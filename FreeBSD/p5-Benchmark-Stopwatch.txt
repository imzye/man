Benchmark::Stopwatch(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Benchmark::Stopwatch - simple timing of stages of your code.

SYNOPSIS
           use Benchmark::Stopwatch;
           my $stopwatch = Benchmark::Stopwatch->new->start;

           # ... code that reads from database ...
           $stopwatch->lap('read from database');

           # ... code that writes to disk ...
           $stopwatch->lap('write to disk');

           print $stopwatch->stop->summary;

           # NAME                        TIME        CUMULATIVE      PERCENTAGE
           #  read from database          0.123       0.123           34.462%
           #  write to disk               0.234       0.357           65.530%
           #  _stop_                      0.000       0.357           0.008%

DESCRIPTION
       The other benchmark modules provide excellent timing for specific parts
       of your code. This module aims to allow you to easily time the
       progression of your code.

       The stopwatch analogy is that at some point you get a "new" stopwatch
       and "start" timing. Then you note certain events using "lap". Finally
       you "stop" the watch and then print out a "summary".

       The summary shows all the events in order, what time they occured at,
       how long since the last lap and the percentage of the total time.
       Hopefully this will give you a good idea of where your code is spending
       most of its time.

       The times are all wallclock times in fractional seconds.

       That's it.

METHODS
   new
           my $stopwatch = Benchmark::Stopwatch->new;

       Creates a new stopwatch.

   start
           $stopwatch = $stopwatch->start;

       Starts the stopwatch. Returns a reference to the stopwatch so that you
       can chain.

   lap
           $stopwatch = $stopwatch->lap( 'name of event' );

       Notes down the time at which an event occurs. This event will later
       appear in the summary.

   stop
           $stopwatch = $stopwatch->stop;

       Stops the stopwatch. Returns a reference to the stopwatch so you can
       chain.

   total_time
           my $time_in_seconds = $stopwatch->total_time;

       Returns the time that the stopwatch ran for in fractional seconds. If
       the stopwatch has not been stopped yet then it returns time it has been
       running for.

   summary
           my $summary_text = $stopwatch->summary;

       Returns text summarizing the events that occured. Example output from a
       script that fetches the homepages of the web's five busiest sites and
       times how long each took.

        NAME                        TIME        CUMULATIVE      PERCENTAGE
         http://www.yahoo.com/       3.892       3.892           22.399%
         http://www.google.com/      3.259       7.152           18.758%
         http://www.msn.com/         8.412       15.564          48.411%
         http://www.myspace.com/     0.532       16.096          3.062%
         http://www.ebay.com/        1.281       17.377          7.370%
         _stop_                      0.000       17.377          0.000%

       The final entry "_stop_" is when the stop watch was stopped.

   as_data
         my $data_structure_hashref = $stopwatch->as_data;

       Returns a data structure that contains all the information that was
       logged.  This is so that you can use this module to gather the data but
       then use your own code to manipulate it.

       The returned hashref will look like this:

         {
           start_time => 1234500,  # The time the stopwatch was started
           stop_time  => 1234510,  # The time it was stopped or as_data called
           total_time => 10,       # The duration of timing
           laps       => [
               {
                   name       => 'test', # The name of the lap
                   time       => 1,      # The time of this lap (seconds)
                   cumulative => 1,      # seconds since start to this lap
                   fraction   => 0.10,   # fraction of total time.
               },
               {
                   name       => '_stop_',   # created as needed
                   time       => 9,
                   cumulative => 10,
                   fraction   => 0.9,
               },
           ],
         }
