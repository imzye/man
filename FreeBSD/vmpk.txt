NAME
       vmpk - Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard

SYNOPSIS
       vmpk [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the vmpk program.

       This program uses standard Qt options.

       Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard is a MIDI events generator and receiver. It
       doesn't produce any sound by itself, but can be used to drive a MIDI
       synthesizer (either hardware or software, internal or external). You
       can use the computer's keyboard to play MIDI notes, and also the mouse.
       You can use the Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard to display the played MIDI
       notes from another instrument or MIDI file player.

VMPK OPTIONS
       The following options apply to vmpk only:

       -h|--help
           Displays a help text.

       -v|--version
           Displays version information.

       -p|--portable
           Enables portable settings mode using a default configuration file
           name.

       -f path/file.conf
           This option implies --portable as well. Reads and writes
           path/file.conf as the portable settings configuration file name.

           This configuration file is always a text file with INI format,
           despite the running Operating System conventions.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       The following options apply to all Qt5/6 applications:

       -style= style / -style style
           Set the application GUI style. Possible values depend on the system
           configuration. If Qt is compiled with additional styles or has
           additional styles as plugins these will be available to the -style
           command line option.

       -stylesheet= stylesheet / -stylesheet stylesheet
           Set the application styleSheet. The value must be a path to a file
           that contains the Style Sheet.

       -widgetcount
           Print debug message at the end about number of widgets left
           undestroyed and maximum number of widgets existed at the same time.

       -reverse
           Set the application's layout direction to Qt::RightToLeft. This
           option is intended to aid debugging and should not be used in
           production. The default value is automatically detected from the
           user's locale (see also QLocale::textDirection()).

       -platform platformName[:options]
           Specify the Qt Platform Abstraction (QPA) plugin.

       -platformpluginpath path
           Specify the path to platform plugins.

       -platformtheme platformTheme
           Specify the platform theme.

       -plugin plugin
           Specify additional plugins to load. The argument may appear
           multiple times.

       -qwindowgeometry geometry
           Specify the window geometry for the main window using the
           X11-syntax. For example: -qwindowgeometry 100x100+50+50

       -qwindowicon icon
           Set the default window icon.

       -qwindowtitle title
           Set the title of the first window.

       -session session
           Restore the application from an earlier session.

       -display hostname:screen_number
           Switch displays on X11. Overrides the DISPLAY environment variable.

       -geometry geometry
           Specify the window geometry for the main window on X11. For
           example: -geometry 100x100+50+50

       -dialogs= [xp|none]
           Only available for the Windows platform. XP uses native style
           dialogs and none disables them.

       -fontengine= freetype
           Use the FreeType font engine.
