DESCRIPTION
       The original Panex puzzle is from the Japanese Magic Company from the
       1980's.  Mathematicians at Bell Laboratories estimated the number of
       moves to swap 2 columns of order 10 to be 27,564 <= N <= 31,537.  It
       came in two varieties: one with a blue and a yellow pyramid of order 10
       on silver tiles; in the gold version pieces of each color look alike
       (i.e. no pyramid is drawn on them), this is a little harder.

       The original Tower of Hanoi puzzle is the invention of Edouard Lucas
       and was sold as a toy in France in 1883.  The legend of 64 disks in the
       great temple of Benares of the god Brahma is also his invention.

FEATURES
       Press "mouse-left" button to move a tile the top tile in a column.
       Release "mouse-left" button on another column.  It will not move if
       blocked.

       Double click on "mouse-right" button or press "R" or "r" keys to reset
       the puzzle.

       Press "M" or "m" keys to toggle between hanoi (one pyramid column) and
       panex (two pyramid columns) modes (they each have different rules).  In
       Hanoi, one can not place larger trapezoid on a smaller trapezoid.  Here
       the goal is to move the pile from the left peg to the rightmost peg.
       In Panex, a tile can not go lower that its initial starting point.
       Here the goal is to exchange the 2 piles.

       Press "I" or "i" keys to increase the number of tiles.

       Press "D" or "d" keys to decrease the number of tiles.

       Press "S" or "s" keys to auto-solve.  Unfortunately, its only
       implemented from the starting position.

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo last move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Unlike other puzzles in the collection there is no way to move pieces
       without drag and drop.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              x{hanoi | panex}: <Number of rows> @ (<Number of moves>/{<Record
              number of moves> <username>|"NEVER noaccess"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the panex window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -[no]mono
               This option allows you to  display on a color screen as if
               monochrome (resource name "mono").

       -[no]{reverse|rv}
               This option allows you to see the panex window in reverse video
               (resource name "reverse").

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the panex window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the panex window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the tiles in the
               panex window (resource name "borderColor").

       -tile color
               This option specifies the tile color of the tiles in the panex
               window (resource name "tileColor").

       -pyramid0 color
               This option specifies the foreground of the first pyramid
               (resource name "pyramidColor0").

       -pyramid1 color
               This option specifies the foreground of the second pyramid, if
               it exists (resource name "pyramidColor1").

       -tiles int
               This option specifies the number of tiles in a column (resource
               name "tiles").

       -mode int
               This option specifies the hanoi (0) or panex (1) mode (resource
               name "mode").

       -hanoi  This option specifies the hanoi mode (resource name "mode").

       -panex  This option specifies the panex mode (resource name "mode").

       -delay msecs
               This option specifies the number of milliseconds it takes to
               move a tile or a group of tiles one space (resource name
               "delay").

       -username string
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or
               else it will get your login name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason for this is that this is simple
       and I do not know what the standard is.

              mode: 0-1 <0 hanoi, 1 panex>
              tiles: 1-10 <number of tiles in a column>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <array pairs of column and position of each
              tile>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <from_column> <to_column>
       from_column is the top tile of the column
       to_column is where that tile is moved to.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.
