NAME
       xcowsay - Display a cute cow and speech bubble.

SYNOPSIS
       xcowsay [-h] [-t time] [-r speed] [-d] [-f font] [text]...

DESCRIPTION
       Display a cow with a speech bubble containing some text.  If text is
       specified it will be displayed in the bubble.  Otherwise the text will
       be read from the standard input and displayed when end of file is
       encountered.

       The cow is displayed for either a fixed amount of time, or an amount of
       time calculated from the size of the text.  Click on the cow to dismiss
       it immediately.

       If xcowsay is started with --daemon it will fork away from the terminal
       and run in daemon mode.  The daemon provides a DBus service
       uk.me.doof.Cowsay that responds to ShowCow requests.  The daemon can
       queue up any number of requests and displays them in order.

       When xcowsay starts it checks to see if a daemon is running, and if it
       is, sends a ShowCow request and returns immediately.  Otherwise xcowsay
       will block until the cow has disappeared.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       xcowsay reads a configuration file on startup.  The configuration file
       can be stored in the XDG compliant location $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xcowsayrc
       (which will default to $HOME/.config/xcowsayrc) or in your home
       directory at $HOME/.xcowsayrc.  If the --config=FILE command line
       option is passed FILE will be processed after your personal
       configuration file.

       The configuration file consists of 'option = value' pairs, one per
       line.  The valid keys are given in the next section.  For example, the
       following line sets display time to 10 seconds:

              display_time = 10000

       The character '#' begins a comment which lasts until the end of the
       line.

       Values containing spaces should be enclosed in quotes.  For example:

              font = "mono 28"

OPTIONS
       Note that these options override any settings in the config file.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information.

       -t time, --time=time
              Display the cow for time seconds.  This overrides any value set
              for reading_speed.  Setting time to zero displays the cow until
              it is clicked.  The corresponding config file option is
              display_time.  This can also be set to a fractional value like
              0.5.

       -r speed, --reading-speed=speed
              Number of milliseconds to display the cow for each word in the
              input text.  This is clamped to a minimum of min_display_time
              and a maximum of max_display_time.  The defaults are 1 second
              and 30 seconds respectively.  The corresponding config file
              option is reading_speed.

       -f font, --font=font
              Font for the speech bubble text.  Accepts Pango font strings.
              The corresponding config file option is font.

       -d file, --dream=file
              Display an image instead of text in the cow's bubble.  The
              dream_time config file option sets the numer of milliseconds to
              display the image for.  The default is 10 seconds.

       --think
              Display a thought bubble instead of a speech bubble.

       --daemon
              Run xcowsay in daemon mode if DBus support has been enabled.
              See the DESCRIPTION section above for more information.

       --cow-size=size
              Size of the cow image.  Current choices are small, med, or
              large.  The corresponding config file option is cow_size.

       --image=file
              Use a different image instead of the cow.  The corresponding
              config file option is alt_image.

       --monitor=N
              Make the cow appear on monitor N.

       --at=X,Y
              Force that cow to appear at screen location (X,Y).  The config
              file options are at_x and at_y.

       --bubble-at=X,Y
              Change position of bubble relative to where it would normally
              appear.  This is most useful when combined with the alt_image
              option to create your own characters.  The config file options
              are bubble_x and bubble_y.

       --no-wrap
              Disable word wrapping when the bubble is too wide to fit on the
              screen.  The config file option wrap can be set to true or false
              to set this explicitly.

       -l, --left
              Make the bubble appear on the left hand side of the cow.  This
              is useful if you are using your own image.

       --debug
              Print messages about what xcowsay is doing.  Useful for finding
              out why the daemon fails.

       --release
              Close window on release event instead of press.  The
              corresponding config file option is
              close_event=button-release-event.

       -v, --version
              Print version information.
