NAME
       rlvm - RealLive interpreter clone

SYNOPSIS
       rlvm [OPTION]... <path to directory containing a Gameexe.ini file>

DESCRIPTION
       rlvm is a Free Software reimplementation of the VisualArt's KK's
       RealLive interpreter. It is meant to provide Linux and Apple users with
       a compatible, portable interpreter to play VisualArts games,
       specifically those released by Key.

       --font Specifies the path to a TrueType font to use instead of trying
              to autodetect the font

SUPPORTED GAMES
       Currently, rlvm can run the following games:

       • Kanon

       • Kanon (With NDT's English patch)

       • AIR

       • CLANNAD / CLANNAD Full Voice Edition

       • Planetarian

       • Planetarian (US Edition)

       • Tomoyo After

       • Little Busters

       • Kud Wafter

       In addition, there is partial support for:

       • Princess Bride

       • Princess Brave

       • ALMA ~zutto soba ni~

       • SNOW

       • Some of the game demos from the Kinetic Novel website.

FILES
       ~/.rlvm/
              All rlvm save files are kept in this directory.

BUGS?
       While rlvm is generally stable, emulation of the RealLive virtual
       machine is incomplete.

NOT A BUG
       English patches that were not compiled with rlBabel will not line break
       correctly. You can check if your patch is compiled with rlBabel and the
       text encoding is set to "Western" by hitting [F1] at any time.

AUTHOR
       rlvm was written by Elliot Glaysher, with the help of Haeleth. Special
       thanks to Jagarl for licensing all his RealLive file reading code under
       liberal licenses, and for doing the first reverse engineering of the
       RealLive system. Windows port and bug fixes made possible by Rasqual
       Twilight.
