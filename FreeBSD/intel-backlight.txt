INTEL_BACKLIGHT(1)      FreeBSD General Commands Manual     INTEL_BACKLIGHT(1)

NAME
     intel_backlight – control backlight on various modern Intel GPUs

SYNOPSIS
     intel_backlight [decr | incr | n]

DESCRIPTION
     This utility allows to control the brightness of the backlight on certain
     Intel GPUs, including i915.

     The current backlight value is reported every time the program is run.
     Additionally, if the argument are invalid then a help message is shown.

     The backlight brightness levels that decr and incr operate on are as
     follows: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 36, 43, 51, 60, 70, 80, 90,
     100.

     The options are as follows:

     decr  Decrease the backlight value to the nearest brightness level.

     incr  Increase the backlight value to the nearest brightness level.

     n     Change the backlight value to n where n should be between 0 and
           100. Providing any other integer results in setting the backlight
           back to the default value of 100.

FILES

       An example of a script adjusting brightness automatically based on the
       input of the MacBook asmc(4) light sensor driver.

     /usr/local/share/examples/intel-backlight/isl_backlight.sh
       An example of a script adjusting brightness automatically based on the
       input of the isl(4) driver, which is currently not part of standard
       FreeBSD.

     The intel_backlight utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.
