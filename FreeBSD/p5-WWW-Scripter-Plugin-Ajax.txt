NAME
       WWW::Scripter::Plugin::Ajax - WWW::Scripter plugin that provides the
       XMLHttpRequest object

VERSION
       Version 0.09 (alpha)

SYNOPSIS
         use WWW::Scripter;
         $w = new WWW::Scripter;

         $m->use_plugin('Ajax');
         $m->get('http://some.site.com/that/relies/on/ajax');

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a plugin for WWW::Scripter that loads the JavaScript
       plugin (WWW::Scripter::Plugin::JavaScript) and provides it with the
       "XMLHttpRequest" object.

       To load the plugin, use WWW::Scripter's "use_plugin" method, as shown
       in the Synopsis. Any extra arguments to "use_plugin" will be passed on
       to the JavaScript plugin (at least for now).

ASYNCHRONY
       The "XMLHttpRequest" object currently does not support asynchronous
       connections. Later this will probably become an option, at least for
       threaded perls.

NON-HTTP ADDRESSES
       Since it uses LWP, URI schemes other than http (e.g., file, ftp) are
       supported.

INTERFACE
       The XMLHttpRequest interface members supported so far are:

         Methods:
         open
         send
         abort
         getAllResponseHeaders
         getResponseHeader
         setRequestHeader

         Attributes:
         onreadystatechange
         readyState
         responseText
         responseXML
         status
         statusText

         Event-Related Methods:
         addEventListener
         removeEventListener
         dispatchEvent

         Constants (static properties):
         UNSENT
         OPENED
         HEADERS_RECEIVED
         LOADING
         DONE

       "responseBody", "overrideMimeType", "getRequestHeader",
       "removeRequestHeader" and more event attributes are likely to be added
       in future versions.

PREREQUISITES
       This plugin requires perl 5.8.5 or higher, and the following modules:

       •   WWW::Scripter::Plugin::JavaScript version 0.002 or later

       •   constant::lexical

       •   XML::DOM::Lite

       •   HTML::DOM version 0.013 or later

       •   Encode 2.09 or higher

       •   WWW::Scripter

       •   LWP 5.833 or higher

       •   URI

BUGS
       If you find any bugs, please report them to the author by e-mail
       (preferably with a patch :-).

       XML::DOM::Lite is quite lenient toward badly-formed XML, so the
       "responseXML" property returns something useful even in cases when it
       should be null.

       The SECURITY_ERR, NETWORK_ERR and ABORT_ERR constants are not available
       yet, as I don't know where to put them.

       It does not conform to the spec in every detail, since the spec is
       still being written and is different every time I check it.

       None of the additional features in the Level 2 spec are implemented.

       There is currently no API to signal that the user has cancelled a
       connection. You can call the "abort" method, but that does not have
       exactly the same result that a user-initiated cancellation is meant to
       have.

       Furthermore, this module follows the badly-designed API that is
       unfortunately the standard so I can't do anything about it.
