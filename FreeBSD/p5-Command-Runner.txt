NAME
       Command::Runner - run external commands and Perl code refs

SYNOPSIS
         use Command::Runner;

         my $cmd = Command::Runner->new(
           command => ['ls', '-al'],
           timeout => 10,
           stdout  => sub { warn "out: $_[0]\n" },
           stderr  => sub { warn "err: $_[0]\n" },
         );
         my $res = $cmd->run;

DESCRIPTION
       Command::Runner runs external commands and Perl code refs

METHODS
   new
       A constructor, which takes:

       command
           an array of external commands, a string of external programs, or a
           Perl code ref.  If an array of external commands is specified, it
           is automatically quoted on Windows.

       timeout
           timeout second. You can set float second.

       redirect
           if this is true, stderr redirects to stdout

       keep
           by default, even if stdout/stderr is consumed, it is preserved for
           return value.  You can disable this behavior by setting keep option
           false.

       stdout / stderr
           a code ref that will be called whenever stdout/stderr is available

       env set environment variables.

             Command::Runner->new(..., env => \%env)->run

           is roughly equivalent to

             {
               local %ENV = %env;
               Command::Runner->new(...)->run;
             }

       cwd set the current directory.

             Command::Runner->new(..., cwd => $dir)->run

           is roughly equivalent to

             {
               require File::pushd;
               my $guard = File::pushd::pushd($dir);
               Command::Runner->new(...)->run;
             }

   run
       Run command. It returns a hash reference, which contains:

       result
       timeout
       stdout
       stderr
       pid

MOTIVATION
       I develop a CPAN client App::cpm, where I need to execute external
       commands and Perl code refs with:

       timeout
       quoting
       flexible logging

       While App::cpanminus has excellent APIs for such use, I still needed to
       tweak them in App::cpm.

       So I ended up creating a seperate module, Command::Runner.
