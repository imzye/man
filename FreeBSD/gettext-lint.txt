PO FILE HEADER DIRECTIVES

       X-POFile-Allow: number
              number of errors to ignore; if number of detected errors is
              diffent than this they will all be reported; a file with 0
              errors but an error allowance greater than zero will also be
              reported

       X-POFile-CheckAccelerator: 1|0
              enable or disable checking accelerators, enabled by default

       X-POFile-CheckEndPontuation: 1|0
              enable or disable checking ending pontuation, enabled by default

       X-POFile-LineLength: number
              check that the line length doesn't exceed number chars; disable
              by default
