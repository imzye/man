NAME
       Authen::Ticket - Perl extension for implementing ticket authentication

SYNOPSIS
         PerlHandler Authen::Ticket

       or

         PerlAccessHandler Authen::Ticket
         ErrorDocument     403  http://ticket.tamu.edu/TicketMaster/

DESCRIPTION
       Authen::Ticket provides the mod_perl framework for using the
       Authen::Ticket::Server and Authen::Ticket::Client classes as Apache
       handlers.

       To create custom handlers, derive a class (My::Authen) from
       Authen::Ticket:

         package My::Authen;
         use vars (qw/@ISA/);
         @ISA = (qw/Authen::Ticket/);

       In addition to My::Authen, the server and client classes are also
       required:

         package My::Authen::Server;
         use vars (qw/@ISA/);
         @ISA = (qw/Authen::Ticket::Server/);

         sub authenticate {
           my($self, $u) = @_;
           my $t = { };

           # do stuff
           return $t;   # hash ref to ticket contents
         }

         package My::Authen::Client;
         use vars (qw/@ISA/);
         @ISA = (qw/Authen::Ticket::Client/);

       See the documentation for each of Authen::Ticket::Server and
       Authen::Ticket::Client for a list of methods that may be implemented.
