IWM(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 IWM(4)

NAME
     iwm – Intel IEEE 802.11ac wireless network driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, include the following lines in
     your kernel configuration file:

           device iwm
           device pci
           device wlan
           device firmware

     You also need to select a firmware for your device.  Choose one from:

           device iwm3160fw
           device iwm3168fw
           device iwm7260fw
           device iwm7265fw
           device iwm8000Cfw
           device iwm8265fw
           device iwm9000fw
           device iwm9260fw

     Or you can use

           device iwmfw

     to include them all.

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           if_iwm_load="YES"
           iwm3160fw_load="YES"
           iwm3168fw_load="YES"
           iwm7260fw_load="YES"
           iwm7265fw_load="YES"
           iwm8000Cfw_load="YES"
           iwm8265fw_load="YES"
           iwm9000fw_load="YES"
           iwm9260fw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The iwm driver provides support for:

           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 3160
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 3165
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 3168
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 7260
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 7265
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 8260
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 8265
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 9260
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 9270
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 946X
           Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 9560

     iwm supports station mode operation.  Only one virtual interface may be
     configured at any time.  For more information on configuring this device,
     see ifconfig(8).

     This driver requires the firmware built with the iwmfw module to work.

     Currently, iwm only supports 802.11b and 802.11g modes.  It will not
     associate to access points that are configured to operate only in 802.11n
     or 802.11ac modes.

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwm0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwm0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwm0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

     Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwm0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \
               wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1

DIAGNOSTICS
     iwm%d: device timeout  The driver will reset the hardware.  This should
     not happen.

     iwm%d: firmware error  The onboard microcontroller crashed for some
     reason.  The driver will reset the hardware.  This should not happen.

     iwm%d: timeout waiting for firmware initialization to complete  The
     onboard microcontroller failed to initialize in time.  This should not
     happen.

     iwm%d: could not load firmware image '%s'  The driver failed to load the
     firmware image using the firmware(9) subsystem.  Verify the iwmfw(4)
     firmware module is present.

     iwm%d: could not load boot firmware  An attempt to upload the boot
     firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed.  This should not
     happen.

     iwm%d: could not load microcode  An attempt to upload the microcode image
     to the onboard microcontroller failed.  This should not happen.

     iwm%d: could not load main firmware  An attempt to upload the main
     firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed.  This should not
     happen.
