CCR(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 CCR(4)

NAME
     ccr – Chelsio T6 crypto accelerator driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ccr
           device cxgbe

     To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
     loader.conf(5):

           ccr_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ccr driver provides support for the crypto accelerator engine
     included on PCI Express Ethernet adapters based on the Chelsio Terminator
     6 ASIC (T6).  The driver accelerates AES-CBC, AES-CCM, AES-CTR, AES-GCM,
     AES-XTS, SHA1, SHA2-224, SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, SHA1-HMAC,
     SHA2-224-HMAC, SHA2-256-HMAC, SHA2-384-HMAC, and SHA2-512-HMAC operations
     for crypto(4) and ipsec(4).  The driver also supports chaining one of
     AES-CBC, AES-CTR, or AES-XTS with SHA1-HMAC, SHA2-224-HMAC,
     SHA2-256-HMAC, SHA2-384-HMAC, or SHA2-512-HMAC for encrypt-then-
     authenticate operations.  For further hardware information and questions
     related to hardware requirements, see http://www.chelsio.com/.

     The ccr driver attaches as a child of an existing Chelsio NIC device and
     thus requires that the cxgbe(4) driver be active.

HARDWARE
     The ccr driver supports the crypto accelerator engine included on
     adapters based on the T6 ASIC:

     •   Chelsio T6225-CR
     •   Chelsio T6225-SO-CR
     •   Chelsio T62100-LP-CR
     •   Chelsio T62100-SO-CR
     •   Chelsio T62100-CR

SUPPORT
     For general information and support, go to the Chelsio support website
     at: http://www.chelsio.com/.

     If an issue is identified with this driver with a supported adapter,
     email all the specific information related to the issue to
     <support@chelsio.com>.
