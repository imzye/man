NAME
       rtconfig - Tool for producing configs from IRR routing policies

SYNOPSIS
       rtconfig [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       rtconfig analyzes the routing policies registered in the Internet
       Routing Registry (IRR) and produces router configuration files.  It
       currently supports cisco and junos router configuration file formats.
       rtconfig reads lines form the standard input, and prints them to the
       standard output, except for the lines that start with "@rtconfig" which
       instruct rtconfig to perform special operation (please see "rtconfig
       Commands" Section below).  rtconfig establishes a whois connection to
       query IRR.

IRRToolSet COMMON OPTIONS

              -help  Print summary of command-line options and abort.

              -T [whois_query | whois_response | input | all]
                     Trace the argument. Useful for debugging.

              -D <integer>
                     Print debugging messages of debug channel <integer> (if
                     compiled with ENABLE_DEBUG defined).

              -version
                     Print the version number and quit.

              -h <host-name>
                     Establish a whois connection to host <host-name>.  The
                     default is whois.radb.net.

              -p <port-no>
                     Establish an whois connection to port <port-no>.  The
                     default is 43.

              -protocol <protocol>
                     Use the <protocol> to connect to the IRR server.
                     <protocol> can be irrd(rawhoisd) or ripe(bird). The
                     default is irrd.

              -s <source-list>
                     Consider the sources specified in the comma separated
                     <source-list>.  If an object is defined in multiple
                     sources in <source-list>, rtconfig uses the definition
                     first encountered in <source-list> from left to right.

              -f <file-name>
                     IRR cache file. You can have any RPSL object in this
                     file, except route objects.  They will override these
                     objects in IRR.  This option is intended for private
                     objects, or to test new public objects before publishing.
                     You can specify more than one cache file by specifying
                     this option repeatedly.

              -rusage
                     Print resource usage upon completion.

              -prompt <new-prompt>
                     Change the prompt to <new-prompt> when invoked
                     interactively. By default the prompt is "rtconfig> ".

              -ignore_errors
                     Do not print error and warning messages due to
                     communication to the database server or parsing policy
                     objects.

              -report_errors
                     Print error and warning messages due to communication to
                     the database server or parsing policy objects.

OTHER OPTIONS

              -config <config-format>
                     Produce router configuration in <config-format> which is
                     either cisco (default) or junos.

              -no_match_ip_inbound
                     In older Cisco IOS versions, in-bound route maps did not
                     support ip access-list matches.  Use of this option
                     causes rtconfig to use distribute-lists to overcome this
                     limitation.

              -asdot Print AS numbers as asdot, i.e. in "X.Y" format; the
                     default is to use RFC-5396 recommended "asplain" format.

              -disable_access_list_cache
                     rtconfig caches the access-lists (and in the future ip
                     as-path access-lists and route-maps) that it generates so
                     that the same access-list number can be reused instead of
                     generating a new access list.  If you do not want
                     rtconfig to consume much memory,
                     -disable_access_list_cache option can be used to turn off
                     this feature.  However, if you are short on memory on
                     your cisco box, you should leave this feature enabled.

              -supress_martian
                     Deprecated.  Properly maintained martian and bogon lists
                     are visible in both the RIPE and Merit whois servers
                     (e.g. "fltr-bogons", "fltr-unallocated" and "fltr-
                     martian" objects), and can be referenced using standard
                     RPSL.

              -cisco_no_compress_acls
                     This option only affects cisco configurations.  This
                     option is used to disable combining multiple cisco access
                     list lines into a single line using wildcards whenever
                     possible.

              -cisco_use_prefix_lists
                     This option only affects cisco configurations.  This
                     option instructs rtconfig to output prefix-lists which
                     yield higher performace than access-lists. This flag
                     implies -cisco_compress_acls.

              -cisco_eliminate_dup_map_parts
                     This option only affects cisco configurations.  This
                     option instructs rtconfig to eliminate a later map part
                     if its filter is covered by earlier map parts.

              -cisco_skip_route_maps
                     This option only affects cisco configurations.  This
                     option instructs rtconfig not to print route maps, hence
                     it only prints access lists.

              -cisco_force_tilda
                     This option only affects cisco configurations. It forces
                     * and + operators in AS path regular expressions to be
                     interpreted as ~* and ~+ operators.  This is useful if
                     you get as path access lists with real long lines, it
                     will force them to multiple lines.

              -cisco_empty_lists
                     This option only affects Cisco configurations. It forces
                     interpreting ANY/NOT ANY prefix filters as
                     universal/empty set of prefixes, and produces access
                     lists for them. By default only warning is issued.

              -cisco_no_default_afi
                     Causes rtconfig not to assume that ipv4.unicast is the
                     router's default address family. IPv4 peers will then
                     have ipv4.unicast explicitly activated and policy will be
                     set in ipv4.unicast address family. Useful when the
                     router is configured with "no bgp default ipv4-unicast".

              -junos_and_not_or
                     This option only affects Juniper configurations.  Modify
                     rtconfig Junos behaviour to match Cisco - AND community &
                     prefix lists rather than OR'ing them.

              -junos_replace
                     This option only affects Juniper configurations.  Output
                     replace: statements to be used with "load replace" on
                     Junos.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

              IRR_HOST
                     Specifies the IRR host to connect.

              IRR_PORT
                     Specifies the IRR port number to connect.

              IRR_SOURCES
                     Specifies the source list (comma separated) to consider.

       Command line options take precedence over environment variables.

rtconfig COMMANDS
       rtconfig copies standard input to standard output except when it
       encounters rtconfig commands on the standard input.  All rtconfig
       commands start with "@rtconfig" at the beginning of a line.  Currently
       the following commands are implemented:

              @rtconfig import <ASN-1> <rtr-1> <ASN-2> <rtr-2>
                     <ASN-1> and <ASN-2> are AS numbers preceded with string
                     "AS". For example, AS number 1 is specified as "AS1".
                     <rtr-1> and <rtr-2> are ip addresses in prefix notation.
                     For example, the router with address 128.9.128.9 is
                     specified as "128.9.128.9".  This command instructs
                     rtconfig to generate import filters where <rtr-1> in
                     <ASN-1> is importing routes from <rtr-2> in <ASN-2>.  The
                     appropriate filters are generated by considering the
                     import/mp-import lines for <ASN-2>-<rtr-1>-<rtr-2> in the
                     aut-num object for <ASN-1>.

              @rtconfig export <ASN-1> <rtr-1> <ASN-2> <rtr-2>
                     The arguments of the export command are the same as the
                     import command.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     generate export filters where <rtr-1> in <ASN-1> is
                     exporting routes to <rtr-2> in <ASN-2>.  The appropriate
                     filters are generated by considering the export/mp-export
                     lines for <ASN-2>-<rtr-1>-<rtr-2> in the aut-num object
                     for <ASN-1>.

              @rtconfig configureRouter <inet-rtr-name>
                     <inet-rtr-name> is the DNS name of an inet-rtr object.
                     This command will use the named inet-rtr object, and
                     configure import/mp-import and export/mp-export policies
                     for each of the BGP4 peers of the router (using the peer
                     attribute).

              @rtconfig importPeerGroup <ASN-1> <rtr-1> <ASN-2> <rtr-2>
              <peering-set-name>
                     Required when using JunOS to place the import policies
                     inside the correct peer group.

              @rtconfig importGroup <ASN-1> <peering-set-name>

              @rtconfig exportGroup <ASN-1> <peering-set-name>
                     <peering-set-name> is a name of a peering set object.
                     This command instructs rtconfig to generate import/mp-
                     import (export/mp-export) filters where <ASN-1> is
                     importing (exporting) routes from (to) the peers listed
                     in <peering-set-name>.  The aut-num object for <ASN-1>
                     should have an import/mp-import (export/mp-export)
                     attribute using the peering set's name.

              @rtconfig static2bgp <ASN-1> <rtr-1>
                     This command instructs rtconfig to generate inject
                     filters where <rtr-1> in <ASN-1> is injecting static
                     routes into BGP4.  The appropriate filters are generated
                     by considering the import/mp-import policies of <ASN-1>
                     where "protocol STATIC" or "protocol STATIC into BGP4" is
                     used.

              @rtconfig set sources = <source-list>
                     <source-list> is string containing comma separated list
                     of sources to consider.  This command instructs rtconfig
                     to change the list of sources considered.

              @rtconfig access_list filter <filter>
                     <filter> is an RPSL filter over AS numbers, AS set names
                     and route set names using operators AND, OR and NOT.
                     This command instructs rtconfig to generate an access
                     list for <filter>.  <mp-filter> is also accepted.

              @rtconfig aspath_access_list filter <filter>
                     <filter> is an RPSL filter over AS path regular
                     expressions using operators AND, OR and NOT.  This
                     command instructs rtconfig to generate an as path access
                     list for <filter>.

              @rtconfig printPrefixes <format> filter <filter>
                     <format> is a quoted string, and <filter> is an RPSL
                     filter over AS numbers, AS set names and route set names
                     using operators AND, OR and NOT, <mp-filter> is also
                     accepted.  This command instructs rtconfig to print the
                     prefixes in <filter> using <format>.  The <format> can
                     contain the following escape sequences:
                           %p  prefix
                           %l  length
                           %L  32-length
                           %n  n   (%p/%l^%n-%m, e.g. 128.9.0.0/16^24-32)
                           %m  m
                           %k  mask
                           %K  inverse of mask (i.e. ~mask)
                           %%  %
                           \n  carriage return
                           \t  tab
                     Example, use:
                        @rtconfig printPrefixes "net %p \tmask %k\n" filter AS1

              @rtconfig printPrefixRanges <format> filter <filter>
                     This command is same as the "printPrefixes" command,
                     except the consecutive address prefixes are compressed
                     into a single address prefix range. <mp-filter> is also
                     accepted.

              @rtconfig printSuperPrefixRanges <format> filter <filter>
                     This command is same as the "printPrefixRanges" command,
                     except it compresses more aggresively. The %n and %m
                     information is lost. But, %D, a set of dont care bits
                     representing different %n-%m ranges are provided. <mp-
                     filter> is also accepted.

              @rtconfig set prefix_acl_no = <no>
                     <no> is an integer.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     start numbering prefix access lists at <no>.  The older
                     term "cisco_prefix_acl_no" is deprecated but kept as an
                     alias.

              @rtconfig set aspath_acl_no = <no>
                     <no> is an integer.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     start numbering aspath access lists at <no>.  The older
                     term "cisco_aspath_acl_no" is deprecated but kept as an
                     alias.

              @rtconfig set pktfilter_acl_no = <no>
                     <no> is an integer.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     start numbering inbound/outbound packet filter access
                     lists at <no>.  The older term "cisco_pktfilter_acl_no"
                     is deprecated but kept as an alias.

              @rtconfig set community_acl_no = <no>
                     <no> is an integer.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     start numbering community access lists at <no>.  The
                     older term "cisco_community_acl_no" is deprecated but
                     kept as an alias.

       Cisco specific commands:

              @rtconfig set cisco_map_name = <map-name>
                     <map-name> is a quoted string.  This command instructs
                     rtconfig to use <map-name> as the name for the route maps
                     generated.  If the <map-name> contains %d, it will be
                     replaced by the peer's AS number.  If it contains a
                     second %d, it will be replaced by an integer that is
                     incremented each time a new map is generated (to ensure
                     unique map names).  The default cisco_map_name is
                     "MyMap_%d_%d".

              @rtconfig set cisco_map_first_no = <no>
                     <no> is an integer.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     use <no> as the first number of a newly generated route
                     map.  If missing, 1 is used.

              @rtconfig set cisco_map_increment_by = <no>
                     <no> is an integer.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     increment route map numbers by <no>.  If missing,
                     successive route maps are numbered by increments of 1.

              @rtconfig set community_set_no = <no>
                     <no> is an integer.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     start numbering community sets at <no>.

              @rtconfig set cisco_access_list_no = <no>
                     <no> is an integer.  This command instructs rtconfig to
                     start numbering all access lists at <no>.

              @rtconfig set cisco_max_preference = <no>
                     <no> is an integer defaulting to 1000.  This command
                     instructs rtconfig to start using preferences from <no>
                     (most preferred) and counting down from there.

              @rtconfig networks <ASN-1>
                     <ASN-1> is an AS number preceded with string "AS".  For
                     each route registered with origin <ASN-1>, a network
                     statement of the form "network <prefix> mask <mask>" is
                     generated.

              @rtconfig v6networks <ASN-1>
                     <ASN-1> is an AS number preceded with string "AS".  For
                     each route6 registered with origin <ASN-1>, a network
                     statement of the form "network <prefix> mask <mask>" is
                     generated.

              @rtconfig default <ASN-1> <ASN-2>
                     <ASN-1> and <ASN-2> are AS numbers preceded with string
                     "AS".  This command instructs rtconfig to generate "ip
                     default-network" statements where <ASN-1> is defaulting
                     to <ASN-2>.  The appropriate statements are generated for
                     the network addresses listed in the default attribute for
                     <ASN-2> in the aut-num object of <ASN-1>.

              @rtconfig inbound_pkt_filter <if-name> <ASN-1> <rtr-1> <ASN-2>
              <rtr-2>
                     The arguments of the inbound_pkt_filter command are the
                     same as the import command.  This command instructs
                     rtconfig to generate packet filters where <rtr-1> in
                     <ASN-1> is going to drop data packets that are received
                     from <rtr-2> in <ASN-2>, but do not have source addresses
                     inside the address prefixes imported from this peer.  The
                     appropriate filters are generated by considering the
                     import lines for <ASN-2>-<rtr-1>-<rtr-2> in the aut-num
                     object for <ASN-1>.  The filter is applied to the
                     interface <if-name> in the inbound direction.  The <if-
                     name> is a string and must be enclosed in double quotes.

              @rtconfig pkt_filter <if-name> <ASN-1> <rtr-1> <ASN-2> <rtr-2>
                     An alias for inbound_pkt_filter.  Now deprecated.

              @rtconfig outbound_pkt_filter <if-name> <ASN-1> <rtr-1> <ASN-2>
              <rtr-2>
                     Same as the pkt_filter command, except the appropriate
                     filters are generated by considering the export lines for
                     <ASN-2>-<rtr-1>-<rtr-2> in the aut-num object for
                     <ASN-1>.  The filter is applied to the interface <if-
                     name> in the outbound direction.

       Junos specific commands:

              @rtconfig set junos_policy_name = <policy-name>
                     <policy-name> is a quoted string.  This command instructs
                     rtconfig to use <policy-name> as the name for the policy
                     statements generated.  If the <policy-name> contains %d,
                     it will be replaced by the peer's AS number.  If it
                     contains a second %d, it will be replaced by an integer
                     that is incremented each time a new map is generated (to
                     ensure unique map names).  The default junos_map_name is
                     "policy_%d_%d".

              @rtconfig networks <ASN-1>
                     <ASN-1> is an AS number preceded with string "AS".  For
                     each route registered with origin <ASN-1>, a network
                     statement of the form "network <prefix> mask <mask>" is
                     generated. This needs to be Juniperized.

            !
            end

LIMITATIONS
       Cisco Configuration Generation:

              Policies in IRR which has as-path regular expressions containing
              [,] are only converted if (1) it is not a negated set, (2) it
              does not contain ranges with more than 10 numbers in the range.
              The following examples are not converted:
                   [^ AS1]
                   [AS1-AS11]
              The first one is not converted because it is a negated set. The
              second one is not converted because AS1-AS11 contains 11
              numbers.  The following examples are converted:
                   [AS1 AS56 AS100]
                   [AS1-AS10]
                   [AS5 AS100-AS105 AS200 AS300-AS307]
              Note that the last example contains 16 numbers which is more
              than 10. This is converted since no single range (AS100-AS105 or
              AS300-AS307) contains more than 10 numbers.
