       charset to another.

               use Convert::Cyrillic;

               $src = 'koi8';
               $dst = 'win';
               $SrcBuf = 'text in koi8 here';
               $DstBuf = Convert::Cyrillic::cstocs ($Src, $Dst, $SrcBuf);

       This package implements routine for converting from one cyrillic
       charset to another. It is intended to be used from cgi's which need
       built-in support for translations. For example, you may wish to use it
       in form processor to translate from user encoding to one used by your
       site.

               KOI8 - for KOI8-R
               WIN - for WIN-1251
               DOS - for DOS, alternative, CP-866
               MAC - for Macintosh
               ISO - for ISO-8859-5
               UTF-8 - for UTF-8 (Unicode)
               VOL - for Volapuk (transliteration)
