NAME
       simbadc - Access the SIMBAD 4 astronomical database.

SYNOPSIS
        $ simbadc
        simbadc> # Queries should default to returning text data.
        simbadc> set type txt
        simbadc> # Get the standard data on Arcturus, capturing
        simbadc> # the output in arcturus.data
        simbadc> queryObjectById Arcturus >arcturus.data
        simbadc> # Queries should default to returning VO data.
        simbadc> set type vo
        simbadc> # Do a url query, capturing its results.
        simbadc> url_query id Ident 3c273 >3c273.data
        simbadc> # Execute a script file, capturing its results.
        simbadc> script_file m31.simbad4 >m31.data
        simbadc> # We are done.
        simbadc> exit

       The intent here is to be able to collect data from the SIMBAD database
       on an ad-hoc basis. Most commands map directly to Astro::SIMBAD::Client
       methods.

DETAILS
       This script uses Term::ReadLine for user interaction, though it can
       also be used as a traditional Unix filter. Command parsing is fairly
       simple. Text::ParseWords is used to split the line into tokens, with
       the first token being the command/method name.

       If a token begins with '>' or '>>', the rest of the token represents
       the name of a file to which the output of that command is redirected.
       The '>' overwrites an existing file, while '>>' appends to it. There
       can be no space between the '>' or '>>' and the file name.

       A token beginning with '<<' introduces a 'here document', which appears
       on subsequent lines of input. The rest of the token represents the text
       which marks the end of the 'here document'. If the script is being run
       interactively, the end text will also be used as the prompt. For
       example:

        simbadc> set format <<eod
        eod>txt=---\n
        eod>name: %idlist(NAME|1)\n
        eod>ra: %coord(d;A)\n
        eod>dec: %coord(d;D)\n
        eod>eod
        simbadc>

       specifies a format to be used for a 'txt' mode query. Note that

        simbadc> set format txt=<<eod

       is not equivalent; the '<<eod' must be a token all by itself.

       If a token begins with '<', the rest of the token is taken as a file
       name, and the contents of the file are substituted for the token. Note
       that this does not give a mechanism for feeding commands from a file,
       since the contents of the input file are not parsed. It does, however,
       give a less painful way to test tweaks of complex formats.

       The following commands are implemented by this script, in addition to
       (or in lieu of) the commands documented in Astro::SIMBAD::Client:

       default (attribute_name ...)
           This command resets the values of the named attributes to their
           static values.

       exit
           This command terminates the script. It is simply a wrapper for
           CORE::exit. End-of-file also works.

       help
           This command displays the documentation for this script. If you use

            simbadc> help client

           You get Astro::SIMBAD::Client.

       show (attribute ...)
           This command is a slightly more command-friendly wrapper for the
           get() method. If given no arguments, all are displayed. The output
           is formatted as 'set' commands.

       static
           This is not really a command, but when prefixed to a method name
           causes that method to be called as a static method. For example,

            simbadc> static set type vo

           Causes the default query type to be 'vo'.

       Any command not named above is assumed to be an Astro::SIMBAD::Client
       method, and called. Whatever the method returns is displayed, unless
       the return is an Astro::SIMBAD::Client object.

       See Astro::SIMBAD::Client for the details.
