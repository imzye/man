NAME
       fapg - Fast Audio Playlist Generator


SYNOPSIS
       fapg [ options ] /path/to/mp3/dir1 [ /path/to/mp3/dir2 ... ]


DESCRIPTION
       fapg is a tool to generate list of audio files (Wav, MP2, MP3, Ogg,
       etc) in various formats (M3U, PLS, XSPF, HTML, RSS, etc).  It is very
       useful if you have a large amount of audio files and you want to
       quickly and frequently build a playlist.

       It is coded in C to be as fast as possible, and does not use any
       specific audio library (like ID3Lib).  This allow you to deploy it
       faster and easier, and to have better performances since the less
       informations are loaded.  On the other hand, this tool is not (yet)
       compatible with all the known formats.


OPTIONS
       -b|--backslash
              Replace the '/' with '\' in Unix path.

       -d|--debug
              Display useful messages if the program fails ;)

       -f|--format=m3u|pls|xspf|html|rss|pla|txx
              Choose which format of playlist you want to generate (default is
              m3u).

       -g|--genre=#:#:...
              Choose which genres (numerical values only) will be included in
              the generated playlist (default is all).

       -n|--nohardlink
              Avoid to parse twice the files because of hardlinks.

       -o|--output=/path/to/file.m3u
              Choose the name of the playlist file to generate (default
              behavior is to display on standard output).

       -p|--prefix=/the/prefix
              Replace the Unix path with another string (useful to give a
              Samba path for example).

       -r|--recursive
              Recursively read the subdirectories.

       -w|--windows
              Replace all Unix characters with Windows characters.

       -x|--exclude=#:#:...
              Choose which genres (numerical values only) will be excluded in
              the generated playlist (default is none).

       -c|--command=<intern|...>
              External binary or script that produces additional fields for
              RSS feeds (slow).

       -s|--stdin
              Read filenames and/or directories from standard input instead of
              command line.


EXAMPLES
       Generate a PLS playlist for an album: fapg --format=pls
       --output=~/path/to/album/list.pls ~/path/to/album

       You have a file server using Samba which shares a large amount of audio
       files for Windows powered computers using Winamp. The directory on the
       server containing the files is /samba/mp3 and is visible on the Windows
       network as \\server\mp3 : cd /samba/mp3 && fapg --backslash
       --output=/samba/mp3/list.m3u --prefix='\\server\mp3\' --recursive
       --windows ./

       An HTML playlist for an album: fapg --output=fapg.html ~/path/to/album

       A playlist that contains all your classical tracks may receive the
       genres to include (or exclude) in one or multiple portions fapg
       --genre=32:105 --genre=106:104:103 /path/to/all/music

       Generate a podcasting XML file using an external program rss.sh to
       generate a detailed description: fapg --output=dir.xml -f rss -c
       /usr/local/bin/rss.sh -r --prefix=http://thisserver/basedir path/to/mp3

       Generate a playlist that will work on a Sansa e200 series MP3 player:
       fapg -f pla -o /path/to/playlist.pla /path/to/all/music

       if command starts with intern the build-in description
       (Author,Title,Link) is generated.  Please note that in all given
       directories ( and in ...basedir/xml ) files called podcast.jpg are
       referenced.  Many header fields are set to defaults using environment
       variables like LOGNAME or LANG.
