SND_ATIIXP(4)          FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual          SND_ATIIXP(4)

NAME
     snd_atiixp – ATI IXP bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_atiixp

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           snd_atiixp_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_atiixp bridge driver allows the generic audio driver, sound(4),
     to attach to ATI IXP audio devices.  This driver supports 16bit playback
     and recording, and 32bit native playback and recording.

   Runtime Configuration
     The following sysctl(8) variables are available in addition to those
     available to all sound(4) devices:

           dev.pcm.%d.polling      Experimental polling mode, where the driver
                                   operates by querying the device state on
                                   each tick using callout(9).  Polling is
                                   disabled by default.  Do not enable it
                                   unless you are facing weird interrupt
                                   problems or if the device cannot generate
                                   interrupts at all.

HARDWARE
     The snd_atiixp driver supports the following audio chipsets:

     •   ATI IXP 200
     •   ATI IXP 300
     •   ATI IXP 400

SEE ALSO
     sound(4)

HISTORY
     The snd_atiixp device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 6.1.

BUGS
     The snd_atiixp driver does not support S/PDIF, but implementing it should
     be fairly easy if the right hardware is available.

     32bit native recording is broken on some hardware.
