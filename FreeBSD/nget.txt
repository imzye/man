NAME
       nget - retrieve files from NNTP (usenet news) hosts

SYNOPSIS
       nget [...]

DESCRIPTION
       nget retrieves messages matching a regular expression, and decodes any
       files contained within.  Multipart messages are automatically pieced
       together.  Parts from multiple servers will be combined if needed.

OPTIONS
       The order options are specified is significant.  In general, an option
       will only affect options that come after it on the command line.

       -q/--quiet
              When specified once, will disable printing of auto-updating text
              to allow the output to be redirected/logged without garbage in
              it.  When specified twice, will disable printing of merely
              informative messages.  Errors will still be printed.

       -h/--host host
              Force only the given host to be used for subsequent commands.
              (Must be configured in .ngetrc.)  Can reset to standard auto-
              choosing method with -h ""

       -a/--available
              Update the list of available newsgroups.  Subsequent -r/-R
              commands can be use to search for newsgroups.

       -A/--quickavailable
              Like -a/--available, but does not update the list, only makes it
              available for searching.

       -X/--xavailable
              Search the group list, but without loading cache file or
              retrieving full group list.  Instead, the search will be done on
              the server.  Compared to -a/-A this has the advantage of not
              requiring any disk space for cache files, and not requiring the
              initial retrieval of the full group list.  The disadvantages are
              not all servers supporting the required NNTP extensions, the
              inability to use complex regexs due to the need to convert it to
              the simpler wildmat format, and the possibility that the
              commands can be quite slow if the server is overloaded (you may
              need to increase the timeout value in some cases).

       -g/--group group(s)
              Update the list of available files in group(s).  Multiple groups
              can be specified by seperating them with commas.  All cached
              groups can be selected with "*".  If a host has been specified
              before with -h, it will retrieve headers only from that host.
              Otherwise it will retrieve headers for all hosts above _glevel
              (see configuration section for more info on priorities.)
              Subsequent -r/-R commands can be used to retrieve files.

       -G/--quickgroup group(s)
              Like --group, but does not retrieve new headers.

       -x/--xgroup group(s)
              Use group(s) for subsequent -r commands, but without loading
              cache file or retrieving full header list.  Instead, the XPAT
              command will used to retrieve only the matching headers.
              Compared to -g/-G this has the advantage of not requiring any
              disk space for cache files, and not requiring the initial
              retrieval of the full header list.  The disadvantages are not
              all servers supporting XPAT, the inability to use complex regexs
              due to the need to convert it to the simpler wildmat format, and
              the possibility that the xpat command can be quite slow if the
              server is overloaded (you may need to increase the timeout value
              in some cases).

       -F/--flushserver host
              Following -g/-G: Flush all headers for server from current
              group(s).
              Following -a/-A: Flush all groups/descriptions for server from
              grouplist.

       -r/--retrieve regex
              Following -g/-G/-x: Matches regex against subjects of previously
              selected group(s), and retrieves ones that match.
              Following -a/-A: Matches regex against newsgroup names and
              descriptions and lists ones that match. (-T required)

       -R/--expretrieve expression
              Like -r, but matches expression instead of merely a regexp.
              (see EXPRETRIEVE EXPRESSIONS section for more info.)  Expression
              is a postfix expression that can contain these keywords:
              Following -g/-G: subject, author, lines, bytes, have, req, date,
              age, update, updateage, messageid(or mid), references.  Note
              that the --limit argument does not affect the option, if you
              want to limit based on number of lines, add it as part of the
              expression.
              Following -a/-A: group, desc.

       -@/--list LISTFILE
              Specify a file to load a list of command line args from.  Looks
              in ~/.nget5/lists/ dir by default.  A # char in a listfile that
              is the first character on a line or is preceeded by whitespace
              and not quoted starts a comment which lasts until the end of the
              line.

       -p/--path DIRECTORY
              Path to store subsequent retrieves.  Also sets -P, and clears
              previously specified dupepaths.  Relative to path which nget was
              started in.  (Except in the case of inside a -@, which will be
              relative to the cwd at the time of the -@.)

       -P/--temppath DIRECTORY
              Store temporary files in path instead of the current dir.

       --dupepath DIRECTORY
              Check for dupe files from specified path in addition to normal
              path.  Can be specified multiple times.

       -m/--makedirs no,yes,ask,<max # of directory levels to create>
              Make dirs specified by -p and -P.  Default is no.  If yes, will
              make dirs automatically.  If #, if the number of directories
              that would need to be created is greater than the number given,
              the answer will be interpreted as no.  If ask, nget will prompt
              the user when trying to change to a dir that does not exist.
              Valid responses to the prompt are y[es], n[o], and a max number
              of directory levels to create.  (This means that if you get in
              the habit of answering "1" rather than "y", and one day typo the
              first portion of a path you won't accidentally create a bunch of
              dirs in the wrong place.)

       -T/--testmode
              Causes --retrieve to merely print out all matching files.

       --text ignore,files,mbox[:filename]
              Specifies how to handle text posts.  The default is files.  OPT
              can be ignore to save only binaries, "files" to save each text
              post in a different file, and "mbox" to save each text post as a
              message in a mbox format mailbox.  The name of the mbox file to
              save in can be specified with mbox:filename, the default is
              nget.mbox.  If the filename ends in .gz, it will automatically
              be gzipped.  Unless the filename has an absolute path, it is
              interpreted as relative to the retrieve path.

       --save-binary-info yes,no
              Specifies whether to save text messages for posts that contained
              only binary data. (If you want to see the headers.)

       --test-multiserver OPT
              Causes testmode to display which servers have parts of each
              file.  OPT may be no to disable(default), long for a verbose
              output, and short for a more condensed form. (In short mode, the
              shortname of each server is printed with no seperating space,
              and it is upper-cased if that server does not have all the
              parts.  If the server has no shortname specified, it defaults to
              the first char of the server alias.)

       --fullxover OPT
              Override the fullxover settings of the config file.  The default
              is -1, which doesn't override.

       -M/--mark
              Mark matched files as retrieved.

       -U/--unmark
              Unmark matched files as retrieved.  (Automatically sets -dI)

       -t/--tries int
              Set maximum number of retries.  -1 will retry indefinatly
              (probably not a good idea).

       -l/--limit int
              Set the minimum number of lines a message (or total number of
              lines for a multi-part message) must have to be considered for
              retrieval.

       -L/--maxlines int
              Set the maximum number of lines a message must have to be
              considered for retrieval. (-1 for unlimited)

       -s/--delay int
              Set the number of seconds to wait between retry attempts.

       --timeout int
              Set the number of seconds to wait for a reply from the nntp
              server before giving up.

       -i/--incomplete
              Retrieve files with missing parts.

       -I/--complete
              Retrieve only files with all parts.

       --decode
              Decode and delete temp files (default)

       -k/--keep
              Decode and keep temp files.

       -K/--no-decode
              Keep temp files, and don't try to decode them.

       -c/--case
              Match case sensitively.

       -C/--nocase
              Match case insensitively.

       --autopar
              Enable automatic parfile handling. (default) Only download as
              many par files as needed to replace missing or corrupt files.

       --no-autopar
              Disable automatic parfile handling.  All parfiles that match the
              expression will be downloaded.

       -d/--dupecheck FLAGS
              Check to make sure you don't already have files.  This is done
              in two ways.  The first ("f") is by compiling a list of all
              files in the current directory, then checking against all
              messages to be retrieved to see if one of the filenames shows up
              in the subject.  This works reasonably well, though sometimes
              the filename isn't in the subject.  It can also cause problems
              if you happen to have files in the directory named silly things
              like "a", in which case all messages with the word "a" in them
              will be skipped.  However, it is still smart enough not to skip
              messages that merely have a word containing "a".
              The second method ("i") is by setting a flag in the header cache
              that will prevent it from being retrieved again.  You can use
              combos such as -dfi to check both, -dFi to only check the flag,
              -dfI to only check files, etc.
              The third ("m") will cause files that are found by the dupe file
              check ("f") to be marked as retrieved in the cache. (Useful for
              handling crossposted binaries and/or binaries saved with another
              newsreader.)

       -D/--nodupecheck
              Don't check either of the --dupecheck methods, retrieve any
              messages that match.

       -N/--noconnect
              Do not connect to any server for retrieving articles.  Useful
              for trying to decode as much as you have.  (if you got stuff
              with -K or ngetlite.)

       -w/--writelite LITEFILE
              Write a list of parts to retrieve with ngetlite.

       --help Show help.

EXPRETRIEVE EXPRESSIONS
       Expressions are in postfix order.  For the int, date, and age types,
       standard int comparisons are allowed (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=).  For regex
       types, ==(=~), !=(!~) are allowed.

       Thus a comparison would take the following form:
       Infix: <keyword> <operator> <value>  Postfix: <keyword> <value>
       <operator>

       Comparisons can be joined with &&(and), ||(or).
       Infix: <comparison> && <comparison>  Postfix: <comparison> <comparison>
       &&

   -g/-G keywords
       subject (regex)
              Matches the Subject: header.

       author (regex)
              Matches the From: header.

       lines (int)
              Matches the Lines: header.

       bytes (int)
              Matches the length of the message in bytes

       have (int)
              Matches the number of parts of a multipart file that we have.

       req (int)
              Matches the total number of parts of a multipart file.

       date (date)
              Matches the Date: header.  All the standard formats are
              accepted.

       age (age)
              Matches the time since the Date: header.
              Format: [X y[ears]] [X mo[nths]] [X w[eeks]] [X d[ays]] [X
              h[ours]] [X m[inutes]] [X s[econds]]
              Ex.: "6 months 7 hours 8 minutes"
              Ex.: "6mo7h8m"

       update (date)
              Matches the "update time" of the cache item.  That is, the most
              recent time that a new part of the file has been added.  For
              example, if part 1 was added one day, and part 2 only appeared
              on the server the next day, then the update time would be when
              part 2 was added on the second day.  But if both parts were seen
              on the first day, then seen again from a different server on the
              second day, the update time would stay at the original value.

       updateage (age)
              Matches the time since the update of the cache item.

       messageid (regex), mid (regex)
              Matches the Message-ID header.  (For multi-part posts, it
              matches the message-id of the first part.)

       references (regex)
              Matches any of the message's References.

   -a/-A keywords
       group (regex)
              Matches the newsgroup name.

       desc (regex)
              Matches the newsgroup description.

CONFIGURATION
       Upon startup, nget will read ~/.nget5/.ngetrc for default configuration
       values and host/group aliases.  An example .ngetrc should have been
       included with nget.

       nget will also check ~/_nget5/ and _ngetrc if needed, to handle OS and
       filesystems that can't (or won't) handle files starting with a period.

       Options are specified one per line in the form:
              key=value

       Values may be strings(any sequence of characters ending in a newline,
       not quoted), integers(whole numbers), floats(decimal numbers),
       boolean(0=false/1=true).

       Subsections are specified in the form:
              {section_name
                     data
              }
       where data is any number of options.

   Global Configuration Options
       limit (int, default=0)
              Default value for -l/--limit

       tries (int, default=20)
              Default value for -t/--tries

       delay (int, default=1)
              Default value for -s/--delay

       usegz (int, default=-1)
              Default gzip compression level to use for cache/midinfo files
              (can be overridden on a per-group basis).  Acceptable values are
              -1=zlib default, 0=uncompressed, and 1-9.

       timeout (int, default=180)
              Seconds to wait for a reply from the nntp server before giving
              up.

       maxstreaming (int, default=64)
              Sets how many xover commands will be sent at once, when using
              fullxover.  maxstreaming=0 will disable streaming.  Note that
              setting maxstreaming too high can cause your connection to
              deadlock if the write buffer is filled up and the write command
              blocks, but the server will never read more commands since it is
              waiting for us to read what it has already sent us.

       maxconnections (int, default=-1)
              Maximum number of connections to open at once, -1 to allow
              unlimited open connections.  When reached, the servers used
              least recently will be disconnected first.  (Note that
              regardless of this setting, nget never opens more than one
              connection per server.)

       idletimeout (int, default=300)
              Max seconds to keep an idle connection to a nntp server open.

       curservmult (float, default=2.0)
              Priority multiplier given to servers which are currently
              connected.  This can be used to avoid excessive server
              switching.  (Set to 1.0 if you want to disable it.)

       penaltystrikes (int, default=3)
              Number of consecutive connect errors before penalizing a server,
              -1 to disable penalization.

       initialpenalty (int, default=180)
              Number of seconds to ignore a penalized server for.

       penaltymultiplier (float, default=2.0)
              Multiplier for penalty time for each time the penalty time runs
              out and the server continues to be down.

       case (boolean, default=0)
              Default for regex case sensitivity. (0=-C/--nocase, 1=-c/--case)

       complete (boolean, default=1)
              Default for incomplete file filter. (0=-i/--incomplete,
              1=-I/--complete)

       dupeidcheck (boolean, default=1)
              Default for already downloaded file filter. (0=-dI, 1=-di)

       dupefilecheck (boolean, default=1)
              Default for duplicate file filter. (0=-dF, 1=-df)

       autopar (boolean, default=1)
              Default for automatic par handling. (0=--no-autopar,
              1=--autopar)

       autopar_optimistic (boolean, default=0)
              One problem with automatic par handling, is that sometimes
              people do multi-day posts and post the par files first.  If
              autopar_optimistic is enabled, it will assume that when there
              aren't enough .pxx files, that it must just be a multi-day post
              and will not grab any pxx files.  If autopar_optimistic is off,
              it grab all the pxx files so that if they expire before more are
              posted, we will already have them.

       quiet (boolean, default=0)
              Default for quiet option. (0=normal, 1=-q)

       tempshortnames (boolean, default=0)
              1=Use 8.3 tempfile names (for old dos partitions, etc), 0=Use
              17.3 tempfile names

       fatal_user_errors (boolean, default=0)
              Makes user/path errors cause an immediate exit rather than
              continuing if possible.

       unequal_line_error (boolean, default=0)
              If set, downloaded articles whose actual number of lines does
              not match the expected value will be regarded as an error and
              ignored.  If 0, a warning will be generated but the article will
              be accepted.

       fullxover (int, default=0)
              Controls whether nget will check for articles added or removed
              out of order when updating header cache.  fullxover=0 will
              follow the nntp spec and assume articles are always added and
              removed in the correct order.  fullxover=1 will assume articles
              may be added out of order, but are still removed in order.
              fullxover=2 handles articles being added and removed in any
              order.

       makedirs (special, default=no)
              Create non-existant directories specified by -p/-P?
              (yes/no/ask/#)

       test_multiserver (special, default=no)
              Display multiserver file complition info in testmode output?
              (no=no, short=show shortname of each server that has parts of
              the file, lowercase when complete and uppercase when that server
              only has some parts, long=show fullname of each server along
              with a count of how many parts it has if it does not have them
              all.)

       text (special, default=files)
              Default for the --text option (possible values are
              ignore,files,mbox[:filename]).

       save_binary_info (boolean, default=0)
              Default for the --save-binary-info option.

       cachedir (string)
              Specifies a different location to store cache files.  Could be
              used to share a single cache dir between a trusted group of
              users, to reduce HD/bandwidth usage, while still allowing each
              user to have their own config/midinfo files.)

   Host Configuration
       Host configuration is done in the halias section, with a subsection for
       each host containing its options:

       address (string, required)
              Address of the server, with optional port number seperated by a
              colon.  To specify a literal IPv6 address with a port number,
              use the format "[address]:port".

       id (int, required)
              An identifier for this server.  The id uniquely identifies a
              certain set of header cache data.  You may specify the same id
              in more than one host, for example if you have multiple accounts
              on a server to avoid to storing the same cache data multiple
              times.  The id should not be changed after you have used it.
              Must be greater than 0 and less than ULONG_MAX. (usually
              4294967295).

       shortname (string, default=first character of host alias)
              The shortname to use for this server.

       user (string)
              Username for the server, if it requires authorization.

       pass (string)
              Password for the server, if it requires authorization.

       fullxover (int)
              Override global fullxover setting for this server only.

       maxstreaming (int)
              Override global maxstreaming setting for this server only.

       idletimeout (int)
              Override global idletimeout setting for this server only.

       linelenience (special, default=0)
              The linelenience option may be specified as either a single int,
              or two ints seperated by a comma.  If only a single int, X is
              specified, then it will be interpeted as shorthand for "-X,+X".
              These values specify the ammount that the real (recieved) number
              of lines (inclusive) for an article may deviate from the values
              returned by the server in the header listings.  For example,
              "-1,2" means that the real number of lines may be one less than,
              equal to, one greater than, or two greater than the expected
              amount.

       For example, the following host section defines a single host "host1",
       with nntp authentication for user "bob", password "something", and the
       fullxover option enabled.
              {halias
                     {host1
                            addr=news.host1.com
                            id=3838
                            user=bob
                            pass=something
                            fullxover=1
                            linelenience=-1,2
                     }
              }

   Server Priority Configuration
       Multiserver priorities are defined in the hpriority section.  Multiple
       priority groups can be made, and different newsgroups can be configured
       to use their own priority grouping, or they will default to the
       "default" group.  The -a option will use the "_grouplist" priority
       group if it exists, otherwise it will use the "default" group.

       The hpriority section contains a subsection for each priority group,
       with data items of server=prio-multiplier, and the special items
       _level=float and _glevel=float.  _level sets the priority level
       assigned to any host not listed in the group, and _glevel sets the
       required priority needed for -g and -a to automatically use that host.
       Both _level and _glevel default to 1.0 if not specified.

       The priority group "trustsizes" also has special meaning, and is used
       to choose which servers reporting of article line/byte counts to trust
       when reporting to the user.

       For example, the following section defines the default priority group
       and the trustsizes priority group.  If all hosts have a certain
       article, goodhost will be most likely to be chosen, and badhost least
       likely.  It also sets the default priority level to 1.01, meaning any
       hosts not listed in this group will have a priority of 1.01.  When
       using -g without first specifying a host, only those with prios 1.2 or
       above will be selected.
              {hpriority
                     {default
                            _level=1.01
                            _glevel=1.2
                            host1=1.9
                            goodhost=2.0
                            badhost=0.9
                     }
                     {trustsizes
                            goodhost=5.0
                            badhost=0.1
                     }
              }

   Newsgroup Alias Configuration
       Newsgroup aliases are defined in the galias section.  An alias can be a
       simple alias=fullname data item, or  a subsection containing group=,
       prio=, and usegz= items.  The per-group usegz setting will override the
       global setting.

       An alias can also refer to multiple groups (either fullnames or further
       aliases).

       For example, the following galias section defines an alias of "abpl"
       for the group "alt.binaries.pictures.linux", "chocobo" for the group
       "alt.chocobo", and ospics for both alt.binaries.pictures.linux and
       alt.binaries.pictures.freebsd.  In addition, the chocobo group is
       assigned to use the chocoprios priority grouping when deciding what
       server to retrieve from.
              {galias
                     abpl=alt.binaries.pictures.linux
                     {chocobo
                            group=alt.chocobo
                            prio=chocoprios
                     }
                     ospics=abpl,alt.binaries.pictures.freebsd
              }

EXIT STATUS
       On exit,  nget will display a summary of the run.  The summary is split
       into three parts:

       OK     Lists successful operations.

              total  Total number of "logical messages" retrieved (after
                     joining parts).

              uu     Number of uuencoded files.

              base64 Number of Base64 (Mime) files.

              XX     Number of xxencoded files.

              binhex Number of Binhex encoded files.

              plaintext
                     Number of plaintext files saved.

              qp     Number of Quoted-Printable encoded files.

              yenc   Number of yEncoded files.

              dupe   Number of decoded files that were exact dupes of existing
                     files, and thus deleted.

              skipped
                     Number of files that were queued to download but turned
                     out to be dupes after decoding earlier parts and
                     comparing their filenames to the subject line.  (Same
                     method thats used for the dupe file check when queueing
                     them up, just that the filename(s) of any decoded files
                     cannot be known until they are downloaded, so some of the
                     checking must occur during the run rather than at queue
                     time.)

              group  Number of groups successfully updated.

              grouplist
                     Newsgroup list successfully updated.

              autopar
                     Number of parity sets that are complete.

       WARNINGS

              group  Updating group info failed for some (but not all)

                     Some articles retrieved had different line counts than
                     the server said they should.  (And unequal_line_error is
                     set to 0).

                     in the pars.

       ERRORS Lists errors that occured.  In addition, the exit status will be
              set to a bitwise OR of the codes of all errors that occured.
              (Note that some errors share an exit code, since there are only
              8 bits available.)

                     Number of file decoding errors.

              autopar (exit code 2)
                     Number of parity sets that could not be completed.

              path (exit code 4)

                     attempted servers.

              fatal (exit code 128)
                     Error preventing further operation, such as "No space
                     left on device".

              other (exit code 64)
                     Any other kind of error.

EXAMPLES
       The simplest possible example.  Retrieve and decode everything from
       alt.binaries.test that you haven't already gotten before:
       nget -g alt.binaries.test -r ""

       get listing of all files matching penguin.*png from
       alt.binaries.pictures.linux (note this is a regex, equivilant to
       standard shell glob of penguin*png.. see the regex(7) or grep manpage
       for more info on regular expressions.)
       nget -g alt.binaries.pictures.linux -DTr "penguin.*png"

       retrieve all the ones that have more than 50 lines:
       nget -g alt.binaries.pictures.linux -l 50 -r "penguin.*png"

       equivilant to above, using -R:
       nget -g alt.binaries.pictures.linux -R "lines 50 > subject penguin.*png
       == &&"
       (basically (lines > 50) && (subject == penguin.*png))

       flush all headers from host goodhost in group
       alt.binaries.pictures.linux:
       nget -Galt.binaries.pictures.linux -Fgoodhost

       retrieve/update group list, and list all groups with "linux" in the
       name or description:
       nget -a -Tr linux

       equivilant to above, using -R:
       nget -a -TR "group linux == desc linux == ||"

       flush all groups from host goodhost in grouplist:
       nget -A -Fgoodhost

NOTES
       Running multiple copies of nget at once should be safe.  It uses file
       locking, so there should be no way for the files to actually get
       corrupted.  However if you have two ngets doing a -g on the same group
       at the same time, it would duplicate the download for both processes.
       If you are using -G there is no problem at all.  (Theoretically you
       might be able to cause some sort of problems by downloading the same
       files from the same group in the same directory at the same time..)

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME   Where to put .nget5 directory. (put nget files $HOME/.nget5/)

       NGETHOME
              Override HOME var (put nget files in $NGETHOME)

       NGETCACHE
              Override HOME/NGETHOME vars and .ngetrc cachedir option (put
              nget cache files in $NGETCACHE)

       NGETRC Alternate configuration file to use.

FILES
       ~/.nget5/
              All configuration and cache files are stored here.  Changed to
              .nget5/ because cache format changed in nget 0.27.  (The 5 in
              the directory name is for file format version 5, not nget
              version 5.)  To upgrade a .nget4 directory to .nget5, simply run
              "mv ~/.nget4 ~/.nget5 ; rm ~/.nget5/*,cache*"

       ~/.nget5/.ngetrc
              Configuration file.  If you store authentication information
              here, be sure to set it readable only by owner.

       ~/_nget5/_ngetrc
              Alternate location, use this if you can't create a dir/file
              starting with a period.

       ~/.nget5/lists/
              Default directory for listfiles.
