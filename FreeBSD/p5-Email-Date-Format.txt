Email::Date::Format(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Email::Date::Format - produce RFC 2822 date strings

VERSION
       version 1.008

SYNOPSIS
         use Email::Date::Format qw(email_date);

         my $header = email_date($date->epoch);

         Email::Simple->create(
           header => [
             Date => $header,
           ],
           body => '...',
         );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple means for generating an RFC 2822
       compliant datetime string.  (In case you care, they're not RFC 822
       dates, because they use a four digit year, which is not allowed in RFC
       822.)

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

FUNCTIONS
   email_date
         my $date = email_date; # now
         my $date = email_date( time - 60*60 ); # one hour ago

       "email_date" accepts an epoch value, such as the one returned by
       "time".  It returns a string representing the date and time of the
       input, as specified in RFC 2822. If no input value is provided, the
       current value of "time" is used.

       "email_date" is exported only if requested.

   email_gmdate
         my $date = email_gmdate;

       "email_gmdate" is identical to "email_date", but it will return a
       string indicating the time in Greenwich Mean Time, rather than local
       time.

       "email_gmdate" is exported only if requested.
