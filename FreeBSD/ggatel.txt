NAME
     ggatel – GEOM Gate local control utility

SYNOPSIS
     ggatel create [-v] [-o ro | wo | rw] [-s sectorsize] [-t timeout]
            [-u unit] path
     ggatel destroy [-f] -u unit
     ggatel list [-v] [-u unit]
     ggatel rescue [-v] [-o ro | wo | rw] -u unit path

DESCRIPTION
     The ggatel utility is a local GEOM Gate class consumer.  It can be used
     as a replacement for md(4) devices or as a “GEOMificator” for non GEOM-
     aware devices, but it was mainly created as an example on how to use and
     how to communicate with the GEOM Gate kernel subsystem.

     Available commands:

     create       Create a ggate provider related to the given regular file or
                  device.

     destroy      Destroy the given ggate provider.

     list         List ggate providers.

     rescue       Take over a previously created provider and handle pending
                  and future requests.  This is useful if the initial ggatel
                  process died.  To prevent data loss, the given path must
                  lead to the regular file or device that was used to create
                  the provider.

     Available options:

     -f                     Forcibly destroy ggate provider (cancels all
                            pending requests).

     -o ro | wo | rw        Specify permissions to use when opening the file
                            or device: read-only (ro), write-only (wo), or
                            read-write (rw).  Default is rw.

     -s sectorsize          Sector size for ggate provider.  If not specified,
                            it is taken from the device, or set to 512 bytes
                            for files.

     -t timeout             Number of seconds to wait before an I/O request
                            will be canceled.  0 means no timeout.  Default is
                            30.

     -u unit                Unit number to use.

     -v                     Do not fork, run in foreground and print debug
                            information on standard output.

     path                   Path to a regular file or device.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, or 1 if the command fails.  To get details
     about the failure, ggatel should be called with the -v option.

EXAMPLES
     “GEOMify” the “fd0” device and use gbde(8) to encrypt data on a floppy
     disk.

           ggatel create -u 5 /dev/fd0
           gbde init /dev/ggate5
           gbde attach ggate5
           newfs /dev/ggate5.bde
           mount /dev/ggate5.bde /secret
           cp /private/foo /secret/
           umount /secret
           gbde detach ggate5
           ggatel destroy -u 5
