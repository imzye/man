Geo::Postcodes::DK(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Geo::Postcodes::DK - Danish postcodes with associated information

SYNOPSIS
       This module can be used object oriented, or as procedures.  Take your
       pick.

   AS OBJECTS
        use Geo::Postcodes::DK;

        my $postcode = '1171';

        if (Geo::Postcodes::DK::valid($postcode)) # A valid postcode?
        {
          my $P = Geo::Postcodes::DK->new($postcode);

          printf "Postcode         '%s'.\n", $P->postcode();
          printf "Postal location: '%s'.\n", $P->location();
          printf "Borough:         '%s'.\n", $P->borough();
          printf "County:          '%s'.\n", $P->county();
          printf "Owner:           '%s'.\n", $P->owner();
          printf "Address:         '%s'.\n", $P->address();
          printf "Postcode type:   '%s'.\n", $P->type();
          printf "- in danish:     '%s'.\n", $P->type_verbose();
          printf "- in english:    '%s'.\n", $P->Geo::Postcodes::type_verbose();
        }

       The test for a valid postcode can also be done on the object itself, as
       it will be undef when passed an illegal postcode (and thus no object at
       all.)

        my $P = Geo::postcodes::DK->new($postcode);

        if ($P) { ... }

       A more compact solution:

        if ($P = Geo::Postcodes::DK->new($postcode))
        {
          foreach my $field (Geo::Postcodes::DK::get_fields())
          {
            printf("%-20s %s\n", ucfirst($field), $P->$field())
          }
        }

   AS PROCEDURES
        use Geo::postcodes::DK;

        my $postcode = "1171";

        if (Geo::Postcodes::DK::valid($postcode))
        {
          printf "Postcode"        '%s'.\n", $postcode;
          printf "Postal location: '%s'.\n", location_of($postcode);
          printf "Postcode type:   '%s'.\n", type_of($postcode);
          printf "Owner:           '%s'.\n", owner_of($postcode);
          printf "Address:         '%s'.\n", address_of($postcode);
        }

ABSTRACT
       Geo::postcodes::DK - Perl extension for the mapping between danish
       (including Grønland and Færøerne) postcodes, postal location, address
       and address owner.

DESCRIPTION
       Tired og entering the postal name all the time? This is not necessary,
       as it is uniquely defined from the postcode. Request the postcode only,
       and use this library to get the postal name.

   EXPORT
       None.

       The module supports the following fields: 'postcode', 'location',
       'address', 'owner', 'type', and -type_verbose'. This list can also be
       obtained with the call Geo::Postcodes::DK::get_fields().

DEPENDENCIES
       This module is a subclass of Geo::Postcodes, which must be installed
       first.

PROCEDURES and METHODS
       These functions can be used as methods or procedures.

   is_field
        my $boolean = Geo::postcodes::DK::is_field($field);
        my $boolean = $postcode_object->is_field($field);

       Does the specified field exist.

   get_fields
         my @fields = Geo::postcodes::DK::get_fields();
         my @fields = $postcode_object->get_fields();

       A list of fields supported by this class.

   selection
       This procedure/method makes it possible to select more than one
       postcode at a time, based on arbitrary complex rules.

       See the selection documentation (perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Selection or
       man Geo::Postcodes::Selection) for a full description, and the tutorial
       (perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial or man Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial) for
       sample code.

   selection_loop
       As above.

PROCEDURES
       Note that the xxx_of procedures return undef when passed an illegal
       argument. They are used internally by the object constructor (new).

   legal
       "my $boolean = Geo::postcodes::DK::legal($postcode);"

       Do we have a legal postcode; a code that follows the syntax rules?

   valid
       "my $boolean = Geo::postcodes::DK::valid($postcode);"

       Do we have a valid postcode; a code in actual use?

   get_postcodes
       This will return an unsorted list of all the norwegian postcodes.

   verify_selectionlist
       This will check the list of arguments for correctness, and should be
       used before calling 'selection'. The procedure returns a modified
       version of the arguments on success, and diagnostic messages on
       failure.

         my($status, @modified) = Geo::Postcodes::DK::verify_selectionlist(@args);

         if ($status)
         {
           my @result = Geo::Postcodes::DK::selection(@modified);
         }
         else
         {
           print "Diagnostic messages:\n";
           map { print " - $_\n" } @modified;
         }

   postcode_of
         $postcode = Geo::Postcodes::NO::postcode_of($postcode);

       Used internally by 'selection', but otherwise not very useful.

   location_of
       "my $location = Geo::postcodes::DK::location_of($postcode);"

       The postal place associated with the specified postcode.

   owner_of
       "my $owner = Geo::postcodes::DK::owner_of($postcode);"

       The owner (company) of the postcode, if any.

   address_of
       "my $address = Geo::postcodes::DK::address_of($postcode);"

       The address (street) associated with the specified postcode.

   type_of
        my $type = Geo::postcodes::DK::type_of($postcode);

       What kind of postcode is this, as a code.

   type_verbose_of
        my $danish_description  = Geo::postcodes::DK::type_verbose_of($postcode);
        my $english_description = Geo::postcodes::type_verbose_of($postcode);

       A danish text describing the type. Use the base class for the english
       description.

       See the TYPE section for a description of the types.

   type2verbose
       Get the description of the specified type.

         my $danish_description  = Geo::Postcodes::DK::type2verbose($type);
         my $english_description = Geo::Postcodes::type2verbose($type);

METHODS
   new
         my $P = Geo::postcodes::DK-E<gt>new($postcode);

       Create a new postcode object. Internally this will call the "xxx_of"
       procedures for the fields supported by this class.

       The constructor will return undef when passed an invalid or illegal
       postcode.  Do not try method calls on it, as it is not an object. See
       the description of the legal and valid procedures above.

   postcode
         my $postcode = $P->postcode();

       The postcode, as given to the constructor (new).

   location
         my $location = $P->location();

       The postal location associated with the specified postcode.

   type
         my $type = $P->type();

       See the description of the procedure type_of above.

   type_verbose
       See the description of the procedure type_verbose_of above.

         my $type_danish  = $P->type_verbose();
         my $type_english = $P->Geo::Postcodes::type_verbose();

       Use this to get the description.

       See the TYPE section for a description of the types.

TYPE
       This class supports the following types for the postal locatuons:

       BX  Postboks (Post Office box)

       ST  Gadeadresse (Street address)

       IO  Personlig eier (Individual owner)

       PP  Ufrankerede svarforsendelser (Porto Paye receiver)

       Se Geo::Postcodes for furter descriptions.

CAVEAT
   POSTCODES
       Danish postcodes (including Grønland) are four digit numbers ("0000" to
       "9999"), while Færøerne uses three digits numbers ("000" to "999").
       This means that "0010" and "010" are legal, while "10" is not.

       Use legal to check for legal postcodes, and valid to check if the
       postcode is actually in use. "Geo::postcodes::DK-"new($postcode)> will
       return undef if passed an illegal or invalid postcode.

       An attempt to access the methods of a non-existent postcode object will
       result in a runtime error. This can be avoided by checking if the
       postal code is legal, before creating the object; valid($postcode)
       returns true or false.

   CHARACTER SET
       The library was written using the ISO-8859-1 (iso-latin1) character
       set, and the special danish letters 'Æ', 'Ø' and 'Å' occur regularly in
       the postal places, kommune name and fylke name. Usage of other
       character sets may cause havoc.  Unicode is not tested.

       Note that the case insensitive search (in the 'selection'
       method/procedure) doesn't recognize an 'Æ' as an 'æ' (and so on). "use
       locale" in the application program should fix this, if the current
       locale supports these characters.

SEE ALSO
       See also the sample programs in the "eg/"-directory of the
       distribution, the tutorial ("perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial" or "man
       Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial") and the selection manual (perldoc
       Geo::Postcodes::Selection or man Geo::Postcodes::Selection) for usage
       details.

       The latest version of this library should always be available on CPAN,
       but see also the library home page; http://bbop.org/perl/GeoPostcodes
       for additional information and sample usage.
