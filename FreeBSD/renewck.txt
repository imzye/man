renewck
       renewck - notify about domains due to expire

SYNOPSIS
       renewck [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The renewck utility monitors a set of Internet domains.  For each
       configured domain it queries a whois server about its expiration date.
       If the domain is due to expire within a preconfigured time interval,
       renewck mails a notification about the fact.

       The utility is intended to be started periodically as a cron job.

       Renewck will re-send notifications until domain is renewed or finally
       expired.  The notification schedule is as follows:

       For each domain domain expiring within a month from the current date, a
       new notification is send each 3 days.

       For domains expiring within two weeks, notifications are re-sent daily.

       For domains expiring within a week, notifications are re-sent each 3
       hours.

OPTIONS
       --domain=domsrv[,domsrv...]
           Adds listed domains to the list of monitored domains.  Each domsrv
           is either a single domain name or a pair domain=server[:port],
           where server stands for the name of whois server to be queried for
           that domain, and optional port is a decimal port number to be used
           instead of the default 43.

           Unless specified explicitely, the whois server to query is selected
           depending on the TLD of the domain.  If no specific whois server
           found, the default one will be used.  The default whois server is
           whois.publicinterestregistry.net, unless set otherwise by the
           --whois-server option.

       --file=FILE
           Read domain names from the FILE.  The file must list a single
           domain on each line.  Optionally, a server[:port] specification is
           allowed after the domain name, separated from it by any amount of
           white space (see the --domain option for the description of that
           specification).

           UNIX-like comments are allowed.  Empty lines are ignored.

       --notify-address=email
           Sent notifications to email instead of to the user which invoked
           renewck.

       --notify_cc=emails
           A comma-separated list of addresses for the notification mail Cc:
           header.

       --notify_subject=text
           Use text as the subject of notification emails.  The following
           variables are expanded within the template text:

               $domain       domain the notification refers to;
               $expiration   expiration date, in the preferred date and time
                             representation for the current locale;
               $daysleft     number of days left to the expiration date;
               $days         number of days as a string, e.g. "two days";

           The default subject line is:

               $domain is due to expire

       --notify-template=FILE
           The file to be used as a template for the message body.  This text
           is expanded as described for --notify-subject above.

       --whois-server=server[:port]
           Sets the default whois server (instead of the hardcoded
           whois.publicinterestregistry.net).  If port is also supplied, it
           will be used instead of the default port 43.

       --whois-delay=N
           Many servers (in particular whois.publicinterestregistry.net used
           by default), implement certain restrictions regarding maximum
           number of queries an IP address can make in a unit of time.  To
           keep request rate within these policies, renewck introduces a
           2-second delay between whois queries.  This option allows to tune
           that delay.

       --cache-file=FILE
           Keep notification history in a GDBM database file named FILE.  By
           default, it is .renewck.db in the user's home directory.

       --debug[=spec[,spec...]], -d[spec[,spec...]]
           Set debugging level.  A spec is either category or category=level,
           where category is a debugging category name and level is a decimal
           verbosity level.  Valid categories are: "MAIN", "DBM" and "WHOIS"
           (all case-insensitive).  If level is not supplied, 1 is used
           instead.

       --help, -h
           Show a terse help summary and exit.

       --man
           Prints the manual page and exits.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The program reads its configuration from one of the following
       locations:

       a. File name given by "RENEWCK_CONF" environment variable (if set)
       b. The file .renewck.conf in the user home directory

       The first existing file is read.  It is an error if the $RENEWCK_CONF
       variable is set, but points to a file that does not exist.  It is OK if
       $RENEWCK_CONF is not set and .renewck.conf does not exist.  It is,
       however, an error if any of these file exists,  but is not readable.

       The configuration file has the usual UNIX configuration format.  Empty
       lines and UNIX comments are ignored.  Each non-empty line is either an
       option name, or option assignment, i.e. opt=val, with any amount of
       optional whitespace around the equals sign.  Valid option names are the
       same as long command line options, but without the leading --.

       For example:

           file  = domain.list
           notify-cc = root
