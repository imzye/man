CVSWRAP(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             CVSWRAP(1)

NAME
     cvswrap – wrapper over cvs to enable fine grained access control to
     repositories

SYNOPSIS
     cvswrap [cvs options]

DESCRIPTION
     cvswrap is a program written to sit in front of cvs.  It provides an
     administrator with fine grained access over cvs repositories.

     On startup it determines the CVSROOT environment variable by way of
     command line options, environment or by parsing the pserver command
     stream.  It then reads a config file cvswrap.conf(5) to determine the
     which wrapper to execute.

     If the CVSROOT is not set or can not be determined then cvs(1) will be
     executed normally.

     Typical usage for cvswrap is to use it to invoke a custom wrapper which
     may be setgid to a special group in order to enforce ACLs over cvs(1)
     operations.

INSTALLATION
     To make this program work one should rename the installed cvs(1) binary
     to /usr/bin/ncvs and install cvswrap in the location where the cvs(1)
     binary was.

BUGS
     The default install of this program is not particulary helpful.  See the
     installation section for help.
