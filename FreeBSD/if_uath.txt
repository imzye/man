UATH(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                UATH(4)

NAME
     uath – Atheros USB IEEE 802.11a/b/g wireless network device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device uath
           device wlan

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_uath_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The uath driver supports USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on
     Atheros Communications fifth generation AR5005UG and AR5005UX chipsets.

     The AR5005UG chipset is made of an AR5523 multiprotocol MAC/baseband
     processor and an AR2112 Radio-on-a-Chip that can operate between 2300 and
     2500 MHz (802.11b/g).

     The AR5005UX chipset is made of an AR5523 multiprotocol MAC/baseband
     processor and an AR5112 dual band Radio-on-a-Chip that can operate
     between 2300 and 2500 MHz (802.11b/g) or 4900 and 5850 MHz (802.11a).

     The AR5005UG and AR5005UX chipsets both have an integrated 32-bit MIPS
     R4000-class processor that runs a firmware and manages, among other
     things, the automatic control of the transmit rate and the calibration of
     the radio.

     uath supports station, and monitor mode operation.  Only one virtual
     interface may be configured at any time.  For more information on
     configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

FIRMWARE
     uath requires firmware that is downloaded to the device.  This is
     normally done by the uathload(8) utility that is launched by devd(8) when
     the device is inserted.  uathload(8) includes the firmware in the binary
     program.  This firmware is licensed for general use and is included in
     the base system.

     The uath driver should work with the following adapters:

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev uath0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev uath0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev uath0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

     Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev uath0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \
               wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1

DIAGNOSTICS
     uath%d: could not send command (error=%s)  An attempt to send a command
     to the firmware failed.

     uath%d: timeout waiting for command reply  A read command was sent to the
     firmware but the firmware failed to reply in time.

     uath%d: device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
     transmission did not complete in time.  The driver will reset the
     hardware.  This should not happen.

HISTORY
     The uath driver first appeared in OpenBSD 4.0.

AUTHORS
     The uath driver was written by Weongyo Jeong <weongyo@FreeBSD.org> and
     Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>.  It is distantly related to a driver
     written by Damien Bergamini <damien@openbsd.org>.

CAVEATS
     Atheros proprietary 108 Mbps mode (aka Super AG mode) is not supported.

     Dual-band adapters are presently not working; to workaround, restriction
     operation to 2.4GHz channels.
