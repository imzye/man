AFTERNOONSTALKER(6)                                        AFTERNOONSTALKER(6)

NAME
       afternoonstalker - A robot-killing game

SYNOPSIS
       afternoonstalker

DESCRIPTION
       In Afternoon Stalker, you are in a two-dimensional maze where you are
       attacked by robots that shoot at you and that you must shoot down.  You
       must pick up a gun somewhere in the maze in order to have a few bullets
       to shoot.  Avoid the spiders and the bats, which can paralyze you long
       enough for a robot to come and shoot you.  The bunker where you start
       is your only protection.

       Use the arrow keys to move and the Ctrl key to shoot in the direction
       you last walked.  You can also shoot in a fixed direction with the H
       (left), J (down), K (up) and L (right) keys (this is the same
       convention as in vi).  The Escape key pauses the game and shows the
       main menu.  The P key also pauses the game the same way.

OPTIONS
       --help display a help page and exit

       --version
              display version information and exit

       --ms-per-frame=N
              N milliseconds per animation frame.  Default is 55.  Minimum is
              1.  Maximum is 1000.  50 means 20 frames per second.

       --full-screen
              Attempt to use the full screen mode.  The default is to display
              the game in an ordinary window.

       --maze=M
              Selects maze M, where M is 0 for the original maze, 1 for a
              slightly different maze, and 2 for a minimal maze.  By default,
              maze 0 is used.  The maze can also be selected from the game's
              interactive menu under Options:Maze.

       --rules=R
              Selects rule set R, where R is 1 or 2.  Rule set #1 applies the
              original Afternoon Stalker rules.  Rule set #2 is slightly
              different.  The game starts with 5 robots instead of 3, and the
              number of simultaneous robots increases more quickly.  There are
              only gray and blue robots, but they move slightly faster.  The
              number of bullets in a gun increases as the game progresses.
              Bonus lives do not come as often.

       --no-auto-pause
              Do not pause automatically when the window loses focus.
