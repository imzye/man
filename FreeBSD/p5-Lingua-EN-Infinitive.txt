NAME
       Lingua::EN::Infinitive - Determine the infinitive form of a conjugated
       word

Synopsis

               my($spell) = Lingua::EN::Infinitive -> new();
               my($word)  = 'rove';

               my($word1, $word2, $suffix, $rule) = $spell -> stem($word);

               # Method 2:

               $spell -> stem($word);

               my($word1, $word2, $suffix, $rule) =
               (
                       $spell -> word1,  # A possibility.
                       $spell -> word2,  # A possibility, or ''.
                       $spell -> suffix,
                       $spell -> rule,
               );

               print "Conjugated: $word. Infinitive: $word1. \n";

               # Now, adjective to noun conversion.

               my($noun);

               for (qw/Turkish amateurish cuttlefish vixenish whitish/)
               {

                       print "$_ => ", (defined $noun ? $noun : $_), ". \n";
               }

               my(%expected) =

                       amateurish      => 'amateur',
                       cuttlefish      => '', # I.e. No change because 'cuttlef' can't be an adjective.
                       demolish        => '', # Ditto.
                       radish          => '', # Ditto.
                       swish           => '', # Ditto.
                       vixenish        => 'vixen',
                       whitish         => 'white',
               );

               my($noun);

               for (qw/Turkish amateurish cuttlefish demolish radish swish vixenish whitish/)

                       $noun = $spell -> adjective2noun($_);

                       print "$_ => ", ($noun ? $noun : $_), '. OK: ', ( ($noun eq $expected{$_}) ? 'Yes' : 'No'), ". \n";
               }

       See scripts/demo.pl and t/test.t for sample code.

Description
   Generic Code
       This section discusses the results from calling the method
       "stem($word)".

       Determines the infinitive form of a conjugated word. Also, determines
       the suffix used to identify which rule to apply to transform the
       conjugated word into the infinitive form.

       Either 1 or 2 possible infinitives are returned. You must check that
       the first is really an English word. If it is, then it is the result.
       If it is not valid, then check the second.

       This module does not provide a way of determining whether or not a
       candidate solution is in fact an English word.

       Failure to deconjugate is indicated by $word1 eq ''.

       In general, you can ignore the 3rd and 4th values returned from
       "stem($word)".

       The algorithm is based on the McIlroy article (see below), after first
       checking for irregular words.

       In the hash 'suffix2rule', you will see the key 'order'. This specifies
       the sort order in which to check the McIlroy rules. I have changed his
       ordering in a number of places, based on my interpreation of which
       order produces the better result.

   Adjectival Code
       This section discusses the results from calling the method
       adjective2noun().

       The source contains a list of (adjective => noun) pairs taken from
       /usr/share/dict/words, and so it can be used to convert adjectives to
       nouns.

       I suggest calling adjective2noun() if "stem($word)" does not provide a
       suitable candidate.

Installation
       You install "Lingua::EN::Infinitive", as you would install any perl
       module library, by running these commands:

               perl Makefile.PL
               make
               make test
               make install

Warning
       Do not make the false assumption that

               "$word1$suffix" eq $word
                       or
               "$word2$suffix" eq $word

Methods
   adjective2noun($adjective)
       Returns either the noun which was used to generate the adjective in the
       first place, or the empty string.

       There are 99 (adjective => noun) pairs in the source code.

   rule()
       Must only be called after calling "stem($word)".

       Returns the same string as the 4th value returned by "stem($word)".

   stem($word)
       Returns a 4-element array:

       o A candidate word, or the empty string
           If a non-empty string is returned, check that it is a real word. If
           it is, then that is the candidate you want.

           If it is not a real word, or it is empty, check the next word
           returned.

       o Another candidate, or the empty string
           As before, check that it is a real word.

       o A suffix, or the empty string
           If one of the first two words is real, this is the suffix removed
           from the input word.

           Normally, you would ignore this value.

       o A rule number, or the empty string.
           The arbitrary rule number used to determine the candidate. Rules
           are applied in the order given by these rule numbers.

           Normally, you would ignore this value.

   suffix()
       Must only be called after calling "stem($word)".

       Returns the same string as the 3rd value returned by "stem($word)".

   word1()
       Must only be called after calling "stem($word)".

       Returns the same string as the 1st value returned by "stem($word)".

   word2()
       Must only be called after calling "stem($word)".

       Returns the same string as the 2nd value returned by "stem($word)".
