NAME
       Array::Utils - small utils for array manipulation

SYNOPSIS
               use Array::Utils qw(:all);

               my @a = qw( a b c d );
               my @b = qw( c d e f );

               # symmetric difference
               my @diff = array_diff(@a, @b);

               # intersection
               my @isect = intersect(@a, @b);

               # unique union
               my @unique = unique(@a, @b);

               # check if arrays contain same members
               if ( !array_diff(@a, @b) ) {
                       # do something
               }

               # get items from array @a that are not in array @b
               my @minus = array_minus( @a, @b );

DESCRIPTION
       A small pure-perl module containing list manipulation routines. The
       module emerged because I was tired to include same utility routines in
       numerous projects.

FUNCTIONS
       "unique"
           Returns an array of unique items in the arguments list.

       "intersect"
           Returns an intersection of two arrays passed as arguments, keeping
           the order of the second parameter. A nice side effect of this
           function can be exploited in situations as:

                   @atreides = qw( Leto Paul Alia 'Leto II' );
                   @mylist = qw( Alia Leto );
                   @mylist = intersect( @mylist, @atreides );  # and @mylist is ordered as Leto,Alia

       "array_diff"
           Return symmetric difference of two arrays passed as arguments.

       "array_minus"
           Returns the difference of the passed arrays A and B (only those
           array elements that exist in A and do not exist in B).  If an empty
           array is returned, A is subset of B.

           Function was proposed by Laszlo Forro <salmonix@gmail.com>.
