INJAIL(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              INJAIL(8)

NAME
     injail – determine if a process is running in a jail

SYNOPSIS
     injail

DESCRIPTION
     The injail utility returns a result which indicates the jailed status of
     the current process environment.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The injail utility exits with one of the following values:
     0       the process is running in a jail.
     1       the process is not running in a jail.
     2       an error prevented determining if the process is running in a
             jail.

BUGS
     injail uses kvm_getprocs(3) to determine process status. Anything which
     could cause a failure in either kvm_open(3) or kvm_getprocs(3) can cause
     this to fail as well. There aught to be a cleaner way.
