PTHREAD_MUTEX_TRYLOCK(3)                      FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_mutex_trylock – attempt to lock a mutex without blocking

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_mutex_trylock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_mutex_trylock() function locks mutex.  If the mutex is
     already locked, pthread_mutex_trylock() will not block waiting for the
     mutex, but will return an error condition.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, pthread_mutex_trylock() will return zero, otherwise an
     error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_mutex_trylock() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]            The value specified by mutex is invalid.

     [EBUSY]             Mutex is already locked.

     [EOWNERDEAD]        The argument mutex points to a robust mutex and the
                         process containing the previous owning thread
                         terminated while holding the mutex lock.  The lock
                         was granted to the caller and it is up to the new
                         owner to make the state consistent.

     [ENOTRECOVERABLE]   The state protected by the mutex is not recoverable.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_mutex_consistent(3), pthread_mutex_destroy(3),
     pthread_mutex_init(3), pthread_mutex_lock(3), pthread_mutex_unlock(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_mutex_trylock() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (“POSIX.1”).
