       DateTime::Calendar::Mayan - The Mayan Long Count, Haab, and Tzolkin
       calendars

SYNOPSIS
          use DateTime::Calendar::Mayan

          my $dtcm = DateTime::Calendar::Mayan->new(
               baktun  => 12,

DESCRIPTION
       An implementation of the Mayan Long Count, Haab, and Tzolkin calendars
       as defined in "Calendrical Calculations The Millennium Edition".
       Supplemented by "Frequently Asked Questions about Calendars".

METHODS
       •   new( baktun => $scalar, ..., epoch => $object )

           Accepts a hash representing a date on the Long Count calendar and a
           "DateTime::Calendar" object specifying an alternate epoch.  All
           keys are optional.

              The units are:
              kin   = 1 day
              uinal = 20 days
              tun   = 360 days
              katun = 7200 days
              baktun = 144000 days

           In the future pictuns, calabtuns, kinchiltuns, and alautuns may be
           accepted.

       •   now

           Alternate constructor.  Uses DateTime->now to set the current date.

       •   today

           Alternate constructor.  Uses DateTime->today to set the current
           date.

       •   clone

           This object method returns a replica of the given object.

       •   from_object( object => $object )

           Accepts a "DateTime::Calendar" object.  Although this calendar
           doesn't support time it will preserve the time value of objects
           passed to it.  This prevents a loss of precision when chaining
           calendars.

           Note: Language support is not implemented.

       •   utc_rd_values

           Returns the current UTC Rata Die days, UTC Rata Die seconds, and
           nanoseconds as a three element list.

       •   from_epoch( epoch => $scalar )

           Creates a new object from a number of seconds relative to midnight
           1970-01-01.

       •   epoch

           Returns the number of seconds since midnight 1970-01-01.

       •   set_mayan_epoch( object => $object )

           Accepts a "DateTime::Calendar" object.  The epoch is set to this
           value on a per object basis

           The default epoch is:

           Goodman-Martinez-Thompson
              Aug. 11, -3113 / Sep. 6, 3114 B.C.E. / 584,283 JD

       •   mayan_epoch

           Returns a "DateTime::Calendar::Mayan" object set to the current
           Mayan epoch.

       •   date

       •   bktuk

       •   long_count( $scalar )

           Returns the Long Count calendar date.  Think DateTime::ymd.  Like
           ymd this method also accepts an optional field separator string.

       •   haab( $scalar )

           Returns the Haab calendar date.  Accepts an optional field
           separator string.

       •   tzolkin( $scalar )

           Returns the Tzolkin calendar date.  Accepts an optional field
           separator string.

       •   baktun

       •   katun

       •   tun

       •   uinal

       •   kin( $scalar )

           Gets/Sets the long count value of the function name.

       •   set_baktun

       •   set_katun

       •   set_tun

       •   set_uinal

       •   set_kin( $scalar )

           Aliases to the combined accessor/mutators.

       •   set( baktun => $scalar, ... )

           Accepts a hash specifying new long count values.  All units are
           optional.

       •   add

       •   subtract( baktun => $scalar, ... )

           Accepts a hash specifying values to add or subject from the long
           count.  All units are optional.

       •   add_duration

       •   subtract_duration( $object )

           Accepts a "DateTime::Duration" object and either adds or subtracts
           it from the current date.   See the DateTime::Duration docs for
           more details.

BACKGROUND
       Please see:

       Chapter 10 of Calendarical Calculations "The Millennium Edition".

       and

       Chapter 7 of Frequently Asked Questions about Calendars.
          http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/node8.html

GOTCHAS
       The Long Count calendar is cyclical and it is possible to have
       different dates in other calendars that convert to be the same Long
       Count date.  Under this calendar the dates 0.0.0.0.0 and 13.0.0.0.0 are
       equivalent.

       The Long Count calendar will next roll over in late 2012 (Gregorian).
       In anticipation of this Long Count dates input as 0-12.*.*.*.* will
       convert to Gregorian dates in the Mayan year that started in -3113
       (Gregorian).  Long Count dates input as 13.*.*.*.* will convert to
       Gregorian dates in the Mayan year that start in 2012 (Gregorian).

       Example:

          use DateTime;
          use DateTime::Calendar::Mayan;

          my $dtcm = DateTime::Calendar::Mayan->new( baktun => 0 );
          print $dtcm->date, "\n";
          print DateTime->from_object( object => $dtcm )->ymd, "\n";

          $dtcm->set( baktun => 13);
          print $dtcm->date, "\n";
          print DateTime->from_object( object => $dtcm )->ymd, "\n";

       Will print:

          13.0.0.0.0
          -3113-08-11
          13.0.0.0.0
          2012-12-21

       As you can see the Long Count dates are identical but the Gregorian
       equivalent dates are different.

       Support for a count of Mayan "years" or "cycles" allowing accurate
       conversion to/from Gregorian dates may be added to this module in the
       future.  This would be an extension to the historical Long Count
       calendar.
