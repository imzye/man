DESCRIPTION
       JOVE is Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs.  It is based on the original
       EMACS editor written at MIT by Richard Stallman.  Although JOVE is
       meant to be compatible with EMACS, there are some major differences
       between the two editors and you shouldn't rely on their behaving
       identically.

       JOVE works on any reasonable display terminal that is described in the
       termcap file (see TERMCAP(5) for more details).  When you start up
       JOVE, it checks to see whether you have your TERM environment variable
       set.  On most systems that will automatically be set up for you, but if
       it's not JOVE will ask you what kind of terminal you are using.  To
       avoid having to type this every time you run JOVE you can set your TERM
       environment variable yourself.  How you do this depends on which shell
       you are running.  If you are running the C Shell, as most of you are,
       you type

            % setenv TERM type

       and with the Bourne Shell, you type

            $ TERM= type ; export TERM

       where type is the name of the kind of terminal you are using (e.g.,
       vt100).  If neither of these works get somebody to help you.

INVOKING JOVE
       If you run JOVE with no arguments you will be placed in an empty
       buffer, called Main.  Otherwise, any arguments you supply are
       considered file names and each is ``given'' its own buffer.  Only the
       first file is actually read in — reading other files is deferred until
       you actually try to use the buffers they are attached to.  This is for
       efficiency's sake: most of the time, when you run JOVE on a big list of
       files, you end up editing only a few of them.

       The names of all of the files specified on the command line are saved
       in a buffer, called *minibuf*.  The mini-buffer is a special JOVE
       buffer that is used when JOVE is prompting for some input to many
       commands (for example, when JOVE is prompting for a file name).  When
       you are being prompted for a file name, you can type ^N (that's
       Control-N) and ^P to cycle through the list of files that were
       specified on the command line.  The file name will be inserted where
       you are typing and then you can edit it as if you typed it in yourself.

       JOVE recognizes the following switches:

       -d_dirname
              dirname is taken to be the name of the current directory.  This
              is for systems that don't have a version of C shell that
              automatically maintains the CWD environment variable.  If -d is
              not specified on a system without a modified C shell, JOVE will
              have to figure out the current directory itself, and that can be
              slow.  You can simulate the modified C shell by putting the
              following lines in your C shell initialization file (.cshrc):

                   alias cd        'cd \!*; setenv CWD $cwd'
                   alias popd      'popd \!*; setenv CWD $cwd'
                   alias pushd     'pushd \!*; setenv CWD $cwd'

       -l_libdir
              Allows the user to specify the directory in which binary files
              required by JOVE can be found (default
              /wrkdirs/usr/ports/editors/jove/work/stage/usr/local/libexec/jove).

       -s_sharedir
              Allows the user to specify the directory in which initialization
              files required by JOVE can be found (default
              /wrkdirs/usr/ports/editors/jove/work/stage/usr/local/share/jove).

       -ls_bothdir
              Allows the user to specify the directory in which binary files
              and initialization files required by JOVE can be found.

       -J     Inhibits reading of the system-wide initialization file
              (/wrkdirs/usr/ports/editors/jove/work/stage/usr/local/share/jove/jove.rc).

       -j     Inhibits reading of the user's initialization file (~/.joverc).

       +n     Reads the file designated by the following argument, and
              positions point at the n'th line instead of the (default) first
              line.  This can be specified more than once but it doesn't make
              sense to use it twice on the same file; in that case the second
              one wins.  If no numeric argument is given after the +, the
              point is positioned at the end of the file.

       +/pattern
              Reads the file designated by the following argument, and
              positions point at the first match of the pattern.

       -p_file
              Parses the error messages in file.  The error messages are
              assumed to be in a format similar to the C compiler, LINT, or
              GREP output.

       -t_tag Runs the find-tag command on tag (see ctags(1)).

       -wn    Divides the window into n windows (if n is ommitted, it is taken
              to be 2).  Subsequent files in the list are read in and
              displayed in succeeding windows.

RECOVERING BUFFERS AFTER A CRASH
       The -r option of jove runs the JOVE recover program.  Use this when the
       system crashes, or JOVE crashes, or you accidently get logged out while
       in JOVE.  If there are any buffers to be recovered, this will find
       them.

       Recover looks for JOVE buffers that are left around and are owned by
       you.  (You cannot recover other peoples' buffers, obviously.)  If there
       were no buffers that were modified at the time of the crash or there
       were but recover can't get its hands on them, you will be informed with
       the message, ``There is nothing to recover.''  Otherwise, recover
       prints the date and time of the version of the buffers it has, and then
       waits for you type a command.

       To get a list of the buffers recover knows about, use the list command.
       This will list all the buffers and the files and the number of lines
       associated with them.  Next to each buffer is a number.  When you want
       to recover a buffer, use the get command.  The syntax is get buffer
       filename where buffer is either the buffer's name or the number at the
       beginning of the line.  If you don't type the buffer name or the
       filename, recover will prompt you for them.

       If there are a lot of buffers and you want to recover all of them, use
       the recover command.  This will recover each buffer to the name of the
       buffer with ``.#'' prepended to the name (so that the original isn't
       over-written).  It asks for each file and if you want to restore that
       buffer to that name you type ``yes''.  If you want to recover the file
       but to a different name, just type the new name in.  If you type ``no''
       recover will skip that file and go on to the next one.

       If you want to look at a buffer before deciding to recover it, use the
       print command.  The syntax for this is print buffer where buffer again
       is either its name or the number.  You can type ^C if you want to abort
       printing the file to the terminal, and recover will respond with an
       appropriate message.

       When you're done and have all the buffers you want, type the quit
       command to leave.  You will then be asked whether it's okay to delete
       the tmp files.  Most of the time that's okay and you should type
       ``yes''.  When you say that, JOVE removes all traces of those buffers
       and you won't be able to look at them again.  (If you recovered some
       buffers they will still be around, so don't worry.)  So, if you're not
       sure whether you've gotten all the buffers, you should answer ``no'' so
       that you'll be able to run recover again at a later time (presumably
       after you've figured out which ones you want to save).  If there were
       more than one crashed JOVE session, quit will move you on to dealing
       with the next one instead of exiting.

       If you type ^C at any time other than when you're printing a file to
       the terminal, recover will exit without a word.  If you do this but
       wish you hadn't, just type ``jove -r'' to the shell again, and you will
       be put back with no loss.

GETTING HELP
       Once in JOVE, there are several commands available to get help.  To
       execute any JOVE command, you type ``<ESC> X command-name'' followed by
       <Return>.  To get a list of all the JOVE commands you type ``<ESC> X''
       followed by ``?''.  The describe-bindings command can be used to get a
       list containing each key, and its associated command (that is, the
       command that gets executed when you type that key).  If you want to
       save the list of bindings, you can set the jove variable
       send-typeout-to-buffer to ON (using the set command), and then execute
       the describe-bindings command.  This will create a buffer and put in it
       the bindings list it normally would have printed on the screen.  Then
       you can save that buffer to a file and print it to use as a quick
       reference card.  (See VARIABLES below.)

       Once you know the name of a command, you can find out what it does with
       the describe-command command, which you can invoke quickly by typing
       ``ESC ?''.  The apropos command will give you a list of all the command
       with a specific string in their names.  For example, if you want to
       know the names of all the commands that are concerned with windows, you
       can run ``apropos'' with the keyword window.

       If the initialization file has provided specific keybindings for your
       terminal, it should also be possible to view the keyboard layout with
       the keychart macro.

       If you're not familar with the EMACS command set, it would be worth
       your while to use run TEACHJOVE.  Do do that, just type ``teachjove''
       to your shell and you will be placed in JOVE in a file which contains
       directions.  I highly recommend this for beginners; you may save
       yourself a lot of time and headaches.

KEY BINDINGS and VARIABLES
       You can alter the key bindings in JOVE to fit your personal tastes.
       That is, you can change what a key does every time you strike it.  For
       example, by default the ^N key is bound to the command next-line and so
       when you type it you move down a line.  If you want to change a binding
       or add a new one, you use the bind-to-key command.  The syntax is
       ``bind-to-key <command> key''.

       You can also change the way JOVE behaves in little ways by changing the
       value of some variables with the set command.  The syntax is ``set
       <variable> value'', where value is a number or a string, or ``on'' or
       ``off'', depending on the context.  For example, if you want JOVE to
       make backup files, you set the ``make-backup-files'' variable to
       ``on''.  To see the value of a variable, use the ``print <variable>''
       command.

INITIALIZATION
       JOVE first reads the system-wide initialization file
       (/wrkdirs/usr/ports/editors/jove/work/stage/usr/local/share/jove/jove.rc)
       which provides reasonable defaults for your installation and loads
       standard macros.  It will normally observe your TERM environment
       variable in order to provide terminal-specific key bindings and a map
       of your keyboard (see the standard ``keychart'' macro).

       JOVE then automatically reads further commands from the initialization
       file called ``.joverc'' (``jove.rc'' under MSDOS) in your HOME
       directory.  In this file you can place commands that you would normally
       type in JOVE.  If you like to rearrange the key bindings and set some
       variables every time you get into JOVE, you should put them in your
       initialization file.  Here are a few lines from mine:
            set match-regular-expressions on
            1 auto-execute-command auto-fill /tmp/Re\|.*drft
            bind-to-key i-search-forward ^\
            bind-to-key i-search-reverse ^R
            bind-to-key find-tag-at-point ^[^T
            bind-to-key scroll-down ^C
            bind-to-key grow-window ^Xg
            bind-to-key shrink-window ^Xs
       (Note that the Control Characters can be either two character sequences
       (e.g. ^ and C together as ^C) or the actual control character.  If you
       want to use an ^ by itself you must BackSlash it (e.g., bind-to-key
       grow-window ^X\^ binds grow-window to ``^X^'').

ENVIRONMENT
       If the variable LC_CTYPE (see environ(5)) is not set in the
       environment, the operational behavior of JOVE for the LC_CTYPE locale
       category is determined by the value of the LANG environment variable.
       If LC_ALL is set, its contents are used to override both the LANG and
       the LC_CTYPE variable.  If none of the above variables is set in the
       environment, the "C" (U.S. style) locale determines how JOVE behaves.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determines how JOVE handles characters. When LC_CTYPE is set to
              a valid value, JOVE can display and handle text and filenames
              containing valid characters for that locale. In particular,
              characters will be correctly recognised as upper or lower case
              and displayed if printable.  However JOVE cannot display or
              handle Extended Unix Code (EUC) characters which are more than 1
              byte wide.  In the "C" locale, only characters from 7-bit ASCII
              are valid (all characters with the eighth bit set being
              displayed in octal). In the "iso_8859_1" locale (if supported by
              the OS), the full Latin-1 alphabet is available. The JOVE
              variable ``lc-ctype'' can be used to change the locale while
              JOVE is running.

SOME MINOR DETAILS
       You should type ^\ instead of ^S in many instances.  For example, the
       way to search for a string is documented as being ``^S'' but in reality
       you should type ``^\''.  This is because ^S is the XOFF character (what
       gets sent when you type the NO SCROLL key), and clearly that won't
       work.  The XON character is ``^Q'' (what gets sent when you type NO
       SCROLL again) which is documented as the way to do a quoted-insert.
       The alternate key for this is ``^^'' (typed as ``^`'' on vt100's and
       its look-alikes).  If you want to enable ^S and ^Q and you know what
       you are doing, you can put the line:
            set allow-^S-and-^Q on
       in your initialization file.

       If your terminal has a metakey and you turn on the ``meta-key''
       variable, JOVE will use it to generate commands which would otherwise
       start with an ESC.  JOVE will automatically turn on ``meta-key'' if the
       METAKEY environment variable exists.  This is useful for if you have
       different terminals (e.g., one at home and one at work) and one has a
       metakey and the other doesn't.  However, if a locale which recognises
       8-bit characters is in force, a metakey may be better used to generate
       the extra characters (so leave the ``meta-key'' variable off).
