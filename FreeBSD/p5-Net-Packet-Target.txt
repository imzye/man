Net::Packet::Target(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::Packet::Target - an object for all network related stuff

SYNOPSIS
          use Net::Packet::Target;

          # Create multiple targets, with multiple port
          my $t1 = Net::Packet::Target->new;
          $t1->ip('www.google.com');
          $t1->portRange('21,22,25,70-90');
          $t1->protocol('tcp');

          print $t1->isMultiple."\n";

          for my $port ($t1->portList) {
             print $t1->ip.' do stuff for port '.$port."\n";
          }

          # Create multiple targets, with only one port
          my $t2 = Net::Packet::Target->new;
          $t2->ipRange('127.0.0.1-10');
          $t2->port(22);
          $t2->protocol('tcp');

          print $t2->isMultiple."\n";

          for my $ip ($t2->ipList) {
             print $t2->port.'/'.$t2->protocol.' do stuff for IPv4 '.$ip."\n";
          }

          # Create a single target
          my $t3 = Net::Packet::Target->new;
          $t3->ip('127.0.0.1');
          $t3->port(22);
          $t3->protocol('tcp');

          print $t3->isMultiple."\n";

          print $t3->port.':'.$t3->protocol.' do stuff for IPv4 '.$t3->ip."\n";

DESCRIPTION
       A Net::Packet::Target object can be used to describe one target, or
       multiple targets. They are mainly used when you use some automated
       tasks you which to use on a range of IPs/ports.

       To describe multiple targets, you simply enter an IP range, or a port
       range, or the two. To describe a single target, you enter one IP
       address, and one port. You can also avoid totally ports, or avoid
       totally IPs, you do what you want.

       It also handles IP name resolution for IPv4 and IPv6, if available.

ATTRIBUTES
       mac [ (scalar) ]
       port [ (scalar) ]
       protocol [ (scalar) ]
       hostname [ (scalar) ]
           These 4 attributes store respectively the target mac address, port,
           protocol to use for port, and the hostname.

       ipList [ (arrayref) ]
       portList [ (arrayref) ]
           These 3 attributes store respectively an IPv4 address list, an IPv6
           address list, and a port list. All this as array references. When
           called without parameter, they return an array.

METHODS
       new Object constructor. There are no default values, due to the nature
           of this object.

       isMultiple
           Because a Net::Packet::Target object can be used to describe one
           target, or multiple ones, we must have a way to know that. This
           method is used to answer the question. Returns 1 if the object is
           composed of either multiple IPs, or multiple ports, 0 otherwise.

       ip [ (scalar) ]
           Will take as a parameter an IPv4 address, or a hostname. Without
           argument, returns the stored value.

       ip6 [ (scalar) ]
           Same as previous, for IPv6.

       ipRange [ (scalar) ]
           Will take as a parameter an IPv4 address range. The format is for
           example: 127.0.0.1-254, or 127.0-10.1.50-70. It will store the
           result in ipList attribute, to be easily used in a for loop.

       portRange [ (scalar) ]
           Same as previous, but for port ranges. The format is for example:
           1-1024, 500-600,100-110. It will store the result in portList
           attribute, to be easily used ina for loop.
