POE::XS::Loop::Poll(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       POE::XS::Loop::Poll - an XS implementation of POE::Loop, using poll(2).

SYNOPSIS
         use POE::Kernel { loop => 'POE::XS::Loop::Poll' };

DESCRIPTION
       This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Loop interface
       written in C using the poll(2) system call.

       Signals are left to POE::Loop::PerlSignals.

SEE ALSO
       POE, POE::Kernel, POE::Loop.

BUGS
       Relies upon small fd numbers, but then a lot of code does.

       Will fail badly if your code uses POE from more than one Perl thread.

       poll() on OS X doesn't support ptys, hence POE::XS::Loop::Poll won't
       work with ptys on OS X.

       If you see an error:

         POE::XS::Loop::Poll hasn't been initialized correctly

       then the loop hasn't been loaded correctly, in POE <= 1.287 the
       following:

         # this doesn't work
         use POE qw(XS::Loop::Poll);

       will not load the loop correctly, you will need to do:

         use POE::Kernel { loop => 'POE::XS::Loop::Poll' };
         use POE;
