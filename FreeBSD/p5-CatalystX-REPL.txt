NAME
       CatalystX::REPL - read-eval-print-loop for debugging your Catalyst
       application

VERSION
       version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
           package MyApp;

           use Moose;

           # Requires Catalyst 5.8 series
           extends 'Catalyst';
           with 'CatalystX::REPL';

           __PACKAGE__->setup(qw/-Debug/);

           1;

DESCRIPTION
       Using Carp::REPL with a Catalyst application is hard. That's because of
       all the internal exceptions that are being thrown and caught by
       Catalyst during application startup. You'd have to manually skip over
       all of those.

       This role works around that by automatically setting up Carp::REPL
       after starting your application, if the "CATALYST_REPL" or "MYAPP_REPL"
       environment variables are set:

        MYAPP_REPL=1 ./script/myapp_server.pl
        # Hit an action
        ...

        42 at lib/MyApp/Controller/Foo.pm line 8.

        # instead of exiting, you get a REPL!
        Trace begun at lib/MyApp/Controller/Foo.pm line 8
        MyApp::Controller::Foo::bar('MyApp::Controller::Foo=HASH(0xc9fe20)', 'MyApp=HASH(0xcea6a4)') called at ...
        ... # Many more lines of stack trace

        $ $c
        MyApp=HASH(0xcea6ec)
        $ $c->req->uri
        http://localhost/foo/bar
        $

       Options like "warn" or "nodie" can be passed to Carp::REPL by putting
       them, seperated by commas, into the environment variable:

        MYAPP_REPL=warn,nodie ./script/myapp_server.pl

       Carp::REPL uses Devel::REPL for the shell, so direct any questions how
       how to use or customize the repl at that module.
