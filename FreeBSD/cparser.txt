DESCRIPTION
     cparser is a C compiler, which can parse C90 and C99 as well as many GCC
     and some MSC extensions.  It also provides many useful analyses for
     warnings and generates concise messages in case of error.  It uses
     libFIRM for optimization and code generation.  The compiler driver is
     largely compatible with GCC.

OPTIONS
     -c      Compile the input files to object files.  The default output
             filename is the input filename with the extension replaced by .o.

     -S      Compile the input files to assembler.  The default output
             filename is the input filename with the extension replaced by .s.

     -E      Preprocess the input file only.  By default the result is output
             to stdout.

     --print-ast
             Output the abstract syntax tree of the parsed input file as C
             again.

     --print-implicit-cast
             When using --print-ast, show casts, which are inserted by the
             semantic checks.

     --print-parenthesis
             When using --print-ast, show all expressions fully parenthesized.

     -ansi   Same as -std=c90 (for C) or -std=c++98 (for C++).

     -std=standard
             Select the language standard.  Supported values are:
             c89
             c90
             iso9899:1990  ISO C90
             gnu89         ISO C90 with GCC extensions
             c99
             iso9899:1999  ISO C99
             gnu99         ISO C99 with GCC extensions
             c11
             iso9899:2011  ISO C11
             gnu11         ISO C11 with GCC extensions
             c++98         ISO C++ 1998.  Not supported yet.
             gnu++98       ISO C++ 1998 with GCC extensions.  Not supported
                           yet.

     --[no-]gcc
             Disable/enable GCC extensions.  This switch supersedes -std.

     --[no-]ms
             Disable/enable MSC extensions.

     -g      When compiling C files, add debug information in stabs format.

     -Olevel
             Select the optimization level.  Sensible values are between 0 and
             4, inclusive.

     -Wwarning
             Enable the specified warning.

     -Wno-warning
             Disable the specified warning.

     -Werror=warning
             Enable the specified warning and turn it into an error.

     -Wno-error=warning
             Force the specified warning to only be a warning, even in the
             presence of -Werror.  This neither enables nor disables the
             warning itself.

     -Waddress
             Warn about suspicious use of addresses, like using the address of
             a function or variable as boolean condition or comparing with the
             address of a string literal.

     -Waggregate-return
             Warn about defining or calling a function, which returns a struct
             or union by value.

     -Wall   Activate most warnings.  In particular these are -Waddress,
             -Wattribute, -Wchar-subscripts, -Wcomment, -Wempty-statement,
             -Wformat, -Wimplicit-function-declaration, -Wimplicit-int,
             -Winit-self, -Wmain, -Wnonnull, -Wparentheses, -Wpointer-arith,
             -Wredundant-decls, -Wreturn-type, -Wshadow-local, -Wsign-compare,
             -Wstrict-prototypes, -Wswitch-enum, -Wunknown-pragmas,
             -Wunreachable-code, -Wunused-function, -Wunused-label,
             -Wunused-parameter, -Wunused-value, -Wunused-variable.

     -Wcast-qual
             Warn whenever a pointer cast removes qualifiers from the pointed-
             to type, e.g. casting a const char* to char*.

     -Wchar-subscripts
             Warn about using an expression of type char as array subscript,
             e.g. char c; arr[c].

     -Wdeclaration-after-statement
             Warn about mixing declarations and statements, which is not
             allowed prior to C99.

     -Wdiv-by-zero
             Warn about compile-time integer division by zero.

     -Wempty-statement
             Warn about empty statements, i.e. statements which only consist
             of a single ‘;’.  Use {} as replacement to avoid this warning.

     -Werror
             Treat warnings as errors, i.e. do not continue after parsing when
             a warning is encountered.

     -Wextra
             (Alias -W) Activate some more warnings.  In particular these are
             -Wempty-statement, -Wshadow, -Wunused-parameter, -Wunused-value.

     -Wfatal-errors
             Immediately abort compilation when encountering an error.

     -Wformat
             Check format strings of char and wchar_t functions.

     -Wimplicit
             Activate -Wimplicit-function-declaration, -Wimplicit-int.

     -Wimplicit-function-declaration
             Warn about calling a function without a prior declaration.

     -Wimplicit-int
             Warn about declarations whose declaration specifiers do not
             include a type specifier.

     -Winit-self
             Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with
             themselves.

     -Wlong-long
             Warn if the type ‘long long’ is used.

     -Wmain  Warn if the type of ‘main’ is suspicious, i.e. if it is not a
             non-static function declared as either int main(void),
             int main(int, char**) or, as an extension,
             int main(int, char**, char**).

     -Wmissing-declarations
             Warn if a non-static function or a global variable without a
             storage class is defined without a prior declaration.  This is
             typically a sign of a missing #include or that the object should
             be static.

     -Wmissing-noreturn
             Warn about functions, which are candidates for the attribute
             ‘noreturn’.

     -Wmissing-prototypes
             Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
             declaration.

     -Wmultichar
             Warn if a multicharacter constant (‘FOOF’) is used.

     -Wnested-externs
             Warn if an ‘extern’ declaration is encountered within a function.

     -Wparentheses
             Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts.  Warn if an
             assignment is used as condition, e.g. if (x = 23).  Warn if &&
             without parentheses is used within ||, e.g. if (x || y && z).
             Warn if it there may be confusion which ‘if’-statement an
             ‘else’-branch belongs to, e.g. if (x) if (y) {} else {}.  Warn if
             cascaded comparisons appear which do not have their mathematical
             meaning, e.g. if (23 <= x < 42).  Warn if + or - is used as
             operand of << or >>, e.g. x + y << z.

     -Wredundant-decls
             Warn about redundant declarations, i.e. multiple declarations of
             the same object or static forward declarations which have no use
             before their definition.

     -Wshadow
             Warn when a new declaration shadows another declaration with the
             same name in an outer scope.

     -Wshadow-local
             Like -Wshadow, but only warn if the shadowed declaration is not
             global, e.g. a local variable shadows a parameter or another
             local variable.

     -Wunreachable-code
             Warn when the compiler determines that a statement (or in some
             cases a part thereof) will never be executed.

     -Wunused
             Activate -Wunused-function, -Wunused-label, -Wunused-parameter,
             -Wunused-value, -Wunused-variable.

     -Wunused-parameter
             Warn when a parameter is never used or only ever read to
             calculate its own new value, e.g. x = x + 1.

     -Wunused-variable
             Warn when a variable is never used or only ever read to calculate
             its own new value, e.g. x = x + 1.

     -w      Suppress all warnings.

     -I dir  Add the directory dir to the paths to be searched for include
             files.

     -L dir  Add the directory dir to the paths to be searched for libraries.

     -Dmacro
             Define the preprocessor macro macro which will expand to 1.

     -Dmacro=defn
             Define the preprocessor macro macro and set its expanded value to
             defn.

     -Umacro
             Undefine the preprocessor macro macro.

     -f option
             Set a frontend or optimizer option.  Use -fhelp to get a list of
             supported optimizer options.

     -f[no-]diagnostics-show-option
             Show the switch, which controls a warning, after each warning.
             Default is on.

     -finput-charset=encoding
             Select the encoding of the input.  Supported values are
             ISO_8859-1:1987 (aliases CP819, IBM819, ISO-8859-1, ISO8859-1,
             ISO_8859-1, csISOLatin1, iso-ir-100, l1 and latin1), ISO-8859-15
             (aliases ISO8859-15, ISO_8859-15 and Latin-9), windows-1252
             (alias cp1252) and UTF-8 (default).  Case is ignored.

     -f[no-]show-column
             Show the column number in diagnostic messages.

     -fsigned-char
             Define ‘char’ to have the same range, representation and
             behaviour as ‘signed char’.

     -funsigned-char
             Define ‘char’ to have the same range, representation and
             behaviour as ‘unsigned char’.

     -b option

             options.

     -l library
             Link with the specified library.

     -o outfile
             Specify the output filename.  This is only valid when using a
             single input filename.  - as filename uses stdout for output.

     -x language
             Overwrite the language auto-detection for the following filenames
             by the specified language.  Supported values are:
             assembler           Assembler file

BUGS
     Probably many - if you hit one, please report it.

     cparser needs to support more switches for better GCC compatibility.
