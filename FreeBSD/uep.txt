UEP(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 UEP(4)

NAME
     uep – eGalax touchscreen driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
     your kernel configuration file:

           device uep
           device usb

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           uep_load="YES"

     To compile this driver with evdev support enabled, place the following
     lines into the kernel configuration file:

           options EVDEV_SUPPORT
           device evdev

DESCRIPTION
     The uep driver provides support for the eGalax onscreen touch panels.

     The driver is a stub.  It just probes and attaches to USB device, creates
     a device entry and feeds reassembled packets from the hardware to it.
     Depending on compile-time kernel options it supports either native or
     evdev operation modes.

     To get the mouse working in X(7) in native mode, install
     ports/x11-drivers/xf86-input-egalax.

     To get the mouse working in X(7) in evdev mode, install
     ports/x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev.

FILES
     uep creates a blocking pseudo-device file, /dev/uep0 in native mode or
     /dev/input/eventN in evdev mode.

AUTHORS
     The uep driver was written by Gleb Smirnoff <glebius@FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS
     uep cannot act like sysmouse(4), as sysmouse(4) does not support absolute
     motion events.
