rlpq(1)                      UNIX Reference Manual                     rlpq(1)

NAME
       rlpq - remote line printer queue examination program

SYNOPSIS
       rlpq [-lmqNV] [-Hprinthost] [-Pprinter] [-Xproxyhost] [--debug]
       [--timeout=seconds] [--port=port] [ job # ... ] [ username ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       rlpq uses TCP/IP to examine print queues for printers anywhere on a
       network.  Unlike lpq, it does not require that the remote printers be
       explicitly known to the local system (traditionally through
       /etc/printcap), and thus is considerably more flexible and requires
       less administration.

       rlpq can be used anywhere a traditional lpq might be used, and is
       backwards compatible with traditional BSD lpq.  If rlpq is invoked as
       lpq, it preserves all known lpq semantics.

       rlpq can be set up, installed, and used in the same two ways as rlpr(1)
       (that is, either with or without the rlprd(8) proxy daemon).  Please
       see rlpr(1) for details, and to see whether you will need to use the
       rlprd(8) proxy daemon or not.

OPTIONS
   Environment/Setup
       --debug
              Print gobs of debugging information.

       -N, --no-bind
              Don't try to bind to privileged port before connecting to lpd.
              Please see the CONFIGURING A PROXY section in rlpr(1) for
              information on use of this option.

       --port=number
              Select an alternate port (instead of 7290) to connect to, if
              using rlprd.  Usually not needed.

       -H, --printhost=host
              Select the host to print to (used with -P).

              Instead of using -H, one can specify the hostname directly
              including it with the printer name with the printer@hostname
              syntax.

       -P, --printer=printername, --queue=printername
              Select the printer to print to (used with -H).

       -X, --proxy=proxyhost, --proxyhost=proxyhost
              Select the proxy host to use, if necessary.

       --timeout=seconds
              Set the inactivity timer.  If the connection hangs for more than
              seconds seconds, then rlpq will give up.  Use the special value
              `-1' to wait forever.  Default timeout is 3 seconds.

       -V, --version
              Print version and exit.

   Behavior
       -l, --long
              Produce a more detailed report.

       -m, --mine
              List only the jobs belonging to you.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Quiet mode - stay quiet (except for fatal errors).  When this
              flag is set, rlpq's return value indicates whether there are any
              items in the specified queue that meet the specified criteria (a
              return value of zero indicates success).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables are used by rlpq:

       RLPR_PRINTHOST
              Specifies the default host's queue to examine.

       PRINTER or LPDEST
              Specifies the default printer to check on the host.
              First PRINTER is consulted, then LPDEST.

              Note that one can also specify the host to examine by setting
              printer to be printer@hostname.  This may be more convenient
              than setting RLPR_PRINTHOST, but will confuse the traditional
              BSD print commands.

       RLPR_PROXYHOST
              Specifies a proxy host to use, if necessary.

FILES
       ~/.rlprrc         Personal printer/host database
       /etc/hosts.lpd    Host-based security on printhost
       /etc/hosts.equiv  Host-based security on printhost
       /etc/passwd       Personal identification
       /usr/local/etc/rlprrcSystem-wide printer/host database

BUGS / LIMITATIONS
       Due to the dynamic nature of print queues, it is possible that the
       actual state of the queue may have changed between the time the
       snapshot was generated and the output was produced.
