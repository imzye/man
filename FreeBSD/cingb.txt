CINGB(6)                     FreeBSD Games Manual                     CINGB(6)

NAME
     cingb – A Gameboy(tm) emulator.

SYNOPSIS
     cingb [-dnoh] [-f sound-frequency] [-c server] [-a action-replay-code]
           ROM-image

DESCRIPTION
     cingb is a free Gameboy(tm) emulator for several operating systems.

OPTIONS
     The following command line arguments are supported:

     ROM-image
             A file containing a Gameboy(tm) game.

     -d      Double-size display mode.

     -n      Switch off the sound.

     -o      Use old black&white Gameboy mode. Some games might run with fewer
             problems, if using this switch.

     -h      Start in server mode. You can use this, if you want to use the
             Dialog-Link emulation. Look also at -c how to connect to a
             Gameboy emulator in server mode.

     -f sound-frequency
             Change the sound frequency to the specified value (8000-44100).

     -c server
             Use Dialog-Link emulation to connect to one other cingb on host
             server which was run using the -h switch.

     -a action-replay-code
             Alter the memory with the given action-replay-code. This is only
             experimental. I haven't really found out the system how these
             codes are mapped to the cartridge memory.

BUGS
     You should be always careful what you are running, of course.  cingb has
     not been built to be secure.  You can always complain about
     incompatibilities on my project site
