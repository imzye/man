TIMES(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual               TIMES(3)

NAME
     times – process times

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/times.h>

     clock_t
     times(struct tms *tp);

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by getrusage(2) and gettimeofday(2).

     The times() function returns the value of time in CLK_TCK's of a second
     since the system startup time.  The current value of CLK_TCK, the
     frequency of the statistics clock in ticks per second, may be obtained
     through the sysconf(3) interface.

     It also fills in the structure pointed to by tp with time-accounting
     information.

     The tms structure is defined as follows:

           struct tms {
                   clock_t tms_utime;
                   clock_t tms_stime;
                   clock_t tms_cutime;
                   clock_t tms_cstime;
           };

     The elements of this structure are defined as follows:

     tms_utime       The CPU time charged for the execution of user
                     instructions.

     tms_stime       The CPU time charged for execution by the system on
                     behalf of the process.

     tms_cutime      The sum of the tms_utimes and tms_cutimes of the child
                     processes.

     tms_cstime      The sum of the tms_stimes and tms_cstimes of the child
                     processes.

     All times are in CLK_TCK's of a second.

     The times of a terminated child process are included in the tms_cutime
     and tms_cstime elements of the parent when one of the wait(2) functions
     returns the process ID of the terminated child to the parent.  If an
     error occurs, times() returns the value ((clock_t)-1), and sets errno to
     indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The times() function may fail and set the global variable errno for any
     of the errors specified for the library routines getrusage(2) and
     gettimeofday(2).

SEE ALSO
     time(1), getrusage(2), gettimeofday(2), wait(2), sysconf(3), clocks(7)

STANDARDS
     The times() function conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (“POSIX.1”).
