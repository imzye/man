FLASHER(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             FLASHER(1)

NAME
       flasher -   flash keyboard LEDs to indicate file writes

SYNOPSIS
       flasher [ -u seconds ] [ -k /dev/ttyXX ] -{c|n|s} file1:file2:...:fileN

DESCRIPTION
       flasher monitors changes to one or more files, and indicates the number
       of writes to these files by briefly flashing a console LED once for
       each write.  The flashing sequence is repeated, after a brief pause,
       until the files have been read.  As the files are subsequently read,
       the number of LED flashes is reduced.  When all monitored files have
       been read, the console LED will be disabled.

       The most obvious use is to monitor specific system log or mail files.

       Multiple LEDs can be used. Each possible LED (-c, -n or -s) takes a
       list of colon-separated file arguments.  For example, when invoked as:

              # flasher -s /var/log/messages:/var/mail/root

       the Scroll Lock LED will flash once for each write made to either of
       these files, until the files are read.  When /var/log/messages has been
       read, the Scroll Lock LED will continue to flash once for each write
       that has been made to /var/mail/root, until it also has been read.

       The list of files can include files that don't yet exist.

       To terminate the daemon, run:

              # kill `cat /var/run/flasher.pid`

X11
       flasher was designed to use the console to indicate file activity.
       When running flasher in an X11 environment, it may be helpful to use
       the -k option to specify what virtual terminal X11 is running under.
       For example, use

              # flasher -k /dev/ttyv3 ...

       when running X11 on FreeBSD on virtual terminal 4.

       Similarly, when using X11 on virtual terminal 8 on Linux, start the
       daemon using:

              # flasher -k /dev/tty8 ...

OPTIONS
       -c     Indicate writes to the specified file using the Caps Lock LED.

       -k /dev/ttyXX
              Use the specified tty (/dev/ttyXX) instead of the console.

       -n     Indicate writes to the specified file using the Num Lock LED.

       -s     Indicate writes to the specified file using the Scroll Lock LED.

       -u number
              Scans the specified files for changes every `number' seconds
              (default: 60).

EXAMPLES
       The following example will flash the Scroll Lock LED to indicate
       /var/log/messages writes, and the Num Lock LED for writes to
       /var/mail/root:

              # flasher -s /var/log/messages -n /var/mail/root

       The following example will flash the Caps Lock LED to indicate writes
       to either /var/log/httpd-error.log or /var/mail/root, and flash the Num
       Lock LED to indicate writes to /var/log/messages.

              # flasher -n /var/log/messages -c /var/log/httpd-
              error.log:/var/mail/root

FILES
       /var/run/flasher.pid - flasher lock file

DIAGNOSTICS
       flasher must be run as the super-user.

       Relative pathnames will be converted to absolute pathnames.

       After the program has daemonized, any messages will be sent to syslog.
