Test::Able::Runner(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Test::Able::Runner - use Test::Able without a bunch of boilerplate

VERSION
       version 1.002

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::Able::Runner;

         use_test_packages
             -base_package => 'My::Project::Test';

         run;

DESCRIPTION
       I like Test::Able. I really don't like having to copy my boilerplate
       test runner and modify it when I use it in a new project. This provides
       a basic test runner for your testable tests that takes care of the
       basics for you. You can extend it a bit to customize things if you like
       as well. Let me know if you want this to do something else.

       This mostly assumes that you want to run several tests as a group
       within a single Perl interpreter. If this is not what you want, then
       you probably don't want this module.

METHODS
   use_test_packages
       The first thing your test runner needs to do is call this method to
       tell it what packages need to be included in your test.

   COMMON CASES
       Before describing the options, here are some examples of how to use
       this subroutine.

       EXAMPLE 1

         use_test_packages
             -base_package => 'My::Project::Test',
             -test_path    => 't/lib';

       This is pretty much the simplest case. This will load and run all the
       packages starting with the name "My::Project::Test" found in the
       project's t/lib directory. I show the "-test_path" option here, but in
       this case it's redundant. Your test path is assumed to be t/lib in the
       usual case.

       EXAMPLE 2

         use_test_packages
             -test_packages => [ qw(
                 My::Project::Test::One
                 My::Project::Test::Two
                 My::Project::Test::Three
             ) ];

       Rather than searching for any test packages you might have in your test
       folder, you might prefer to explicitly list them.

       OPTIONS

       "-base_package"
           This is the package namespace to search for classes within. Any
           class found under this namespace (within any directory included in
           "-test_path") will be run in your tests. If you want to include
           classes under this base package namespace that are not tests (test
           roles or base classes or whatever), you may place a global package
           variable within the package named $NOT_A_TEST and set it to a true
           value:

             package My::Project::Test::Base;
             use Test::Able;

             our $NOT_A_TEST = 1;

           You may use this option or the "-test_packages" option. This may be
           a single scalar package name

       "-test_packages"
           This is the list of test packages to load and run. It is always
           given as an array of package names.

       "-test_path"
           This is the search path for test classes. This lists additional
           paths that should be added to @INC to search for tests before
           loading the tests. These paths are added to the front of @INC.

           It can be given as a single scalar or as an array of paths:

             use_test_packages
                 -base_package => 'My::Project::Test',
                 -test_path    => [ 't/online', 't/offline' ];

   init_meta
       Sets up your test runner package.

   run
       This invokes the test runner for all the tests you've requested.

COOKBOOK
       Here are some other things you might like to try.

   Test Runner Tests
       The test runner itself may have tests if you want. The test runner
       classes uses the usual Test::Able bits, so this works. Similarly, you
       can do setup, teardown, and all the rest in your runner.

         use Test::Able::Runner;

         use_test_packages
             -base_package => 'Foo::Test';

         test plan => 1, test_something => sub {
             ok(1);
         };

         run;
