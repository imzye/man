NAME
       Text::Bind - Bind Perl structures to text files

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Bind;

           # Create a new object
           $text = new Text::Bind;                     # or
           $text = new Text::Bind "page.html"          # or
           $text = new Text::Bind \*IN;

           # Bind a string value to a data site
           $text->bind_site("astring", "Hello World!");

           # Bind a function to a data site
           $text->bind_site("form", \&generate_form);

           # Bind a filehandle to a data site
           $text->bind_site("filehandle", \*FILE);

           # Bind an object to a data site
           $some_object = new SomeClass;
           $text->bind_site("object", $some_object);

           # Read text
           $text->read_text(\*OUT, "page.html");       # or
           $text->read_text(\*OUT, \*IN);              # or
           $text->read_text(\*OUT);                    # or
           $text->read_text;

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Bind allows you to bind Perl structures (strings, routines,
       filehandles, objects) to specific locations (called data sites) in text
       files.

       The main purpose of this module is to support HTML templates for CGI
       programs.  Therefore, HTML pages design can be kept separate from CGI
       code.  However, the class is general enough to be used in other
       contexts than CGI application development.  For example, it could be
       used to do form letters.

       To create a new object, do one of the following:

           $text = new Text::Bind;
           $text = new Text::Bind $filename;
           $text = new Text::Bind \*FILE;

       If no argument is given during object instantiation, then the input
       must be specified during the read_text method.  Otherwise, a filename
       or a filehandle can be listed to specify the input source of the text
       data.

       To have the data processed, use the read_text method in one of the
       following ways:

           $text->read_text;
           $text->read_text(\*OUT);
           $text->read_text(\*OUT, $filename);
           $text->read_text(\*OUT, \*FILE);

       When called with no arguments, input is read from what is specified
       during object instantiation, and output goes to STDOUT.  If arguments
       are specified, the first argument is the output filehandle.  If
       undefined, STDOUT is used.  The second argument is the filename or the
       filehandle of the input.  If not defined, input is read from what is
       specified during object instantiation.

       The syntax for specifying data sites in the input and how to bind Perl
       structures to those sites is covered in the following sections.

Data Site Syntax
       To define a data site, the syntax is as follows:

           ##PL_name=value##

       where the components mean the following:

       "##PL_"
           Start of a data site.

       name
           Type name of the site, possible values:

           "site"
               Specifies a labeled data site where the data for the site
               determined thru the bind_site method.

           "file"
               Specifies the name of file that defines the contents of the
               data site.  Works in a similiar manner as HTTP server-side file
               include directive.  If a trailing pipe is included in the
               value, then the value is treated as program to invoke, and the
               output of the program is used to fill the site.

           "beginloop"
               The start of a repeatable loop.  Text following, and up to the
               end-of-loop data site, is treated as a repeatable segment.  See
               "Data Site Loops" for more information.

           "endloop"
               The end point of a repeatable loop.  See "Data Site Loops" for
               more information.

           The name is case insensitive.

       "=" Separator of name and value.

       value
           String value associated with name.  Value is case sensitive.

       "##"
           End of data site.

       Data sites that do not have a binding during processing of text input
       are expanded to the empty string.

       Duplicate sites can occur.  The binding will be reexecuted each time
       the site occurs.

   Example data sites
       A data site for an HTML form:

           <html>
           <body>
           ##PL_site=inputform##
           </body>
           </html>

       The call to bind_site may look like:

           $text->bind_site("inputform", \&create_form)

       The following shows how a file can bound to a site:

           <html>
           <body>
           ...
           <hr>
           ##PL_file=copyright.html##
           </body>
           </html>

       The contents of "copyright.html" will replace the site definition.

       The following shows how the output of a program can be included:

           ##PL_file=/bin/ls -l |##

Data Site Bindings via bind_site Method
       The bind_site method takes 2 arguments, the name of the site to bind to
       and a value to define the value of the site during the read_text
       method.  Example:

           $text->bind_site($name, $bind);

       The $name of the data site corresponds to the value of a
       ##PL_site=value## data site.

       The bind value can be one of the following Perl data structures:

       scalar string
           The data site is replaced with the value of the scalar string.

       function
           A reference to a function.  The function is invoked as follows:

               &func($textobj, $outfh, $site_name);

           Where, $textobj is the Text::Bind object.  $outfh is the output
           filehandle.  The function uses $outfh to output the data that
           should go in the location of the data site.  For example:

               print $outfh "... data here ...";

           $site_name is the name of the site the function is being called
           for.

           Since the Text::Bind object is passed to the function, the function
           can change bindings.  Any changes will affect any data sites
           following the site being processed.

           Additional arguments can be passed to the bind_site method when
           binding a function.  For example:

               $text->bind_site($site_name, \&func, $arg1, $arg2);

           A copy of those arguments will be passed as extra arguments when
           the function is invoked.  Continuing with the previous example, the
           function would be called as follows:

               &func($page_obj, $outfh, $site_name, $arg1, $arg2);

           Since the function may only exist for the purpose of filling the
           contents of a site, an anonymous function can be passed instead of
           a named function.  For example:

               $text->bind_site($site_name, sub {
                   my($txtobj, $fh, $site) = @_;

                   ## ... code here ...
               });

           Note, the return value of the function is used within in data site
           loops.  See "Data Site Loops" for more information.

       filehandle
           A reference to a filehandle (technically a reference to a glob of a
           filehandle).  The filehandle is read until EOF and any data read
           goes in the location of the site.

       object
           An object reference.  Text::Bind will attempt to call the method
           fill_site of the object.  Therefore, the object must have defined a
           method called fill_site, or a runtime error will occur.

           The method is invoked with the same arguments as in a function
           binding:

               $object->fill_site($page_obj, $outfh, $site_name);

           Any additional arguments passed during the bind_site call will be
           passed to the registered object's fill_site method like in function
           bindings:

               $object->fill_site($page_obj, $outfh, $site_name,
                                  $arg1, $arg2, ..., $argN);

           Note, the return value of the fill_site method is used within in
           data site loops.  See "Data Site Loops" for more information.

       array
           Actually, a reference to an array.  The values of the array are
           iterated over each time the data site is evaluated.  The items in
           the array can be scalar strings, functions, filehandles, or
           objects, as defined above.

           Binding an array to a site is most applicable for loops created by
           "##PL_beginloop##".  See "Data Site Loops" for more information.

Data Site Loops
       Occasionally, there is a need to have a block of text be repeatable.
       For example, lets take the following text data:

           ##PL_beginloop##Item = ##PL_site=listvalue##
           ##PL_endloop##

       And the following bindings:

           $text->bind_site('listvalue', [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]);

       Will generated the following output:

           Item = 1
           Item = 2
           Item = 3
           Item = 4

       The text between the begin and end data sites is repeated until the
       evaluation of ALL data sites within the loop generate no more data.

       Within a loop, types of data sites are treated as follows:

       scalar string
           Will always be printed.  However, a scalar string data site will
           always be treated to have no more data when determine end of loop
           condition.

       function or object
           Will always be invoked.  However, the return value is check to
           determine if the last value has been generated for the data site.
           A return value of false tells "Text::Bind" that no more data exists
           for this site.

           WARNING: If the loop contains multiple data sites, it is possible
           that a function, or object method, will be called again if the
           other sites have not signified an end of data condition.  Hence,
           the function/method should still return a false value for the
           duraction of the loop.

       filehandle
           Will always be printed.  However, a filehandle data site will
           always be treated to have no more data when determine end of loop
           condition.  Also, since the EOF condition will be set after the
           first evaluation of the data site, subsequent evaluation will
           generate no data unless something resets the filehandle.

       array
           The items of the array are iterated over until end of the array is
           reached.  Once the last item is reached, the end of data condition
           is set for the site.

   Loop Examples
       A good example of loops is when populating an HTML table with data:

           <table>
           ##PL_beginloop##
           <tr>
           <td>##PL_site=lastname##</td>
           <td>##PL_site=firstname##</td>
           <td>##PL_site=street##</td>
           <td>##PL_site=city##</td>
           <td>##PL_site=state##</td>
           <td>##PL_site=zip##</td>
           </tr>
           ##PL_endloop##

LIMITATIONS
       •   Data site loops cannot be nested.

       •   Multiple data site loops cannot exist on a single line.
