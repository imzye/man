CALICO(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              CALICO(1)

NAME
     calico – dispatches cat

SYNOPSIS
     calico [-H host] [-P port] [-t timeout] directory

DESCRIPTION
     The calico program dispatches incoming TLS connections to instances of
     pounce(1) by Server Name Indication (SNI).  Instances of pounce(1) should
     be configured with -U to bind to UNIX-domain sockets in the directory
     passed to calico.

     Note that calico is not a proxy.  Incoming connections are passed
     directly to instances of pounce(1), which handle TLS negotiation.
     Instances of pounce(1) and calico can be restarted independently of each
     other.

     The arguments are as follows:

     -H host
             Bind to host.  The default host is localhost.

     -P port
             Bind to port.  The default port is 6697.

     -t timeout
             Set the timeout in milliseconds after which a connection will be
             closed if it has not sent the ClientHello message.  The default
             timeout is 1000 milliseconds.

     directory
             The path to the directory containing pounce(1) UNIX-domain
             sockets.

EXAMPLES
     Start and dispatch to two instances of pounce(1):

           $ pounce -U /var/run/calico -H oftc.example.org oftc.conf
           $ pounce -U /var/run/calico -H libera.example.org libera.conf
           $ calico -H example.org /var/run/calico

     The two instances can be connected to via oftc.example.org:6697 and
     libera.example.org:6697, respectively.
