NAME
       Log::TraceMessages - Perl extension for trace messages used in
       debugging

SYNOPSIS
         use Log::TraceMessages qw(t d);
         $Log::TraceMessages::On = 1;
         t 'got to here';
         t 'value of $a is ' . d($a);
         {
             local $Log::TraceMessages::On = 0;
             t 'this message will not be printed';
         }

         $Log::TraceMessages::Logfile = 'log.out';
         t 'this message will go to the file log.out';
         $Log::TraceMessages::Logfile = undef;
         t 'and this message is on stderr as usual';

         # For a CGI program producing HTML
         $Log::TraceMessages::CGI = 1;

         # Or to turn on trace if there's a command-line argument '--trace'
         Log::TraceMessages::check_argv();

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a slightly better way to put trace statements into your
       code than just calling print().  It provides an easy way to turn trace
       on and off for particular sections of code without having to comment
       out bits of source.

USAGE
       $Log::TraceMessages::On
           Flag controlling whether tracing is on or off.  You can set it as
           you wish, and of course it can be "local"-ized.  The default is
           off.

       $Log::TraceMessages::Logfile
           The name of the file to which trace should be appended.  If this is
           undefined (which is the default), then trace will be written to
           stderr, or to stdout if $CGI is set.

       $Log::TraceMessages::CGI
           Flag controlling whether the program printing trace messages is a
           CGI program (default is no).  This means that trace messages will
           be printed as HTML.  Unless $Logfile is also set, messages will be
           printed to stdout so they appear in the output page.

       t(messages)
           Print the given strings, if tracing is enabled.  Unless $CGI is
           true or $Logfile is set, each message will be printed to stderr
           with a newline appended.

       trace(messages)
           Synonym for t(messages).

       d(scalar)
           Return a string representation of a scalar's value suitable for use
           in a trace statement.  This is just a wrapper for Data::Dumper.

           d() will exit with '' if trace is not turned on.  This is to stop
           your program being slowed down by generating lots of strings for
           trace statements that are never printed.

       dmp(scalar)
           Synonym for d(scalar).

       check_argv()
           Looks at the global @ARGV of command-line parameters to find one
           called '--trace'.  If this is found, it will be removed from @ARGV
           and tracing will be turned on.  Since tracing is off by default,
           calling check_argv() is a way to make your program print trace only
           when you ask for it from the command line.
