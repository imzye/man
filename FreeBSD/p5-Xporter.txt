Xporter(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation           Xporter(3)


NAME
       Xporter - Alternative Exporter with persistant defaults & auto-ISA

VERSION
       Version "0.1.1"

SYNOPIS
       In the "Exporting" module:

         { package module_adder [optional version];
                 use warnings; use strict;
           use mem;                    # to allow using module in same file
           our (@EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK);
           our $lastsum;
           our @lastargs;
           use Xporter(@EXPORT=qw(adder $lastsum @lastargs),
                               @EXPORT_OK=qw(print_last_result));

           sub adder($$) {@lastargs=@_; $lastsum=$_[0]+$_[1]}
           sub print_last_result () {
             use P;    # using P allows answer printed or as string
             if (@lastargs && defined $lastsum){
               P "%s = %s\n", (join ' + ' , @lastargs), $lastsum;
             }
           }
         }

       In "use"-ing module (same or different file)

         package main;  use warnings; use strict;
         use module_adder qw(print_last_result);

         adder 4,5;

       Printing output:

         print_last_result();

         #Result:

         4 + 5 = 9

       (Or in a test:)

         ok(print_last_result eq "4 + 5 = 9", "a pod test");

DESCRIPTION
       "Xporter"  provides  "EXPORT"  functionality similar to  Exporter  with
       some different rules to simplify common cases.

       The primary difference, in  "Xporter"  is that the default  "EXPORT"
       list remains the default  "EXPORT"  list unless the user specifically
       asks for it to not be included, whereas in Exporter, asking for any
       additional exports from the  "EXPORT_OK"  list, clears the default
       "EXPORT"  list.

       "Xporter"  makes it easy to reset or clear the default so that choice
       is left to the user.

       To reset the default  "EXPORT"  list to empty, a bare minus ('-') or
       logical-not sign ('!') is placed as the first parameter in the client's
       import list.

       Example

       Suppose a module has exports:

         our (@EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK);
         use Xporter(@EXPORT=qw(one $two %three @four),
                     @EXPORT_OK=qw(&five));

       In the using module, to only import symbols 'two' and 'five', one would
       use:

       Example

         use MODULENAME qw(! $two five);

       That negates the default "EXPORT" list, and allows selective import of
       the values wanted from either,  the default  "EXPORT"  or the
       "EXPORT_OK" lists.  Note:  modules in the default list don't need to be
       reiterated in the OK list as they are already assumed to be "OK" to
       export having been in the default list.

       (New in 0.1) It is also possible to negate only 1 item from the default
       "EXPORT" list, as well as import optional symbols in 1 statement.

       Example

         use MODULENAME qw(!$two five);      #or
         use MODULENAME qw(!two five);

       Only export "two" from the default export list will be excluded.
       Whereas export "five" will be added to the list of items to import.

       Other functions of Exporter are not currently implemented, though
       certainly requests and code donations made via the CPAN issue database
       will be considered if possible.

   Types and Type Export
       Listing the EXPORT and EXPORT_OK assignments as params to Xporter will
       allow their types to be available to importing modules at compile time.
       the mem module was provided as a generic way to force declarations into
       memory during Perl's initial BEGIN phase so they will be in effect when
       the program runs.

   Version Strings
       Version strings in the form of a decimal fraction, (0.001001), a
       V-String (v1.2.1 with no quotes), or a version string ('1.1.1' or
       'v1.1.1') are supported, though note, versions in different formats are
       not interchangeable.  The format specified in a module's documentation
       should be used.
