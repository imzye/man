NAME
       apachetop - display real-time web server statistics

SYNOPSIS
       apachetop [-f filename] [-H hits | -T time] [-q] [-l] [-s segments]
       [-p] [-r secs]

DESCRIPTION
       ApacheTop watches a logfile generated by Apache (in standard common or
       combined logformat, and generates human-parsable output in realtime.

       -f logfile
              Select which file to watch.  Specify this option multiple times
              to watch multiple files.

       -H hits | -T time
              These options are mutually exclusive. Specify only one, if any
              at all. They work as follows. ApacheTop maintains a table of
              information internally containing all the relevant information
              about the hits it's seen. This table can only be a finite size,
              so you need to decide how big it's going to be. You have two
              options.  You can either: Use -H to say "remember <this many>
              hits" or  Use -T to say "remember all hits in <this many>
              seconds" The default (at the moment) is to remember hits for 30
              seconds.  Setting this too large (whichever option you choose)
              will cause ApacheTop to use more memory and more CPU time. My
              experimentation finds that remembering no more than around 5000
              requests works well.

       -q     Instructs ApacheTop to keep the querystrings, not remove them.

       -l     Instructs ApacheTop to lowercase all URLs, thus /FOO and /foo
              are treated as the same and accumulate the same statistics.

       -s segments
              Instructs ApacheTop to only keep the first <segments> parts of
              the path. Trailing slashes are kept if present. Statistics are
              then merged for each truncated url.

       -p     Instructs ApacheTop to keep the protocol (http:// usually) at
              the front of its' referrer strings. Normal behaviour is to
              remove them to give more room to more useful information.

       -r secs
              Set default refresh delay, in seconds.

EXAMPLES
       apachetop -f /var/logs/httpd/access.log
