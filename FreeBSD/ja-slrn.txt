SYNOPSIS
       slrn [ -n ] [ -h nntp-server-name ] [ -f newsrc-file ] [ -create ] [ -C
       ] [ -help ]

DESCRIPTION
       slrn is an easy to use but powerful NNTP based newsreader. It relies
       extensively on the S-Lang programmer's library for many of its
       features.

       If no server is specified on the command line using the -h option, the
       server specified by the NNTPSERVER environment variable will be used.
       The -f option specifies which newsrc file should be used.  If none is
       specified, a default value of .jnewsrc will be used. This value can be
       set on a server by server basis using the .slrnrc initialization file.

       The -create option should be used the first time slrn is used for a
       particular server. This causes slrn to read the entire list of groups
       available at the server and place them in the selected newsrc file.  If
       the NNTP connection is slow, this process may take several minutes.
       Fortunately, this happens only when the -create flag is used.

       If -C is specified on the command line, the terminal is assumed to
       support colors.  Colors may be specified by using the initialization
       file.  If the -n option is present, no new newsgroups will be checked
       for.  This may result in a faster startup.


BASIC OPERATION
       Using slrn is simple.  For many, simply typing slrn will connect to a
       news server. After starting, slrn checks for the existence of new
       newsgroups and automatically subscribes to them. Then after new news is
       checked, slrn goes into ``full screen'' mode at which point the user
       can unsubscribe to one or more groups.  slrn will display a list of
       newsgroups that looks like:

       ->  3      sci.research.postdoc                 689-705
           1      comp.databases.olap                  1-1

       Here the middle column shows the name of a newsgroup and the left
       column shows the number of unread articles in the group. The right
       column shows the range of articles present on the server. Note the
       presence of the -> in the first column on the `sci.research.postdoc'
       line. This symbol is used by slrn as a pointer to indicate the
       currently selected line. It may be moved up and down by using the arrow
       keys. Pressing the RETURN key or the SPACEBAR at this point will select
       the `sci.research.postdoc' group. A new screen will appear showing
       something like:

       ->-   703   (P) Lecturer in Comp.        dumontet@nuri.inria.fr (dumo
         -   704   Research & Developnment      dumontet@nuri.inria.fr (dumo
         -   705   Re: Example of proposal      shinbrot@bart.chem-eng.nwu.e

       Here, each line consists of four fields and possibly the -> cursor. The
       first field indicates whether the article has been read or not. A
       hyphen ( - ) in the first field indicates that the article has not been
       read.  Since a hyphen appears in the first field in all three of the
       lines above, none of the articles have been marked as read. A d in this
       field indicates that an article has been read. The currently selected
       article can be changed from the read to the unread state by pressing
       the u key. The d key may be used to mark the article as read without
       actually reading it.  The c key may be used to mark all the articles as
       read (Actually this is the preferred way to use the newsreader: scan
       the articles by eye looking for something interesting then before
       moving on to next newsgroup, press `c' to mark all articles as read).

       The second field displays the server number of the article. The third
       and fourth fields contain the subject and author of the article,
       respectively.

       Pressing the SPACEBAR or the RETURN key will create a second window and
       display the contents of the currently selected article. The screen will
       now consist of two windows - a large one and a small one. The large
       window, known as the article window, will contain the currently
       selected article and the small one, known as the summary window, will
       contain the list of articles as shown above. The space bar may be used
       the scroll the article forward and the DELETE key or the `B' key may be
       used to scroll it backward. The UP/DOWN arrow keys simply move the ->
       cursor from one line to another in the summary window. To hide the
       article window, press the h key.This will zoom the summary window to
       full screen.

       The f key may be used to post a followup to the currently selected
       article. To return to the list of Newsgroups, press the Q key to leave
       this mode.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       slrn uses the following list of environment variables:

       NNTPSERVER  NNTP Server to connect to if none specified when slrn is
                   started.

       EDITOR

       SLANG_EDITOR
                   Editor to use when composing messages. The '%s' and `%d'
                   format descriptors may be used to specify the filename and
                   line number respectively. For example, if `jed' is your
                   editor, then you can use something like: setenv
                   SLANG_EDITOR ´jed %s -g %d´ in your shell startup file.  If
                   you are using a bash shell, you could instead use the
                   command: export SLANG_EDITOR=´jed %s -g %d´ in your shell
                   startup file.  SLANG_EDITOR is the prefered environment
                   variable since all S-Lang applications that use an editor
                   look for this variable and understand this syntax.

       REPLYTO     Address to be inserted into the `Reply-To' field.

       ORGANIZATION
                   String to be used in the `Organization' field.

slrn INITIALIZATION FILE
       If a file called .slrnrc is present in the users HOME directory, slrn
       will use it as an initialization file. This file can contain list of
       personalized keybindings as well as a list of server -- newsrc
       mappings.

       BINDING KEYS

       To bind a key to a particular function use the syntax:

       setkey keymap function key-sequence

       The setkey function requires three arguments. The first argument
       specifies the keymap to be used for the bindings.  Valid keymaps
       include: group and article.  The function argument specifies the
       function that is to be executed when keys in the last argument are
       pressed. For example,

                              setkey  group  quit "x"

       indicates that if x is pressed at the group level, the quit function
       will be executed. Note that although not normally necessary, the last
       argument should be enclosed in double quotes since it may contain SPACE
       characters.

       The key-sequence argument can consist of several characters. For
       example, on many terminals, the RIGHT arrow sends the three characters
       ESC, `[' and `C' to the terminal. To bind the RIGHT key to
       `select_group' function, use:

                               setkey group select_group "\e[C"

       Sometimes, it is necessary to unbind a key from a keymap before binding
       the key. For example, one cannot do:

                               setkey group quit "\e"

       to bind the ESC key to the quit function without first unsetting it.
       This is because the default bindings use the ESC character as the
       prefix character for certain keymaps. To achieve this goal, use the
       unsetkey function:

                                unsetkey group "\e"
                                setkey group quit "\e"

       Here the unsetkey function has been used to remove the binding for the
       ESC character before binding it to the `quit' function.  Please note
       that unsetting the ESC key will also unset any key sequence been with
       the ESC key.  This includes most function keys.

       See the example initialization file below for the list of functions and
       their meaning.

       USING MULTIPLE SERVERS

       The easiest way to use multiple servers is through the use of the
       server command in the .slrnrc file. This command simple associates a
       server name with a newsrc file:

       server nntp-server newsrc-file

       For example, suppose that you use three servers with hostnames
       `red.news.edu', `blue.news.edu', and `green.news.edu'. The the lines:

       server red.news.edu .jnewsrc-red

       server blue.news.edu .jnewsrc-blue

       server green.news.edu .jnewsrc-green

       specify that the file .jnewsrc-red is to be used when the server
       red.news.edu is connected to, etc...

       DEFINING COLORS

       Color support is enabled when using the `-C' command line switch.  The
       colors may be defined through the use of the `color' keyword in the
       `.slrnrc' file.  The syntax is:

           color OBJECT-NAME FOREGROUND-COLOR BACKGROUND-COLOR

         Here, OBJECT-NAME can be any one of the following items:

           article        --  The body of the article (not headers)
           author         --  Author's name
           boldtext       --  Color for *emphasized* text
           box            --  Color for popup boxes
           cursor         --  The --> position indicator
           description    --  Newsgroup descriptions (group mode)
           error          --  Error messages
           frame          --  Frame around a popup box
           group          --  Newsgroup names (group mode)
           grouplens_display -- Grouplens score
           header_name    --  Name of the header, e.g., From:
           header_number  --  Nth line of header window
           headers        --  The lines that constitute the headers of the article
           high_score     --  Articles with high scores
           menu           --  Line at the top of the display (menu bar)
           menu_press     --  Menu bar entry when activated
           normal         --  anything not included above
           pgpsignature   --  PGP signature text
           quotes         --  Quoted material (level 0)
           quotes1        --  Quoted material (level 1)
           quotes2        --  Quoted material (level 2)
           quotes3        --  Quoted material (level 3)
           quotes4        --  Quoted material (level 4)
           quotes5        --  Quoted material (level 5)
           quotes6        --  Quoted material (level 6)
           quotes7        --  Quoted material (level 7)
           response_char  --  As in [Y]es, [N]o, [C]ancel
           signature      --  Author's signature
           selection      --  Currently selected item in a popup listbox
           status         --  Status line attached to windows
           subject        --  Subject
           thread_number  --  Thread numbers
           tilde          --  Tildes (tilde mode)
           tree           --  Article tree
           underline_text --  Color for _emphasized_ test

         The foreground/background color names can be any of the following:

           black                gray
           red                  brightred
           green                brightgreen
           brown                yellow
           blue                 brightblue
           magenta              brightmagenta
           cyan                 brightcyan
           lightgray            white
           default

         Most terminals do not support the second group of colors for the
       background.


       HIDING QUOTED ARTICLES

         Often articles contain quotes of previous articles.  slrn is capable
       of not displaying lines in an article that match a given regular
       expression.  The regular expression may be specified by putting a line
       of the form

            ignore_quotes  REGULAR-EXPRESSION

       in the .slrnrc startup file.  The default regular expression is

            "^ ?[:>=]"

       which matches any line that begins with or without a space followed by
       either a colon, greater than sign, or an equal sign.

       To toggle the display of such lines on or off, press the `T' key when
       in article mode.

ARTICLE SCORING
       (For a complete description of the flexibility in the slrn scorefile
       system, see the files KILL_FAQ and score.txt in the slrn distribution)

       slrn incorporates a sophisticated system for scoring articles.  In
       other newsreaders, one of slrn's scoring features would be called a "
       killfile ".  But unlike some other newsreaders, slrn provides for a
       great degree of flexibility and the capability to mark articles in ways
       other than merely killing them.

       Four levels of scoring are provided:

       -9999  The scored article is deleted (as with a common killfile) and
              will not appear in the header window

       -1 through -9998
              The scored article appears with a " D " as in "Deleted" flag in
              the header window

       0 normal article

       1 through 9999
              The scored article's header appears with a " !  " flag to
              indicate importance

       CONFIGURING THE SCOREFILE

       The scorefile system is disabled until you set scorefile to the
       pathname of the file slrn should use to hold the scoring parameters.

       Once set, scorefile may be accessed through the E command at the header
       window, or may be edited manually.  When accessed with E , slrn appends
       a template based upon the currently selected article to the scorefile
       with various parameters taken from the article and you are placed in
       your editor.  To enable scoring, delete the % comment symbol from the
       first column of the header line(s) you wish to score upon.

       The other way to configure your scorefile is by editing the file
       directly, with a text editor.  Here is a sample scorefile (remember the
       KILL_FAQ and score.txt files are the definitive references for the
       score system):

       This file consists of two sections.  The first section defines a set of
       tests applied to the news.software.readers newsgroups.  The second
       section applies to the comp.os.linux newsgroups.

       The first section consists of three tests.  The first test applies a
       score of 9999 to any subject that contains the string `slrn'.  The
       second test applies to the `From'.  It says that any article from
       davis@space.mit.edu gets scores 9999.  The third test gives a score of
       -9999 to any article whose subject contains the word `agent'.  Since
       tests are applied in order, if an article contains both `slrn' and
       `agent', it will be given a score of 9999 since 9999 is a special score
       value.

       The second section is more complex.  It applies to the newsgroups
       comp.os.linux newsgroups and consists of 5 tests.  The first three are
       simple: -10 points are given if the subject contains `swap', 20 if it
       contains SunOS, and 50 if the article is from someone named `Linus'.
       This means that if Bill@Somewhere writes an article whose subject is
       `Swap, Swap, Swap', the article is give -10 points.  However, if the
       Linus writes an article with the same title, it is given -10 + 50 = 40
       points.  Note that the first test expires at the beginning of 1996.

       The fourth test kills all articles that were cross posted to an advocay
       newsgroup UNLESS they were posted by Linus.  Note that if a keyword
       begins with the `~' character, the effect of the regular expression is
       reversed.

       The fourth test serves to filter out posts from someone@who.knows.where
       unless he posts about `gizmos' in one of the comp.os.development
       newsgroups.  Again note the `~' character.

       The last test marks as important messages from mentioning Moe or Curly
       in the alt.fan.warlord newsgroup.  This demonstrates use of an "OR"
       condition in a scorefile.

       MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS

       The .slrnrc initialization file also supports the following commands:

          signature             <signature file name>
          organization          <Your organization name>
          replyto               <Email address to be used reply to>
          quote_string          <string to be used to quote an article>
          editor_command        <string used to invoke editor>
          scorefile             <score file name>


       For example,

          signature         .news-signature
          organization      "Society of Famous Outlaws"
          signature         "Billy the Kid"
          quote_string      ">"
          editor_command    "jed %s -g %d -tmp"
          scorefile         "News/Score"

         %almost redundant, whereas with others which don't expire entries from
         %overview files regularly, it's almost vital.  If the users sees a lot of
         %"article not available" errors, they should probably try turning it on.
