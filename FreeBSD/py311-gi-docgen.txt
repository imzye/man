NAME
       gi-docgen - a documentation generator using gobject-introspection

SYNOPSIS
       gi-docgen COMMAND [OPTION...] GIR_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       GI-DocGen is a document generator for GObject-based libraries. GObject
       is the base type system of the GNOME project. GI-DocGen uses the
       machine readable introspection data provided by GObject-based libraries
       in order to generate the API reference of these libraries, as well as
       other ancillary documentation.

       The main gi-docgen executable provides various subcommands to access
       all its functionality.


Common options
       All commands have the following options:


       --quiet
              do not print details of the current operation

       --fatal-warnings
              make warnings fatal errors

       --help print command line help


The generate command
       The generate command provides the main functionality of gi-docgen.

       gi-docgen generate [ OPTIONS ] [ GIR_FILE ]


       The generate command will parse the given GIR file, as well as its
       dependencies, and build an API reference for the namespace it finds in
       the introspection data. Projects can use a configuration file to
       control aspects of the output, as well as provide additional content
       that should be included in the documentation.


   options:
       --config=FILE
              use the given project configuration file

       --content-dir=PATH
              specify the directory where the content files listed in the
              project configuration file can be found

       --templates-dir=PATH
              specify the directory where the templates used to generate the
              documentation can be found

       --theme-name=NAME
              specify the template name to be used when generating the
              documentation, overriding the project's configuration

       --output-dir=PATH
              create the documentation under the given directory

       --no-namespace-dir
              generate all documentation files directly under the output
              directory, instead of creating a directory using the namespace
              name and version

       --add-include-path=PATH
              add a directory to the path which the scanner uses to find GIR
              files. Can be used multiple times to specify multiple
              directories

       --section=NAME
              generate the documentation only for the given section. Can be
              used multiple times to specify multiple sections. The supported
              sections are aliases, bitfields, classes, domains, enums,
              interfaces, structs and unions. Special values are all, meaning
              all sections (the default); and none, meaning no section

       --dry-run
              parse the GIR_FILE without generating the documentation


The gen-index command
       The gen-index command generates an index of symbols and terms that can
       be used to search inside the documentation generated by gi-docgen.

       gi-docgen gen-index [ OPTIONS ] [ GIR_FILE ]


       The generated index is a JSON formatted file is called index.json.


   options:
       --config=FILE
              use the given project configuration file

       --content-dir=PATH
              specify the directory where the content files listed in the
              project configuration file can be found

       --output-dir=PATH
              create the index under the given directory

       --add-include-path=PATH
              add a directory to the path which the scanner uses to find GIR
              files. Can be used multiple times to specify multiple
              directories

       --dry-run
              parse the GIR_FILE without generating the documentation


The check command
       The check command runs a series of checks on the introspection file, to
       verify that public API is properly documented. It can be used as part
       of a test suite.

       gi-docgen check [ OPTIONS ] [ GIR_FILE ]


   options:
       --config=FILE
              use the given project configuration file

       --add-include-path=PATH
              add a directory to the path which the scanner uses to find GIR
              files. Can be used multiple times to specify multiple
              directories


The serve command

       The serve command generates an API reference and serves it using a
       local HTTP server.

       gi-docgen serve [ OPTIONS ] [ GIR_FILE ]


       The serve command will parse the given GIR file, as well as its
       dependencies, and build an API reference for the namespace it finds in
       the introspection data. Once the reference has been built successfully,
       gi-docgen will start a local HTTP server pointing at the output
       directory.


   options:
       --bind=ADDRESS
              use the given address for the HTTP server; the default is
              127.0.0.1

       --port=PORT
              use the given port for the HTTP server; the default is 8080


The help command
       The help command prints out the command line help. If you don't specify
       any command or option when invoking gi-docgen, the help command will be
       implied.

       gi-docgen help [ OPTIONS ] [ COMMAND ]


       If no command is specified, help will print out the list of commands.

       If a command is specified, help will print out the command line help
       for that program.


   options:
       --version
              print out the version of gi-docgen


EXIT STATUS
       0      The command was successful.

       1      Error, or warning, was generated.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The gi-docgen executable uses the XDG_DATA_DIRS and XDG_DATA_HOME
       environment variables to search for introspection data included in the
       GIR file.

       If the GIDOCGEN_DEBUG environment variable is set, gi-docgen will print
       out additional messages, which can be helpful when debugging issues.
