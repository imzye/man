NAME
       Devel::TraceSAX - Trace SAX events

SYNOPSIS
         ## From the command line:
           perl -d:TraceSAX           script.pl
           perl -d:TraceSAX=-dump_all script.pl

         ## procedural:
           use Devel::TraceSAX;

           trace_SAX $obj1;

         ## Emitting additional messages
           use Devel::TraceSAX qw( emit_trace_SAX_message );

           emit_trace_SAX_message "this is a test";

DESCRIPTION
       WARNING: alpha code alert!!! This module and its API subject to change,
       possibly radically :).

       Traces SAX events in a program.  Works by applying Devel::TraceCalls to
       a tracer on the desired classes for all known SAX event types
       (according to XML::SAX::EventMethodMaker and XML::SAX::Machines).

   Emitting messages if and only if Devel::TraceCalls is loaded
           use constant _tracing => defined $Devel::TraceSAX::VERSION;

           BEGIN {
               eval "use Devel::TraceCalls qw( emit_trace_SAX_message )"
                   if _tracing;
           }

           emit_trace_SAX_message( "hi!" ) if _tracing;

       Using the constant "_tracing" allows expressions like

           emit_trace_SAX_message(...) if _tracing;

       to be optimized away at compile time, resulting in little or no
       performance penalty.

TODO
       Add a lot more formatting clean-up.

LIMITATIONS
       This module overloads CORE::GLOBAL::require when used from the command
       line via -d: or -M.  For some reason this causes spurious warnings like

          Unquoted string "fields" may clash with future reserved word at /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.6.1/base.pm line 87.

       That line looks like "require fields;", so it looks like the (*)
       prototype on our CORE::GLOBAL::require = sub (*) {...} isn't having
       it's desired effect.  It would be nice to clean these up.
