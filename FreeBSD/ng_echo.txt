NAME
     ng_echo – netgraph echo node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_echo.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The echo node type reflects all data and control messages back to the
     sender.  This node type is used for testing and debugging.

HOOKS
     A echo node accepts any request to connect, regardless of the hook name,
     as long as the name is unique.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports only the generic control messages.  Any other
     control messages are reflected back to the sender.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.

SEE ALSO
     netgraph(4), ng_hole(4), ngctl(8)

HISTORY
     The ng_echo node type was implemented in FreeBSD 4.0.
