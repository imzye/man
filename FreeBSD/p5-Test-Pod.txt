NAME
       Test::Pod - check for POD errors in files

VERSION
       Version 1.52

SYNOPSIS
       "Test::Pod" lets you check the validity of a POD file, and report its
       results in standard "Test::Simple" fashion.

           use Test::Pod tests => $num_tests;
           pod_file_ok( $file, "Valid POD file" );

       Module authors can include the following in a t/pod.t file and have
       "Test::Pod" automatically find and check all POD files in a module
       distribution:

           use Test::More;
           eval "use Test::Pod 1.00";
           plan skip_all => "Test::Pod 1.00 required for testing POD" if $@;
           all_pod_files_ok();

       You can also specify a list of files to check, using the
       all_pod_files() function supplied:

           use strict;
           use Test::More;
           eval "use Test::Pod 1.00";
           plan skip_all => "Test::Pod 1.00 required for testing POD" if $@;
           my @poddirs = qw( blib script );
           all_pod_files_ok( all_pod_files( @poddirs ) );

       Or even (if you're running under Apache::Test):

           use strict;
           use Test::More;
           eval "use Test::Pod 1.00";
           plan skip_all => "Test::Pod 1.00 required for testing POD" if $@;

           my @poddirs = qw( blib script );
           use File::Spec::Functions qw( catdir updir );
           all_pod_files_ok(
               all_pod_files( map { catdir updir, $_ } @poddirs )
           );

DESCRIPTION
       Check POD files for errors or warnings in a test file, using
       "Pod::Simple" to do the heavy lifting.

FUNCTIONS
   pod_file_ok( FILENAME[, TESTNAME ] )
       pod_file_ok() will okay the test if the POD parses correctly.  Certain
       conditions are not reported yet, such as a file with no pod in it at
       all.

       When it fails, pod_file_ok() will show any pod checking errors as
       diagnostics.

       The optional second argument TESTNAME is the name of the test.  If it
       is omitted, pod_file_ok() chooses a default test name "POD test for
       FILENAME".

   all_pod_files_ok( [@entries] )
       Checks all the files under @entries for valid POD. It runs
       all_pod_files() on directories and assumes everything else to be a file
       to be tested. It calls the plan() function for you (one test for each
       file), so you can't have already called "plan".

       If @entries is empty or not passed, the function finds all POD files in
       files in the blib directory if it exists, or the lib directory if not.
       A POD file matches the conditions specified below in "all_pod_files".

       If you're testing a module, just make a t/pod.t:

           use Test::More;
           eval "use Test::Pod 1.00";
           plan skip_all => "Test::Pod 1.00 required for testing POD" if $@;
           all_pod_files_ok();

       Returns true if all pod files are ok, or false if any fail.

   all_pod_files( [@dirs] )
       Returns a list of all the POD files in @dirs and in directories below.
       If no directories are passed, it defaults to blib if blib exists, or
       else lib if not. Skips any files in CVS, .svn, .git and similar
       directories. See %Test::Pod::ignore_dirs for a list of them.

       A POD file is:

       •   Any file that ends in .pl, .PL, .pm, .pod, .psgi or .t.

       •   Any file that has a first line with a shebang and "perl" on it.

       •   Any file that ends in .bat and has a first line with "--*-Perl-*--"
           on it.

       The order of the files returned is machine-dependent.  If you want them
       sorted, you'll have to sort them yourself.
