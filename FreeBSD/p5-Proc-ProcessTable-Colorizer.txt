Proc::ProcessTable::Colorizer(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Proc::ProcessTable::Colorizer - Like ps, but with colored columns and
       enhnaced functions for searching.

VERSION
       Version 0.3.0

SYNOPSIS
           use Proc::ProcessTable::Colorizer;

           my $cps = Proc::ProcessTable::Colorizer->new;
           print $cps->colorize;

       This module uses Error::Helper for error reporting.

       As of right now this module is not really user friend and will likely
       be going through lots of changes as it grows.

METHODS
   new
       Creates a new object. This method will never error.

           my $cps=Proc::ProcessTable::Colorizer->new;

   colorize
       This colorizes it and returns a setup Text::Table object with
       everything already setup.

           use Proc::ProcessTable::Colorizer;
           my $cps = Proc::ProcessTable::Colorizer->new;
           print $cps->colorize;

   fields
       Gets a hash of possible fields from Proc::ProcessTable as an hash.

       This is really meant as a internal function.

   fieldsGet
       Gets the currently set fields.

       Returns a array ref of current fields to be printed.

           my $fields=$cps->fieldsGet;

   nextColor
       Returns the next color.

           my $nextColor=$cps->nextColor;

   nextColor
       Resets the next color to the first one.

           my $nextColor=$cps->nextColor;

   fieldsSet
       Gets the currently set fields.

       Returns a list of current fields to be printed.

           my @fields=$cps->fieldsGet;

   pctcpuSearchGet
       Returns the current value for the PCT CPU search.

       The return is a array ref.

           my $pctcpu_search=$cps->pctcpuSearchGet;

   pctcpuSearchSetString
       Search for procs based on the CPU usage.

       The following equalities are understood.

           <=
           <
           >
           >=

       The string may contain multiple values seperated by a comma. Checking
       will stop after the first hit.

       If the string is undef, all procs will be shown.

           #search for procs with less than 60% of CPU usage
           $cps->pctcpuSearchSetString('<60');
           #shows procs with greater than 60% of CPU usage
           $cps->pctcpuSearchSetString('>60');

   pctmemSearchGet
       Returns the current value for the PCT MEM search.

       The return is a array ref.

           my $pctmem_search=$cps->pctmemSearchGet;

   pctmemSearchSetString
       Search for procs based on the memory usage.

       The following equalities are understood.

           <=
           <
           >
           >=

       The string may contain multiple values seperated by a comma. Checking
       will stop after the first hit.

       If the string is undef, all procs will be shown.

           #search for procs with less than 60% of the memory
           $cps->pctmemSearchSetString('<60');
           #shows procs with greater than 60% of the memory
           $cps->pctmemSearchSetString('>60');

   processColorGet
           my $timeColors=$cps->processColorGet;

   procSearchGet
       This returns the search string value that will be used for matching the
       proc column.

       The return is undefined if one is not set.

           my $search_regex=$cps->procSearchGet;
           if ( defined( $search_regex ) ){
               print "search regex: ".$search_regex."\n";
           }else{
               print "No search regex.\n";
           }

   procSearchSet
       This sets the proc column search regex to use.

       If set to undef(the default), then it will show all procs.

           #shows everything
           $cps->procSearchSet( undef );

           #search for only those matching musicpd
           $cps->procSeearchSet( 'musicpd' );

           #search for those that match /[Zz]whatever/
           $cps->procSearchSet( '[Zz]whatever' );

   selfIgnoreGet
   selfIgnoreSet
       Wether or not to show the PID of this processes in the list.

       undef

       Resets it to the default, 2.

       0

       Always show self PID in the list.

       1

       Never show self PID in the list.

       2

       Don't show self PID if it is a search.

       This is the default.

   startString
       Generates a short time string based on the supplied unix time.

   swappedOutSearchGet
       Returns the current value for the swapped out search.

       The return is a Perl boolean.

           my $swappedOut_search=$cps->swappedOutSearchGet;
           if ( $swappedOut_search ){
               print "only swapped out procs will be shown";
           }

   swappedOutSearchSet
       Sets the swapped out search value.

       The value taken is a Perl boolean.

           $cps->swappedOutSearchSet( 1 );

   timeColorsGet
           my $timeColors=$cps->timeColorsGet;

   timeSearchGet
       Returns the current value for the time search.

       The return is a array ref.

           my $time_search=$cps->waitSearchGet;

   timeSearchSetString
       Search for procs based on the CPU time value.

       The following equalities are understood.

           <=
           <
           >
           >=

       The string may contain multiple values seperated by a comma. Checking
       will stop after the first hit.

       If the string is undef, all wait channels will be shown.

           #search for procs with less than 60 seconds of CPU time
           $cps->waitSearchSetString('<69');
           #shows procs with less than 60 seconds and greater 120 seconds
           $cps->waitSearchSetString('<60,>120');

   timeString
       Turns the raw run string into something usable.

       This returns a colorized item.

           my $time=$cps->timeString( $seconds );

userSearchGet
       This gets the user to be searched for and if it should be inverted or
       not.

       This returns an array reference of users to search for.

       An selection can be inverted via !.

           my $user_search=$cps->userSearchGet;

userSearchSetString
       This takes a string to set the user search for.

       An selection can be inverted via !.

       The string may contain multiple users seperated by a comma.

       If the string is undef, all users will be shown.

           #search for user foo and bar
           $cps->userSearchSetString('foo,bar');
           #show users not matching foo
           $cps->userSearchSetString('!foo');
           #show all users, clearing any previous settings
           $cps->userSearchSetString;

   waitSearchGet
       Returns the current value for the wait search.

       The return is a array ref.

           my $wait_search=$cps->waitSearchGet;

   waitSearchSetString
       This takes a string to set the wait channel search for.

       An selection can be inverted via !.

       The string may contain multiple users seperated by a comma.

       If the string is undef, all wait channels will be shown.

           #search for wait channel wait and sleep
           $cps->waitSearchSetString('wait,sleep');
           #shows wait channels not matching sbwait
           $cps->waitSearchSetString('!sbwait');
           #show all users, clearing any previous settings
           $cps->waitSearchSetString;

   zombieSearchGet
       Returns the current value for the zombie search.

       The return is a Perl boolean.

           my $zombie_search=$cps->zombieSearchGet;

               print "only zombie procs will be shown";
           }

   zombieSearchSet
       Sets the zombie search value.

       The value taken is a Perl boolean.

           $cps->zombieSearchSet( 1 );

COLORS
       These corresponds to Term::ANSIColor colors.

   Time
       The color column is not a single color, but multiple depending on the
       amount of time.

       The default is as below.

           'GREEN', seconds
           'BRIGHT_GREEN', minutes
           'RED', hours

           BRIGHT_YELLOW
           BRIGHT_CYAN
           BRIGHT_MAGENTA
           BRIGHT_BLUE

ERROR CODES/FLAGS

       The time search string contains errors.
