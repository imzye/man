PXZ(1)                            Parallel XZ                           PXZ(1)



NAME
       pxz - Parallel LZMA compressor compatible with XZ.

SYNOPSIS
       pxz [options]... [file]...


DESCRIPTION
       pxz is a compression utility that takes advantage of running XZ
       compression simultaneously on different parts of an input file on
       multiple cores and processors. This significantly speeds up compression
       time.

OPTIONS
       -v     Be verbose - shows progress.

       -h, --help
              Display help.

       -f, --force
              Force operation.

       -c, --stdout
              Write results to standard output and don't delete input files.

       -k, --keep
              Keep (don't delete) input files.

       -T, --threads
              Maximal number of threads to run simultaneously.

       -D, --context-size
              Context size per one thread specified as a multiple of
              dictionary size for active compression level.

       -V, --version
              Display version of PXZ.

EXAMPLES
       pxz file1 file2
              Compress file1 and file2 to file1.xz and file2.xz using default
              settings.

       pxz -T4 file1
              Compress file1 with default compression and maximum of 4
              threads.

       pxz -k -9 file1
              Use maximal compression and keep the original file1, use default
              number of threads.

       pxz -f -T4 file1
              Compress file with default compression and with 4 threads.

       pxz -kvf -3 -T8 file1
              Use -3 compression, keep the original file, use 8 threads and
              show progress.

       tar Oc dir1 | pxz -D 12 -cv - > dir1.tar.xz
              Move dir1 into tar, then compress it with the context of 12
              sizes of dictionary per thread, show progress and write result
              to dir1.tar.xz.
