NAME
       swayimg - image viewer for Wayland display servers

SYNOPSIS
       swayimg [OPTIONS]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       If no input files or directories are specified, the viewer will try to
       read all files in the current directory.

       Use '-' as FILE to read image data from stdin.

       Use prefix exec:// to get image data from stdout printed by external
       command.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display help message and exit.

       -v, --version
           Display version information and list of supported image formats.

       -g, --gallery
           Start in gallery mode.

       -F, --from-file
           Interpret FILE as text list of image files.

       -r, --recursive
           Read directories recursively.

       -o, --order=ORDER
           Set order of the image list:
           •   none: unsorted;
           •   alpha: sorted alphabetically;
           •   numeric: sorted numerically;
           •   mtime: sorted by file modification time;
           •   size: sorted by file size;
           •   random: randomize list.

       -s, --scale=MODE
           Set image scale:
           •   optimal: 100% or less to fit to window (default);
           •   width: fit image width to window width;
           •   height: fit image height to window height;
           •   fit: fit to window;
           •   fill: crop image to fill the window;
           •   real: real size (100%);
           •   keep: keep the same scale as for previously viewed image.

       -l, --slideshow
           Run slideshow on startup.

       -f, --fullscreen
           Start in full screen mode.

       -p, --position=parent|X,Y
           Set window position, this option valid only in Sway WM:
           •   parent: set position from parent (currently active) window;
           •   X,Y: absolute coordinates of the top left corner, e.g. 100,200.

       -w, --size=fullscreen|parent|image|W,H
           Set window size:
           •   fullscreen: use full screen mode;
           •   parent: [Only in Sway WM] set size from parent (currently
               active) window;
           •   image: set size from the first loaded image;
           •   W,H: absolute size of the window in pixels, e.g. 320,240.

       -a, --class=NAME
           Set window class/app_id.

       -i, --ipc=FILE
           Start IPC server based on UNIX sockets. FILE must point to the UNIX
           socket file to create. The IPC protocol is a simple text-based one-
           way protocol that allows clients to submit actions for execution.
           For a list of actions and their parameters, see swayimgrc(5).

       -c, --config=SECTION.KEY=VALUE
           Override configuration parameter, see swayimgrc(5) for a list of
           sections and their parameters.

       -C, --config-file=FILE
           Load configuration from specified FILE.

SWAY/HYPRLAND INTEGRATION
       Sway/Hyprland integration mode is automatically enabled if IPC for
       these compositors is present in the system. This mode provides some
       features such as setting the window position and getting the workspace
       layout. By default, the application creates an "overlay" above the
       currently active window, which gives the illusion that the image is
       opened directly inside the terminal window.

ENVIRONMENT
       SWAYSOCK
           Path to the socket file used for Sway IPC.

       HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
           Path to the socket file used for Hyprland IPC.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, HOME
           Prefix of the path to the application config file, see swayimgrc(5)
           for details.

       XDG_CACHE_HOME, HOME
           Prefix for the path used as persistent storage for thumbnails.

       SHELL
           Shell for executing an external command and loading an image from
           stdout.

SIGNALS
       SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2
           Perform the actions specified in the config file.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is 0 if the program completed successfully and 1 if an
       error occurred.

EXAMPLES
       View multiple files:
           swayimg photo.jpg logo.png

       Start slideshow for all files (recursively) in the current directory in
       random order:
           swayimg --slideshow --recursive --order=random

       View using pipes:
           wget -qO- https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/tux.png | swayimg -

       Loading stdout from external commands:
           swayimg "exec://wget -qO- https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/tux.png" \
                   "exec://curl -so- https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/tux.png"

       View all images from the current directory in gallery mode:
           swayimg --gallery
