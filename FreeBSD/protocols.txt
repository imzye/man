NAME
     protocols – protocol name data base

DESCRIPTION
     The protocols file contains information regarding the known protocols
     used in the DARPA Internet.  For each protocol a single line should be
     present with the following information:

           official protocol name
           protocol number
           aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A
     ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of
     the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.

     Protocol names may contain any printable character other than a field
     delimiter, newline, or comment character.

FILES
