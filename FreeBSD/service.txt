SERVICE(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             SERVICE(8)

NAME
     service – control (start/stop/etc.) or list system services

SYNOPSIS
     service [-j jail] -e
     service [-j jail] -R
     service [-j jail] [-v] -l
     service [-j jail] [-v] -r
     service [-j jail] [-v] script command

DESCRIPTION
     The service command is an easy interface to the rc.d system.  Its primary
     purpose is to start and stop services provided by the rc.d scripts.  When
     used for this purpose it will set the same restricted environment that is
     in use at boot time (see ENVIRONMENT).  It can also be used to list the
     scripts using various criteria.

     The options are as follows:

     -e  List services that are enabled.  The list of scripts to check is
         compiled using rcorder(8) the same way that it is done in rc(8), then
         that list of scripts is checked for an "rcvar" assignment.  If
         present the script is checked to see if it is enabled.

     -j jail
         Perform the given actions under the named jail.  The jail argument
         can be either a jail ID or a jail name.

     -l  List all files in /etc/rc.d and the local startup directories.  As
         described in rc.conf(5) this is usually /usr/local/etc/rc.d.  All
         files will be listed whether they are an actual rc.d script or not.

     -R  Restart all enabled local services.

     -r  Generate the rcorder(8) as in -e above, but list all of the files,
         not just what is enabled.

     -v  Be slightly more verbose.

ENVIRONMENT
     When used to run rc.d scripts the service command sets HOME to / and PATH
     to /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin which is how they are set in /etc/rc at
     boot time.

EXIT STATUS
     The service utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The following are examples of typical usage of the service command:

           service named status
           service -j dns named status
           service -rv

     The following programmable completion entry can be used in bash(1) for
     the names of the rc.d scripts:

           _service () {
                   local cur
                   cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
                   COMPREPLY=( $( compgen -W '$( service -l )' -- $cur ) )
                   return 0
           }
           complete -F _service service

SEE ALSO
     bash(1) (ports/shells/bash), rc.conf(5), rc(8), rcorder(8)

HISTORY
     The service utility first appeared in FreeBSD 7.3.
