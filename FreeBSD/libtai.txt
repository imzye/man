caldate(3)             FreeBSD Library Functions Manual             caldate(3)

NAME
       caldate - calendar dates

SYNTAX
       #include <caldate.h>

       unsigned int caldate_fmt(s,&cd);
       unsigned int caldate_scan(s,&cd);

       struct caldate cd;
       char *s;

DESCRIPTION
       A struct caldate value is a calendar date.  It has three components:
       year, month (1...12), and day (1...31).

       caldate_fmt prints cd in ISO style (yyyy-mm-dd) into the character
       buffer s, without a terminating NUL.  It returns the number of
       characters printed.  s may be zero; then caldate_fmt returns the number
       of characters that would have been printed.

       caldate_scan reads a calendar date in ISO style from the beginning of
       the character buffer s and puts it into cd.  It returns the number of
       characters read.  If s does not start with an ISO-style date,
       caldate_scan returns 0.
