NAME
       Chemistry::File::SMARTS - SMARTS chemical substructure pattern linear
       notation parser

SYNOPSYS
           #!/usr/bin/perl
           use Chemistry::File::SMARTS;

           # this string matches an oxygen next to an atom with three
           # neighbors, one of which is a hydrogen, and a positive charge
           my $smarts = 'O[D3H+]';

           # parse a SMARTS string and compile it into a
           # Chemistry::Pattern object
           my $patt = Chemistry::Pattern->parse("$smarts", format => 'smarts');

           # find matches of the pattern in a Chemistry::Mol object $mol
           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->read("myfile.mol");
           while ($patt->match($mol)) {
               print "pattern matches atoms: ", $patt->atom_map, "\n"
           }

           # NOTE: if the SMARTS pattern relies on aromaticity or ring
           # properties, you have to make sure that the target
           # molecule is "aromatized" first:
           my $smarts = 'c:a';
           my $patt = Chemistry::Pattern->parse("$smarts", format => 'smarts');
           use Chemistry::Ring 'aromatize_mol';
           aromatize_mol($mol);  # <--- AROMATIZE!!!
           while ($patt->match($mol)) {
               print "pattern matches atoms: ", $patt->atom_map, "\n"
           }

           # Note that "atom mapping numbers" end up as $atom->name
           my $patt = Chemistry::Pattern->parse("[C:7][C:8]", format => 'smarts');
           print $patt->atoms(1)->name;    # prints 7

DESCRIPTION
       This module parse a SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification)
       string, generating a Chemistry::Pattern object.  It is a file I/O
       driver for the PerlMol toolkit; it's not called directly but by means
       of the Chemistry::Pattern->parse class method.

       For a detailed description of the SMARTS language, see
       <http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html>. Note
       that this module doesn't implement the full language, as detailed under
       CAVEATS.

       This module is part of the PerlMol project, <http://www.perlmol.org/>.

CAVEATS
       The following features are not implemented yet:

       chirality: @, @@
       component-level gruouping
           That is, the difference between these three cases:

               (SMARTS)
               (SMARTS).(SMARTS)
               (SMARTS).SMARTS

       The so-called parser is very lenient, so if you give it something
       that's not quite reasonable it will ignore it or interpret it in a
       strange way without warning.

       As shown in the synopsis, you have to make sure that the molecule is
       "aromatized" if you want to apply to it a pattern that relies on
       aromaticity or ring properties.
