NAME
       Devel::Leak - Utility for looking for perl objects that are not
       reclaimed.

SYNOPSIS
         use Devel::Leak;
         ... setup code

         my $count = Devel::Leak::NoteSV($handle);

         ... code that may leak

         Devel::Leak::CheckSV($handle);

DESCRIPTION
       Devel::Leak has two functions "NoteSV" and "CheckSV".

       "NoteSV" walks the perl internal table of allocated SVs (scalar values)
       - (which actually  contains arrays and hashes too), and records their
       addresses in a table. It returns a count of these "things", and stores
       a pointer to the table (which is obtained from the heap using malloc())
       in its argument.

       "CheckSV" is passed argument which holds a pointer to a table created
       by "NoteSV". It re-walks the perl-internals and calls sv_dump() for any
       "things" which did not exist when "NoteSV" was called. It returns a
       count of the number of "things" now allocated.

CAVEATS
       Note that you need a perl built with -DDEBUGGING for sv_dump() to print
       anything, but counts are valid in any perl.

       If new "things" have been created, "CheckSV" may (also) report
       additional "things" which are allocated by the sv_dump() code.

HISTORY
       This little utility module was part of Tk until the variable renaming
       in perl5.005 made it clear that Tk had no business knowing this much
       about the perl internals.
