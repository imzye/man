ISCSI_INITIATOR(4)     FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual     ISCSI_INITIATOR(4)

NAME
     iscsi_initiator – kernel driver for the iSCSI protocol

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device iscsi_initiator

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           iscsi_initiator_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     This driver, along with its userspace counterpart iscontrol(8), is
     obsolete and is not present in FreeBSD 14 and above.  Users are advised
     to use iscsi(4) instead.

     The iscsi_initiator implements the kernel side of the Internet SCSI
     (iSCSI) network protocol standard, the userland companion is
     iscontrol(8), and permits access to remote virtual SCSI devices via
     cam(4).

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     debug.iscsi_initiator         set the debug-level, 0 means no debugging,
                                   9 for maximum.

     net.iscsi.isid                the initiator part of the Session
                                   Identifier.

     kern.cam.cam_srch_hi=1        allow search above LUN 7 for SCSI3 and
                                   greater devices.

     the following are informative only:

     net.iscsi.driver_version      the current version of the driver.

     net.iscsi.sessions            the number of current active sessions.

     net.iscsi.n.targetname        is the targe name of session n.

     net.iscsi.n.targeaddress      is the IP address of the target of session
                                   n.

     net.iscsi.n.stats             are some statistics for session n

     net.iscsi.n.pid               is the process id of the userland side of
                                   session n, see iscontrol(8).

FILES
     The iscsi_initiator driver creates the following:

     /dev/iscsi          used to create new sessions.
     /dev/iscsi%d        for each new session.
