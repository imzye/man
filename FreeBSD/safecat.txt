maildir(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             maildir(1)

NAME
       maildir - safely write data to a qmail-style maildir


SYNOPSIS
       maildir dir


INTRODUCTION
       maildir is a shell script which invokes safecat.  It is equivalent to
       safecat dir/tmp dir/new.  It saves a little typing for those who want
       to use qmail maildirs, which have a fixed structure.  safecat, on the
       other hand, allows the user to have one temporary directory for many
       spool directories. This is occasionally useful; some people don't like
       to multiply the number of places which need to be periodically cleaned
       up.
