LIQUIDIO(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            LIQUIDIO(4)

NAME
     liquidio – Cavium 10Gb/25Gb Ethernet driver for the FreeBSD operating
     system

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device lio

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_lio_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The liquidio driver provides support for 23XX 10Gb/25Gb Ethernet
     adapters.  The driver supports Jumbo Frames, Transmit/Receive checksum
     offload, TCP segmentation offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO),
     VLAN tag insertion/extraction, VLAN checksum offload, VLAN TSO, and
     Receive Side Steering (RSS)

     Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
     Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
     configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.  The maximum
     MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 16000.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The liquidio driver supports the following cards:

     •   LiquidIO II CN2350 210SV/225SV
     •   LiquidIO II CN2360 210SV/225SV

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.lio.fw_type

             String that specifies type of firmware to be loaded.  Default is
             "nic". Use "none" to load firmware from flash.

     hw.lio.num_queues_per_pf0

             Unsigned integers that specify number of queues per PF0.  Valid
             range is 0 to 64.  Use 0 to derive autoconfigures based on the
             number of cpus with a max of 8

     hw.lio.num_queues_per_pf1

             Unsigned integers that specify number of queues per PF1.  Valid
             range is 0 to 64.  Use 0 to derive autoconfigures based on the
             number of cpus with a max of 8

     hw.lio.console_bitmask

             Bitmask indicating which consoles have debug output redirected to
             syslog.

     hw.lio.rss

             To enable/disable driver RSS support

     hw.lio.hwlro

             To enable/disable hardware LRO
