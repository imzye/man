SIMPLEBUS(4)           FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual           SIMPLEBUS(4)

NAME
     simplebus – ePAPR simple-bus driver

SYNOPSIS
     options FDT

DESCRIPTION
     This bus driver is dedicated for the simple-bus node of a flattened
     device tree compliant with the ePAPR specification.

     The simplebus entity does not represent any physical element by itself,
     it is rather an umbrella node grouping integrated on-chip peripherals
     like interrupt controller, connectivity controllers, accelerating engines
     and so on.

     The driver is generic and common for all flattened device tree nodes
     claiming simple-bus compatibility.  It iterates over direct descendants
     of the simple-bus node, instantiates newbus children and assigns
     resources to them, based on the configuration data retrieved from the
     nodes properties in fdt(4).

     Note the simplebus does not manage device resources and passes through
     any requests to the fdtbus(4) layer.
