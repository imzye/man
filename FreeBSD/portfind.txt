NAME
       portfind -    find ports with detailed and short view

SYNOPSIS
       portfind [-a] [-d] [-p] [-m] [-D] [-f] [-n] [-r] [-h] [-v] search_word

DESCRIPTION
       portfind finds ports by name (default). It is able to search in other
       fields than name (see OPTIONS). It also looks if a port is already
       installed and tells the user the installed version number.

       portfind uses /usr/ports/INDEX-X (X stands for the version) and
       /var/db/pkg. Please be sure, you updated your index file (cd to
       /usr/ports and do make index) after every port sync.

OPTIONS
       Without options     the search only matches the name of the ports
       -a                  Search in all fields
       -d                  Search in name and in description
       -p                  Search in name and in path
       -m                  Search in name and maintainer
       -D                  Search in name and dependencies
       -f                  Show result with dependencies
       -n                  Show normal version of results (short version is
       default)
       -r                  Show result count
       -h                  Print this help text
       -v                  Print version number
