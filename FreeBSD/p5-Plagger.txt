NAME
       Plagger - Pluggable RSS/Atom Aggregator

SYNOPSIS
         % plagger -c config.yaml

DESCRIPTION
       Plagger is a pluggable RSS/Atom feed aggregator and remixer platform.

       Everything is implemented as a small plugin just like qpsmtpd, blosxom
       and perlbal. All you have to do is write a flow of aggregation,
       filters, syndication, publishing and notification plugins in config
       YAML file.

       See <http://plagger.org/> for cookbook examples, quickstart document,
       development community (Mailing List and IRC), subversion repository and
       bug tracking.
