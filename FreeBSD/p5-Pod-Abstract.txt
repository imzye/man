NAME
       Pod::Abstract - Abstract document tree for Perl POD documents

SYNOPSIS
        use Pod::Abstract;
        use Pod::Abstract::BuildNode qw(node);

        # Get all the first level headings, and put them in a verbatim block
        # at the start of the document
        my $pa = Pod::Abstract->load_filehandle(\*STDIN);
        my @headings = $pa->select('/head1@heading');
        my @headings_text = map { $_->pod } @headings;
        my $headings_node = node->verbatim(join "\n",@headings_text);

        $pa->unshift( node->cut );
        $pa->unshift( $headings_node );
        $pa->unshift( node->pod );

        print $pa->pod;

DESCRIPTION
       POD::Abstract provides a means to load a POD (or POD compatible)
       document without direct reference to it's syntax, and perform
       manipulations on the abstract syntax tree.

       This can be used to support additional features for POD, to format
       output, to compile into alternative formats, etc.

   WHY?
       If you've ever asked yourself "What does Pod do for me?", this module
       is intended to answer that question.

       While Pod looks like a simple format, the specification calls for a
       number of special cases to be handled, and that makes any software that
       works on Pod as text more complex than it needs to be.

       In addition to this, Pod does not lend itself to a natural structured
       model. This makes it difficult to manipulate without damaging the
       validity of the document.

       Pod::Abstract solves these problems by loading the document into a
       structured tree, and providing consistent traversal, searching,
       manpulation and re-serialisation. Pod related utilities are easy to
       write using Pod::Abstract.

       The design goal of Pod::Abstract is to do the hard work for the
       programmer - the library should work for you, and as such it should be
       significantly easier than string mashing what you want out of a Pod
       document.

   PROCESSING MODEL
       The intent with POD::Abstract is to provide a means to decorate a parse
       tree, rather than manipulate text, to allow other software to add
       features and functionality to POD based documenation systems.

       If you wish to write modules that interact nicely with other
       POD::Abstract modules, then you should provide a POD::Abstract ->
       POD::Abstract translation. Leave any document element that your program
       is not interested in directly untouched in the parse tree, and if you
       have data that could be useful to other packages, decorate the parse
       tree with that data even if you don't see any direct way to use it in
       the output.

       In this way, when you want one more feature for POD, rather than write
       or fork a whole translator, a single inline "decorator" can be added.

       The "paf" utility provides a good starting point, which also allows you
       to hook in to an existing filter/transform library. Simply add a
       "Pod::Abstract::Filter" class to the namespace and it should start
       working as a "paf" command.

   EXAMPLE
       Suppose you are frustrated by the verbose list syntax used by regular
       POD. You might reasonably want to define a simplified list format for
       your own use, except POD formatters won't support it.

       With Pod::Abstract you can write an inline filter to convert:

        * item 1
        * item 2
        * item 3

       into:

        =over

        =item *

        item 1

        =item *

        item 2

        =item *

        item 3

        =back

       This transformation can be simply performed on the document tree. If
       your formatter does not use Pod::Abstract, you can simply pipe out POD
       and use a regular formatter. If your formatter supports Pod::Abstract
       though, then you can feed in the syntax tree directly without having to
       re-serialise and parse the document.

       In addition to this, because the source document is still valid Pod,
       you aren't breaking compatibility with regular perldoc just by making
       Pod::Abstract transformations.

   POD SUPPORT
       Pod::Abstract aims to support all POD rules defined in perlpodspec
       (even the ones I don't like), except for those directly related to
       formatting output, or which cannot be implemented generically.

COMPONENTS
       Pod::Abstract is comprised of:

       •   The parser, which loads a document tree for you.

           You should access this through "Pod::Abstract", not directly

       •   The document tree, which is the root node you are given by the
           parser. Calling pod on the root node should always give you back
           your original document.

           See Pod::Abstract::Node

       •   Pod::Abstract::Path, the node selection expression language. This
           is generally called by doing "$node->select(PATH_EXP)".
           Pod::Abstract::Path is the most complex and powerful component of
           this module, and if you're not using it you should be. ;)

           This allows you to ask questions like:

           "In the first head1 that starts with "A", find me the head2
           matching 'foo' with bold text somewhere in the preceding paragraph
           or heading"

            /head1[@heading=~{^A}](0)/head2[@heading=~{foo}i]<<head2 :paragraph[//:B]

           You probably don't need anything that complex, but it's there if
           you do.

       •   The node builder, Pod::Abstract::BuildNode

METHODS
   load_file
        my $pa = Pod::Abstract->load_file( FILENAME );

       Read the POD document in the named file. Returns the root node of the
       document.

   load_filehandle
        my $pa = Pod::Abstract->load_file( FH );

       Load a POD document from the provided filehandle reference. Returns the
       root node of the document.

   load_string
        my $pa = Pod::Abstract->load_string( STRING );

       Loads a POD document from a scalar string value. Returns the root node
       of the document.
