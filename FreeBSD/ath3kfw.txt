     Bluetooth USB devices

SYNOPSIS
     ath3kfw -d device_name -f firmware_path
     ath3kfw -h

DESCRIPTION
     The ath3kfw utility downloads the specified firmware file to the
     specified ugen(4) device.

     This utility will only work with Atheros AR3011 and AR3012 chip based
     Bluetooth USB devices.  The identification is currently based on USB
     vendor ID/product ID pair.  The vendor ID should be 0x0cf3
     (USB_VENDOR_ATHEROS2) and the product ID should be one of the supported

             Specify ugen(4) device name.

     I       Enable informational debugging.

     -f firmware_path

             upload.
