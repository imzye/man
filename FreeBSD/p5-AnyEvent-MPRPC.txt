NAME
       AnyEvent::MPRPC - Simple TCP-based MPRPC client/server

SYNOPSIS
           use AnyEvent::MPRPC;

           my $server = mprpc_server '127.0.0.1', '4423';
           $server->reg_cb(
               echo => sub {
                   my ($res_cv, @params) = @_;
                   $res_cv->result(@params);
               },
           );

           my $client = mprpc_client '127.0.0.1', '4423';
           my $d = $client->call( echo => 'foo bar' );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provide TCP-based MessagePack RPC server/client
       implementation.

       AnyEvent::MPRPC provide you a couple of export functions that are
       shortcut of AnyEvent::MPRPC::Client and AnyEvent::MPRPC::Server.  One
       is "mprpc_client" for Client, another is "mprpc_server" for Server.

FUNCTIONS
   mprpc_server $address, $port;
       Create AnyEvent::MPRPC::Server object and return it.

           AnyEvent::MPRPC::Server->new(
               address => $address,
               port    => $port,
           );

       See AnyEvent::MPRPC::Server for more detail.

   mprpc_client $hostname, $port
       Create AnyEvent::MPRPC::Client object and return it.

               host => $hostname,
               port => $port,
           );
