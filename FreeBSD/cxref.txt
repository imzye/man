NAME
       cxref-query - A program to query the cross reference database from
       cxref.


SYNOPSIS
       cxref-query [name _[ _... _name]] [-Odirname] [-Nbasename]
       [-xref[-all][-file][-func][-var][-type]]


DESCRIPTION
       A very simple program to query the cross-reference database that is
       created by the cxref program. This is intended to be an example of the
       information that is in the database and how to use it rather than a
       fully featured tool.


OPTIONS
       name   Names of objects to query.  The names that it looks up are the
              names of: Files, Variables, Functions, Typedefs

              If there are no names on the command line then the program
              enters interactive mode and prompts for names until an end of
              file (^D) is seen.

       -Odirname
              Use dirname as the input directory

       -Nbasename
              Use basename.* as the input filenames

       -xref  Produce cross referencing information (see below).
               -all    All cross references.
               -file   Cross references for files.
               -func   Cross references for functions.
               -var    Cross references for variables.
               -type   Cross references for types.


       The output depends on the -xref options but basically gives what is
       seen in the section of the document for the named object.
