sansi(1)                       General Commands                       sansi(1)

NAME
       sansi -- StripANSI; strip ANSI escape sequences/characters from text
       files

SYNTAX
       sansi < ANSIfied_textfile > unANSIfied_textfile

              Strips ANSI from ANSIfied_textfile. Where ANSIfied_textfile is
              the name of the textfile containing ANSI, and
              unANSIfied_textfile is a filehandle you've chosen for it's
              output (sansi redirects the filtered output to the filename
              you've chosen).

DESCRIPTION
       sansi was written to strip the ANSI control sequences in files, or
       output, often, but not limited to those generated by compilers. I found
       it difficult to visually grok/grep the output of script(1) sessions.
       Especially with the advent of clang. While it's nice to replay the
       script(1) sessions to view the highlighted messages. It's near
       impossible to read it inline in your favorite pager, or text editor;
       Enter sansi.

       ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
              John Marino
              It probably would have never occurred to me to release this,
              except that I thought it might help him, and the other
              committers. I hoped it might help him after all the
              [unintentional] grief I've caused him. Thanks for your patience,
              John!
