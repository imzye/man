MVS(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 MVS(4)

NAME
     mvs – Marvell Serial ATA Host Controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device scbus
           device mvs

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           mvs_load="YES"

     The following tunables are settable from the loader(8):

     hint.mvs.X.msi
     controls Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) usage by the specified
     controller.

     hint.mvs.X.ccc
     controls Command Completion Coalescing (CCC) usage by the specified
     controller.  Non-zero value enables CCC and defines maximum time (in us),
     request can wait for interrupt.  CCC reduces number of context switches
     on systems with many parallel requests, but it can decrease disk
     performance on some workloads due to additional command latency.

     hint.mvs.X.cccc
     defines number of completed commands for CCC, which trigger interrupt
     without waiting for specified coalescing timeout.

     hint.mvsch.X.pm_level
     controls SATA interface Power Management for the specified channel,
     allowing some power to be saved at the cost of additional command
     latency.  Possible values:

           0     interface Power Management is disabled (default);
           1     device is allowed to initiate PM state change, host is
                 passive;
           4     driver initiates PARTIAL PM state transition 1ms after port
                 becomes idle;
           5     driver initiates SLUMBER PM state transition 125ms after port
                 becomes idle.

     Note that interface Power Management is not compatible with device
     presence detection.  A manual bus reset is needed on device hot-plug.

     hint.mvsch.X.sata_rev
     setting to nonzero value limits maximum SATA revision (speed).  Values 1,
     2 and 3 are respectively 1.5, 3 and 6Gbps.

DESCRIPTION
     This driver provides the CAM(4) subsystem with native access to the SATA
     ports of several generations (Gen-I/II/IIe) of Marvell SATA controllers.
     Each SATA port found is represented to CAM as a separate bus with one
     target, or, if HBA supports Port Multipliers (Gen-II/IIe), 16 targets.
     Most of the bus-management details are handled by the SATA-specific
     transport of CAM.  Connected ATA disks are handled by the ATA protocol
     disk peripheral driver ada(4).  ATAPI devices are handled by the SCSI
     protocol peripheral drivers cd(4), da(4), sa(4), etc.

     Driver features include support for Serial ATA and ATAPI devices, Port
     Multipliers (including FIS-based switching, when supported), hardware
     command queues (up to 31 command per port), Native Command Queuing, SATA
     interface Power Management, device hot-plug and Message Signaled
     Interrupts.

HARDWARE
     The mvs driver supports the following controllers:

     Gen-I (SATA 1.5Gbps):
           •   88SX5040
           •   88SX5041
           •   88SX5080
           •   88SX5081

     Gen-II (SATA 3Gbps, NCQ, PMP):
           •   88SX6040
           •   88SX6041 (including Adaptec 1420SA)
           •   88SX6080
           •   88SX6081

     Gen-IIe (SATA 3Gbps, NCQ, PMP with FBS):
           •   88SX6042
           •   88SX7042 (including Adaptec 1430SA)
           •   88F5182 SoC
           •   88F6281 SoC
           •   MV78100 SoC

     Note, that this hardware supports command queueing and FIS-based
     switching only for ATA DMA commands.  ATAPI and non-DMA ATA commands
     executed one by one for each port.
