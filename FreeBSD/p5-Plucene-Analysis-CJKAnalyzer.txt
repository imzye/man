NAME
       Plucene::Analysis::CJKAnalyzer - Analyzer for CJK texts

SYNOPSIS
               # isa Plucene::Analysis::Analyzer

               my Plucene::Analysis::CJKAnalyzer $wt
                       = Plucene::Analysis::CJKAnalyzer->new(@args);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a text analyzer for analyzing CJK texts. Plucene does not
       support CJK texts natively. This module encodes terms in MIME::Base64
       format to get around this problem. Texts are assumbed to be in UTF-8
       encoding.

       See "cjk.t" in t for more details.

METHODS
   tokenstream
               my Plucene::Analysis::CJKAnalyzer Plucene::Analysis::ChineseAnalyzer->new(@args);

       Creates a TokenStream which tokenizes all the text in the provided
       Reader.
