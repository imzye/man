RBENV(1)                         Rbenv Manual                         RBENV(1)

NAME
       rbenv - manage your application's Ruby environment

SYNOPSIS
       rbenv <command> [<args>...]

DESCRIPTION
       rbenv respects the .ruby-version file in a project directory by making
       sure that any ruby, gem, bundle, or other Ruby command invocation
       automatically invokes the Ruby version configured for that project.

       It does so by generating shims for all Ruby executables. As long as
       rbenv shims directory is prepended to PATH, rbenv automatically ensures
       transparent switching between Ruby versions.

       rbenv looks for available Ruby versions in the $RBENV_ROOT/versions
       directory.

           The Ruby version name to be used

       RBENV_ROOT (default: ~/.rbenv)
           The location where rbenv discovers Ruby versions, plugins, and
           other configuration

       RBENV_DIR (default: $PWD)
           Directory to traverse bottom-up to locate the .ruby-version file

PLUGINS
       As its core functionality, rbenv only switches between Ruby versions
       and does nothing else, but offers a plugin mechanism to hook into and
       override almost any aspect of its default behavior.

       The most common plugin for rbenv is ruby-build which facilitates
       installing new Ruby versions into the $RBENV_ROOT/versions directory.
