NAME
       policy-test - Postfix Policy Daemon Testing Tool

SYNOPSIS
       policy-test [options...] unix:/file/path policy-test [options...]
       inet:hostname:port

        -h, --help              display this help and exit
            --version           output version information and exit
        -v, --verbose           increase verbosity level

DESCRIPTION
       policy-test is a script that converts Postfix log entries on the
       standard input into requests to the Postfix policy daemon given as the
       first argument. It can be used for:

       Testing the performance of a policy daemon
       Pre-seeding a Greylist policy daemon with data from the logs

       Note that this program is still in its very early stages of development
       and does only support a small subset of the normal attributes used in
       the Postfix policy delegation protocol. It basically supports the bare
       minimum to make it work with Postgrey.

       Also note that a non-standard attribute is being generated:
       policy_test_time contains the Unix timestamp of when the client
       connected.
