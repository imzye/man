NAME
       Pod::Elemental - work with nestable Pod elements

VERSION
       version 0.103006

SYNOPSIS
         use Pod::Elemental;
         use Pod::Elemental::Transformer::Pod5;

         my $document = Pod::Elemental->read_file('lib/Pod/Elemental.pm');

         Pod::Elemental::Transformer::Pod5->new->transform_node($document);

         print $document->as_debug_string, "\n"; # quick overview of doc structure

         print $document->as_pod_string, "\n";   # reproduce the document in Pod

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::Elemental is a system for treating a Pod (plain old documentation)
       documents as trees of elements.  This model may be familiar from many
       other document systems, especially the HTML DOM.  Pod::Elemental's
       document object model is much less sophisticated than the HTML DOM, but
       still makes a lot of document transformations easy.

       In general, you'll want to read in a Pod document and then perform a
       number of prepackaged transformations on it.  The most common of these
       will be the Pod5 transformation, which assumes that the basic meaning
       of Pod commands described in the Perl 5 documentation hold: "=begin",
       "=end", and "=for" commands mark regions of the document, leading
       whitespace marks a verbatim paragraph, and so on.  The Pod5 transformer
       also eliminates the need to track elements representing vertical
       whitespace.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

ATTRIBUTES
   event_reader
       The event reader (by default a new instance of Pod::Eventual::Simple is
       used to convert input into an event stream.  In general, it should
       provide "read_*" methods that behave like Pod::Eventual::Simple.

   objectifier
       The objectifier (by default a new Pod::Elemental::Objectifier) must
       provide an "objectify_events" method that converts Pod events into
       Pod::Elemental::Element objects.

   document_class
       This is the class for documents created by reading pod.

METHODS
   read_handle
   read_file
   read_string
       These methods read the given input and return a
       Pod::Elemental::Document.
