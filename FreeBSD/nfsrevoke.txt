NFSREVOKE(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           NFSREVOKE(8)

NAME
     nfsrevoke – revoke NFS V4 client

SYNOPSIS
     nfsrevoke ClientId

DESCRIPTION
     nfsrevoke This command is used by a system administrator to revoke a
     client's access to the NFS Version 4 server. All Open/Lock state held by
     the client will be released.  After revocation, the client will no longer
     be able to use state on the server until it does a fresh
     SetClientID/SetClientIDConfirm operations sequence.  THIS SHOULD BE DONE
     AS A LAST RESORT ONLY, when clients are holding state that must be
     released on the server.

     The ClientId argument is a hexadecimal string, which is the last field of
     the nfsdumpstate(8) command's -o and -l options output.

HISTORY
     The nfsrevoke command was introduced as a part of the experimental nfs
     server subsystem.
