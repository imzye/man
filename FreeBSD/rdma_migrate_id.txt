RDMA_MIGRATE_ID(3)       Librdmacm Programmer's Manual      RDMA_MIGRATE_ID(3)



NAME
       rdma_migrate_id - Move a communication identifier to a different event
       channel.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>

       int rdma_migrate_id (struct rdma_cm_id *id, struct rdma_event_channel
       *channel);

ARGUMENTS
       id          An existing communication identifier to migrate.

       channel     The communication channel that events associated with the
                   allocated rdma_cm_id will be reported on.  May be NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       Migrates a communication identifier to a different event channel.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       This routine migrates a communication identifier to the specified event
       channel and moves any pending events associated with the rdma_cm_id to
       the new channel.  Users should not poll for events on the rdma_cm_id's
       current event channel or invoke other routines on the rdma_cm_id while
       migrating between channels.  This call will block while there are any
       unacknowledged events on the current event channel.

       If the channel parameter is NULL, the specified rdma_cm_id will be
       placed into synchronous operation mode.  All calls on the id will block
       until the operation completes.
