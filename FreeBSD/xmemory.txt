NAME
       xmemory - game of memory for several players

SYNOPSIS
       xmemory <options>

DESCRIPTION
       XMemory is a multi player memory game. It is played simultaenously on
       several X Displays, which have to be listed on the command-line.  To
       run properly, the access to the selected X Displays must be allowed.
       This can be achieved in the usual manner by running xhost on the
       desired displays.


RULES
       Like in the traditional memory game, the players have to find similar
       tiles on the table to get the tiles. The main change in this version
       is, that the players play simultaenously and therefor the whole game
       gets some kind of an action game.

       Opening a tile leads to a lock of the tile for about 3 seconds when
       opening the first tile. 1 second after opening the second tile, both
       tiles flip back and therefor are accessable again for all other
       players. (In synchronous mode the 1st tile remains opened until the
       second tile is selected)

       Winner is the player who collected the most matching tiles.


OPTIONS
   Tile Selection
       -pictures   The tiles are switched from the default Smileys to the
                   default set of picture tiles.  Use -help to check, if there
                   are any picture packages installed on your system.

       -file name  Use the picture file name for creating the tiles

       -letter     The tiles are switched from the default Smileys to a normal
                   letter mode.


   Game Selection
       -small      small amount of tiles

       -normal     normal amount of tiles (default)

       -big        large amount of tiles

       -remain     leave tiles on screen after match. Tiles will only remain
                   on the screen of the player who found the match.

       -sync       play the traditional game where only one player can select
                   at a time.

       -tile <w>x<h>
                   set number of tiles explicitly, which overrides the other
                   size selection options.  The total amount of tiles has to
                   be even.

       -lock <n>   locks the size of picture images to n perecent of the
                   original size. This might be usefull for better results,
                   since the images are stored in an pre-dithered format and
                   are scaled in the most primitive way, so that there might
                   be undesired effects, when scaling to odd amounts.


   Fonts
       -font name  Override the default pattern '-adobe-courier-bold-r-
                   normal-*' to search for a different set of fonts in letter
                   or smiley game. The program tries to use scalable fonts on
                   the displays, when bitmap fonts in the necessary size can't
                   be found. If the fonts don't look pretty, check out if the
                   fontserver fs (or xfs) is running on the display.


   Player Selection
       <display>   Each name of a display (containing a colon) activates a
                   player on that screen. The total amount of players is
                   internally limited to 10.

       <display>/<color>
                   A display name can be extended by a color specification.
                   Otherwise, a default color is selected for that player.

       -color<n> <name>
                   The color for player n can be set explicitly to name even
                   so previous option is the easier way to achive this.
