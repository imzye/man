NAME
       cdm - CP/M disk manager

SYNOPSIS
       cdm file...

DESCRIPTION
       cdm gives access to the CP/M disk images used by yaze(1).  With cdm you
       can create disks, copy files to and from the Unix file system, list
       files and erase files from the CP/M disk.

OPTIONS
       Any files listed on the cdm command line are taken to be existing CP/M
       disk files and they are mounted successively to drive A, B, C, ... etc.

       The format of CP/M disk files (<CPM_Disk>) is described in yaze.doc and
       yaze-ag.doc.

INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
       The interactive interface to cdm mimics an extended CP/M clone.  The
       current disk and user number appear in the prompt and can be changed by
       entering DU: as a command, where D is any mounted disk letter (a .. p)
       and U is a user number (cdm allows 0 .. 31, although you should
       restrict yourself to numbers under 16 to remain compatible with CP/M).

       DU: can also be prefixed to any filename, to indicate that it is not on
       the current disk/user.  Two pseudo disks can be referenced in the copy
       command: u and t.  These refer to files in the Unix file-system.
       `u:file' refers to a binary Unix file and `t:file' refers to a text
       Unix file.  The difference is that u: files are copied verbatim whereas
       t: files undergo CRLF and ^Z processing appropriate for the copy
       direction (to or from CP/M).

       Command names can be shortened to a unique abbreviation.  If cdm was
       compiled with GNU Readline, command-line editing, filename completion
       and history recall are available - see the readline documentation.
