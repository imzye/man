CHMOD(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               CHMOD(1)

NAME
     chmod – change file modes

SYNOPSIS
     chmod [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] mode file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The chmod utility modifies the file mode bits of the listed files as
     specified by the mode operand.

     The options are as follows:

     -f      Do not display a diagnostic message if chmod could not modify the
             mode for file, nor modify the exit status to reflect such
             failures.

     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
             are followed and hence unaffected by the command.  (Symbolic
             links encountered during tree traversal are not followed.)

     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the mode of the link
             itself rather than the file that the link points to.

     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
             This is the default.

     -R      Change the modes of the file hierarchies rooted in the files,
             instead of just the files themselves.  Beware of unintentionally
             matching the “..” hard link to the parent directory when using
             wildcards like “.*”.

     -v      Cause chmod to be verbose, showing filenames as the mode is
             modified.  If the -v flag is specified more than once, the old
             and new modes of the file will also be printed, in both octal and
             symbolic notation.

     The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.
     In addition, these options override each other and the command's actions
     are determined by the last one specified.

     If chmod receives a SIGINFO signal (see the status argument for stty(1)),
     then the current filename as well as the old and new modes are displayed.

     Only the owner of a file or the super-user is permitted to change the
     mode of a file.

EXIT STATUS
     The chmod utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

MODES
     Modes may be absolute or symbolic.  An absolute mode is an octal number
     constructed from the sum of one or more of the following values:

           4000    (the setuid bit).  Executable files with this bit set will
                   run with effective uid set to the uid of the file owner.
                   Directories with this bit set will force all files and sub-
                   directories created in them to be owned by the directory
                   owner and not by the uid of the creating process, if the
                   underlying file system supports this feature: see chmod(2)
                   and the suiddir option to mount(8).
           2000    (the setgid bit).  Executable files with this bit set will
                   run with effective gid set to the gid of the file owner.
           1000    (the sticky bit).  See chmod(2) and sticky(7).
           0400    Allow read by owner.
           0200    Allow write by owner.
           0100    For files, allow execution by owner.  For directories,
                   allow the owner to search in the directory.
           0040    Allow read by group members.
           0020    Allow write by group members.
           0010    For files, allow execution by group members.  For
                   directories, allow group members to search in the
                   directory.
           0004    Allow read by others.
           0002    Allow write by others.
           0001    For files, allow execution by others.  For directories
                   allow others to search in the directory.

     For example, the absolute mode that permits read, write and execute by
     the owner, read and execute by group members, read and execute by others,
     and no set-uid or set-gid behaviour is 755 (400+200+100+040+010+004+001).

     The symbolic mode is described by the following grammar:

           mode         ::= clause [, clause ...]
           clause       ::= [who ...] [action ...] action
           action       ::= op [perm ...]
           who          ::= a | u | g | o
           op           ::= + | - | =
           perm         ::= r | s | t | w | x | X | u | g | o

     The who symbols ``u'', ``g'', and ``o'' specify the user, group, and
     other parts of the mode bits, respectively.  The who symbol ``a'' is
     equivalent to ``ugo''.

     The perm symbols represent the portions of the mode bits as follows:

           r       The read bits.
           s       The set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution
                   bits.
           t       The sticky bit.
           w       The write bits.
           x       The execute/search bits.
           X       The execute/search bits if the file is a directory or any
                   of the execute/search bits are set in the original
                   (unmodified) mode.  Operations with the perm symbol ``X''
                   are only meaningful in conjunction with the op symbol
                   ``+'', and are ignored in all other cases.
           u       The user permission bits in the original mode of the file.
           g       The group permission bits in the original mode of the file.
           o       The other permission bits in the original mode of the file.

     The op symbols represent the operation performed, as follows:

     +     If no value is supplied for perm, the ``+'' operation has no
           effect.  If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit
           specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode
           creation mask (see umask(2)) is clear, is set.  Otherwise, the mode
           bits represented by the specified who and perm values are set.

     -     If no value is supplied for perm, the ``-'' operation has no
           effect.  If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit
           specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file mode
           creation mask is clear, is cleared.  Otherwise, the mode bits
           represented by the specified who and perm values are cleared.

     =     The mode bits specified by the who value are cleared, or, if no who
           value is specified, the owner, group and other mode bits are
           cleared.  Then, if no value is supplied for who, each permission
           bit specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the file
           mode creation mask is clear, is set.  Otherwise, the mode bits
           represented by the specified who and perm values are set.

     Each clause specifies one or more operations to be performed on the mode
     bits, and each operation is applied to the mode bits in the order
     specified.

     Operations upon the other permissions only (specified by the symbol ``o''
     by itself), in combination with the perm symbols ``s'' or ``t'', are
     ignored.

     The ``w'' permission on directories will permit file creation,
     relocation, and copy into that directory.  Files created within the
     directory itself will inherit its group ID.

EXAMPLES
     644           make a file readable by anyone and writable by the owner
                   only.

     go-w          deny write permission to group and others.

     =rw,+X        set the read and write permissions to the usual defaults,
                   but retain any execute permissions that are currently set.

     +X            make a directory or file searchable/executable by everyone
                   if it is already searchable/executable by anyone.

     755
     u=rwx,go=rx
     u=rwx,go=u-w  make a file readable/executable by everyone and writable by
                   the owner only.

     go=           clear all mode bits for group and others.

     g=u-w         set the group bits equal to the user bits, but clear the
                   group write bit.

COMPATIBILITY
     The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.

STANDARDS
     The chmod utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”)
     compatible with the exception of the perm symbol “t” which is not
     included in that standard.

HISTORY
     A chmod command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.

BUGS
     There is no perm option for the naughty bits of a horse.
