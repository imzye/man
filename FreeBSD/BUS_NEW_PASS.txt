BUS_NEW_PASS(9)        FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual       BUS_NEW_PASS(9)

NAME
     BUS_NEW_PASS – notify a bus that the pass level has been changed

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void
     BUS_NEW_PASS(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     The BUS_NEW_PASS() method is called on each bus device to rescan the
     device tree when the pass level has been changed.  This method is
     responsible for invoking BUS_NEW_PASS on child bus devices to propagate
     the rescan to child devices.  It is also responsible for reprobing any
     unattached child devices and allowing drivers for the current pass to
     identify new children.  A default implementation is provided by
     bus_generic_new_pass(9).
