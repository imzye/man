NAME
       Log::Dump - simple logger mainly for debugging

SYNOPSIS
           use Log::Dump; # installs 'log' and other methods

           # class log
           __PACKAGE__->log( error => 'foo' );

           # object log
           sub some_method {
             my $self = shift;

             # you can pass multiple messages (will be concatenated)
             # and objects (will be dumped via L<Data::Dump>).
             $self->log( info => 'my self is ', $self );
           }

           # you can control which log should be shown by labels.
           sub broken_method {
             my $self = shift;

             $self->logfilter('broken_only');
             $self->log( broken_only => 'shown' );
             $self->log( debug       => 'not shown' );
           }

           # you can log to a file
           __PACKAGE__->logfile('log.txt');
           __PACKAGE__->log( file => 'will be saved' );
           __PACKAGE__->logfile('');  # to close

           # you can color logs to stderr
           sub important_method {
             my $self = shift;
             $self->logcolor( important => 'bold red on_white' );
             $self->log( important => 'bold red message' );
             $self->logcolor(0);  # no color
           }

           # you can log with timestamp
           __PACKAGE__->logtime(1);
           $self->log( $ENV{REMOTE_ADDR} => 'foo' );
           __PACKAGE__->logtime(0); # hide timestamp

           # you can turn off the logging; set to true to turn on.
           __PACKAGE__->logger(0);

           # or you can use better loggers (if they have a 'log' method)
           __PACKAGE__->logger( Log::Dispatch->new );

DESCRIPTION
       Log::Dump is a simple logger mix-in mainly for debugging. This installs
       six methods into a caller (the class that "use"d Log::Dump) via
       Sub::Install. The point is you don't need to load extra dumper modules
       or you don't need to concatenate messages. Just log things and they
       will be dumped (and concatenated if necessary) to stderr, and to a file
       if you prefer. Also, you can use these logging methods as class methods
       or object methods (though usually you don't want to mix them,
       especially when you're doing something special).

METHODS
   log
       logs things to stderr. The first argument (other than class/object) is
       considered as a label for the messages, and will be wrapped with square
       blackets. Objects in the messages will be dumped through Data::Dump,
       and multiple messages will be concatenated. And usually line
       feed/carriage return will be appended.

       The "fatal" label is special: if you log things with this label, the
       logger croaks the messages (and usually the program will die).

       Also, if you log things with "error" or "warn" labels, the logger carps
       the messages (with a line number and a file name).

       Other labels have no special meaning for the logger, but as you can
       filter some of the logs with these labels, try using meaningful ones
       for you.

       Note that these special labels doesn't work with custom loggers.
       Actually, you can pass anything to "log" method to conform to your
       logger's requirement.

   logger
       turns on/off the logger if you set this to true/false (preferably, 1/0
       to avoid confusion). And if you set a class name (or an object) that
       provides "log" method, it will be used while logging.

   logfilter
       If you specify some labels through this, only logs with those labels
       will be shown. Set a false value to disable this filtering.

   logfile
       If you want to log to a file, set a file name, and an optional open
       mode for IO::File ("w" for write by default). When you set a false
       value, the opened file will be closed. Note that this doesn't disable
       logging to stderr. Logs will be dumped both to stderr and to a file
       while the file is open.

   logcolor
       If you want to color logs to stderr, provide a label and its color
       specification (actually a hash of them) to "logcolor". Then, log will
       be colored (if Term::ANSIColor is installed and your terminal supports
       the specification). If you set a false scalar, coloring will be
       disabled. See Term::ANSIColor for color specifications.

   logtime
       If you set this to true, timestamp will be prepended. You can pass a
       strftime format if you need finer control. Set a false value to disable
       this timestamp.
