DESCRIPTION
       libjodycode is a software code library containing code shared among
       several of the programs written by Jody Bruchon such as imagepile,
       jdupes, winregfs, and zeromerge. These shared pieces of code were
       copied between each program as they were updated. As the number of
       programs increased and keeping these pieces of code synced became more
       annoying, the decision was made to combine all of them into a single
       reusable shared library.
