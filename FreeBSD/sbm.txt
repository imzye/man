NAME
     sbm – simple bandwidth monitor

SYNOPSIS
     sbm [-B | -t] [-c count] [-d delay] [-i interface]

DESCRIPTION
     sbm is a simple bandwidth monitor.

OPTIONS
     -B            Show values in bytes instead of bits in default output.

     -c count      Stop monitoring after count samples.  If count is 0, it
                   will loop forever.  This is the default.

     -d delay      Sample interface statistics every delay ms.  The default
                   delay is 1000 ms.

     -i interface  Monitor the selected interface.  If not provided the first
                   active, non-loopback interface will be used.

     -t            Enable terse output.  The first pair of values is Rx/Tx in
                   bits per second and the second pair is Rx/Tx in packets per
                   second.

SIGNALS
     If sbm receives a SIGINFO (usually set to ‘^T’) signal (or SIGUSR1 on
     Linux), the accumulated amount of data transmitted for Rx and Tx and the
     time since the program started will be printed to the standard output.
