       taskd -v|--version

DESCRIPTION
       Taskserver is a sync server for Taskwarrior and related products.


COMMANDS
       Taskserver supports several commands, which provide administrative
       capabilities.  The commands are:


       taskd init [--data <root>] [options]
              Performs a one-time initialization of the Taskserver instance.
              Creates the bare data structure.  Either '--data <root>' must be
              specified, or TASKDDATA must be set.


       taskd help <command> [options]
              Provides option and syntax help for each command.


       taskd config [options] [--data <root>] [--force] [<name> [<value>]]
              Allows modification of the taskd configuration.  Can add,
              remove, modify or list all configuration settings.  Either
              '--data <root>' must be specified, or TASKDDATA must be set.


       taskd server [--daemon] [options]
              Starts the server in daemon or TTY mode.  While there is no
              interactivity, the difference is whether taskd is attached to a
              TTY or not.

              Note that sending the HUP signal to the taskd server causes a
              configuration file reload before the next request is handled.


       taskd add [--data <root>] org <org>

       taskd add [--data <root>] group <org> <group>

       taskd add [--data <root>] user <org> <user>
              Adds organizations, groups and users.  Either '--data <root>'
              must be specified, or TASKDDATA must be set.


       taskd remove [--data <root>] org <org>

       taskd remove [--data <root>] group <org> <group>

       taskd remove [--data <root>] user <org> <user>
              Removes organizations, groups and users.  Either '--data <root>'
              must be specified, or TASKDDATA must be set.


       taskd suspend [--data <root>] org <org>

       taskd suspend [--data <root>] group <org> <group>

       taskd suspend [--data <root>] user <org> <user>
              Suspends organizations, groups and users.  Either '--data
              <root>' must be specified, or TASKDDATA must be set.


       taskd resume [--data <root>] org <org>

       taskd resume [--data <root>] group <org> <group>

       taskd resume [--data <root>] user <org> <user>
              Resumes organizations, groups and users.  Either '--data <root>'
              must be specified, or TASKDDATA must be set.


       taskd diagnostics
              Displays diagnostic information important when reporting bugs.


       taskd validate <JSON | file>
              Parses the quoted JSON string or JSON file.  Useful for
              debugging JSON that is generated by Taskserver clients.


       taskd client [options] <host:port> <file> [<file> ...]
              Sends the Taskserver request in <file> to <host:port>. Options
              specified must include ca.cert (for self-signed certs),
              client.cert, client.key.


COMMON OPTIONS
       Most commands support the following options:


       --NAME=VALUE
              Temporary configuration override.


       --force
              Does not ask for confirmation of changes.


       --quiet
              Suppresses verbose output.


       --debug
              Shows debugging information.


       --data <root>
              Many commands require the location of the data root, so either
              it must be provided as shown, or via the TASKDDATA environment
              variable.


CONFIGURATION
       The Taskserver configuration file can be found in the top level of the
       data root.  It is recommended that the 'taskd config' command is used
       to manipulate this file.

       Note that any configuration variable may be overridden on the command
       line using this syntax:

         $ taskd server --NAME=VALUE

       In all commands but one, this will _temporarily_ override the value,
       but with the 'init' command, which creates a config file, overrides are
       made permanent.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Environment variables provide values that would otherwise be required
       at the command line.


       TASKDDATA=<root>
              Most command require either '--data <root>' or this environment
              variable.  If both are provided, the command line overrides the
              environment.
