NAME
       Regexp::Copy - copy Regexp objects

SYNOPSIS
         use Regexp::Copy qw( re_copy );

         my $re1 = qr/Hello!/;
         my $re2 = qr/Goodbye!/;

         re_copy($re1, $re2);

         print "ok\n" if 'Goodbye!' =~ $re1;

DESCRIPTION
       "Regexp::Copy" allows you to copy the contents of one Regexp object to
       another.  A problem that I have found with the qr// operator is that
       the Regexp objects that it creates are is impossible to dereference.
       This causes problems if you want to change the data in the regexp
       without losing the reference to it.  Its impossible.  Regexp::Copy
       allows you to change the Regexp by copying one object created through
       qr// to another.

       This module came about through discussions on the London.pm mailing
       list in regards to attempts various people had made to serialize
       objects with qr// created Regexp objects in them.  The Regex::Copy
       distribution also loads Regexp::Storable, which provides hooks to allow
       the Storable persistence method to freeze and thaw Regexp objects
       created by qr//.

FUNCTIONS
       re_copy(FROM, TO)
           The "re_copy" function copies the regular expression magic
           contained within the variable FROM to the variable named in TO.

THANKS TO
       Piers Cawley, who provided the magic Pixie::Info code, that forms the
       basis of Regexp::Copy.
