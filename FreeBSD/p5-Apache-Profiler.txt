NAME
       Apache2::Profiler - profiles time seconds needed for every request

SYNOPSIS
         <Location /cgi-bin>
         PerlInitHandler Apache2::Profiler
         </Location>

DESCRIPTION
       Apache2::Profiler is a mod_perl init (and cleanup) handler to profile
       time taken to process one request. Profiled data is reported to the
       Apache Log file. It'd be useful to profile some heavy application
       taking a long time to proceed.

       Apache2::Profiler is for "mod_perl" version 2.0 or later.  If you are
       using "mod_perl" version 1.x, you need Apache::Profiler instead.

       It uses Time::HiRes to take milliseconds, and outputs profiled data as
       Apache log "notice" level like:

         [Tue Oct  7 20:52:53 2003] [notice] [client 127.0.0.1] uri: /test.html takes 0.0648910999298096 seconds

CONFIGURATION
       ProfileLongerThan
             PerlSetVar ProfileLongerThan 0.5

           specifies lower limit of request time taken to profile. This
           example only logs requests which takes longer than 0.5 seconds.
           This value is set to 0 by default, which means it logs all
           requests.

TODO
       •   customizable log format (exportable to some profiling tools)

       •   profiles CPU time rather than "gettimeofday"

       patches are always welcome!
