DHTTPD(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              DHTTPD(1)



DHTTPD
       dhttpd - Minimal Webserver without Cgi-bin support.

SYNOPSIS
       dhttpd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       dhttpd is a program that started out as a small project to write a
       simple server that could not be hacked, i.e. one that doesn't allow cgi
       scripts, and one that didn't require a permanent IP address to use
       properly.  When this server was completed and it was in working
       condition, it was  realized that it was memory efficient, low profile,
       quick, and served the one need for an HTTP daemon: to transmit files.

       The document root is /usr/local/www/data.

       To enable dhttp, add 'dhttpd_enable="YES"' to /etc/rc.conf.  If you
       want to change the default port from 80 to another port, add
       ´dhhtdp_flags="- p <PORT>"´ to /etc/rc.conf.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -p portnum
              Set the port the web server runs on
