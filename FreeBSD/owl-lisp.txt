NAME
       ol - an Owl Lisp compiler and interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       ol [options] [path] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Owl Lisp is a purely functional variant of R7RS Scheme. Ol can be used
       to evaluate programs interactively and compile them to native binaries
       via C.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of essential command
       line flats options is included below.  The complete list is shown on
       the help page.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       -e, --eval string
              Evaluate the string, print it's value, and exit with 0 unless
              errors occurred.

       -t, --test string
              Evaluate the string and exit with 1 if the value is #false, 0 if
              it's true, or 126 if there is an error.

       -o, --output output-file
              Compile the given file to fasl or C code, and save the result to
              the given output file.

       -r, --run path
              Load the file silently, and call the last value with the
              remaining command line arguments.

       -x, --output-format format
              Choose what ol should compile the given input to. Valid options
              are currently c and fasl. This is normally deduced from the file
              suffix given in -o, and is thus not usually needed.

       -O0, -O1, -O2
              Write plain bytecode, compile some common functions to C or
              everything possible. These only make sense when compiling to C.

       -l, --load path
              Resume execution of program state saved with suspend.

EXAMPLES
       Make a simple binary
               $ echo '(lambda (args) (for-each print args))' > test.l
               $ ol -o test.c test.l
               $ gcc -o test test.c
               $ ./test foo bar

       Compile in a pipe
              $ echo '(lambda (args) (print (cons "I got " args)))' | ol -x c
              -o - | gcc -x c -o test - && ./test 11 22 33

       Loading vs running files
               $ echo '(print "Hello, world!")' > test.l
               $ ol test.l
               Hello, world!
               $ echo '(lambda (args) (print "Hello, world!"))' > test.l
               $ ol --run test.l arg1 arg2 arg3
               Hello, world!
