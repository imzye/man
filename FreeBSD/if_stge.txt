STGE(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                STGE(4)

NAME
     stge – Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device stge

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_stge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The stge device driver provides support for various NICs based on the
     Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet controller chip.

     The Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 is found on the D-Link DGE-550T and the
     Antares Microsystems Gigabit Ethernet board.  It uses an external PHY or
     an external 10-bit interface.

     All NICs supported by the stge driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload
     for both receive and transmit, hardware VLAN tag stripping/insertion
     features, and receive interrupt moderation mechanism as well as a 64-bit
     multicast hash filter.  The Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 supports TBI (ten
     bit interface) and GMII transceivers, which means it can be used with
     either copper or 1000baseX fiber applications.

     The Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 also supports jumbo frames, which can be
     configured via the interface MTU setting.  Selecting an MTU larger than
     1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to receive
     and transmit jumbo frames.

     The stge driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option
                      can also be used to select either full-duplex or
                      half-duplex modes.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The ifconfig(8)
                      mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                      full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     1000baseTX       Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.  The
                      Sundance/Tamarack supports 1000Mbps in autoselect mode
                      only.

     The stge driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The stge driver provides support for various NICs based on the
     Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 based Gigabit Ethernet controller chips,
     including:

     •   Antares Microsystems Gigabit Ethernet
     •   ASUS NX1101 Gigabit Ethernet
     •   D-Link DL-4000 Gigabit Ethernet
     •   IC Plus IP1000A Gigabit Ethernet
     •   Sundance ST-2021 Gigabit Ethernet
     •   Sundance ST-2023 Gigabit Ethernet
     •   Sundance TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet
     •   Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     dev.stge.%d.rxint_nframe
             Number of frames between RxDMAComplete interrupts.  The accepted
             range is 1 to 255, default value is 8 frames.  The interface has
             to be brought down and up again before a change takes effect.

     dev.stge.%d.rxint_dmawait
             Maximum amount of time to wait in 1us increments before issuing
             an Rx interrupt if the number of frames received is less than
             rxint_nframe.  The accepted range is 0 to 4194, default value is
             30 microseconds.  The interface has to be brought down and up
             again before a change takes effect.
