DESCRIPTION
       wemux enhances tmux to make multi-user terminal multiplexing both
       easier and more powerful. It allows users to host a wemux session and
       have clients join in either:

       Mirror Mode gives clients (another SSH user on your machine) read-only
       access to the session, allowing them to see you work, or

       Pair Mode allows the client and yourself to work in the same terminal
       (shared cursor) or work independently in another window (separate
       cursors) in the same tmux session.

       It features multi-session support as well as user listing and
       notifications when users attach/detach.

HOST COMMANDS
   wemux start
       Start a wemux session, chmod /tmp/wemux-wemux to 1777 so that other
       users may connect to it, and attach to it. If a wemux session already
       exists, it will attach to it instead.

   wemux attach
       Attach to an existing wemux session.

   wemux stop
       Kill the wemux session and remove the /tmp/wemux-wemux socket.

   wemux kick <var>username</var>
       Kick an SSH user from the server and remove their wemux pair sessions.

   wemux config
       Open /usr/local/etc/wemux/wemux.conf in your $EDITOR.

   wemux
       When wemux is run without any arguments in host mode, it is just like
       running wemux start. It will reattach to an existing wemux session if
       it exists, otherwise it will start a new session.

CLIENT COMMANDS
   wemux mirror
       Attach to session in read-only mode.

   wemux pair
       Attach to session in pair mode, which allows editing.

   wemux rogue
       Attach to server in rogue mode, which allows editing and switching to
       windows independently from the host.

   wemux logout
       Remove your pair mode session.

   wemux
       When wemux is run without any arguments in client mode, its behavior
       attempts to intelligently select mirror, pair or rogue:

       •   If the client does not have an existing rogue session it will
           attach to the wemux session in pair mode.

       •   If the client has already started a wemux rogue mode session, it
           will reattach to the session in rogue mode.

       •   By setting default_client_mode="rogue" in wemux.conf this can be
           changed to always join in pair mode, even if a pair session doesn´t
           already exist.




   Other Commands
       wemux passes commands it doesn´t understand through to tmux with the
       correct socket setting.

       wemux list-sessions is equivalent to entering tmux -S /tmp/wemux-wemux
       list-sessions

USER LIST
       wemux can display a list of connected users, indicating users in mirror
       mode with [m] at the end of their name.

       If you´d like to see a list of all users currently connected to the
       wemux session, you have three options:

   wemux users
       Enter wemux users in the terminal to display a list of all currently
       connected wemux users.



           $ wemux users
           Users connected to ´wemux´:
             1. zolrath
             2. csagan[m]




   Status Bar
       You can add the user list to your status bar by adding #(wemux
       status_users) where you see fit by editing your ~/tmux.conf file.



           set -g status-right "#(wemux status_users)"




   Display Message
       If you´d rather display users on command via a tmux message, similar to
       the user attachment/detachment messages, you can do so by editing your
       ~/tmux.conf file. Pick whatever key you´d like to bind the displaying
       the message to. Using t as an example:



           unbind t
           bind t run-shell ´wemux display_users´




       Note that the tmux prefix should be pressed before t to activate the
       command.

       User listing can be disabled by setting allow_user_list="false" in
       wemux.conf

   Short-form Commands
       All commands have a short form. s for start, a for attach, p for pair
       etc. For a complete list, type wemux help (or wemux h)

MULTI-HOST MODE
       wemux supports specifying the joining different wemux sessions via
       wemux join <session>. This allows multiple hosts on the same machine to
       host their own independent wemux sessions with their own clients. By
       default this option is disabled.

       wemux will remember the last session specified to in order to make
       reconnecting to the same session easy. wemux help will output the
       currently specified session along with the wemux command list.

       Changing sessions can be enabled by setting allow_session_change="true"
       in /usr/local/etc/wemux/wemux.conf

   Joining Different wemux Sessions
       To change the wemux session run wemux join <session>. The name will be
       sanitized to contain no spaces or uppercase letters.



           $ wemux join Project X
           Changed wemux session from ´wemux´ to ´project-x´
           $ wemux start
           $ wemux
           $ wemux stop
           $ wemux reset
           Changed wemux session from ´project-x´ to ´wemux´




   wemux join <var>sessionname</var>
       Join wemux session with specified name.



           $ wemux join rails
           Changed wemux session from ´wemux´ to ´rails´




   wemux join <var>sessionnumber</var>
       Alternatively, enter the session number displayed next to the session
       name in wemux list.



           $ wemux j 1
           Changed wemux session from ´rails´ to ´project-x´




   wemux join
       Join with no argument simply displays the current wemux server, if
       you´re into that.



           $ wemux join
           Current wemux server: wemux




   Resetting the Session Name
       In order to easily return to the default session you can run wemux
       reset

   wemux reset
       Joins the default wemux session: wemux (or value of
       default_session_name in wemux.conf)



           $ wemux reset
           Changed wemux session from ´project-x´ to ´wemux´




   Active Session List
       To list the name of all currently running wemux sessions run wemux list

   wemux list
       List all currently active wemux sessions.



           $ wemux list
           Currently active wemux sessions:
             1. project-x
             2. rails
             3. wemux    <- current session




       wemux join and wemux stop both accept either the name of a session or
       the number indicated next to the name in wemux list.

       Listing sessions can be disabled by setting allow_session_list="false"
       in /usr/local/etc/wemux/wemux.conf

CONFIGURATION
       There are a number of additional options that be configured in
       /usr/local/etc/wemux/wemux.conf. In most cases the only option that
       must be changed is the host_list array. To open your wemux
       configuration file, you can either open /usr/local/etc/wemux/wemux.conf
       manually or run wemux config An example configuration file is available
       at $(DOCDIR)/wemux.conf.example.

   Host Mode
       To have an account act as host, ensure that you have added their
       username to the /usr/local/etc/wemux/wemux.conf file´s host_list array.



           host_list=(zolrath hostusername brocksamson)




   Pair Mode
       Pair mode can be disabled, only allowing clients to attach to the
       session in mirror mode by setting allow_pair_mode="false"

   Rogue Mode
       Rogue mode can be disabled, only allowing clients to attach to the
       server in mirror or pair mode by setting allow_rogue_mode="false"

   Default Client Mode
       When clients enter ´wemux´ with no arguments by default it will first
       attempt to join an existing rogue mode session. If there is no rogue
       session it will start in pair mode. By setting default_client_mode to
       "rogue", ´wemux´ with no arguments will always join a rogue mode
       session, even if it has to create it.

       This can be changed by setting default_client_mode="rogue"

   Default Session Name
       The default wemux session name will be used with wemux reset and when
       allow_session_change is not enabled in wemux.conf.

       This can be changed by setting default_session_name="customname"

   Changing Sessions
       The ability to change sessions can be enabled by setting
       allow_session_change="true"

   Listing Sessions
       Listing sessions can be disabled by setting allow_session_list="false"

   Listing Users
       Listing users can be disabled by setting allow_user_list="false" in
       wemux.conf

   Kicking SSH Users
       Kicking SSH users from the server can be disabled by setting
       allow_kick_user="false" in wemux.conf

   Announcements
       When a user joins a session in either mirror or pair mode, a message is
       displayed to all currently attached users:



           csagan has attached in mirror mode.
           csagan has detached.




       This can be disabled by setting announce_attach="false"

       In addition, when a user switches from one session to another via the
       wemux join <sessionname> command, their movement is displayed similarly
       to the attach messages.

       If csagan enters wemux join applepie the users on the default session
       wemux will see:



           csagan has switched to session: applepie




       If csagan returns to default session with: wemux reset users on wemux
       will see:



           csagan has joined this session.




       This can be disabled by setting announce_session_change="false"

   Automatic SSH Client Modes
       To make an SSHed user start in a wemux mode automatically, add one of
       the following lines to the users .bash_profile or .zshrc

       Option 1: Automatically log the client into mirror mode upon login,
       disconnect them from the server when they detach. wemux mirror; exit

       Option 2: Automatically start the client in mirror mode but allow them
       to detach.
       wemux mirror

       Option 3: Automatically start the client in pair mode but allow them to
       detach.
       wemux pair

       Option 4: Only display the connection commands, don´t automatically
       start any modes.
       wemux help

       Please note that this does not ensure a logged in user will not be able
       to exit tmux and access their shell. If the user is not trusted, you
       must perform any security measures one would normally perform for a
       remote user.
