NAME
     dmesg – display the system message buffer

SYNOPSIS
     dmesg [-ac] [-M core [-N system]]

DESCRIPTION
     The dmesg utility displays the contents of the system message buffer.  If
     the -M option is not specified, the buffer is read from the currently
     running kernel via the sysctl(3) interface.  Otherwise, the buffer is
     read from the specified core file, using the name list from the specified
     kernel image (or from the default image).

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Show all data in the message buffer.  This includes any syslog
             records and /dev/console output.

     -c      Clear the kernel buffer after printing.

     -M      Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
             core.

     -N      If -M is also specified, extract the name list from the specified
             system instead of the default, which is the kernel image the
             system has booted from.

FILES
     /var/run/dmesg.boot      usually a snapshot of the buffer contents taken
                              soon after file systems are mounted at startup
                              time
