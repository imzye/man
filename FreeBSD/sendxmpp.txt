NAME
       sendxmpp - send xmpp messages from the commandline.

SYNOPSIS
       sendxmpp [options] <recipient1> [<recipient2> ...]

       sendxmpp --raw [options]

DESCRIPTION
       sendxmpp is a program to send XMPP (Jabber) messages from the
       commandline, not unlike mail(1). Messages can be sent both to
       individual recipients and chatrooms.

OPTIONS
       -f,--file file
           Use file configuration file instead of ~/.sendxmpprc

       -u,--username user
           Use user instead of the one in the configuration file

       -p,--password password
           Use password instead of the one in the configuration file

       --sso
           Instead of specifying username or password, attempt to use system
           level SSO (e.g. kerberos) if supported.

       -j,--jserver server
           Use jabber server instead of the one in the configuration file.

       -o,--component componentname
           Use componentname in connect call. Seems needed for Google talk.

       -r,--resource res
           Use resource res for the sender [default: 'sendxmpp']; when sending
           to a chatroom, this determines the 'alias'

       -t,--tls
           Connect securely, using TLS

       -e,--ssl
           Connect securely, using SSL

       -n,--no-tls-verify
           Deactivate the verification of SSL certificates. Better way is to
           use parameter --tls-ca-path with the needed path to CA
           certificates.

       -a,--tls-ca-path
           Path to your custom CA certificates, so you can verificate SSL
           certificates during connecting.

       -l,--headline
           Backward compatibility option. You should use
           --message-type=headline instead. Send a headline type message (not
           stored in offline messages)

       --messages-type
           Set type of message. Supported types are: message chat headline.
           Default message type is message. Headline type message can be set
           also with --headline option, see --headline

       -c,--chatroom
           Send the message to a chatroom

       -s,--subject subject
           Set the subject for the message to subject [default: '']; when
           sending to a chatroom, this will set the subject for the chatroom

       -m,--message message
           Read the message from message (a file) instead of stdin

       -i,--interactive
           Work in interactive mode, reading lines from stdin and sending the
           one-at-time

       -w,--raw
           Send raw XML message to jabber server

       -v,--verbose
           Give verbose output about what is happening

       -h,--help,--usage
           Show a 'Usage' message

       -d,--debug
           Show debugging info while running. WARNING: This will include
           passwords etc. so be careful with the output! Specify multiple
           times to increase debug level.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       You may define a '~/.sendxmpprc' file with the necessary data for your
       xmpp-account. Since version 1.24 the following format is supported:

           username: I<your_username>
           jserver: I<jabber_server>
           port: I<jabber_port>
           password: I<your_jabber_password>
           component: I<optional_component_name>

       Example for Google Talk servers:

           username: I<lubomir.host>
           jserver: I<talk.google.com>
           password: I<my-secure-password>
           component: I<gmail.com>

       With version 1.23 and older only one-line format is supported:

           user@server password componentname

       e.g.:

           # my account
           alice@jabber.org  secret

       ('#' and newlines are allowed like in shellscripts). You can add a host
       (or IP address) if it is different from the server part of your JID:

           # account with specific connection host
           alice@myjabberserver.com;foo.com secret

       You can also add a port if it is not the standard XMPP port:

           # account with weird port number
           alice@myjabberserver.com:1234 secret

       Of course, you may also mix the two:

           # account with a specific host and port
           alice@myjabberserver.com;foo.com:1234 secret

       NOTE: for your security, sendxmpp demands that the configuration file
       is owned by you and readable only to you (permissions 600).

EXAMPLE
          $ echo "hello bob!" | sendxmpp -s hello someone@jabber.org

            or to send to a chatroom:

          $ echo "Dinner Time" | sendxmpp -r TheCook --chatroom test2@conference.jabber.org

            or to send your system logs somewhere, as new lines appear:

          $ tail -f /var/log/syslog | sendxmpp -i sysadmin@myjabberserver.com

            NOTE: be careful not the overload public jabber services
