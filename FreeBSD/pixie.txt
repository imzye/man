NAME
       rndr - render a rib file

SYNOPSIS
       rndr [ -f <range> ] [ options ... ] [ -P:n | -t:n ] [ name.rib ...  ]
       rndr -r <port>
       rndr -k <port>
       rndr [ options... ] [ name.rib ...  ] -s <srv1:port1,srv2:port2...>

DESCRIPTION
       Rndr Renders a file with Pixie.

       The main documentation is maintained in html form and should be
       included with your distribution in the html or doc directories.

       Note: If the filename given is '-' or no filename is given, then rndr
       will read from standard input.  This is not valid for network renders,
       where the file needs to be shipped to the server rndr instances for
       them to read.

OPTIONS
       -f <range>
              Render only selected frames.  Range can be of the form N for a
              single frame, N1:N2 for N1 through to N2, or N1:N2:N3 for N1 to
              N3 skipping, but only every N2 frames.

       -q     Quiet mode.  Errors and warnings are not displayed.

       -d     Framebuffer display.  Overrides the display drivers and uses
              framebuffer.

       -t     Display statistics.  At the end of each frame, statistics are
              output.

       -p     Display progress.  Displays an updating progress line on the
              terminal.

       -P:n   Specify the number of subprocesses for a multiprocessor render.
              May not be used with -r or -s.

       -t:n   Specify the number of threads for a multithreaded render.  May
              not be used with -r or -s.

       -c <client port>
              Specify a client (for subprocesses, used internally by rndr).
