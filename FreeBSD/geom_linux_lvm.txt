GEOM_LINUX_LVM(4)      FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual      GEOM_LINUX_LVM(4)

NAME
     geom_linux_lvm – GEOM based Linux LVM logical volume mapping

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           options GEOM_LINUX_LVM

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           geom_linux_lvm_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The geom_linux_lvm framework provides support for mapping Linux LVM
     volumes to GEOM providers.  geom_linux_lvm currently supports linear
     stripes with segments on one or more physical disks.  The parser is able
     to read LVM2 Text Format metadata, the logical volumes will be assembled
     and made available under /dev/linux_lvm/.  The metadata is read-only,
     logical volumes cannot be allocated or resized.

EXAMPLES
     To view which geom_linux_lvm devices are available:

           # geom linux_lvm list
           Geom name: vg1
