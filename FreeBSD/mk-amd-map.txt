MK-AMD-MAP(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          MK-AMD-MAP(8)

NAME
     mk-amd-map – create database maps for amd(8)

SYNOPSIS
     mk-amd-map [-p] mapname

DESCRIPTION
     The mk-amd-map utility creates the database maps used by the keyed map
     lookups in amd(8).  It reads input from the named file and outputs them
     to a correspondingly named hashed database.

     The -p option prints the map on standard output instead of generating a
     database.  This is usually used to merge continuation lines into one
     physical line.
