NAME
       Games::Dissociate - a Dissociated Press algorithm and filter

SYNOPSIS
           use Games::Dissociate;
           ...
           $brilliant_prose = dissociate($normal_prose);

       or

           perl -MGames::Dissociate -e dissociate_filter meno.txt

ABSTRACT
       This module provides the function "dissociate", which implements a
       Dissociated Press algorithm, well known to Emacs users as "meta-x
       dissociate".  The algorithm here is by no means a straight port of
       Emacs's "dissociate.el", but is instead merely inspired by it.

       (I actually intended to make it a straight port, but couldn't manage it
       -- the code in "dissociate.el" is totally uncommented, and is
       especially obscure Lisp.)

       This module also provides a procedure "dissociate_filter", for use in
       the one-liner context:

         perl -MGames::Dissociate -e 'dissociate_filter(2)'
           < thesis.txt  > snip.txt

       or

         perl -MGames::Dissociate -e 'dissociate_filter(-2)'
           < thesis.txt  > snip.txt

       or in a script consisting of

         #!/usr/local/bin/perl
         use Games::Dissociate;  dissociate_filter;

   Sample Dissociation
       I got this text from feeding the UNIX man page for "regexp" (in
       plaintext) to "dissociate" with a $group_size parameter of 3:

           nd of then the full list of the more branch is zero or "*", "."

   About Dissociated Press algorithms
       "Dissociated Press" algorithms produce text with token-patterns
       (patterns of words, or patterns of characters) similar those found to
       an input text.

       This may be implemented in terms of Markov chains (basically,
       statistical modeling of frequency of token-groups), altho both this
       module and Emacs's "dissociate.el" take shortcuts to avoid having to
       construct and manipulate a real statistical model of the input text.

       Basically, the way Dissociated Press algorithms (at least mine -- I
       can't speak for the exact details of all others) work is:

           1. Start at a random point in the text, and read a group of tokens
           (characters or words from there -- where group size is a parameter
           you change) from there.  Call this the last-matched group.

           2. Output the last-matched group.

           3. Look for the other times the last-matched group occurs in the
           text, and randomly select one of them.  (Or: select the next time
           that group occurs -- a shortcut I've made in the code, which seems
           to still produce random-looking results).  Look at the group of
           tokens that occurs right after that.  Make that the last-matched
           group.  Loop back to Step 2 until we think we've outputted enough.

           4. But if the last-matched group from 2 occurred just that once in
           the text, go back to step 1.

       Since the groups of characters or words (at least, when you look at
       them as bits of text only group-size tokens long) are all taken from
       the input text, you get somewhat natural-looking text -- as opposed to
       what you'd get if you just randomly outputted single characters or
       single words from the input text.

       The process of applying a DissociatedPress algorithm to a bit of text
       is called "dissociation".

PARAMETERS AND USAGE
       To use this module after you've installed it, say "use
       Games::Dissociate".  This imports the function "dissociate" and the
       procedure "dissociate_filter".

       dissociate($input, $group_size, $max)
           The function "dissociate" takes three parameters:

             $output = dissociate($input, $group_size, $max);

           $input is the input string, hopefully containing a stretch of
           (plaintext) text in a human language, encoded either in just plain
           US-ASCII, or in a character-encoding your locale settings know
           about.  $output will be "dissociated text" (charmingly generated
           gibberish) based on that input text.  (Note that output will
           contain no line-breaks or tabs.  Yoy may wish, as
           "dissociate_filter" does, to pass the output thru Text::Wrap's
           "wrap".)

           You'll get strange output if $input contains markup (HTML, LaTeX,
           etc.), or is very short, or is not in a human language.

           $group_size is the number of tokens (words or characters) that must
           be in common between bits of text the dissociation algorithm skips
           between.  A positive value means you want to dissociate by
           character, with a group-size of that many characters (4 = 4
           characters); a negative value means you want to dissociate by word,
           with a group size of that many words (-2 = 2 words).  I suggest
           values between -3 and 5; I'm a fan of -2.  A $group_size value of 0
           or 1 is invalid, and currently causes "dissociate" to use the
           default value of 2 (2 characters) instead.  A value of -1 is
           invalid, and currently causes "dissociate" to use the value of -2
           (2 words) instead.  The behavior/validity of $group_size values of
           0, 1, or -1 may change in future versions.

           $max is a parameter used to control the maximum number of
           iterations of "dissociate"'s central loop -- it corresponds roughly
           to the number of "chunks" of text you get back, where a chunk is N
           * -$group_size words for negative values of $group_size, and N *
           $group_size characters for positive values of $group_size.  $max
           must be greater than 1.

           If you need (!) more precise control over the size of the output
           text, try setting set $max high and trim the output to size, and/or
           try calling "dissociate" multiple times until you get the amount of
           output you want.  (But be sure to give up if "dissociate" keeps
           returning nullstring, as it will in some strange cases.)

           "dissociate" can also be called with the following syntaxes:

             dissociate($input, $group_size);
              # acts like max of 100

             dissociate($input);
              # acts like group size of 2 (characters) and max of 100

       dissociate_filter()
       dissociate_filter($group_size)
       dissociate_filter($group_size, $max)
           This library also provides the procedure "dissociate_filter", which
           pulls input from "<>" (files specified on the command line, or
           STDIN), and sends dissociated output to STDOUT.  It can be called
           with these syntaxes:

             dissociate_filter($group_size, $max);

             dissociate_filter($group_size);
              # uses a default value for $max

             dissociate_filter();
              # uses a default value for $group_size and $max

           These above-mentioned default values can come from command line
           switches, if you make a script consisting of:

             #!/usr/local/bin/perl
             use Games::Dissociate;
             dissociate_filter;

           and call that script, say, "dissociate", and call it as:

             dissociate -c5 -m200 < foo.txt

           or

             dissociate -w2 -m70 foo.txt bar.txt | less

           and so on.

           To explain the switches:

           "-w[number]" specifies a by-word dissociation with that number of
           words as the group size, "-c[number]" specifies a by-character
           dissociation with that number of characters as the group size,
           "-m[number]" specifies a default for $max.

           If you don't specify a default for $group_size or $max, $group_size
           defaults to 100 and $max defaults to 2 (characters).

   Efficiency Notes
       This module has to search the input string by performing regexp
       searches on it.  In the current version of this module, control over
       compilation of regular expressions may not be not optimally efficient.
       Perl 5.005 provides options to better control regexp compilation; once
       Perl 5.005 is in wider use, I may come out with a new version of
       Games::Dissociate requiring Perl 5.005 or later, using these new regexp
       compilation control features.

       If you feed this module a lot of text (over 50K, say), it will indeed
       get very slow (notably with by-word dissociation), since that whole
       chunk of text has to be searched over and over and over.

       If you have an idea for making this module more efficient, feel free to
       email it to me.

   Internationalization Notes
       When dealing with text in heavily inflected languages (like Finnish --
       lots of unique word endings, frequently used), this module will require
       longer input text to produce interesting results for by-word
       dissociation, compared to relatively inflection-poor languages like
       English.

       For text written with no inter-word spacing (often the case with Thai,
       for example), there's no way for this module to tell where the word
       breaks are -- in such cases, use only the by-character mode.

       The current version of this library assumes "/./" matches a single
       character, for by-character dissociation; and, for by-word
       dissociation, that "/\w+/" matches whole words and /\W+/ matches non-
       word strings.  These are locale-dependent functions, and
       Games::Dissociate has a "use locale" in it, hopefully triggering
       correct behavior for your favorite locale, language, and character-
       encoding.  Consult perllocale and locale for more information on
       locales.

       I have found "use locale" to do unwelcome things (like unceremoniously
       dumping core) on a few very strange, very old (and otherwise barely-
       working) machines.  If this is a problem for you, or if you don't plan
       to use locales, comment out the "use locale" in the Games::Dissociate
       source code.

       The treatment of locales and support for them may change in future
       versions of this module, depending on how future Perl versions shape
       up, particularly in their support of Unicode.

   Randomness Notes
       This library uses "rand" extensively, but never calls "srand".  If
       you're getting the same dissociated output all the time, then you're
       using an old (pre-5.004) version of Perl that doesn't do implicit
       randomness seeding -- just call "srand();", maybe right after you say
       "use Games::Dissociate";
