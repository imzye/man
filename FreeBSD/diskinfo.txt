DISKINFO(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            DISKINFO(8)

NAME
     diskinfo – get information about disk device

SYNOPSIS
     diskinfo [-citSvw] disk ...
     diskinfo [-p] disk ...
     diskinfo [-s] disk ...

DESCRIPTION
     The diskinfo utility prints out information about a disk device, and
     optionally runs a naive performance test on the device.

     The following options are available:

     -v     Print fields one per line with a descriptive comment.

     -c     Perform a simple measurement of the I/O read command overhead.

     -i     Perform a simple IOPS benchmark.

     -p     Return the physical path of the disk.  This is a string that
            identifies the physical path to the disk in the storage enclosure.

     -s     Return the disk ident, usually the serial number.

     -S     Perform synchronous random write test (ZFS SLOG test), measuring
            time required to write data blocks of different size and flush
            disk cache.  Blocks of more then 128KB are written with multiple
            parallel operations.

     -t     Perform a simple and rather naive benchmark of the disks seek and
            transfer performance.

     -w     Allow disruptive write tests.

     If given no arguments, the output will be a single line per specified
     device with the following fields: device name, sectorsize, media size in
     bytes, media size in sectors, stripe size, stripe offset, firmware
     cylinders, firmware heads, and firmware sectors.  The last three fields
     are only present if the information is available.

HISTORY
     The diskinfo command appeared in FreeBSD 5.1.

AUTHORS
     The diskinfo utility was written by Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS
     There are in order of increasing severity: lies, damn lies, statistics,
     and computer benchmarks.
