ZPOOL-STATUS(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        ZPOOL-STATUS(8)

NAME
     zpool-status – show detailed health status for ZFS storage pools

SYNOPSIS
     zpool status [-DigLpPstvx] [-T u|d] [-c [SCRIPT1[,SCRIPT2]…]] [pool]…
           [interval [count]]

DESCRIPTION
     Displays the detailed health status for the given pools.  If no pool is
     specified, then the status of each pool in the system is displayed.  For
     more information on pool and device health, see the Device Failure and
     Recovery section of zpoolconcepts(7).

     If a scrub or resilver is in progress, this command reports the
     percentage done and the estimated time to completion.  Both of these are
     only approximate, because the amount of data in the pool and the other
     workloads on the system can change.

     -c [SCRIPT1[,SCRIPT2]…]
             Run a script (or scripts) on each vdev and include the output as
             a new column in the zpool status output.  See the -c option of
             zpool iostat for complete details.

     -i      Display vdev initialization status.

     -g      Display vdev GUIDs instead of the normal device names These GUIDs
             can be used in place of device names for the zpool
             detach/offline/remove/replace commands.

     -L      Display real paths for vdevs resolving all symbolic links.  This
             can be used to look up the current block device name regardless
             of the /dev/disk/ path used to open it.

     -p      Display numbers in parsable (exact) values.

     -P      Display full paths for vdevs instead of only the last component
             of the path.  This can be used in conjunction with the -L flag.

     -D      Display a histogram of deduplication statistics, showing the
             allocated (physically present on disk) and referenced (logically
             referenced in the pool) block counts and sizes by reference
             count.

     -s      Display the number of leaf VDEV slow IOs.  This is the number of
             IOs that didn't complete in zio_slow_io_ms milliseconds (default
             30 seconds).  This does not necessarily mean the IOs failed to
             complete, just took an unreasonably long amount of time.  This
             may indicate a problem with the underlying storage.

     -t      Display vdev TRIM status.

     -T u|d  Display a time stamp.  Specify u for a printed representation of
             the internal representation of time.  See time(2).  Specify d for
             standard date format.  See date(1).

     -v      Displays verbose data error information, printing out a complete
             list of all data errors since the last complete pool scrub.

     -x      Only display status for pools that are exhibiting errors or are
             otherwise unavailable.  Warnings about pools not using the latest
             on-disk format will not be included.
