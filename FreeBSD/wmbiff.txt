WMBIFF(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              WMBIFF(1)



NAME
       WMBiff - A dockable Mailbox Monitor


SYNOPSIS
       wmbiff [-display <display name>] [-geometry +XPOS+YPOS] [-c <filename>]
       [-h] [-v] [-debug] [-fg <foreground-color>] [-bg <background-color>]
       [-hi <highlight-color>] [-font <X11 font>|default] [-o] [+w]


DESCRIPTION
       WMbiff displays the status of up to five mailboxes. It shows the number
       of new mail messages, if any, otherwise 0. In classic mode instead of 0
       it shows the total number of messages.  It also has mail retrieval
       capabilities, and can be configured to do this automatically. At the
       moment, UNIX-style, maildir, POP3, APOP and IMAP4 mailboxes are
       supported.

       The mailboxes are displayed in 5 different lines, each one with its own
       description of up to five chars. If no mail is present in a given
       mailbox, WMbiff will display the total number of mails in cyan. If
       there's new mail in the box, the number of new messages will be
       displayed in yellow. When new mail arrives, this number will optionally
       flash for a small period of time, and also optionally, a command can be
       executed on mail arrival (for example, opening your mail reader or
       playing a sound file).

       Pressing mouse button 1 will execute a command, defined in the user's
       config file. Mouse button 3 will execute a command to fetch mail, if
       defined.  To restart wmbiff, press mouse button 1 while holding control
       and shift keys, or send it SIGUSR1.


OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -v     Show version of program.

       -display <display name>
              Use an alternate X Display.

       -geometry <geometry>
              Initial window position.

       -c <filename>
              Use specified configuration file instead of ~/.wmbiffrc.

       -debug Print verbose log of progress.

       -fg <color>
              Use specified X11 color for foreground. Implies -font default,
              unless overridden.

       -bg <color>
              Use specified X11 color for background. Implies -font default,
              unless overridden.

       -hi <color>
              Use specified X11 color for new mail counters. Implies -font
              default, unless overridden.

       -font <font>
              Use specified X11 font instead of the LED pixmap.  This may be
              more readable or suitable for some non-US characters.  The
              special font "default" tells wmbiff to use a compile time
              default.

       -skip-certificate-check
              When using TLS (IMAPS), keep going, even if the server's
              certificate is invalid.  Invalid certificates have expired, have
              a different hostname than you connected to, are corrupt, or have
              been revoked.  Do not use this option unless wmbiff fails and
              suggests it to you, and even then, be careful and consider
              alerting your mail system administrator first.  The need to use
              this option is a sign of server misconfiguration.

       -relax Assume the configuration is correct, parse it without paranoia,
              and assume hostnames are okay.

       -o     Enable classical mode look and behaviour: shows the number of
              new mail messages, if any, or the total number of messages.
              This option also enables the special keyword "beep" (disabled by
              default).

       +w     Do not use the "withdrawn" state: the wmbiff window will not be
              captured as an icon and placed in the dock, but will instead
              have its own window.  This option starts with a '+' for
              consistency with other software programs: many use '-w' to mean
              the opposite.
