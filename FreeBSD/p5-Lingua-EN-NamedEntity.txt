NAME
       Lingua::EN::NamedEntity - Basic Named Entity Extraction algorithm

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::EN::NamedEntity;
         my @entities = extract_entities($some_text);

DESCRIPTION
       "Named entities" is the NLP jargon for proper nouns which represent
       people, places, organisations, and so on. This module provides a very
       simple way of extracting these from a text. If we run the
       "extract_entities" routine on a piece of news coverage of recent UK
       political events, we should expect to see it return a list of hash
       references looking like this:

         { entity => 'Mr Howard', class => 'person', scores => { ... }, },
         { entity => 'Ministry of Defence', class => 'organisation', ... },
         { entity => 'Oxfordshire', class => 'place', ... },

       The additional "scores" hash reference in there breaks down the various
       possible classes for this entity in an open-ended scale.

       The hash also includes the number of occurrences for that entity.

       Naturally, the more text you throw at this, the more accurate it
       becomes.

   extract_entities
       Pass to "<extract_entities"> a text, and it will return a list of
       entities, as described above.
