Test::TrailingSpace(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Test::TrailingSpace - test for trailing space in source files.

VERSION
       version 0.0601

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::TrailingSpace;

           my $finder = Test::TrailingSpace->new(
               {
                   root => '.',
                   filename_regex => qr/\.(?:t|pm|pl)\z/,
               },
           );

           # TEST
           $finder->no_trailing_space(
               "No trailing space was found."
           );

       Or, if you want the test to be optional:

           use Test::More;

           eval "use Test::TrailingSpace";
           if ($@)
           {
               plan skip_all => "Test::TrailingSpace required for trailing space test.";
           }
           else
           {
               plan tests => 1;
           }

           my $finder = Test::TrailingSpace->new(
               {
                   root => '.',
                   filename_regex => qr/\.(?:t|pm|pl)\z/,
               },
           );

           # TEST
           $finder->no_trailing_space(
               "No trailing space was found."
           );

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to test for lack of trailing space. See the
       synopsis for more details.

       NOTE: there is an older CPAN distribution titled Test::EOL that also
       supports testing for trailing space / trailing whitespace, although it
       has some limitations that Test::TrailingSpace does not have, and also
       only calls it "trailing whitespace", rather than "trailing space".
       Whenever possible, one should prefer to use it, instead of this module.

METHODS
   new({ root => ".", filename_regex => qr/\. ... \z/,})
       Constructs a new object with the root (that defaults to "." and the
       filename matching regular expression. All the files under root matching
       the pattern will be searched (excpet for those under version control
       directories, "blib", "_build", etc.).

       The 'abs_path_prune_re' parameter can be used to specify a regular
       expression to prune the absolute path based on, so as to ignore what is
       under there.

       The 'find_tabs' option, if set to a true value, detects and reports for
       the presence of hard tabs ('\t'). (Added in version 0.0400)

       The 'find_cr' option, if set to a true value, detects and reports for
       the presence of carriage returns at the end of lines. (DOS-style line
       endings.)  It was added in version 0.0400.  So

           my $finder = Test::TrailingSpace->new(
               {
                   root => '.',
                   filename_regex => qr/\.(?:t|pm|pl)\z/,
                   abs_path_prune_re => qr#\Alib/sample-data#,
               }
           );

       Will ignore everything under "lib/sample-data" . Note that as of
       Test::TrailingSpace version 0.0300 it can also be used to skip files
       with these filenames (e.g: "abs_path_prune_re => qr#\.patch\z#").

   $finder->no_trailing_space($blurb)
       Determines if there is no trailing space in the source files. Returns
       true if no trailing space was found, and false if trailing space was
       found.  It is equivalent to Test::More::ok(), with diagnostics to
       report if there is trailing space.
