Mknod(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation             Mknod(3)


NAME
       Mknod - Perl extension for the mknod(2) call

SYNOPSIS
         use Mknod;
         # create a pipe
         mknod('hole', S_IFIFO|0644);
         # or a device
         mknod('ttyS0', S_IFCHR|0644, 4|64);

DESCRIPTION
         It seemed to me this system call wasnt available to perl yet.
         If I was just looking in the wrong place, please let me know:)

         Returns 1 on ok and 0 on failure.

   EXPORT
         mknod()
         S_IFREG
         S_IFIFO
         S_IFBLK
         S_IFCHR

       This behaviour can be prevented:
         use Mknod ();
         Mknod::mknod(...)
