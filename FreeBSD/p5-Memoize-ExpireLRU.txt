Memoize::ExpireLRU(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Memoize::ExpireLRU - Expiry plug-in for Memoize that adds LRU cache
       expiration

SYNOPSIS
           use Memoize;

           memoize('slow_function',
                   TIE => [Memoize::ExpireLRU,
                           CACHESIZE => n,
                          ]);

       Note that one need not "use" this module.  It will be found by the
       Memoize module.

       The argument to "CACHESIZE" must be an integer.  Normally, this is all
       that is needed.  Additional options are available:

               TUNECACHESIZE => m,
               INSTANCE      => 'descriptive_name',
               TIE           => '[DB_File, $filename, O_RDWR | O_CREATE, 0666]'

DESCRIPTION
       For the theory of Memoization, please see the Memoize module
       documentation. This module implements an expiry policy for Memoize that
       follows LRU semantics, that is, the last n results, where n is
       specified as the argument to the "CACHESIZE" parameter, will be cached.

PERFORMANCE TUNING
       It is often quite difficult to determine what size cache will give
       optimal results for a given function. To aid in determining this,
       ExpireLRU includes cache tuning support. Enabling this causes a
       definite performance hit, but it is often useful before code is
       released to production.

       To enable cache tuning support, simply specify the optional
       "TUNECACHESIZE" parameter with a size greater than that of the
       "CACHESIZE" parameter.

       When the program exits, a set of statistics will be printed to stderr.
       If multiple routines have been memoized, separate sets of statistics
       are printed for each routine. The default names are somewhat cryptic:
       this is the purpose of the "INSTANCE" parameter. The value of this
       parameter will be used as the identifier within the statistics report.

DIAGNOSTIC METHODS
       Two additional routines are available but not exported.
       Memoize::ExpireLRU::ShowStats returns a string identical to the
       statistics report printed to STDERR at the end of the program if test
       caches have been enabled; Memoize::ExpireLRU::DumpCache takes the
       instance name of a memoized function as a parameter, and returns a
       string describing the current state of that instance.
