DESCRIPTION
       WeeChat (Wee Enhanced Environment for Chat) is a free chat client, fast
       and light, designed for many operating systems.  It is highly
       customizable and extensible with scripts.

OPTIONS
       -a, --no-connect
           Disable auto-connect to servers when WeeChat is starting.

       -c, --colors
           Display default colors in terminal.

       --daemon
           Run WeeChat in background, as a daemon (works only with the command
           weechat-headless).

       --stdout
           Display log messages on standard output instead of writing them in
           log file (works only with the command weechat-headless, not
           compatible with option "--daemon").

       -d, --dir <path>
           Force a single directory for all WeeChat files (directory is
           created if not found).  Four directories can be given, separated by
           colons (in this order: config, data, cache, runtime).  If this
           option is not given, the environment variable WEECHAT_HOME is used
           (if not empty).

       -t, --temp-dir
           Create a temporary WeeChat home directory and delete it on exit
           (incompatible with option "-d").
           The name of the directory is automatically built by WeeChat, with
           this template: "weechat_temp_XXXXXX" (where "XXXXXX" is random). It
           it created in the first available directory in this list:
           environment variable "TMPDIR", "/tmp" (may be different according
           to the operating system), environment variable "HOME", current
           directory.
           The temporary home directory has permissions 0700 (only owner can
           read, write and execute).

       -h, --help
           Display help.

       -i, --build-info
           Display build information and exit.

       -l, --license
           Display WeeChat license.

       -p, --no-plugin
           Disable plugins auto-load.

       -P, --plugins <plugins>
           Load only these plugins at startup (see /help
           weechat.plugin.autoload).  If this option is given, the option
           weechat.plugin.autoload is not used.

       -r, --run-command <command>
           Run command(s) after startup; many commands can be separated by
           semicolons, this option can be given multiple times.

       -s, --no-script
           Disable scripts auto-load.

       --upgrade
           Upgrade WeeChat using session files generated with command /upgrade
           -quit.

       -v, --version
           Display WeeChat version.

       plugin:option
           Option for a plugin.

DEBUG OPTIONS
       WARNING: these options are for debug purposes only, DO NOT USE IN
       PRODUCTION!

       --no-dlclose
           Do not call the function dlclose after plugins are unloaded.  This
           is useful with tools like Valgrind to display stack for unloaded
           plugins.

       --no-gnutls
           Do not call the init and deinit functions of GnuTLS library.  This
           is useful with tools like Valgrind and electric-fence, to prevent
           GnuTLS memory errors.

       --no-gcrypt
           Do not call the init and deinit functions of Gcrypt library.  This
           is useful with tools like Valgrind, to prevent Gcrypt memory
           errors.

PLUGIN OPTIONS
       For complete doc on plugin options, please look at plugins
       documentation in WeeChat user’s guide <https://weechat.org/doc/>.
