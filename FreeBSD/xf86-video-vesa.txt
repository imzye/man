DESCRIPTION
       vesa is an Xorg driver for generic VESA video cards.  It can drive most
       VESA-compatible video cards, but only makes use of the basic standard
       VESA core that is common to these cards.  The driver supports depths 8,
       15 16 and 24.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The vesa driver supports most VESA-compatible video cards.  There are
       some known exceptions, and those should be listed here.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the presence of VESA-compatible hardware.  The
       ChipSet name may optionally be specified in the config file "Device"
       section, and will override the auto-detection:

           "vesa"

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "ShadowFB" "boolean"
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
              on.

              This option is recommended for performance reasons.

       Option "ModeSetClearScreen" "boolean"
              Clear the screen on mode set. Some BIOSes seem to be broken in
              the sense that the newly set video mode is bogus if they are
              asked to clear the screen during mode setting. If you experience
              problems try to turn this option off. Default: on.
