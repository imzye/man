NAME
       CGI::Application::Dispatch::Server - A simple HTTP server for
       developing with CGI::Application::Dispatch

SYNOPSIS
       This module is no longer maintained or recommended. Use
       CGI::Application::Server instead, which can do all this can and more.

         use CGI::Application::Dispatch::Server;

         my $server = CGI::Application::Dispatch::Server->new(
                    class    => 'MyClass::Dispatch'
                    root_dir => '/home/project/www',
          );
         $server->run;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple HTTP server for for use during development with
       CGI::Application::Dispatch.

       It's a helpful tool for working on a private copy of a website on a
       personal computer. It's especially useful for working offline when you
       don't have easy access to a full-blown webserver.

       If you have customized dispatch args, it's recommended that you put
       them in their own class, as described in the CGI::Application::Dispatch
       docs.  That way, they can be accessed directly through
       CGI::Application::Dispatch, or through here.

METHODS
   new()
         my $server = CGI::Application::Dispatch::Server->new(
               port     => '80',                # optional, defaults to 8080
               class    => 'MyClass::Dispatch', # optional, defaults CGI::Application::Dispatch
               root_dir => './alphasite',       # optional, defaults to "."
         );

       Initialize the server. If you've subclassed CGI::Application::Dispatch
       to provide your own dispatch_args(), let us know that here.

       If you are also serving some static content, define "root_dir" with the
       root directory of this content.

Other Methods You Probably Don't Need to Know About
   dispatch_args()
        $server->dispatch_args(\%override_args);

       This accepts a hashref of arguments and merges it into
       CGI::Application::Dispatch's dispatch() arguments.

       Be aware that this is a shallow merge, so a top level key name in the
       new hash will completely replace one in the old hash with the same
       name.

       It is recommended that you put your dispatch args in a separate class
       instead, as mentioned in the DESCRIPTION.

   handle_request()
         $self->handle_request($cgi);

       This will check the request URI and handle  it appropriately, printing
       to STDOUT upon success. There's generally no reason to call this
       directly.

CAVEATS
       This is a subclass of HTTP::Server::Simple and all of its caveats apply
       here as well.

BUGS
       If you are not sure the behavior is a bug, please discuss it on the
       cgiapp mailing list ( cgiapp@lists.erlbaum.net ). If you feel certain
       if you have found a bug, please report it through rt.cpan.org.
