NAME
       boxes - text mode box and comment drawing filter

SYNOPSIS
       boxes [options] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
       Boxes is a text filter which can draw any kind of box around its input
       text. Box design choices range from simple boxes to complex ASCII art.
       A box can also be removed and repaired, even if it has been badly
       damaged by editing of the text inside. Since boxes may be open on any
       side, boxes can also be used to create regional comments in any
       programming language.  New box designs can be added and shared by
       appending to a configuration file.

       boxes is a command line tool, but also integrates with any text editor
       that supports filters. The boxes website has examples on how to
       configure editor integration for various text editors:
       <URL:https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/editors.html>

OPTIONS
       Options offered by boxes are the following:

       -a format, --align=format
             Alignment/positioning of text inside box. This option takes a
             format string argument which is read from left to right. The
             format string may not contain whitespace and must consist of one
             or more of the following components:

             hx - horizontal alignment of the input text block inside a box.
             Possible values for x are l (ell, for left alignment), c
             (center), or r (right). This does not affect the justification of
             text lines within the input text block (use the j argument
             instead).
             vx - vertical alignment of the input text block inside a box.
             Possible values for x are t (for top alignment), c (center), or b
             (bottom).
             jx - justification of lines within the input text block. Possible
             values for x are l (ell, for left justification), c (center), or
             r (right). This does not affect the alignment of the input text
             block itself within the box. Use the h and v arguments for input
             text block positioning.

             Short hand notations (can be combined with the above arguments):
             l (ell) - short for hlvcjl
             c - short for hcvcjc
             r - short for hrvcjr

             The default for -a is hlvt.

       -c string, --create=string
             Command line design definition for simple cases. The argument of
             this option is the definition for the "west" (W) shape. The
             defined shape must consist of exactly one line, i.e. no
             multi-line shapes are allowed. The -c option is intended as a
             shortcut for those cases where simple regional comments are to be
             created, which only need a certain character or sequence of
             characters to be placed in front of every line. In such cases, it
             is much more convenient to simply specify -c than to do a
             complete design definition in one's config file, where the only
             shape defined is the west shape.
             This option implies a -d and does not access the config file.  -c
             may of course be used in conjunction with any of the other
             options. By default, -c is not specified.

       --color, --no-color
             Printing of color codes. Box designs and the text inside a box
             may contain ANSI color codes, sometimes called "escape
             sequences". In this way, boxes and text can be colored.
             Whether these escape sequences are printed by boxes is normally
             determined by the terminal capabilities (default). Using --color,
             boxes can be told to always output escape sequences even if it
             thinks the terminal may not understand them. Using --no-color,
             escape sequences will never be printed.

             Of course, even with --color, a box will only appear colored if
             it is already defined with colors. In case you want to auto-color
             some text that isn't yet, take a look at lolcat.
             These options consider all escape sequences to be color codes.
             Any other escape sequences present will be printed or removed
             along with the color codes.

       -d string, --design=string
             Design selection. The one argument of this option is the name of
             the design to use, which may either be a design's primary name or
             any of its alias names.

       -e eol, --eol=eol
             Override line terminator.  eol can be CR, LF, or CRLF.  The
             default is to use the system-specific line terminator, which
             means CRLF on Windows, and LF otherwise. This option should only
             be used in an emergency, because normally the system-specific
             line terminator will be just fine. This option is considered
             experimental, and may go away in a future version of boxes.  Let
             us know in <URL:https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/60>
             if you think we should keep it.

       -f string, --config=string
             Use alternate config file. The one argument of this option is the
             name of a valid boxes config file. The argument of -f can also be
             a directory which contains a configuration file. More information
             on this topic below in the CONFIGURATION FILE section.

       -h, --help
             Print usage information.

       -i string, --indent=string
             Indentation mode. Possible arguments are text (indent text inside
             of box), box (indent box, not text inside of box), or none (throw
             away indentation). Arguments may be abbreviated. The default is
             box.

       -k bool, --kill-blank, --no-kill-blank
             Kill leading/trailing blank lines on removal. The value of bool
             is either true or false.  This option only takes effect in
             connection with -r.  If set to true, leading and trailing blank
             lines will be removed from the output. If set to false, the
             entire content of the former box is returned.  The default is
             false, if both the top and the bottom part of the box are open,
             as is the case with most regional comments. If the box's design
             defines a top part or a bottom part, the default is true.

       -l, --list
             List designs. Produces a listing of all available box designs in
             the config file, along with a sample box and information about
             its creator.  Also checks the syntax of the entire config file.
             If used in conjunction with -d, displays detailed information
             about the specified design.

       -m, --mend
             Mend box. This removes a (potentially broken) box as with -r, and
             redraws it afterwards. The mended box is drawn according to the
             options given. This may be important to know when it comes to
             restoring padding, indentation, etc. for the mended box. Implies
             -k false.

       -n encoding, --encoding=encoding
             Character encoding. Overrides the character encoding of the input
             and output text. Choose from the list shown by iconv -l. If an
             invalid character encoding is specified here, UTF-8 is used as a
             fallback. The default is to use the system encoding, which is
             normally the best course of action.  So don't specify this option
             unless you have to.

       -p string, --padding=string
             Padding. Specify padding in spaces around the input text block
             for all sides of the box. The argument string may not contain
             whitespace and must consist of a combination of the following
             characters, each followed by a number indicating the padding in
             spaces:

             a - (all) give padding for all sides at once
             h - (horiz) give padding for both horizontal sides
             v - (vertical) give padding for both vertical sides
             b - (bottom) give padding for bottom (south) side
             l - (left) give padding for left (west) side
             t - (top) give padding for top (north) side
             r - (right) give padding for right (east) side

             Example: -p a4t2 would define the padding to be 4 characters on
             all sides, except for the top of the box, where the input text
             block will be only 2 lines away from the box.
             The default for this option is determined by the box design used.
             If the design does not specify anything, no default padding is
             used.

       -q query, --tag-query=query
             Query designs by tag. In contrast to -l, this will only print the
             matching design names. This option is normally used stand-alone;
             if used in combination with other options, behavior is undefined.
             The query argument is a comma-separated list of tags which can be
             present on a design in order to match. A tag may optionally be
             prefixed with + in order to require that it be present, or with -
             in order to exclude designs which have that tag. Each tag can
             only occur once per query. The special query (all) matches all
             box designs, even if they don't have any tags.
             This option is intended for use by scripts. Alias names are
             printed below their primary design name, and postfixed with
             (alias).
             Example: boxes -q programming,-comment

       -r, --remove
             Remove an existing box. Which design to use is detected
             automatically. In order to save time or in case the detection
             does not decide correctly, combine with -d to specify the design.

       -s widthxheight, --size=widthxheight
             Box size. This option specifies the desired box size in units of
             columns (for width) and lines (for height).  If only a single
             number is given as argument, this number specifies the desired
             box width. A single number prefixed by 'x' specifies only the box
             height.  The actual resulting box size may vary depending on the
             individual shape sizes of the chosen design. Also, other command
             line options may influence the box size (such as -p).
             By default, the smallest possible box is created around the text.

       -t tabopts, --tabs=tabopts
             Tab handling. This option controls how tab characters in the
             input text are handled. The tabopts must always begin with a
             positive integer number indicating the distance between tab
             stops, sometimes called "spaces per tab".
             Immediately following the tab distance, an optional character can
             be appended, telling boxes how to treat the leading tabs. The
             following options are available:

             e - expand tabs into spaces
             k - keep tabs as close to what they were as possible
             u - unexpand tabs. This makes boxes turn as many spaces as
             possible into tabs.

             The -t string can be just a number. In that case, e is assumed
             for tab handling. The factory default for the -t option is simply
             8, which is just such a case.
             For example, you could specify -t 4u in order to have your
             leading tabs unexpanded. In the box content, tabs are always
             converted into spaces. The tab distance in this example is 4.

       -v, --version
             Print out current version number.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Boxes will look for the configuration file in several places, some of
       which are given by the XDG specification.

       1. -f option [file or dir]
             When a configuration file is specified on the command line, we
             will use that. The -f option can also specify a directory. Any
             location specified via -f must exist, or boxes will terminate
             with an error.

       2. BOXES environment variable [file or dir]
             If no config file is specified on the command line, boxes will
             check for the BOXES environment variable, which may contain a
             filename or directory to use. Any location specified via the
             BOXES environment variable must exist, or boxes will terminate
             with an error.

       3. $HOME [dir]
       4. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/boxes [dir]
       5. $HOME/.config/boxes [dir]
       6. /usr/local/share/boxes/boxes-config [file]
       7. /etc/xdg/boxes [dir]
       8. /usr/local/share/boxes [dir]
       9. /usr/share/boxes [dir]
             Either one of these last two directory locations might have the
             same name as the global config file from 6. That's fine. It just
             means that we first look for a file of that name, and then for a
             directory containing the file.

       The XDG environment variable XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is not supported. However,
       its default value is supported via steps 8 and 9 above.

       In the above list, whenever a step is designated with [dir], the
       following file names will be found, in this order:
             1. .boxes
             2. box-designs
             3. boxes-config
             4. boxes

       As soon as the first valid file is found, we use that and stop the
       search.

       The recommended location for a user-specific configuration file is
       $HOME/.boxes or $HOME/.config/boxes/.boxes. A global configuration file
       should be located at /usr/local/share/boxes/boxes-config. But all of
       the other locations are fully supported, too.

       The syntax of boxes config files is described on the website at
       <URL:https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/config-syntax.html>.
