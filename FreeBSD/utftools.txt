NAME
       expand - convert tabs to spaces

SYNOPSIS
       expand [-v] [-t tabs] [--] [file ... ]

       expand converts tabs in its input files to spaces and writes the result
       to the standard output.

OPTIONS
       -v     The -v option instructs expand to print its version number and
              exit.

       -t tabs
              The -t option sets the number of spaces corresponding to each
              tab stop to tabs.  The default is 8 spaces.

       --     The -- (double dash) option indicates the end of options.

DESCRIPTION
       expand reads each file in turn, expanding tabs to spaces from each file
       in turn, and writing the result to the standard output.  If no files
       are specified or a file is - (dash), expand reads from the standard
       input.

       expand expects its input to be Unicode characters in utf(4) form.

EXAMPLES
       Convert tabs to spaces in file1 and write the results to file2:

            expand file1 >file2

SEE ALSO
