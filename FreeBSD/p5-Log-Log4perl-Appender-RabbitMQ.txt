VERSION
       version 0.200002

SYNOPSIS
           use Log::Log4perl;

           my $log4perl_config = q{
               log4perl.logger = DEBUG, RabbitMQ

               log4perl.appender.RabbitMQ             = Log::Log4perl::Appender::RabbitMQ
               log4perl.appender.RabbitMQ.exchange    = myexchange
               log4perl.appender.RabbitMQ.routing_key = mykey
               log4perl.appender.RabbitMQ.layout      = Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
           };

           Log::Log4perl::init(\$log4perl_config);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Log::Log4perl appender for publishing log messages to
       RabbitMQ using Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ.  Defaults for unspecified options
       are provided by Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ and can be found in it's
       documentation.

CONFIG OPTIONS
       All of the following options can be passed to the constructor, or be
       specified in the Log4perl config file. Unless otherwise stated, any
       options not specified will get whatever defaults Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ
       provides.  See the documentation for that module for more details.

       Connection Options

       These options are used in the call to Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ::connect()
       when the appender is created.

       user
       password
       host
           Defaults to localhost.

       port
       vhost
       channel_max
       frame_max
       heartbeat
       ssl
       ssl_verify_host
       ssl_cacert
       ssl_init
       timeout

       Exchange Options

       Except for declare_exchange, these options are used in a call to
       Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ::exchange_declare() to declare the exchange
       specified on the exchange option (See "Publish Options").  If
       declare_exchange is false (the default) the exchange will not be
       declared and must already exist.

       declare_exchange
           Declare the exchange, or just trust that it already exists?
           Boolean, defaults to 0.

       exchange_type
           'direct, 'topic', etc.

       durable_exchange
           Should the exchange survive a restart? Boolean, defaults to 0.

       auto_delete_exchange
           Delete the exchange when this proccess disconnects? Boolean,
           defaults to 1.

       Publish Options

       These options are used in the call to Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ::publish()
       for each message.

       routing_key
           The routing key for messages. If the routing key contains a %c or a
           %p it will be interpolated for each message. %c will be replaced
           with the Log4perl category.  %p will be replaces with the Log4perl
           priority.

           Defaults to %C

       exchange
           The exchange to publish the message too. This exchange must already
           exist unless declare_exchange is set to true.

       mandatory
           boolean. Flag published messages mandatory.

       immediate
           boolean. Flag published messages immediate.

       following methods:
