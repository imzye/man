NAME
       fbpanel - a NETWM compliant lightweight GTK2-based panel for UNIX
       desktop.

SYNOPSIS
       fbpanel [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       fbpanel is desktop panel which provides graphical information and
       feedback about desktop activity and allows interaction with the window
       manager.  It features:

       • taskbar - shows a list of the managed windows (tasks)

       • pager - thumbnailed view of the desktop.

       • launchbar - buttons to quickly launch applications

       • show desktop - button to iconify or shade all windows

       • image - display an image

       • clock - show the current time and/or date

       • system tray - tray for XEMBED icons (aka docklets)

       fbpanel requires NETWM (www.freedesktop.org) compliant window manager.
       You can run many instances of fbpanel each with its own configuration
       (see OPTIONS below).

OPTIONS
       --help -- print help message and exit.

       --version
              -- print version and exit.

       --log <number>
              -- set log level 0-5. 0 - none 5 - chatty

       --configure
              -- open configuration dialog

       --profile <name>
              -- use specified profile. The profile is loaded from the file
              ~/.config/fbpanel/<name>.  If that fails, fbpanel will load
              /usr/local/share/fbpanel/<name>.  No -p option is equivalent to
              -p default

       -h     -- same as --help

       -p     -- same as --profile

       -v     -- same as --version

       -C     -- same as --configure


CUSTOMIZATION
       To change default settings, copy profile file to your home directory
             mkdir -p ~/.config/fbpanel
             cp /usr/local/share/fbpanel/default ~/.config/fbpanel
       and edit it. Default profile file contains comments and explanation
       inside, so it should be easy. For full list of options please visit
       fbpanel's home page.


FILES
       /usr/local/share/fbpanel/
              Directory with system-wide resources and default settings

       ~/.config/fbpanel/
              Directory with the user's private profiles
