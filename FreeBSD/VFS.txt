VFS(9)                 FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual                VFS(9)

NAME
     VFS – kernel interface to file systems

DESCRIPTION
     Calls used to set or query file systems for settings or information.

     File systems that do not implement a VFS operation should use the
     appropriate vfs_std function from src/sys/kern/vfs_default.c rather than
     implementing empty functions or casting to eopnotsupp.
