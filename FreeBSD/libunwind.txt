_U_DYN_CANCEL(3libunwind)    Programming Library     _U_DYN_CANCEL(3libunwind)

NAME
       _U_dyn_cancel -- cancel unwind-info for dynamically generated code

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       void _U_dyn_cancel(unw_dyn_info_t *di);

DESCRIPTION
       The _U_dyn_cancel() routine cancels the registration of the unwind info
       for a dynamically generated procedure. Argument di is the pointer to
       the unw_dyn_info_t structure that describes the procedure's
       unwind-info.

       The _U_dyn_cancel() routine is guaranteed to execute in constant time
       (in the absence of contention from concurrent calls to
       _U_dyn_register() or _U_dyn_cancel()).

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       _U_dyn_cancel() is thread safe but not safe to use from a signal
       handler.
