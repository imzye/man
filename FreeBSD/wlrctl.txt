TOPLEVEL MATCHSPEC
       A match is a colon separated attribute/value pair. e.g. To match a
       firefox window, a suitable match value is app_id:firefox. You may give
       any number of match specifiers, and a window must match all of them to
       be considered. If the app_id or title keys are specified more than
       once, a window may match any of the given values. Otherwise later key
       value pairs override previous ones. A match without a key is assumed to
       be an app_id, so just firefox works in the example above.

       Currently supported attributes are: app_id, title, and state.

       Supported state values are: maximized, minimized, active, and
       fullscreen, and their negations: unmaximized, unminimized, inactive,
       and unfullscreen.  You can also use a '-' prefix, for example
       state:-fullscreen.
