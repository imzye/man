DESCRIPTION
       The "Protocol::ACME" is a class implementing an interface for the Let's
       Encrypt ACME API.

       NOTE: This code at this point is functional but should be considered
       'alpha' quality.

       The class handles the protocol details behind provisioning a Let's
       Encrypt certificate.

CONSTRUCTOR METHODS
       The following constructor methods are available:

       $acme = Protcol::ACME->new( %options )
           This method constructs a new "Protocl::ACME" object and returns it.
           Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the initial
           state.  The may be passed in as a hash or a hashref. The following
           options correspond to attribute methods described below. Items
           marked with a * are required.

              KEY                     DEFAULT
              -----------             --------------------
              *host                   undef
              account_key             undef
              openssl                 undef
              ua                      HTTP::Tiny->new()
              loglevel                error
              debug                   0
              mailto                  undef

           host: The API end point to connect to.  This will generally be
           acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org or acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org

           account_key: The account private key in a scalar ref or filename.
           See "$self-"account_key> for details on this arguemtn.

           openssl: The path to openssl.  If this option is used a local
           version of the openssl binary will be used for crypto operations
           rather than "Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA".

           ua: An HTTP::Tiny object customized as you see fit

           loglevel: Set the loglevel to one of the "Log::Any" values.

           debug: If set to non-zero this is a shortcut for "loglevel ="
           debug>

           mailto: This should be the email address that you want associated
           with your account.  This is used my Let's Encrypt for expiration
           notification.

   METHODS
       account_key( $key_filename )
       account_key( \$buffer )
       account_key( \%explicit_args )
           "account_key" will load a the private account key if it was not
           already loaded when the "pProtocol::ACME" object was constructed.
           There are three ways to call this:

           If the arg is a SCALAR it is assumed to be the filename of the key.
           "account_key" will throw an error if there are problems reading the
           file.

           If the arg is a SCALAR reference it is assumed to be a buffer that
           contains the KEY.

           If the arg is a HASH reference it contains named arguments.  The
           arguments are:

              KEY          DEFAUL        DESC
              -----------  -----------   -------------------
              filename     undef         The key Filename
              buffer       undef         Buffer containing the key
              format       undef         Explicitly state the format ( DER | PEM )

           If both "filename" and "buffer" are set the "buffer" argument will
           be ignored.

           If the format is not explcitly set "Protocol::ACME" will look at
           the key and try and determine what the format it.

       load_key_from_disk( $key_path )
           DEPRECATED

           Load a key from disk.  Currently the key needs to be unencrypted.
           Callbacks for handling password protected keys are still to come.

       directory()
           Loads the directory from the ACME host.  This call must be made
           first before any other calls to the API in order the bootstrap the
           API resource list.

       register( %args )
           Call the new-reg resource and create an account associated with the
           loaded account key.  If that key has already been registered this
           method will gracefully and silently handle that.

           Arguments that can be passed in:

              KEY                     DEFAULT
              -----------             --------------------
              mailto                  undef

           mailto: See "new" for a desciption.  This will override the value
           passed to new if any.

       accept_tos()
           In order to use the Let's Encrypt service, the account needs to
           accept the Terms of Service.  This is provided in a link header in
           response to the new-reg ( or reg ) resource call.  If the TOS have
           already been accepted as indicated by the reg structure returned by
           the API this call will be a noop.

       authz( $domain )
           "authz" needs to be called for each domain ( called identifiers in
           ACME speak ) in the certificate.  This included the domain in the
           subject as well as the Subject Alternate Name (SAN) fields.  Each
           call to "authz" will result in a challenge being issued from Let's
           Encrypt.  These challenges need to be handled individually.

       handle_challenge( $challenge_object )
           "handle_challenge" is called for each challenge issued by "authz".
           The challenge object must be a subclass of
           "Protocol::ACME::Challenge" which implements a 'handle' method.
           This objects handle method will be passed three arguments and is
           expected to fulfill the preconditions for the chosen challenge.
           The three areguments are:

             fingerprint: the sha256 hex digest of the account key
             token: the challenge token
             url: the url returned by the challenge

           Fully describing how to handle every challenge type of out of the
           scope of this documentation ( at least for now ).  Two challenge
           classes have been included for reference:

           "Protocol::ACME::Challenge::SimpleSSH" is initialized with the ssh
           host name and the www root for the web server for the http-01
           challenge.  It will ssh to the host and create the file in the
           correct location for challenge fulfillment.

           "Protocol::ACME::Challenge::LocalFile" is initialized with just the
           www root for the web server for the http-01 challenge.  It will
           simply create the challenge file in the correct place on the local
           filesystem.

           "Protocol::ACME::Challenge::Manual" is intended to be run in an
           interactive manner and will stop and prompt the user with the
           relevant information so they can fulfill the challenge manually.

           but below is an example for handling the simpleHTTP ( http-01 )
           challenge.

       check_challenge()
           Called after "handle_challenge".  This will poll the challenge
           status resource and will return when the state changes from
           'pending'.

       cleanup_challenge()
           Called after "check_challenge" to remove the challenge files.

       $cert = sign( $csr_filename )
       $cert = sign( \$buffer )
       $cert = sign( \%explicit_args )
           Call "sign" after the challenge for each domain ( itentifier ) has
           been fulfilled.  There are three ways to call this:

           If the arg is a SCALAR it is assumed to be the filename of the CSR.
           "sign" will throw an error if there are problems reading the file.

           If the arg is a SCALAR reference it is assumed to be a buffer that
           contains the CSR.

           If the arg is a HASH reference it contains named arguments.  The
           arguments are:

              KEY          DEFAUL        DESC
              -----------  -----------   -------------------
              filename     undef         The CSR Filename
              buffer       undef         Buffer containing the CSR
              format       undef         Explicitly state the format ( DER | PEM )

           If both "filename" and "buffer" are set the "buffer" argument will
           be ignored.

           If the format is not explcitly set Protocol::ACME will look at the
           CSR and try and determine what the format it.

           On success "Protocol::ACME" will return the DER encoded signed
           certificate.

       $cert_chain = chain()
           After "sign" has been called and a cert successfully created,
           "chain" will fetch and return the DER encoded certificate issuer.

       revoke( $certfile )
           Call "revoke" to revoke an already issued certificate. $certfile
           must point the a DER encoded form of the certificate.

       recovery_key()
           LE does not yet support recovery keys.  This method will die when
           called.
