STDINT(7)          FreeBSD Miscellaneous Information Manual          STDINT(7)

NAME
     stdint – standard integer types

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdint.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The <stdint.h> header provides source-portable integer types of a
     specific size, smallest memory footprint with a minimum size, fastest
     access speed with a minimum size, largest integer size, and those capable
     of storing pointers.

     The types int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, and int64_t provide a signed integer
     type of width 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, respectively.  The types uint8_t,
     uint16_t, uint32_t, and uint64_t provide an unsigned integer type of
     width 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, respectively.  These integer types should be
     used when a specific size is required.

     The types int_fast8_t, int_fast16_t, int_fast32_t, and int_fast64_t
     provide the fastest signed integer type with a width of at least 8, 16,
     32, or 64 bits, respectively.  The types uint_fast8_t, uint_fast16_t,
     uint_fast32_t, and uint_fast64_t provide the fastest unsigned integer
     type with a width of at least 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, respectively.  These
     types should be used when access speed is paramount, and when a specific
     size is not required.

     The types int_least8_t, int_least16_t, int_least32_t, and int_least64_t
     provide the smallest memory footprint signed integer type with a width of
     at least 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, respectively.  The types uint_least8_t,
     uint_least16_t, uint_least32_t, and uint_least64_t provide the smallest
     memory footprint unsigned integer type with a width of at least 8, 16,
     32, or 64 bits, respectively.  These types should be used when memory
     storage is of concern, and when a specific size is not required.

     The type intmax_t provides a signed integer type large enough to hold any
     other signed integer.  The type uintmax_t provides an unsigned integer
     type large enough to hold any other unsigned integer.  These types are
     generally the largest signed and unsigned integer types available on a
     specific architecture.

     The type intptr_t provides a signed integer type with the ability to hold
     a pointer to void, that can later be converted back to a pointer to void.

     The type uintptr_t provides an unsigned integer type with the ability to
     hold a pointer to void, that can later be converted back to a pointer to
     void.

     Additionally, the <stdint.h> header defines some macros, but none of them
     are documented here.

STANDARDS
     The <stdint.h> header conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (“ISO C99”) and IEEE
     Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

HISTORY
     The <stdint.h> header was first introduced in FreeBSD 5.0.
