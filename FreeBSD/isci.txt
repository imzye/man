ISCI(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                ISCI(4)

NAME
     isci – Intel C600 Serial Attached SCSI driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into your kernel, place the following lines in
     your kernel configuration file:

           device scbus
           device isci

     Or, to load the driver as a module at boot, place the following line in
     loader.conf(5):

           isci_load="YES"

HARDWARE
     The isci driver provides support for Intel C600 SAS controllers.

CONFIGURATION
     To force legacy interrupts for all isci driver instances, set the
     following tunable value in loader.conf(5):

           hw.isci.force_legacy_interrupts=1

DEBUGGING
     To enable debugging prints from the isci driver, set the

           hw.isci.debug_level

     variable to a value between 1 and 4 in loader.conf(5).

     The hardware layer in the isci driver has extensive logging capabilities
     which are disabled by default for performance reasons.  These can be
     enabled by adding

           options ISCI_LOGGING

     to the kernel configuration file.
