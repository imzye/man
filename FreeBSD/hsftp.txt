NAME
       hsftp - ftp emulator for ssh1


SYNOPSIS
       hsftp [-v][-l username][-p portnumber] remote_host
       hsftp [-h]



DESCRIPTION
       hsftp is an ftp emulator that provides the look-and-feel of an ftp
       session, but uses ssh to transport commands and data.

       hsftp executes UNIX commands on the remote host, and thus will fail on
       non-UNIX remote hosts.  If needed, hsftp will ask for the password.
       (The password is encrypted by ssh before transmission.)

       Only a subset set of ftp commands is implemented: (m)put, (m)get,
       dir/ls, ldir, cd, lcd, pwd, chmod, mkdir, del/rm, ?/help, quit/bye.


OPTIONS
       -l username
              The username on the remote host. Only required if not identical
              to the username on the local host.

       -p portnumber
              The port on the remote host. Only required if not the default
              port (22).

       -v     Be more verbose.

       -h     Print help.


CAVEATS
       For speed, hsftp doesn't check whether a 'cd' on the remote host is
       valid (i.e. whether the remote directory exists.)

       get/put is always recursive. Already existing files are always
       overwritten.

       If not installed SUID root, the password, once typed in, may be paged
       out to the swap partition when the program is left idle for some time.

BUGS
       It has been reported that on FreeBSD, when downloading a file, it says:
       Write failed flushing stdout buffer.  However, the file transfer is
       successful.

       With OpenSSH, you may get the following error message after uploading
       files: Error reading from pipe: I/O error.  However, the file transfer
       is successful.
