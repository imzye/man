NDISGEN(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             NDISGEN(8)

NAME
     ndisgen – generate a FreeBSD driver module from a Windows® NDIS driver
     distribution

SYNOPSIS
     ndisgen [/path/to/INF /path/to/SYS]

DESCRIPTION
     The ndisgen script uses the ndiscvt(8) utility and other tools to
     generate a FreeBSD loadable driver module and a static ELF object module
     from a Windows® NDIS driver, for use with the ndis(4) compatibility
     module.

     The ndisgen script is interactive and contains its own help section.
     Unless the paths to both files are supplied on the command line, the
     script will prompt the user for the .INF and .SYS files needed to
     generate the FreeBSD driver module.  The script will also prompt for any
     firmware or other external files needed.
