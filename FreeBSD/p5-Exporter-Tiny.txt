NAME
       Exporter::Shiny - shortcut for Exporter::Tiny

SYNOPSIS
          use Exporter::Shiny qw( foo bar );

       Is a shortcut for:

          use base "Exporter::Tiny";
          push our(@EXPORT_OK), qw( foo bar );

       For compatibility with Sub::Exporter, the following longer syntax is
       also supported:

          use Exporter::Shiny -setup => {
             exports => [qw( foo bar )],
          };

DESCRIPTION
       This is a very small wrapper to simplify using Exporter::Tiny.

       It does the following:

       •   Marks your package as loaded in %INC;

       •   Pushes any function names in the import list onto your @EXPORT_OK;
           and

       •   Pushes "Exporter::Tiny" onto your @ISA.

       It doesn't set up %EXPORT_TAGS or @EXPORT, but there's nothing stopping
       you doing that yourself.

       This module is just a wrapper around Exporter::Tiny, so take a look at
       Exporter::Tiny::Manual::QuickStart and
       Exporter::Tiny::Manual::Exporting for further information on what
       features are available.

       Other interesting exporters: Sub::Exporter, Exporter.
