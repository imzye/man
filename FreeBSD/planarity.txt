       planarity


   Batch modes
       planarity -s [-q] COMMAND INPUT OUTPUT [COMPLEMENT]

       planarity -r [-q] COMMAND K N [OUTPUT]

       planarity -rm [-q] N OUTPUT [COMPLEMENT]

       planarity -x [-q] -(gam) INPUT OUTPUT

DESCRIPTION
       Invokes the Edge Addition Planarity Suite command-line tool, either in
       interactive mode or in batch mode.

       Without a parameter, the tool presents a menu-driven interactive
       interface.

       When a parameter is given, it runs in batch mode and returns 0 or 1 for
       a successful result and -1 on error.


OPTIONS
       -h, -help [-menu]
              Display some help, with -menu triggering even more detailed
              output.


       -i, -info
              Display version, copyright, license, and reference articles
              information.


       -q     Quiet mode optional modifier, see below which options accept it.


       -s [-q] COMMAND INPUT OUTPUT [COMPLEMENT]
              Run the COMMAND (see below) on a specific graph given in the
              INPUT file, with output in the primary OUTPUT file and
              complementary information, if any, in the secondary COMPLEMENT
              file (e.g. an ASCII art rendition for the planar graph drawing
              command). The return value is 0 if the specific graph is
              embeddable (e.g. it is planar or doesn't contain a homeomorphic
              subgraph) and 1 if it isn't embeddable (e.g. non planar or does
              contain a homeomorphic subgraph).


       -r [-q] COMMAND K N [OUTPUT]
              Run the COMMAND (see below) on K random graphs with N vertices.
              Optionally, write all generated graphs to .g6 OUTPUT.


       -rm [-q] N OUTPUT [COMPLEMENT]
              Generate a random maximal planar graph with N vertices, then
              output its planar embedding in the primary OUTPUT file and
              optionally the generated graph in the COMPLEMENT file.


       -rn [-q] N OUTPUT [COMPLEMENT]
              Generate a random nonplanar graph (maximal planar plus one edge)
              with N vertices, then output a Kuratowski subgraph of the
              generated graph in the primary OUTPUT file and optionally the
              gnerated graph in the COMPLEMENT file.


       [-q] -(gam) INPUT OUTPUT
              Transform single graph in INPUT file (any supported format) to
              .g6 (g), adjacency list (a), or adjacency matrix (m) format and
              output to OUTPUT file.


       [-q] COMMAND INPUT OUTPUT
              Run the COMMAND (see below) on graphs in .g6 encoded INPUT file,
              then output summary statistics to OUTPUT file.


COMMANDS
       Determine which algorithm implementation to run:

       -p     Planar embedding and Kuratowski subgraph isolation

       -d     Planar graph drawing by visibility representation (and optional
              ASCII art rendition)

       -o     Outerplanar embedding and obstruction isolation

       -2     Search for subgraph homeomorphic to K_{2,3}

       -3     Search for subgraph homeomorphic to K_{3,3}

       -4     Search for subgraph homeomorphic to K_4


EXAMPLES
       planarity -s -q -p infile.txt embedding.out [obstruction.out]
              Process infile.txt in quiet mode (-q), putting planar embedding
              in embedding.out or (optionally) a Kuratowski subgraph in
              obstruction.out.  Process returns 0=planar, 1=nonplanar,
              -1=error

       planarity -s -q -d infile.txt embedding.out [drawing.out]
              If graph in infile.txt is planar, then put embedding in
              embedding.out and (optionally) an ASCII art drawing in
              drawing.out.  Process returns 0=planar, 1=nonplanar, -1=error
