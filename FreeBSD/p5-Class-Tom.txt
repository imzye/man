NAME
       Class::Tom - The Transportable Object Model for Perl

SYNOPSIS
       use Class::Tom qw ( restore );

       my $tom = new Class::Tom;

       $tom->insert(<OBJECT>);

       $tom->insert(<ANONYMOUS SUB>);

       $tom->insert(<PACKAGE NAME>);

       my $flat = $tom->store();

       my $newtom = restore( $flat );

DESCRIPTION
       "Class::Tom" allows you to transport objects from one system to another
       without requiring that the packages the object relies on actually exist
       on the other machine.

METHODS
       new "new" is the objects constructor.  It can optionally take the
           Encoder argument if you've created a new encoding scheme.

       insert
           The "insert" method accepts one of three things as an argument, a)
           an CODE reference (such as an anonymous subroutine or a reference
           to a subroutine), b) an Object or c) a string that contains the
           package name.  If you insert an Object then "insert" returns the id
           of that object in the internal object list.

       extract
           The "extract" method returns an object that has been "insert"'ed.
           The argument is the Id of the object you insert.

       store
           The "store" method returns the flattened container ready for
           shipping.

       register
           The "register" method evals each of the methods stored inside the
           TOM compartment

       restore
           "restore" is optionally exported, and is used to turn a flattened
           TOM object into a real perl object.

BUGS
       There are probably loads.  I've not had time to test this on any
       machine other than my own,  so your milage may vary.  Remember, this is
       a beta version.  3.02 will be the full bugfixed release.
