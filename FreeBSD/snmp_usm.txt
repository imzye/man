NAME
     snmp_usm – user-based security module for bsnmpd(1)

LIBRARY
     (begemotSnmpdModulePath."usm" = /usr/lib/snmp_usm.so)

DESCRIPTION
     The snmp_usm module implements SNMPv3 User-Based Security Model MIB as
     defined in RFC 3414.  The module is used to manage the internal list of
     SNMPv3 USM active users in bsnmpd.  The module must be loaded for bsnmpd
     to receive and process SNMPv3 USM PDUs correctly.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     A short description of the objects in the MIB follows.

     usmStats   The subtree contains statistics for the User-based Security
                Model PDU processing.  The statistics are reset each time the
                module is loaded.

     usmUserSpinLock
                An advisory lock used to coordinate several Command Generator
                Applications when altering the SNMP USM users.

     usmUserTable
                The table contains all SNMP USM users configured in bsnmpd.
                The table contains the following objects

                usmUserEngineID         An SNMP engine's administratively-
                                        unique identifier. Must be set to the
                                        same Engine ID as bsnmpd so that the
                                        user will actually be allowed to
                                        communicate with the daemon.  The
                                        column is used as entry key and is not
                                        accessible for GET or SET operations.

                usmUserName             The USM user name. The second entry
                                        key, again not accessible for GET or
                                        SET operations.

                usmUserSecurityName     The column has the exact same value as
                                        the usmUserName column, however is
                                        accessible for GET operations.

                usmUserCloneFrom        A GET on this column will return an
                                        empty OID. SET operations are
                                        currently not supported.

                usmUserAuthProtocol     The value of this column contains the
                                        OID corresponding to the
                                        authentication protocol used by the
                                        USM user. The following protocols and
                                        their OIDs are known to snmp_usm
                                        module

                                        NoAuthProtocol 1.3.6.1.6.3.10.1.1.1

                                        HMACMD5AuthProtocol
                                                               1.3.6.1.6.3.10.1.1.2

                                        HMACSHAAuthProtocol
                                                               1.3.6.1.6.3.10.1.1.3

                usmUserAuthKeyChange, usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange
                                        These columns may be used to change
                                        the user's authentication key.

                usmUserPrivProtocol     The value of this column contains the
                                        OID corresponding to the privacy
                                        protocol used by the USM user. The
                                        following protocols and their OIDs are
                                        known to snmp_usm module

                                        NoPrivProtocol 1.3.6.1.6.3.10.1.2.1

                                        DESPrivProtoco 1.3.6.1.6.3.10.1.2.2

                                        AesCfb128Protocol 1.3.6.1.6.3.10.1.2.4

                usmUserPrivKeyChange, usmUserOwnPrivKeyChange
                                        These columns may be used to change
                                        the user's privacy key.

                usmUserPublic           An arbitrary octet string that may be
                                        modified to confirm a SET operation on
                                        any of the columns was successful.

                usmUserStorageType      This column always has either of two
                                        values. Entries created via bsnmpd's
                                        configuration file always have this
                                        column set to readOnly (5) and it is
                                        not possible to modify those entries.
                                        Entries created by Command Generator
                                        Applications always have this column
                                        set to volatile(2) and such entries
                                        are lost when the module is restarted.
                                        A SET operation on this column is not
                                        allowed.

                usmUserStatus           This column is used to create new USM
                                        user entries or delete existing ones
                                        from the table.
