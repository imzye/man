wlclock(1)                       Version 1.0.1                      wlclock(1)

NAME
       wlclock - A digital analog clock for Wayland

DESCRIPTION
       wlclock displays an analog clock on Wayland desktops.

       wlclock is inspired by xclock(1) and the default configuration has been
       chosen to mimic it. However unlike xclock, wlclock is not a regular
       window but a desktop-widget.

       A Wayland compositor must implement the Layer-Shell and XDG-Output for
       wlclock to work.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display help message and exit.

       -V, --version
           Display version and exit.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity of logging.

       --background-colour <colour>
           The background colour of the clock. The default is "#FFFFFF".

       --border-colour <colour>
           The border colour of the clock. The default is "#000000".

       --border-size <size>, --border-size <top> <right> <bottom> <left>
           Set the border size. Requires either one argument, to set all
           border sizes, or four arguments, to set the border sizes
           individually. The default border size is 1.

       --clock-colour <colour>
           The colour of clock elements. The default is "#000000".

       --corner-radius <radius>, --corner-radius <top-left> <top-right>
       <bottom-right> <bottom-left>
           The radius of the corners. Expects either one argument, to set the
           radius of all corners, or four arguments, to set the individual
           corner radii. If set to sufficiently high values, wlclock will be
           completely round. Set to 0 to disable corner roundness. The default
           radius is 0.

       --exclusive-zone <option>
           Exclusive zone of the surface. Can be "true", "false" or
           "stationary". If "true", the compositor is informed that it should
           not obstruct the surface of wlclock with other surfaces. If
           "false", the compositor is informed that it can place other
           surfaces over or under the surface of wlclock. If "stationary", the
           compositor is informed that the surface of wlclock should not be
           moved to accommodate other layer shell surfaces and that it can
           freely place other surfaces over or under the surface of wlclock.
           The default is "stationary". The exact implementation is compositor
           dependant; A compositor may choose to ignore the requested
           exclusive zone of surfaces.

       --hand-width <size>
           The width of the clock hands. If set to 0, wlclock will draw
           xclock-like clock hands. The default is 0.

       --layer <layer>
           Layer of the layer surface. Can be "overlay", "top", "bottom" or
           "background". Typically, "bottom" and "background" will be
           underneath regular windows, while "top" and "overlay" will be above
           them, however the exact placement on the z axis depends on the
           implementation of the compositor. The default layer is "overlay".

       --margin <size>, --margin <top> <right> <bottom> <left>
           Set the margin. Requires either one argument, to set all margins,
           or four arguments, to set the margins individually. The default
           margin is 0.

       --marking-width <size>
           The width of the markings on the clock face. The default is 1.

       --namespace <namespace>
           The namespace of the layers surface. Some compositors may treat
           layer surfaces differently based on their namespace. The default is
           "wlclock".

       --no-input
           If this flag is used, wlclock will ask the compositor to not send
           it input events; This will make mouse events pass through wlclock
           to windows beneath it.

       --output <output name>
           Name of the output on which wlclock should be displayed. Output
           names are compositor dependant. If set to "all" or "*", wlclock
           will be displayed on all outputs, which is the default behaviour.

       --position <position>
           Set the position of the clock. Can be "center", "top", "right",
           "bottom", "left", "top-right", "top-left", "bottom-right" and
           "bottom-left". Defaults to "center".

       --size <size>
           The size of the clock, without borders. The default size is 165.

       --snap
           If this flag is used, the hour hand will instantly snap to the next
           position once the new hour begins, instead of slowly progressing
           over the hour.

COLOURS
       wlclock can parse hex code colours and read RGB values directly.

       The supported formats are "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBBAA", "0xRRGGBB" and
       "0xRRGGBBAA" for hex code colours and "rgb(rrr,ggg,bbb)" and
       "rgba(rrr,ggg,bbb,aaa)" for RGB colours.
