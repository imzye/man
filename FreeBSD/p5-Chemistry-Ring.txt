NAME
       Chemistry::Ring - Represent a ring as a substructure of a molecule

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::Ring;

           # already have a molecule in $mol...
           # create a ring with the first six atoms in $mol
           my $ring = Chemistry::Ring->new;
           $ring->add_atom($_) for $mol->atoms(1 .. 6);

           # find the centroid
           my $vector = $ring->centroid;

           # find the plane that fits the ring
           my ($normal, $distance) = $ring->plane;

           # is the ring aromatic?
           print "is aromatic!\n" if $ring->is_aromatic;

           # "aromatize" a molecule
           Chemistry::Ring::aromatize_mol($mol);

           # get the rings involving an atom (after aromatizing)
           my $rings = $mol->atoms(3)->attr('ring/rings');

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides some basic methods for representing a ring. A ring
       is a subclass of molecule, because it has atoms and bonds. Besides
       that, it has some useful geometric methods for finding the centroid and
       the ring plane, and methods for aromaticity detection.

       This module does not detect the rings by itself; for that, look at
       Chemistry::Ring::Find.

       This module is part of the PerlMol project, <http://www.perlmol.org/>.

METHODS
       Chemistry::Ring->new(name => value, ...)
           Create a new Ring object with the specified attributes. Same as
           "Chemistry::Mol->new".

       $ring->centroid
           Returs a vector with the centroid, defined as the average of the
           coordinates of all the atoms in the ring. The vecotr is a
           Math::VectorReal object.

       my ($norm, $d) = $ring->plane
           Returns the normal and distance to the origin that define the plane
           that best fits the atoms in the ring, by using multivariate
           regression. The normal vector is a Math::VectorReal object.

       $ring->is_aromatic
           Naively guess whether ring is aromatic from the molecular graph,
           with a method based on Huckel's rule. This method is not very
           accurate, but works for simple molecules. Returns true or false.

EXPORTABLE SUBROUTINES
       Nothing is exported by default, but you can export these subroutines
       explicitly, or all of them by using the ':all' tag.

       aromatize_mol($mol)
           Finds all the aromatic rings in the molecule and marks all the
           atoms and bonds in those rings as aromatic.

           It also adds the 'ring/rings' attribute to the molecule and to all
           ring atoms and bonds; this attribute is an array reference
           containing the list of rings that involve that atom or bond (or all
           the rings in the case of the molecule).  NOTE (the ring/rings
           attribute is experimental and might change in future versions).
