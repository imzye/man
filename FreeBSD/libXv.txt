Xv(3)                           libXv Functions                          Xv(3)

NAME
       Xv - X Window System video extension

DESCRIPTION
       The X Video Extension (Xv) extension provides support for video
       adaptors attached to an X display.  It takes the approach that a
       display may have one or more video adaptors, each of which has one or
       more ports through which independent video streams pass.

       An adaptor may be able to display video in a drawable, capture video
       from a drawable, or both.  It translates between video encoding (NTSC,
       PAL, SECAM, etc...) and drawable format (depth and visual-id pair). An
       adaptor may support multiple video encodings and/or multiple drawable
       formats.

       Clients use Xv(3) to gain access and manage sharing of a display's
       video resources.  Typically, a client will use XvQueryExtension(3) to
       determine the status of the extension, XvQueryAdaptors(3) to get a
       description of what video adaptors exist, and XvQueryEncodings(3) to
       get a description of what video encodings an adaptor supports.

       Once a client has determined what video resources are available, it is
       free to put video into a drawable or get video from a drawable,
       according the capabilities supported.  Clients can select to receive
       events when video activity changes in a drawable and when port
       attributes have changed.

       The Xv protocol version 2.2 and later is extended to support client
       images in alternate colorspaces (XvImages).  Xv adaptors which are
       capable of displaying XvImages will have the XvImageMask field set in
       the type field of the XvAdaptorInfo.  XvImage formats supported by the
       port may be queried with XvListImageFormats(3).  XvImages may be
       created with the help of XvCreateImage(3) or XvShmCreateImage(3);
       XvImages may be displayed with XvPutImage(3) or XvShmPutImage(3).  The
       Port attributes of the port specified in the Xv(Shm)PutImage command
       will be valid for the image operation when applicable.  There will be a
       port encoding with the name "XV_IMAGE".  The width and height of that
       encoding will indicate the maximum source image size.
