EMP_SERVER(6)                FreeBSD Games Manual                EMP_SERVER(6)

NAME
       emp_server - Empire server

SYNOPSIS
       emp_server [-dFhpsv] [-e configfile] [-E action] [-R seed]

DESCRIPTION
       emp_server is a daemon which listens to the Empire port for players
       connecting to the game.  For more information on the game of Empire,
       see the info pages within the game.

OPTIONS
       -d     Debug mode.  This will prevent the server from forking itself
              into the background.  Implies -E abort.  You normally want to
              use this flag if you are running emp_server from within a
              debugger.

       -e configfile
              Use game configuration in configfile.

       -E action
              What to do on recoverable internal error ("oops"): abort,
              crash-dump (but continue), nothing (default).  crash-dump works
              by aborting a fork of the server process.

       -F     Force emp_server to start even when game state looks bad.  Risks
              crashes and further corruption; use this only for attempting to
              fix up problems.  Better make a backup first, and lock out
              players.

       -h     Help.  Print brief usage information and exit.

       -p     Threading debug mode.  Implies -d.

       -s     Enable thread stack checking.

       -R  seed
              Set the seed for random function.

       -v     Print version information and exit.

OPERANDS
       Operands are ignored for backward compatibility.  Their use is
       deprecated.


SIGNALS
       SIGHUP Request emp_server to reopen log files and reload its
              configuration.  This allows proper log rotation.  Only the
              update schedule is reloaded at this time.

       SIGINT, SIGTERM
              Request emp_server to shut down immediately.
