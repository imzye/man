ARPDIG(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              ARPDIG(1)

NAME
     arpdig – dig an interface for arp responses

SYNOPSIS
     arpdig [-nq] [-i ifname] [-F fromaddr] netblock/len
     arpdig [-n] -p [-F fromaddr] [-f file] ipaddr ...

DESCRIPTION
     The arpdig utility is used to send a bunch of ARP whohas requests for a
     given address block or list and collect and show ARP responses to them.

     The following options are available:

     -n      Disable nameserver lookups for IP addresses responded.

     -q      Be less verbose; show nothing but ARP responses and/or
             errors/warnings.

     -F fromaddr
             Send ARP whohas requests from given IP address.

     -i ifname
             Send ARP whohas requests via given interface instead of auto-
             determined one.

     -p      Probe list of IP addresses specified instead of whole netblock.

     -f file
             Using together with -p flag, instructs arpdig to read IP address
             list from file and prepend it to the list specified on the
             command line.

     By default, arpdig determines the interface to send ARP requests by
     asking the kernel for a route to the netblock.  A warning will be emitted
     if no such route can be obtained.

     If no -F flag is given, arpdig uses the first IP address inside the
     probed block on selected interface.  If no such address exists, 0.0.0.0
     will be used.

REQUIREMENTS
     arpdig uses bpf(4) both for sending ARP requests and for listening to ARP
     responses.

SEE ALSO
     bpf(4)

BUGS
     Late ARP responses may be missed.

     Probe mode should be rewritten to use bpf(4) more effeciently.

     Using -F with argument 0 acts as there is no -F flag instead of asking
     from 0.0.0.0 address.
