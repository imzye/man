SPIGEN(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              SPIGEN(4)

NAME
     spigen – SPI generic I/O device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device spi
           device spibus
           device spigen

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           spigen_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The spigen driver provides direct access to a slave device on the SPI
     bus.  Each instance of a spigen device is associated with a single chip-
     select line on the bus, and all I/O performed through that instance is
     done with that chip-select line asserted.

     SPI data transfers are inherently bi-directional; there are no separate
     read and write operations.  When commands and data are sent to a device,
     data also comes back from the device, although in some cases the data may
     not be useful (or even documented or predictable for some devices).
     Likewise on a read operation, whatever data is in the buffer at the start
     of the operation is sent to (and typically ignored by) the device, with
     each outgoing byte then replaced in the buffer by the corresponding
     incoming byte.  Thus, all buffers passed to the transfer functions are
     both input and output buffers.

     The spigen driver provides access to the SPI slave device with the
     following ioctl(2) calls, defined in <sys/spigenio.h>:

     SPIGENIOC_TRANSFER (struct spigen_transfer)
             Transfer a command and optional associated data to/from the
             device, using the buffers described by the st_command and st_data
             fields in the spigen_transfer.  Set st_data.iov_len to zero if
             there is no data associated with the command.

             struct spigen_transfer {
                     struct iovec st_command;
                     struct iovec st_data;
             };

     SPIGENIOC_TRANSFER_MMAPPED (spigen_transfer_mmapped)
             Transfer a command and optional associated data to/from the
             device.  The buffers for the transfer are a previously-mmap'd
             region.  The length of the command and data within that region
             are described by the stm_command_length and stm_data_length
             fields of spigen_transfer_mmapped.  If stm_data_length is non-
             zero, the data appears in the memory region immediately following
             the command (that is, at offset stm_command_length from the start
             of the mapped region).

             struct spigen_transfer_mmapped {
                     size_t stm_command_length;
                     size_t stm_data_length;
             };

     SPIGENIOC_GET_CLOCK_SPEED (uint32_t)
             Get the maximum clock speed (bus frequency in Hertz) to be used
             when communicating with this slave device.

     SPIGENIOC_SET_CLOCK_SPEED (uint32_t)
             Set the maximum clock speed (bus frequency in Hertz) to be used
             when communicating with this slave device.  The setting remains
             in effect for subsequent transfers; it is not necessary to reset
             this before each transfer.  The actual bus frequency may be lower
             due to hardware limitations of the SPI bus controller device.

     SPIGENIOC_GET_SPI_MODE (uint32_t)
             Get the SPI mode (clock polarity and phase) to be used when
             communicating with this device.

     SPIGENIOC_SET_SPI_MODE (uint32_t)
             Set the SPI mode (clock polarity and phase) to be used when
             communicating with this device.  The setting remains in effect
             for subsequent transfers; it is not necessary to reset this
             before each transfer.

HINTS CONFIGURATION
     On a device.hints(5) based system, such as MIPS, these values are
     configurable for spigen:

     hint.spigen.%d.at
             The spibus the spigen instance is attached to.

     hint.spigen.%d.clock
             The maximum bus frequency to use when communicating with this
             device.  Actual bus speed may be lower, depending on the
             capabilities of the SPI bus controller hardware.

     hint.spigen.%d.cs
             The chip-select number to assert when performing I/O for this
             device.  Set the high bit (1 << 31) to invert the logic level of
             the chip select line.

     hint.spigen.%d.mode
             The SPI mode (0-3) to use when communicating with this device.

FDT CONFIGURATION
     On an fdt(4) based system, the spigen device is defined as a slave device
     subnode of the SPI bus controller node.  All properties documented in the
     spibus.txt bindings document can be used with the spigen device.  The
     most commonly-used ones are documented below.

     The following properties are required in the spigen device subnode:

     compatible
             Must be the string "freebsd,spigen".

     reg     Chip select address of device.

     spi-max-frequency
             The maximum bus frequency to use when communicating with this
             slave device.  Actual bus speed may be lower, depending on the
             capabilities of the SPI bus controller hardware.

     The following properties are optional for the spigen device subnode:

     spi-cpha
             Empty property indicating the slave device requires shifted clock
             phase (CPHA) mode.

     spi-cpol
             Empty property indicating the slave device requires inverse clock
             polarity (CPOL) mode.

     spi-cs-high
             Empty property indicating the slave device requires chip select
             active high.
