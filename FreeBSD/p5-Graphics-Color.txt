NAME
       Graphics::Color - Device and library agnostic color spaces.

VERSION
       version 0.31

SYNOPSIS
         my $color = Graphics::Color::RGB->new(
             red => .5, green => .5, blue => .5, alpha => .5
         );
         say $color->as_string;

DESCRIPTION
       Graphics color is a device and library agnostic system for creating and
       manipulating colors in various color spaces.

DISCLAIMER
       I'm not an art student or a wizard of arcane color knowledge.  I'm a
       normal programmer with a penchant for things graphical.  Hence this
       module is likely incomplete in some places.  Patches are encouraged.
       I've intentions of adding more color spaces as well as conversion
       routines (where applicable).

COLOR TYPES
       The following color types are supported.

       CMYK

       HSL

       HSV

       RGB

       YIQ

       YUV

METHODS
   derive
       Clone this color but allow one of more of it's attributes to change by
       passing in a hashref of options:

         my $new = $color->derive({ attr => $newvalue });

       The returned color will be identical to the cloned one, save the
       attributes specified.

   equal_to
       Compares this color to the provided one.  Returns 1 if true, else 0;

   not_equal_to
       The opposite of equal_to.
