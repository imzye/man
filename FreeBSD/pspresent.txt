NAME
       pspresent - fullscreen PostScript presentation tool

SYNOPSIS
       pspresent [options] file.ps

DESCRIPTION
       pspresent is a tool that displays PostScript slides in fullscreen, for
       giving presentations.  Navigation is simple, and the display is double-
       buffered for seamless transitions between slides.  The actual rendering
       is done in the background using Ghostscript.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -o     Do not override window manager.  pspresent will attempt to
              disable decorations and resize itself to the size of the screen,
              but will otherwise co-operate with your window manager (which
              may mean that it is not truly fullscreen).

       -s     Limit pspresent to only use the given head on a XINERAMA
              display.

       -O Portrait|Landscape|Upside-Down|Seascape
              Override orientation.

COMMANDS
       The following keys can be used from within pspresent to navigate the
       slides.  If Shift is depressed, then only the last page of each series
       of overlays is shown (an overlay set is identified as a series of pages
       with the same logical page number).

       set is identified as a series of pages with the same logical page
