GEOM-EXPORTER(8)        FreeBSD System Manager's Manual       GEOM-EXPORTER(8)

NAME
     geom-exporter – Export GEOM statistics to Prometheus

SYNOPSIS
     geom-exporter [-hP] [-b address] [-p port] [-f pattern] [-F pattern]

DESCRIPTION
     Prometheus is a monitoring system that gathers metrics from its targets
     by fetching them through HTTP GET requests.  Metrics are identified by a
     name and an optional set of labels.  Sample values are required to be
     numerical.

     The geom-exporter daemon publishes statistics from the FreeBSD GEOM
     system via an HTTP server, in the correct format to be scraped by
     Prometheus.  Its options are as follows:

     -f, --pattern pattern
             A regular expression that can be used to only show statistics for
             some devices.  Only devices with the names matching pattern will
             be published.  The format of the regular expression is described
             at https://docs.rs/regex.

     -F, --pattern pattern
             A regular expression that can be used to exclude devices.  No
             devices with names matching pattern will be published.

     -b, --address address
             Bind to this local address.  By default, geom-exporter will bind
             to the wildcard address.

     -p, --port port
             Serve metrics on this TCP port.  The default is 9248.

     -P, --physical
             Only display physical providers (those with rank of 1).
