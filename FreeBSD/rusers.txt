RUSERS(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              RUSERS(1)

NAME
     rusers – who is logged in to machines on local network

SYNOPSIS
     rusers [-al] [host ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The rusers command produces output similar to who(1), but for the list of
     hosts or all machines on the local network.  For each host responding to
     the rusers query, the hostname with the names of the users currently
     logged on is printed on each line.  The rusers command will wait for one
     minute to catch late responders.

     The following options are available:

     -a      Print all machines responding even if no one is currently logged
             in.

     -l      Print a long format listing.  This includes the user name, host
             name, tty that the user is logged in to, the date and time the
             user logged in, the amount of time since the user typed on the
             keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if
             applicable).

DIAGNOSTICS
     rusers: RPC: Program not registered  The rpc.rusersd(8) daemon has not
     been started on the remote host.

     rusers: RPC: Timed out  A communication error occurred.  Either the
     network is excessively congested, or the rpc.rusersd(8) daemon has
     terminated on the remote host.

     rusers: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Timed out  The remote host is not
     running the portmapper (see rpcbind(8)), and cannot accommodate any RPC-
     based services.  The host may be down.
