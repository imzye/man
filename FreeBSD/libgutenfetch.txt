GUTENFETCH_DUPLICATE_SERVER(3)                FreeBSD Library Functions Manual



NAME
       gutenfetch_duplicate_server -- This function creates a copy of a
       gutenfetch_server_t data structure.


SYNOPSIS
       #include <gutenfetch.h>

       gutenfetch_server_t *
       gutenfetch_new_server( gutenfetch_server_t * );


DESCRIPTION
       This function takes a valid gutenfetch_server_t data structure and
       returns a duplicate of the server.  The result must be freed when it is
       no longer needed.  If the function fails, it will return NULL instead
       of a valid pointer.
