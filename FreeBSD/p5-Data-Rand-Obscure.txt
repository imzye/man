Data::Rand::Obscure(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Data::Rand::Obscure - Generate (fairly) random strings easily.

VERSION
       Version 0.021

SYNOPSIS
           use Data::Rand::Obscure qw/create create_b64/;

           # Some random hexadecimal string value.
           $value = create;

           ...

           # Random base64 value:
           $value = create_b64;

           # Random binary value:
           $value = create_bin;

           # Random hexadecimal value:
           $value = create_hex;

           ...

           # A random value containing only hexadecimal characters and 103 characters in length:
           $value = create_hex(length => 103);

           # Object-orientated

           my $generator = Data::Rand::Obscure->new(seeder => sub { ... # My special seeding algorithm # },
               digester => sub { return $my_favorite_digester; });

           $value = $generator->create;

           $value = $generator->create_hex(length => 32);

DESCRIPTION
       Data::Rand::Obscure provides a method for generating random
       hexadecimal, binary, and base64 strings of varying length.  To do this,
       it first generates a pseudo-random "seed" and hashes it using a SHA-1,
       SHA-256, or MD5 digesting algorithm.

       Currently, the seed generator is:

           join("", <an increasing counter>, time, rand, $$, {})

       You can use the output to make obscure "one-shot" identifiers for
       cookie data, "secret" values, etc.

       Values are not GUARANTEED to be unique (see Data::UUID for that), but
       should be sufficient for most purposes.

       This package was inspired by (and contains code taken from) the
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session package by Yuval Kogman

METHODS
   Data::Rand::Obscure->new([ seeder => <seeder>, digester => <digester> ])
       Returns a Data::Rand::Obscure::Generator with the following methods:

           create
           create_hex
           create_bin
           create_b64

       You may optionally supply a seeder subroutine, which is called
       everytime a new value is to be generated.  It should return some seed
       value that will be digested.

       You may also optionally supply a digester subroutine, which is also
       called everytime a new value is to be generated.  It should return a
       Digest object of some kind (which will be used to take the digest of
       the seed value).

EXPORTS
   $value = create([ length => <length> ])
   $value = create_hex([ length => <length> ])
       Create a random hexadecimal value and return it. If <length> is
       specificied, then the string will be <length> characters long.

       If <length> is specified and not a multiple of 2, then $value will
       technically not be a valid hexadecimal value.

   $value = create_bin([ length => <length> ])
       Create a random binary value and return it. If <length> is specificied,
       then the value will be <length> bytes long.

   $value = create_b64([ length => <length> ])
       Create a random base64 value and return it. If <length> is specificied,
       then the value will be <length> bytes long.

       If <length> is specified, then $value is (technically) not guaranteed
       to be a "legal" b64 value (since padding may be off, etc).

FUNCTIONS
   singleton
       Returns the Data::Rand::Obscure::Generator used in the above exported
       functions You probably don't need to use this.
