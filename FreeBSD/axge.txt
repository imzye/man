AXGE(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                AXGE(4)

NAME
     axge – ASIX Electronics AX88178A/AX88179 USB Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device xhci
           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device axge

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_axge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The axge driver provides support for USB Gigabit Ethernet adapters based
     on the ASIX Electronics AX88179 USB 3.0 and AX88178A USB 2.0 chipsets.

     The AX88179 and AX88178A contain a 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC with a GMII
     interface for interfacing with the Gigabit Ethernet PHY.

     These devices will operate with both USB 1.x and USB 2.0 controllers, and
     the AX88179 will operate with USB 3.0 controllers.  Packets are received
     and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.

     The axge driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option
                      can also be used to select either full-duplex or
                      half-duplex modes.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The ifconfig(8)
                      mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                      full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     1000baseT        Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation (AX88178
                      only).  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can also be used
                      to select either full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     The axge driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).
