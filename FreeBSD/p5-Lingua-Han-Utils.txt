NAME
       Lingua::Han::Utils - The utility tools of Chinese character(HanZi)

SYNOPSIS
           use Lingua::Han::Utils qw/Unihan_value csplit cdecode csubstr clength/;

           # cdecode
           # the same as decode('cp936', $word) in ASCII editing mode
           #         and decode('utf8', $word) in Unicode editing mode
           my $word = cdecode($word);

           # Unihan_value
           # return the first field of Unihan.txt on unicode.org
           my $word = "我";
           my $unihan = Unihan_value($word); # return '6211'
           my $words = "爱你";
           my @unihan = Unihan_value($word); # return (7231, 4F60)
           my $unihan = Unihan_value($word); # return 72314F60

           # csplit
           # split the Chinese characters into an array
           my $words = "我爱你";
           my @words = csplit($words); # return ("我", "爱", "你")

           # csubstr
           # treat the Chinese characters as one
           # so it's the same as splice(csplit($words), $offset, $length)
           my $words = "我爱你啊";
           my @words = csubstr($words, 1, 2); # return ("爱", "你")
           my @words = csubstr($words, 1); # return ("爱", "你", "啊")
           my $words = csubstr($words, 1, 2); # 爱你

           # clength
           # treat the Chinese character as one
           my $words = "我爱你";
           print clength($words); # 3

EXPORT
       Nothing is exported by default.

EXPORT_OK
       cdecode
           use Encode::Guess to decode the character. It behavers like:
           decode('cp936', $word) under ASCII editing mode and decode('utf8',
           $word) under Unicode editing mode.

       Unihan_value
           the first field of Unihan.txt is the Unicode scalar value as
           U+[x]xxxx, we return the [x]xxxx.

       csplit
           split the Chinese characters into an array, English words can be
           mixed in.

       csubstr(WORD, OFFSET, LENGTH)
           treat the Chinese character as one word, substr it.

           (BE CAFEFUL! it's NOT lvalue, we cann't use csubstr($word, 2, 3) =
           $REPLACEMENT)

           if no LENGTH is specified, substr form OFFSET to END.

       clength
           treat the Chinese character as one word(length 1).
