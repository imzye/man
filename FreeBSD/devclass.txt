DEVCLASS(9)            FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual           DEVCLASS(9)

NAME
     devclass – object representing a class of devices

SYNOPSIS
     typedef struct devclass *devclass_t;

DESCRIPTION
     The devclass object has two main functions in the system.  The first is
     to manage the allocation of unit numbers for device instances and the
     second is to hold the list of device drivers for a particular bus type.
     Each devclass has a name and there cannot be two devclasses with the same
     name.  This ensures that unique unit numbers are allocated to device
     instances.

     Beware that this means devclass must be the same for different bus
     attachments of the same device driver.
