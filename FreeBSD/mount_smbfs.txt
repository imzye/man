NAME
     mount_smbfs – mount a shared resource from an SMB file server

SYNOPSIS
     mount_smbfs [-E cs1:cs2] [-I host] [-L locale] [-M crights:srights] [-N]
                 [-O cowner:cgroup/sowner:sgroup] [-R retrycount] [-T timeout]
                 [-U username] [-W workgroup] [-c case] [-d mode] [-f mode]
                 [-g gid] [-n opt] [-u uid]
                 //user@server[:port1[:port2]]/share node

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_smbfs command mounts a share from a remote server using
     SMB/CIFS protocol.

     The options are as follows:

     -E cs1:cs2
             Specifies local (cs1) and server's (cs2) character sets.

     -I host
             Do not use NetBIOS name resolver and connect directly to host,
             which can be either a valid DNS name or an IP address.

     -L locale
             Use locale for lower/upper case conversion routines.  Set the
             locale for case conversion.  By default, mount_smbfs tries to use
             an environment variable LC_* to determine it.

     -M crights:srights
             Assign access rights to the newly created connection.

     -N      Do not ask for a password.  At run time, mount_smbfs reads the
             ~/.nsmbrc file for additional configuration parameters and a
             password.  If no password is found, mount_smbfs prompts for it.

     -O cowner:cgroup/sowner:sgroup
             Assign owner/group attributes to the newly created connection.

     -R retrycount
             How many retries should be done before the SMB requester decides
             to drop the connection.  Default is 4.

     -T timeout
             Timeout in seconds for each request.  Default is 15.

     -U username
             Username to authenticate with.

     -W workgroup
             This option specifies the workgroup to be used in the
             authentication request.

     -c case
             Set a case option which affects name representation.  case can be
             one of the following:

             Value      Meaning

             l          All existing file names are converted to lower case.
                        Newly created file gets a lower case.

             u          All existing file names are converted to upper case.
                        Newly created file gets an upper case.

     -f mode, -d mode
             Specify permissions that should be assigned to files and
             directories.  The values must be specified as octal numbers.
             Default value for the file mode is taken from mount point,
             default value for the directory mode adds execute permission
             where the file mode gives read permission.

             Note that these permissions can differ from the rights granted by
             SMB server.

     -u uid, -g gid
             User ID and group ID assigned to files.  The default are owner
             and group IDs from the directory where the volume is mounted.

     //user@server[:port1[:port2]]/share
             The mount_smbfs command will use server as the NetBIOS name of
             remote computer, user as the remote user name and share as the
             resource name on a remote server.  Optional port1 and port2
             arguments can be used to override default values of port numbers
             used by communication protocols.  For SMB over NetBIOS default
             value for port1 are 139, and port2 are 137.

     node    Path to mount point.

FILES
     ~/.nsmbrc           Keeps user-specific static parameters for connections
                         and other information.  See
                         /usr/share/examples/smbfs/dot.nsmbrc for details.
     /etc/nsmb.conf      Keeps system-wide static parameters for connections
                         and other information.

EXAMPLES
     The following example illustrates how to connect to SMB server “SAMBA” as
     user “GUEST”, and mount shares “PUBLIC” and “TMP”:

           mount_smbfs -I samba.mydomain.com //guest@samba/public /smb/public
           mount_smbfs -I 192.168.20.3 -E koi8-r:cp866 //guest@samba/tmp /smb/tmp

     It is also possible to use fstab(5) for smbfs mounts (the example below
     does not prompt for a password):

           //guest@samba/public    /smb/public     smbfs  rw,noauto,-N 0   0

STANDARDS
     mount_smbfs offers support for SMB/CIFS/SMB1.  It does not support newer
     versions of the protocol like SMB2 and SMB3.  SMB2 and SMB3 are supported
     by software available in the ports(7) collection.

     The list of supported SMB servers includes:
     -   Samba
     -   Windows 95/98/ME/2000/NT4.0 (SPs 4, 5, 6)
     -   IBM LanManager
     -   NetApp

HISTORY
     SMB/CIFS protocol and SMB/CIFS file system implementation first appeared
     in FreeBSD 4.5.
