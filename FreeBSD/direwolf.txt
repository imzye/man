NAME
       aclients - Test program for side-by-side TNC performance comparison.



SYNOPSIS
       aclients tnc ...

              Each tnc reference is a port,  =, and a description.

DESCRIPTION
       aclients is used to compare how well different TNCs decode AS.25
       frames.  The port can be a serial port name, host_name:tcp_port,
       ip_addr:port, or simply tcp_port.




OPTIONS
       None.




EXAMPLES
       aclients /dev/ttyS0=KPC3+ /dev/ttyUSB0=D710A 8000=DireWolf
       192.168.1.64:8002=other

       Serial port /dev/ttyS0 is connected to a KPC3+ with monitor mode turned
       on.

       Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0 is connected to a TM-D710A with monitor mode
       turned on.

       The Dire Wolf software TNC is available on network port 8000.

       Some other software TNC is available on network port 8002 on host
       192.168.1.64.

       Packets from each are displayed in columns so it is easy to see how
       well each decodes the received signals.

       The "Receive Performance" section of the User Guide contains some
       complete examples of how to set up tests and the results.
