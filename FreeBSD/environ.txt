ENVIRON(7)         FreeBSD Miscellaneous Information Manual         ENVIRON(7)

NAME
     environ – user environment

SYNOPSIS
     extern char **environ;

DESCRIPTION
     An array of strings, called the environment is made available to each
     process by execve(2) when a process begins.  By convention these strings
     have the form name=value, and are referred to as “environment variables”.
     A process can query, update, and delete these strings using the
     getenv(3), setenv(3), and unsetenv(3) functions, respectively.  The
     shells also provide commands to manipulate the environment; they are
     described in the respective shell manual pages.

     What follows is a list of environment variables typically seen on a UNIX
     system.  It includes only those variables that a user can expect to see
     during their day-to-day use of the system, and is far from complete.
     Environment variables specific to a particular program or library
     function are documented in the ENVIRONMENT section of the appropriate
     manual page.

ENVIRONMENT
     BLOCKSIZE        The size of the block units used by several disk-related
                      commands, most notably df(1), du(1) and ls(1).
                      BLOCKSIZE may be specified in units of a byte by
                      specifying a number, in units of a kilobyte by
                      specifying a number followed by ‘K’ or ‘k’, in units of
                      a megabyte by specifying a number followed by ‘M’ or
                      ‘m’, and in units of a gigabyte by specifying a number
                      followed by ‘G’ or ‘g’.  Sizes less than 512 bytes or
                      greater than a gigabyte are ignored.  This variable is
                      processed by the getbsize(3) function.

     COLUMNS          The user's preferred width in column positions for the
                      terminal.  Utilities such as ls(1) and who(1) use this
                      to format output into columns.  If unset or empty,
                      utilities will use an ioctl(2) call to ask the terminal
                      driver for the width.

     EDITOR           Default editor name.

     EXINIT           A startup list of commands read by ex(1) and vi(1).

     HOME             A user's login directory, set by login(1) from the
                      password file passwd(5).

     LANG             This variable configures all programs which use
                      setlocale(3) to use the specified locale unless the LC_*
                      variables are set.

     LC_ALL           Overrides the values of LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE,
                      LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME and LANG.

     LC_COLLATE       Locale to be used for ordering of strings.

     LC_CTYPE         Locale to be used for character classification (letter,
                      space, digit, etc.) and for interpreting byte sequences
                      as multibyte characters.

     LC_MESSAGES      Locale to be used for diagnostic messages.

     LC_MONETARY      Locale to be used for interpreting monetary input and
                      formatting output.

     LC_NUMERIC       Locale to be used for interpreting numeric input and
                      formatting output.

     LC_TIME          Locale to be used for interpreting dates input and for
                      formatting output.

     MAIL             The location of the user's mailbox instead of the
                      default in /var/mail, used by mail(1), sh(1), and many
                      other mail clients.

     MANPATH          The sequence of directories, separated by colons,
                      searched by man(1) when looking for manual pages.

     NLSPATH          List of directories to be searched for the message
                      catalog referred to by LC_MESSAGES.  See catopen(3).

     PAGER            Default paginator program.  The program specified by
                      this variable is used by mail(1), man(1), ftp(1), etc,
                      to display information which is longer than the current
                      display.

     PATH             The sequence of directories, separated by colons,
                      searched by csh(1), sh(1), system(3), execvp(3), etc,
                      when looking for an executable file.  PATH is set to
                      ``/usr/bin:/bin'' initially by login(1).

     POSIXLY_CORRECT  When set to any value, this environment variable
                      modifies the behaviour of certain commands to (mostly)
                      execute in a strictly POSIX-compliant manner.

     PRINTER          The name of the default printer to be used by lpr(1),
                      lpq(1), and lprm(1).

     PWD              The current directory pathname.

     SHELL            The full pathname of the user's login shell.

     TERM             The kind of terminal for which output is to be prepared.
                      This information is used by commands, such as nroff(1)
                      or plot(1) which may exploit special terminal
                      capabilities.  See /usr/share/misc/termcap (termcap(5))
                      for a list of terminal types.

     TERMCAP          The string describing the terminal in TERM, or, if it
                      begins with a '/', the name of the termcap file.  See
                      TERMPATH below, and termcap(5).

     TERMPATH         A sequence of pathnames of termcap files, separated by
                      colons or spaces, which are searched for terminal
                      descriptions in the order listed.  Having no TERMPATH is
                      equivalent to a TERMPATH of $HOME/.termcap:/etc/termcap.
                      TERMPATH is ignored if TERMCAP contains a full pathname.

     TMPDIR           The directory in which to store temporary files.  Most
                      applications use either /tmp or /var/tmp.  Setting this
                      variable will make them use another directory.

     TZ               The timezone to use when displaying dates.  The normal
                      format is a pathname relative to /usr/share/zoneinfo.
                      For example, the command

                            env TZ=America/Los_Angeles date

                      displays the current time in California.  See tzset(3)
                      for more information.

     USER             The login name of the user.  It is recommended that
                      portable applications use LOGNAME instead.

     Further names may be placed in the environment by the export command and
     name=value arguments in sh(1), or by the setenv command if you use
     csh(1).  It is unwise to change certain sh(1) variables that are
     frequently exported by .profile files, such as MAIL, PS1, PS2, and IFS,
     unless you know what you are doing.

     The current environment variables can be printed with env(1), set(1) or
     printenv(1) in sh(1) and env(1), printenv(1) or the printenv built-in
     command in csh(1).
