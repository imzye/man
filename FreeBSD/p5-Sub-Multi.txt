Sub::Multi(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation        Sub::Multi(3)


NAME
       Sub::Multi - Data::Bind-based multi-sub dispatch

SYNOPSIS
        my $multi_sub = Sub::Multi->new($sub1, $sub2, $sub3);

       Now dispatch to the right subroutine, based on @args.

        $multi_sub->(@args);

DESCRIPTION
       Perl6 allows multiple subs and methods with the same name, differing
       only in their signature.

           multi sub bar (Dog $foo) {?}
           multi sub bar (Cat $foo) {?}

       Dispatching will happen based on the runtime signature of the
       subroutine or method call.

   new
        my $multi_sub = Sub::Multi->new($sub1, $sub2, $sub3);
        $multi_sub->(@args);

       Build and return a code reference that will dispatch based on the Perl6
       multi dispatch semantics.

       TODO: Verify this statement: Before the method is actually dispatched,
       a call to Data::Bind->sub_signature should be made to register the
       subroutine signature.

   add_multi
         my $multi_sub  =  Sub::Multi->add_multi($sub_name, \&sub );
         $multi_sub->(@args);

       Associates $sub_name with "\&sub", and returns code reference that will
       dispatch appropriately. "add_multi" can be called multiple times with
       the same $sub_name to build a multi-dispatch method.

       TODO: Verify this statement: Before the method is actually dispatched,
       a call to Data::Bind->sub_signature should be made to register the
       subroutine signature.
