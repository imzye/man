NAME
       HTML::Tidy - (X)HTML validation in a Perl object

VERSION
       Version 1.60

SYNOPSIS
           use HTML::Tidy;

           my $tidy = HTML::Tidy->new( {config_file => 'path/to/config'} );
           $tidy->ignore( type => TIDY_WARNING, type => TIDY_INFO );
           $tidy->parse( "foo.html", $contents_of_foo );

           for my $message ( $tidy->messages ) {
               print $message->as_string;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       "HTML::Tidy" is an HTML checker in a handy dandy object.  It's meant as
       a replacement for HTML::Lint.  If you're currently an HTML::Lint user
       looking to migrate, see the section "Converting from HTML::Lint".

EXPORTS
       Message types "TIDY_ERROR", "TIDY_WARNING" and "TIDY_INFO".

       Everything else is an object method.

METHODS
   new()
       Create an HTML::Tidy object.

           my $tidy = HTML::Tidy->new();

       Optionally you can give a hashref of configuration parms.

           my $tidy = HTML::Tidy->new( {config_file => 'path/to/tidy.cfg'} );

       This configuration file will be read and used when you clean or parse
       an HTML file.

       You can also pass options directly to tidyp.

           my $tidy = HTML::Tidy->new( {
                                           output_xhtml => 1,
                                           tidy_mark => 0,
                                       } );

       See "tidyp -help-config" for the list of options supported by tidyp.

       The following options are not supported by "HTML::Tidy":

       •   quiet

   messages()
       Returns the messages accumulated.

   clear_messages()
       Clears the list of messages, in case you want to print and clear, print
       and clear.  If you don't clear the messages, then each time you call
       parse() you'll be accumulating more in the list.

   ignore( parm => value [, parm => value ] )
       Specify types of messages to ignore.  Note that the ignore flags must
       be set before calling "parse()".  You can call "ignore()" as many times
       as necessary to set up all your restrictions; the options will stack
       up.

       •   type => TIDY_INFO|TIDY_WARNING|TIDY_ERROR

           Specifies the type of messages you want to ignore, either info or
           warnings or errors.  If you wanted, you could call ignore on all
           three and get no messages at all.

               $tidy->ignore( type => TIDY_WARNING );

       •   text => qr/regex/

       •   text => [ qr/regex1/, qr/regex2/, ... ]

           Checks the text of the message against the specified regex or
           regexes, and ignores the message if there's a match.  The value for
           the text parm may be either a regex, or a reference to a list of
           regexes.

               $tidy->ignore( text => qr/DOCTYPE/ );
               $tidy->ignore( text => [ qr/unsupported/, qr/proprietary/i ] );

   parse( $filename, $str [, $str...] )
       Parses a string, or list of strings, that make up a single HTML file.

       The $filename parm is only used as an identifier for your use.  The
       file is not actually read and opened.

       Returns true if all went OK, or false if there was some problem calling
       tidy, or parsing tidy's output.

   clean( $str [, $str...] )
       Cleans a string, or list of strings, that make up a single HTML file.

       Returns the cleaned string as a single string.

   tidyp_version()
   libtidyp_version()
       Returns the version of the underling tidyp library.

INSTALLING TIDYP
       "HTML::Tidy" requires that "tidyp" be installed on your system.  You
       can obtain tidyp through your distribution's package manager (make sure
       you install the development package with headers), or from the tidyp
       Git repository at <http://github.com/petdance/tidyp>.

CONVERTING FROM "HTML::Lint"
       "HTML::Tidy" is different from "HTML::Lint" in a number of crucial
       ways.

       •   It's not pure Perl

           "HTML::Tidy" is mostly a happy wrapper around tidyp.

       •   The real work is done by someone else

           Changes to tidyp may come down the pipe that I don't have control
           over.  That's the price we pay for having it do a darn good job.

       •   It's no longer bundled with its "Test::" counterpart

           HTML::Lint came bundled with "Test::HTML::Lint", but
           Test::HTML::Tidy is a separate distribution.  This saves the people
           who don't want the "Test::" framework from pulling it in, and all
           its prerequisite modules.
