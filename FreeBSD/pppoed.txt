PPPOED(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              PPPOED(8)

NAME
     pppoed – handle incoming PPP over Ethernet connections

SYNOPSIS
     pppoed [-Fd] [-P pidfile] [-a name] [-e exec | -l label] [-n ngdebug]
            [-p provider] interface

DESCRIPTION
     The pppoed utility listens to the given interface for PPP over Ethernet
     (PPPoE) service request packets, and actions them by negotiating a
     session then invoking a ppp(8) program.  The negotiation is implemented
     by the “pppoe” netgraph node.  See ng_pppoe(4) for details.

     The pppoed utility will only offer services to clients requesting
     services from the given provider, which is taken as an empty name if not
     provided.  If a provider name of “*” is given, any PPPoE requests will be
     offered service.

     The supplied name will be given as the access concentrator name when
     establishing the connection.  If no name is given, the current base
     hostname is used.

     After receiving a request (PADI) from the PPPoE netgraph node, pppoed
     fork(2)s a child process and returns to service further requests.  The
     child process offers service (using name) and waits for a SUCCESS
     indication from the PPPoE node.  On receipt of the SUCCESS indication,
     pppoed will execute

           exec /usr/sbin/ppp -direct label

     as a shell sub-process.  If label has not been specified, it defaults to
     provider.  It is possible to specify another command using the exec
     argument.  This is mandatory if provider and label are not given.  The
     child process will have standard input and standard output attached to
     the same netgraph(4) data socket (see ng_socket(4)) when started.

     The environment variables HISMACADDR and ACNAME are made available to the
     child process and are set to the MAC address of the peer and the name of
     the AC respectively.

     Upon invocation, pppoed will attach a “pppoe” netgraph node to the
     relevant “ether” node using “interface:” as the node name, and then
     connect that “pppoe” node to a local “socket” node.  If the -F option has
     not been given, pppoed will then go into the background and disassociate
     itself from the controlling terminal.  When the -F option is given,
     pppoed stays in the foreground.

     If the -d option is given, additional diagnostics are provided (see the
     DIAGNOSTICS section below).  If the -n option is given, NgSetDebug() is
     called with an argument of ngdebug.

     If pidfile is given, pppoed will write its process ID to this file on
     startup.

DIAGNOSTICS
     After creating the necessary netgraph(4) nodes as described above, pppoed
     uses syslogd(8) to report all incoming connections.  If the -d option is
     given, pppoed will report on the child processes creation of a new
     netgraph socket, its service offer and the invocation of the ppp(8)
     program.  If the -n option is given, netgraph diagnostic messages are
     also redirected to syslogd(8).

     It is sometimes useful to add the following to /etc/syslog.conf:

           !pppoed
           *.*                             /var/log/pppoed.log

     and the following to /etc/newsyslog.conf:

           /var/log/pppoed.log           640  3       100    *     Z

HISTORY
     The pppoed utility was written by Brian Somers <brian@Awfulhak.org> and
     first appeared in FreeBSD 3.4.

BUGS
     If another netgraph node is using the given interface, pppoed will fail
     to start.  This is because netgraph(4) does not currently allow node
     chaining.  This may change in the future.
