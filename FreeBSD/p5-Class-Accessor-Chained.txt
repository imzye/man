Class::Accessor::Chained(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Class::Accessor::Chained - make chained accessors

SYNOPSIS
        package Foo;
        use base qw( Class::Accessor::Chained );
        __PACKAGE__->mk_accessors(qw( foo bar baz ));

        my $foo = Foo->new->foo(1)->bar(2)->baz(4);
        print $foo->bar; # prints 2

DESCRIPTION
       A chained accessor is one that always returns the object when called
       with parameters (to set), and the value of the field when called with
       no arguments.

       This module subclasses Class::Accessor in order to provide the same
       mk_accessors interface.
