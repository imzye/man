NAME
       mfsexports.cfg - MooseFS access control for mfsmounts

DESCRIPTION
       The file mfsexports.cfg contains MooseFS access list for mfsmount
       clients.

SYNTAX
       Syntax is:

       ADDRESS DIRECTORY [OPTIONS]

       Lines starting with # character are ignored as comments.

       ADDRESS can be specified in several forms:

       *                   all addresses
       n.n.n.n             single IP address
       n.n.n.n/b           IP class specified by network address and number of significant bits
       n.n.n.n/m.m.m.m     IP class specified by network address and mask
       f.f.f.f-t.t.t.t     IP range specified by from-to addresses (inclusive)

       DIRECTORY can be / or path relative to MooseFS root; special value .
       means MFSMETA companion filesystem.

       OPTIONS list:

       ro, readonly
              export tree in read-only mode; this is default

       rw, readwrite
              export tree in read-write mode

       alldirs
              allows to mount any subdirectory of specified directory
              (similarly to NFS)

       dynamicip
              allows reconnecting of already authenticated client from any IP
              address (the default is to check IP address on reconnect)

       ignoregid
              disable testing of group access at mfsmaster level (it's still
              done at mfsmount level) - in this case "group" and "other"
              permissions are logically added; needed for supplementary groups
              to work (mfsmaster receives only user primary group information)

       admin  administrative privileges - currently: allow changing of quota
              values

       maproot=USER[:GROUP]
              maps root (uid=0) accesses to given user and group (similarly to
              maproot option in NFS mounts); USER and GROUP can be given
              either as name or number; if no group is specified, USER's
              primary group is used. Names are resolved on mfsmaster side (see
              note below).

       mapall=USER[:GROUP]
              like above but maps all non privileged users (uid!=0) accesses
              to given user and group (see notes below).

       password=PASS, md5pass=MD5
              requires password authentication in order to access specified
              resource

       minversion=VER
              rejects access from clients older than specified

       mingoal=N, maxgoal=N
              specify range in which goal can be set by users

       mintrashtime=TDUR, maxtrashtime=TDUR
              specify range in which trashtime can be set by users

       Default options are: ro, maproot=999:999, mingoal=1, maxgoal=9,
       mintrashtime=0, maxtrashtime=4294967295.

NOTES
       USER and GROUP names (if not specified by explicit uid/gid number) are
       resolved on mfsmaster host.

       TDUR can be specified as number without time unit (number of seconds)
       or combination of numbers with time units. Time units are: W,D,H,M,S.
       Order is important - less significant time units can't be defined
       before more significant time units.  Time units are case insensitive.

       Option mapall works in MooseFS in different way than in NFS, because
       MooseFS is using FUSE's "default_permissions" option. When mapall
       option is used, users see all objects with uid equal to mapped uid as
       their own and all other as root's objects. Similarly objects with gid
       equal to mapped gid are seen as objects with current user's primary
       group and all other objects as objects with group 0 (usually wheel).
       With mapall option set attribute cache in kernel is always turned off.

EXAMPLES
       *                    /       ro
       192.168.1.0/24       /       rw
       192.168.1.0/24       /       rw,alldirs,maproot=0,password=passcode
       10.0.0.0-10.0.0.5    /test   rw,maproot=nobody,password=test
       10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0 /public rw,mapall=1000:1000
       10.2.0.0/16          /       rw,alldirs,maproot=0,mintrashtime=2h30m,maxtrashtime=2w
