NAME
       Net::TiVo - Perl interface to TiVo.

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::TiVo;

           my $tivo = Net::TiVo->new(
               host => '192.168.1.25',
               mac  => 'MEDIA_ACCESS_KEY'
           );

           for ($tivo->folders()) {
               print $_->as_string(), "\n";
           }

ABSTRACT
       "Net::TiVo" provides an object-oriented interface to TiVo's REST
       interface.  This makes it possible to enumerate the folders and shows,
       and dump their meta-data.

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::TiVo" has a very simple interface, and currently only supports
       the enumeration of folder and shows using the REST interface.  The main
       purpose of this module was to provide access to the TiVo
       programmatically to automate the process of downloading shows from a
       TiVo.

       "Net::TiVo" does not provide support for downloading from TiVo.  There
       are several options available, including LWP, wget, and curl.  Note: I
       have used wget version >= 1.10 with success.  wget version 1.09
       appeared to have an issue with TiVo's cookie.

BUGS
       One user has reported 500 errors when using the library.  He was able
       to track the bug down to LWP and Net::SSLeay.  Once he switched from
       using Net::SSLeay to Crypt::SSLeay the 500 errors went away.

CACHING
       "Net::TiVo" is slow due to the amount of time it takes to fetch data
       from TiVo.  This is greatly sped up by using a cache.  "Net::TiVo"'s
       "new" method accepts a reference to a "Cache" object.  Any type of
       caching object may be supported as long as it meets the requirements
       below.  There are several cache implementations available on CPAN, such
       as "Cache::Cache".

       The following example creates a cache that lasts for 600 seconds.

           use Cache::FileCache;

           my $cache = Cache::FileCache->new(
                namespace          => 'TiVo',
                default_expires_in => 600,
           }

           my $tivo = Net::TiVo->new(
                host  => '192.168.1.25',
                mac   => 'MEDIA_ACCESS_KEY',
                cache => $cache,
           }

       "Net::TiVo" uses positive caching, errors are not stored in the cache.

       Any "Cache" class may be used as long as it supports the following
       method signatures.

           # Set a cache value
           $cache->set($key, $value);

           # Get a cache value
           $cache->get($key);

   METHODS
       folders()
           Returns an array in list context or array reference in scalar
           context containing a list of Net::TiVo::Folder objects.
