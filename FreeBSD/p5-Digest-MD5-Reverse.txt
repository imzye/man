Digest::MD5::Reverse(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Digest::MD5::Reverse - MD5 Reverse Lookup

VERSION
       Version 1.3

SYNOPSIS
           use Digest::MD5::Reverse;
           my $plaintext = reverse_md5($md5);

DESCRIPTION
       MD5 sums (see RFC 1321 - The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm) are used as
       a one-way hash of data. Due to the nature of the formula used, it is
       impossible to reverse it.

       This module provides functions to search several online MD5 hashes
       database and return the results (or return undefined if no match
       found).

       We are not breaking security. We are however making it easier to lookup
       the source of a MD5 sum.

EXAMPLES
           use Digest::MD5::Reverse;
           print "Data is ".reverse_md5("acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8")."\n";
           # Data is foo
