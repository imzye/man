NAME
       Authen::SASL::Cyrus - XS SASL Authentication

SYNOPSIS
        use Authen::SASL;

        $sasl = Authen::SASL->new(
          mechanism => 'NAME',
          callback => { NAME => VALUE, NAME => VALUE, ... },
        );


        $conn = $sasl->client_new(<service>, <server>);

DESCRIPTION
       SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
       protocols. Authen::SASL::Cyrus provides an implementation framework
       that all protocols should be able to share.

       The XS framework makes calls into the existing libsasl2.so shared
       library to perform SASL client connection functionality, including
       loading existing shared library mechanisms.

   CONSTRUCTOR
       The contructor may be called with or without arguments. Passing
       arguments is just a short cut to calling the "mechanism" and "callback"
       methods.

       client_new( SERVICE, HOST )
           Creates and returns a new connection object blessed into
           Authen::SASL::Cyrus.  It is on that returned reference that the
           following methods are available.  The SERVICE is the name of the
           service being implemented, which may be used by the underlying
           mechanism. An example service is "ldap". The HOST is the name of
           the server being contacted, which may also be used by the
           underlying mechanism.

   Authen::SASL::Cyrus METHODS
       callback ( NAME )
           Tells if the named callback has a handler installed. The list of
           implemented callbacks is "user", "auth", and "language". Others may
           be implemented in future releases.

       callback( NAME => VALUE,  NAME => VALUE, ... )
           Sets the given callback(s) to the given value(s). See the
           "Callbacks" section for a description of callback VALUEs. See above
           for a list of implemented callback NAMEs.

       client_start
           The initial step to be performed. Returns the initial value to pass
           to the server.

       client_step( CHALLENGE )
           This method is called when a response from the server requires it.
           CHALLENGE is the value from the server. Returns the next value to
           pass to the server.

       code
           Returns a 1 if an error has occurred in any step along the way. See
           the "error" method to get a better explanation of what error
           occurred.  Returns a 0 if no errors have occurred.

       error
           Returns a string with a brief description of what caused the last
           error, AND clears the error message so that subsequent calls will
           return an empty string until another error occurs.

       host
           Returns the host argument that was passed to "client_new" =item
           mechanism

           Returns the SASL mechanism currently in use. It should match one of
           the installed SASL shared library mechanisms (see your SASL
           distribution for a list of available mechanisms).

       property( NAME )
           Gets the SASL value for the named property. Currently implemented
           property names are: "user", "ssf", "maxout", "realm", "optctx",
           "iplocal" | "sockname", "ipremote" | "peername".

       property( NAME => VALUE, NAME => VALUE, ... )
           Sets the named property(ies) to the given value(s). Currently
           implemented property names are given above.

       service
           Returns the service argument that was passed to "client_new"

   Callbacks
       There are three different ways in which a callback may be passed

       CODEREF
           If the value passed is a code reference then, when needed, it will
           be called and the connection object will be passed as the first
           argument.

       ARRAYREF
           If the value passed is an array reference, the first element in the
           array must be a code reference. When the callback is called the
           code reference will be called with the connection object passed as
           the first argument and the second value from the array passed
           after. The code reference should return a scalar value which is the
           answer to the callback, e.g.  a "user" callback should return a
           single string which is the username of the client.

       SCALAR
           All other values passed will be returned directly to the SASL
           library as the answer to the callback.
