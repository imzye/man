NAME
       sharpconstruct - Interactive 3D modeling package


SYNOPSIS
       sharpconstruct [options] [file]


DESCRIPTION
       SharpConstruct is a 3D modeling program designed to paint depth on to
       polygon models in real-time. Unlike traditional modeling programs,
       SharpConstruct makes it easy to quickly model organic shapes. The model
       is manipulated much like clay -- push or pull an area, smooth it, make
       a hollow or a hill.
