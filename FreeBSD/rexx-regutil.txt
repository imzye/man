NAME
     regutil – RexxUtil library for Regina REXX interpreter

DESCRIPTION
     regutil is a collection of utility functions for use with the Regina REXX
     interpreter.  These closely mirror the functions contained in the
     RexxUtil library provided on IBM systems (e.g. OS/2).  As it stands,
     regutil will not work with another REXX interpreter.

     Details of usage are in the full manual, which is normally found at:
     /usr/local/share/doc/regutil/regutil.pdf (if installed).
