DEVICE_GET_FLAGS(9)    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual   DEVICE_GET_FLAGS(9)

NAME
     device_set_flags, device_get_flags – manipulate driver flags

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void
     device_set_flags(device_t dev, uint32_t flags);

     uint32_t
     device_get_flags(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     Each device supports a set of driver-dependent flags which are often used
     to control device behaviour.  These flags are read by calling
     device_get_flags() and written by calling device_set_flags().
