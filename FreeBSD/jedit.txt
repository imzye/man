JEDIT(1)               jEdit - Programmer's Text Editor               JEDIT(1)



NAME
       jEdit - Programmer's Text Editor written in Java


SYNOPSIS
       jedit  [ options ] [ files ]


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents jEdit's command-line parameters.
       Complete documentation can be found by invoking the Help->jEdit Help
       menu item within jEdit or by invoking jedit -usage.

       jEdit  is a cross-platform text editor written in Java. It has an
       extensive feature set that includes syntax highlighting, auto indent,
       folding, word wrap, abbreviation expansion, multiple clipboards,
       powerful search and replace and much more.

       Furthermore, jEdit is extremely customizable, and extensible, using
       either macros written in the BeanShell scripting language, or plugins
       written in Java. With plugins, you can create a very powerful
       development environment for HTML, XML, C/C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Lisp,
       Scheme, and many others.

       jEdit Requires A Java Runtime Environment Version 11 or later.

       jEdit is released under the GNU General Public License, which can be
       found in the online help.

GENERAL COMMAND LINE USAGE
       When opening files from the command line, a line number or marker to
       position the caret on can be specified like so:

       $ jedit MyApplet.java +line:10

       $ jedit thesis.tex +marker:c

       Command-line switches begin with a "-". Some take a parameter. A file
       whose name begins with "-" can be opened like so:

       $ jedit -- -myfile


MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
       -log=level
              Set the minimum log level to an integer between 1 and 9. Default
              is 7.  Has no effect when connecting to another instance via the
              edit server.

       -usage Show a brief command line usage message without starting jEdit.
              This message is also shown if an invalid switch was specified.

       -version
              Show the version number without starting jEdit.

       --     Specifies the end of command-line processing. Further parameters
              are treated as file names, even if they begin with a dash.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       -plugins
              Enable loading of plugins. This is the default. Has no effect
              when connecting to another instance via the edit server.

              these parameters on the command line.

       -settings=dir
              Store user-specific settings in the directory named "dir",
              instead of the default $HOME/.jedit. The directory will be

EDIT SERVER OPTIONS
       For information about the edit server, see the section "Starting jEdit"
       in the jEdit online help.


       -background
              Run jEdit in background mode. In background mode, the edit
              server will continue listening for client connections even after
              all views are closed. Has no effect when connecting to another
              instance via the edit server.

       -nobackground
              Disable background mode. This is the default. Has no effect when
              connecting to another instance via the edit server.

       -gui   Open an initial view. This is the default. Has no effect when
              connecting to another instance via the edit server.

       -nogui Do not open an initial view, and instead only open one when the
              first client connects. Can only be used in combination with the
              -background switch.  You can use this switch to "pre-load" jEdit
              when you log in to your computer, for example. Has no effect
              when connecting to another instance via the edit server.

       -server
              Store the server port info in the file named "server" inside the
              settings directory. This is the default.

       -server=name
              Store the server port info in the file named "name". File names
              for this parameter are relative to the settings directory.

       -noserver
              Do not attempt to connect to a running edit server, and does not
              start one either.


FILES
       ~/.jedit
              Each user who runs jEdit has a settings directory. Its content
              is documented in the "Customizing jEdit" section of the online
              help.
