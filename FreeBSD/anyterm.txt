NAME
       anytermd - A terminal-emulating HTTP daemon

SYNOPSIS
       anytermd [--command arg] [--device arg] [--port arg] [--user arg]
       [--auth arg] [--charset arg] [--foreground] [--diff] [--nodiff]
       [--max-sessions arg] [--max-http-connections arg] [--local-only]
       [--name arg]

       anytermd --help

DESCRIPTION
       Anyterm provides a terminal window on a web page, so you can run
       command-line programs on a machine even when the only access to it is
       over HTTP.

       Anyterm consists of some Javascript on a web page, an XmlHttpRequest
       channel on standard ports back to the server, an HTTP proxy such as
       Apache's mod_proxy and the Anyterm daemon. The daemon, anytermd, uses a
       pseudo-terminal to communicate with a shell or other application, and
       includes terminal emulation. Key presses are picked up by the Javscript
       which sends them to the daemon; changes to the emulated screen are sent
       from the daemon to the Javascript which updates its display.
       Performance is quite reasonable and SSL can be used to secure the
       connection.  For security reasons, it is highly recommended that
       anytermd NOT be exposed directly to the Internet!  See the section
       SECURITY below.

SECURITY
       Do not run anytermd as root.

       Anyterm's code has not been audited for security. It is almost
       certainly possible to cause it to crash by sending it invalid input,
       and experience suggests that this sort of weakness can also be
       exploited to allow arbitary code execution.

       Note that all CGI applications and similar programs are subject to this
       sort of problem, though some are better written than others. The
       Anyterm code does not need run with a higher priviledge level than any
       other web application, so weaknesses in Anyterm do not put your system
       at any higher risk than weaknesses in any other web application would.

       Avoid exposing anytermd directly to the Internet.

       anytermd should be used only as a backend service, reachable only via a
       frontend HTTPS proxy, such as Apache, that requires authentication.
       http://anyterm.org/1.1/install.html gives examples of how to set this
       up.

       A more complete and up-to-date discussion of security issues in
       anytermd can be found at http://anyterm.org/security.html.

EXAMPLES
       If you just want to test Anyterm, you can do:

       anytermd --local-only

       and then connect to http://localhost:8080 with your Javascript-enabled
       web browser.  The brower should display a terminal window containing a
       bash command prompt owned by the user who started anytermd.

       If you want to set up SSH-over-HTTP access on localhost:8022, you might
       run it as:

       anytermd --command "/usr/bin/ssh -o your-username@localhost" --port
       8022 --user nobody --charset utf-8 --local-only
