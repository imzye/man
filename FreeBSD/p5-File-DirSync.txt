NAME
       dirsync - Syncronize two directories rapidly

       $Id: dirsync,v 1.15 2007/08/04 07:33:29 rob Exp $

SYNOPSIS
         # Rebuild the source cache for rapid updating.
         dirsync  [ options ]  --rebuild  <source_dir>

         # Quickly update source to destination.
         dirsync  [ options ]  <source_dir> <dest_dir>

           -or-

         # Mirror source to destination ignoring cache.
         # (almost like: cp -a <source_dir>/. <dest_dir>/.
         #  except files may be deleted in destination
         #  to ensure exact consistency with source.)
         dirsync  [ options ]  --nocache <source_dir> <dest_dir>

DESCRIPTION
       This is just a wrapper script for easy commandline access to
       File::DirSync.  It mirrors all files and symlinks recursively from
       source_dir to dest_dir.

OPTIONS
   --help (or -h)
       Show this help screen

   --rebuild (or -r)
       Rebuilds the dirsync cache on source_dir.  Write access to source_dir
       is required to rebuild.  If dest_dir is not specified when this option
       is, then nothing is mirrored to anywhere after the cache is rebuilt.

   --local (or -l)
       Local directory only, no recursion.

   --nocache (or -n)
       When mirroring from source_dir to dest_dir, do not assume that
       --rebuild has built the dirsync cache on source_dir already.  It is
       ignored and all files are mirrored.  This option will significantly
       slow the performance of the mirroring process.

   --ignore <dir> (or -i=<dir>)
       Avoid recursing into directories named <dir> within the entire descent
       of source_dir.  This option applies to both the --rebuild option and
       the mirroring process if a second directory is supplied.  It may be
       specified multiple times to ignore several directories.

   --only <node> (or -o=<node>)
       If this option is used, this will be the only node checked for changes,
       but the cache will still be rebuilt all the way to source_dir.  This
       only node must always be a subdirectory or a file within a subdirectory
       of source_dir.  This option only applies to the --rebuild option.  It
       may be specified multiple times to rebuild several nodes.

   --skew (or -s)
       Enable clock skew protection.  If a file or directory is found within
       source_dir modified in the future, the timestamp will be reset back to
       "now" to prevent corrupting the directory cache into the future.

   --concur <lockfile> (or -c=<lockfile>)
       If this option is used, <lockfile> will be used to ensure that only one
       dirsync process is running at a time.  If another process is
       concurrently running, this process will immediately abort without doing
       anything.  If <lockfile> does not exist, it will be created.

   --gentle <percent>[:<ops>] (or -g=<percent>:<ops>)
       If this option is specified, then dirsync will spend <percent> % of the
       time sleeping instead of syncing.  If <ops> is specified, it will
       perform <ops> disk operations in between each pause cycle.  If this
       option is not specified, dirsync will burn continually until the
       process has completed.

   --proctitle (or -p)
       If this option is specified, the process name will be modified to show
       the current operation.  This can be useful for viewing or monitoring
       the progress.

   --verbose (or -v)
       Show extra details.
