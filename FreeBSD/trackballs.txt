NAME
       Trackballs - marble game similar to the classic arcade game 'Marble
       Madness'

SYNOPSIS
       trackballs [-w] [-m] [-y] [-f] [-e -l<level> -t<level>] [-r<width>]
       [-s<sensitivity>] ...


DESCRIPTION
       Trackballs is a simple game inspired by the classic Atari 1980's arcade
       game 'Marble Madness' (later released by Electronic Arts for the Amiga
       and other platforms).

       By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with sharp
       objects, pools of acid and other obstacles the player collects points.
       When the ball passes through the goal it continues to the next, more
       difficult track - unless the time runs out.

       It should be noted that this game is _not_ intended to be a replica of
       Marble Madness but rather merely inspired by it. For instance the game
       uses 3D graphics even though the original game had no real use for it.
       Also the game is fully programmable with a scripting extension (Guile),
       and includes a level editor with which to easily create new levels.
