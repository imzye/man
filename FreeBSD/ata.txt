ATA(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 ATA(4)

NAME
     ata – generic ATA/SATA controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device scbus
           device ata

     Alternatively, to load the driver as set of modules at boot time, place
     some of the following lines in loader.conf(5):

           ata_load="YES"

           ataisa_load="YES"
           atapci_load="YES"

           ataacard_load="YES"
           ataacerlabs_load="YES"
           ataamd_load="YES"
           ataati_load="YES"
           atacenatek_load="YES"
           atacypress_load="YES"
           atacyrix_load="YES"
           atahighpoint_load="YES"
           ataintel_load="YES"
           ataite_load="YES"
           atajmicron_load="YES"
           atamarvell_load="YES"
           atamicron_load="YES"
           atanational_load="YES"
           atanetcell_load="YES"
           atanvidia_load="YES"
           atapromise_load="YES"
           ataserverworks_load="YES"
           atasiliconimage_load="YES"
           atasis_load="YES"
           atavia_load="YES"

     The first line is for the common hardware independent code, and is a
     prerequisite for the other modules.  The next three lines are generic
     bus-specific drivers.  The rest are vendor-specific PCI drivers.

     The following tunables are settable from the loader(8):

     hw.ata.ata_dma_check_80pin
     set to 0 to disable the 80pin cable check (the default is 1, check the
     cable).

     hint.atapci.X.msi
     set to 1 to allow Message Signalled Interrupts (MSI) to be used by the
     specified PCI ATA controller, if supported.

     hint.ata.X.devX.mode
     limits the initial ATA mode for the specified device on the specified
     channel.

     hint.ata.X.mode
     limits the initial ATA mode for every device on the specified channel.

     hint.ata.X.pm_level
     controls SATA interface Power Management for the specified channel,
     allowing some power savings at the cost of additional command latency.
     Possible values:

           0     Interface Power Management is disabled.  This is the default
                 value.
           1     The device is allowed to initiate a PM state change; the host
                 is passive.

     hint.ata.X.devX.sata_rev
     limits the initial SATA revision (speed) for the specified device on the
     specified channel.  Values 1, 2 and 3 are respectively 1.5, 3 and 6Gbps.

     hint.ata.X.sata_rev
     Same, but for every device on the specified channel.

DESCRIPTION
     The ata driver gives the CAM(4) subsystem access to the ATA (IDE) and
     SATA ports of many generic controllers.  Depending on the controller,
     each PATA (IDE) port or each one or two SATA ports are represented to CAM
     as a separate bus with one or two targets.  Most of the bus-management
     details are handled by the ATA/SATA-specific transport of CAM.  Connected
     ATA disks are handled by the ATA protocol disk peripheral driver ada(4).
     ATAPI devices are handled by the SCSI protocol peripheral drivers cd(4),
     da(4), sa(4), etc.

     This driver supports ATA, and for the most of controllers, ATAPI devices.
     Command queuing and SATA port multipliers are not supported.  Device hot-
     plug and SATA interface power management is supported only on some
     controllers.

     The ata driver can change the transfer mode when the system is up and
     running.  See the negotiate subcommand of camcontrol(8).

     The ata driver sets the maximum transfer mode supported by the hardware
     as default.  However, the ata driver sometimes warns: “DMA limited to
     UDMA33, non-ATA66 cable or device”.  This means that the ata driver has
     detected that the required 80 conductor cable is not present or could not
     be detected properly, or that one of the devices on the channel only
     accepts up to UDMA2/ATA33.  The hw.ata.ata_dma_check_80pin tunable can be
     set to 0 to disable this check.

     Some of above chips can be configured for AHCI mode.  In such case they
     are supported by ahci(4) driver instead.

     Unknown ATA chipsets are supported in PIO modes, and if the standard
     busmaster DMA registers are present and contain valid setup, DMA is also
     enabled, although the max mode is limited to UDMA33, as it is not known
     what the chipset can do and how to program it.

NOTES
     Please remember that in order to use UDMA4/ATA66 and above modes you must
     use 80 conductor cables.  Please assure that ribbon cables are no longer
     than 45cm.  In case of rounded ATA cables, the length depends on the
     quality of the cables.  SATA cables can be up to 1m long according to the
     specification.  External SATA cables can be 2m long and more, but not all
     controllers work well on long cables, especially at high speeds.
