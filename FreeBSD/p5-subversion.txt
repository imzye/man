NAME
       SVN::Base - Base class for importing symbols for svn modules

SYNOPSIS
           # Load the svn_ra_* functions into the SVN::Ra namespace.
           package SVN::Ra;
           use SVN::Base qw(Ra svn_ra_);

           # Load svn_config_t structure accessors in the magic namcespace
           # provided by swig, so we could use it returned by other functions
           package _p_svn_config_t;
           use SVN::Base qw(Core svn_config_);

DESCRIPTION
       SVN::Base is a module importing the subversion perl bindings raw
       symbols created by swig, into proper namespace and make them easier to
       use.

       It will also find the accessors for members of a C struct, create an
       simpler accessor function like "$data->field()" and
       "$data->field($new_value)".

       Once you understand the convention of subversion functions in perl
       bindings, you could look at the subversion api and write them in perl.
       The API is available in the source header files or online at
       <https://subversion.apache.org/docs/api/latest/>.

INTERNALS
       The perl bindings of swig wraps raw functions into different perl
       modules, for example, SVN::_Core, SVN::_Repos. Upon import, SVN::Base
       bootstrap the requested module if it's not yet loaded, and iterate over
       the symbols provided in that module, it them puts the function with
       prefix trimmed in the namespace of the caller for this import.

       The 3rd through the last parameter is a list of symbol endings that you
       wish for SVN::Base not to import into your namespace.  This is useful
       for cases where you may want to import certain symbols differently than
       normally.

CAVEATS
       SVN::Base consider a function as structure member accessor if it is
       postfixed ``_get'' or ``_set''. Real functions with this postfixes will
       need extra handling.
