NAME
       Layout::Manager - 2D Layout Management

SYNOPSIS
       Layout::Manager provides a simple interface for creating layout
       managers, or classes that size and position components within a
       container.

       A few managers are provided for reference, but this module is primarily
       meant to serve as a base for outside implementations.

           use Layout::Manager;

           my $foo = Layout::Manager->new;
           $foo->do_layout($component);

USING A LAYOUT MANAGER
       Layout::Manager relies on Graphics::Primitive::Container as a source
       for it's components.

       Various implementations of Layout::Manager will require you do add
       components with slightly different second arguments, but the general
       case will be:

         $lm->add_component($comp, $constraints);

       The contents of $constraints must be discerned by reading the
       documentation for the layout manager you are using.

       The $comp argument must be a Graphics::Primitive::Component.

       Layout manager works hand-in-hand with Graphics::Primitive, so you'll
       want to check out the lifecyle documented in
       Graphics::Primitive::Component.  It will look something like this:

         $cont->add_component($foo, { some => metadata });
         $driver->prepare($cont);
         my $lm = new Layout::Manager::SomeImplementation;
         $lm->do_layout($cont);
         $driver->pack($cont);
         $driver->draw($cont);

       When you are ready to lay out your container, you'll need to call the
       do_layout method with a single argument: the component in which you are
       laying things out. When do_layout returns all of the components should
       be resized and repositioned according to the rules of the
       Layout::Manager implementation.

   PREPARATION
       Subsequent calls to do_layout will be ignored if the Container is
       prepared.  The Container's "prepared" flag and the flags of all it's
       children are checked, so any modifications to any child component will
       cause the entire container (and any container children) to be laid out
       again.

WRITING A LAYOUT MANAGER
       Layout::Manager provides all the methods necessary for your
       implementation, save the do_layout method.  This method will be called
       when it is time to layout the components.

       The add_component method takes two arguments: the component and a
       second, abritrary piece of data.  If your layout manager is simple,
       like Compass, you may only require a simple variable like "NORTH".  If
       you create something more complex the second argument may be a hashref
       or an object.

       The value of the components method is an arrayref of hashrefs.  The
       hashrefs have two keys:

       component
           The component to be laid out.

       args
           The argument provided to add_component.

TIPS
       Layout manager implementations should honor the visible attribute of a
       component, as those components need to be ignored.

METHODS
   do_layout
       Lays out this manager's components in the specified container.
