NAME
       Text::Diff::Parser - Parse patch files containing unified and standard
       diffs

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Diff::Parser;

           # create the object
           my $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new();

           # With options
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( Simplify=>1, # simplify the diff
                                              Strip=>2 );  # strip 2 directories

           # Create object.  Parse $file
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( $file );
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( File=>$file );

           # Create object.  Parse text
           my $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( $text );
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( Diff=>$text );

           # parse a file
           $parser->parse_file( $filename );

           # parse a string
           $parser->parse( $text );

           # Remove no-change lines.  Combine line substitutions
           $parser->simplify;

           # Find results
           foreach my $change ( $parser->changes ) {
               print "File1: ", $change->filename1;
               print "Line1: ", $change->line1;
               print "File2: ", $change->filename2;
               print "Line2: ", $change->line2;
               print "Type: ", $change->type;
               my $size = $change->size;
               foreach my $line ( 0..($size-1) ) {
                   print "Line: ", $change->text( $line );
               }
           }

           # In scalar context, returns the number of changes
           my $n = $parser->changes;
           print "There are $n changes",

           # Get the changes to a given file
           my @changes = $parser->changes( 'Makefile.PL' );

           # Get list of files changed by the diff
           my @files = $parser->files;

DESCRIPTION
       "Text::Diff::Parser" parses diff files and patches.  It allows you to
       access the changes to a file in a standardized way, even if multiple
       patch formats are used.

       A diff may be viewed a series of operations on a file, either adding,
       removing or modifying lines of one file (the "from-file") to produce
       another file (the "to-file").  Diffs are generaly produced either by
       hand with diff, or by your version control system ("cvs diff", "svn
       diff", ...).  Some diff formats, notably unified diffs, also contain
       null operations, that is lines that

       "Text::Diff::Parser" currently parses unified diff format and standard
       diff format.

       Unified diffs look like the following.

           --- Filename1 2006-04-12 18:47:22.000000000 -0400
           +++ Filename2 2006-04-12 19:21:16.000000000 -0400
           @@ -1,4 +1,6 @@
            ONE
            TWO
           -THREE
           +honk
            FOUR
           +honk
           +honk

       Standard diffs look like the following.

           diff something something.4
           3c3
           < THREE
           ---
           > honk
           4a5,6
           > honk
           > honk

       The diff line isn't in fact part of the format but is necessary to find
       which files the chunks deal with.  It is output by "cvs diff" and "svn
       diff" so that isn't a problem.

METHODS
   new
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new;
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( $file );
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( $handle );
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( %params );
           $parser = Text::Diff::Parser->new( \%params );

       Object constructor.

       Diff
           String that contains a diff.  This diff will be parse before "new"
           returns.

       File
           File name or file handle that is parsed before "new" returns.

       Simplify
           Simplifying a patch involves dropping all null-operations and
           converting and remove operation followed by an add operation (or an
           add followed by a remove) of the same size on the same lines into a
           modify operation.

       Strip
           Strip N leading directories from all filenames.  Less then useful
           for standard diffs produced by "cvs diff", because they don't
           contain directory information.

       TrustAtAt
           In a unified diff, various chunks are introduced with @@.  By
           default, we trust these to reference the right line count.  If you
           set this to 0, the lines will not be trust and a chunk must end
           with another @@ line or --- (which introduces a new file).  Note
           that not trusting @@ means you can not parse a diff that removes a
           line that begins with --, because that also start with '---'.

       Verbose
           If true, print copious details of what is going on.

   parse_file
           $parser->parse_file( $file );
           $parser->parse_file( $handle );

       Read and parse the file or file handle specified.  Will "die" if it
       fails, returns true on sucess.  Contents of the file may then be
       accessed with "changes" and "files".

   parse
           $parser->parse( $string );

       Parses the diff present in $string.  Will "die" if it fails, returns
       true on sucess.  Contents of the file may then be accessed with
       "changes" and "files".

   files
           %files = $parser->files;

       Fetch a list of all the files that were referenced in the patch.  The
       keys are original files ("from-file") and the values are the modified
       files ("to-file").

   changes
           @changes = $parser->changes;
           $n = $parser->changes;
           @changes = $parser->changes( $file );
           $n = $parser->changes( $file );

       Return all the operations (array context) or the number of operations
       in the patch file.  If $file is specified, only returns changes to that
       file ("from-file" or "to-file").

       Elements of the returned array are change objects, as described in
       "CHANGE METHODS" below.

   simplify
           $parser->simplify;

       Simplifies the diff.  Removes no-change lines.  Combine line
       substitutions.  Automatically called if you supply Simplify to ->new().

   source
           my $file = $parser->source

       Returns the filename of the last file that was parsed.  Returns "user
       filehandle" if you supplied a file handle.

CHANGE METHODS
       The "changes" method returns an array of objects that describe each
       operation.  You may use the following methods to find out details of
       the operation.

   type
       Returns the type of operation, either 'ADD', 'REMOVE', 'MODIFY' or ''
       (null operation).

   filename1
       Filename of the "from-file".

   filename2
       Filename of the "to-file".

   line1
       Line in the "from-file" the operation starts at.

   line2
       Line in the "to-file" the operation starts at.

   size
       Number of lines affected by this operation.

   text
           $line  = $ch->text( $N );
           @lines = $ch->text;

       Fetch the text of the line $N if present or all lines affected by this
       operation.  For '' (null) and 'REMOVE' operations, these are the lines
       present before the operation was done ('from-file'.  For 'ADD' and
       'MODIFY' operations, these are the lines present after the operation
       was done ('to-file'.

BUGS
       I'm not 100% sure of standard diff handling.

       Missing support for context diffs.
