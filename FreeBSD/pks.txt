NAME
       pksd.conf - Public Key Server Daemon configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The pksd.conf file contains all the configuration information for the
       programs which comprise the public key server system (pks-intro(8)).
       It contains a list of configuration variables of the form

              word value

       If the first character of a line is #, the line is a comment, and
       ignored.  The variables are as follows:

       pks_bin_dir
              This defines the location of the executables which form the
              public key server system.  In particular, pksdctl(8) must be in
              this directory.

       chroot_dir
              This is the directory where pksd should chroot to. If pksd
              chroots somewhere then all paths are then relative to the
              chroot_dir. Example: pks is installed into /home/pksd. The full
              path to the databases may be /home/pksd/var/db, but if
              chroot_dir is set to /home/pksd, the value for db_dir should be
              /var/db.

       pid_dir
              This is the directory where pksd should to write a pid file.

       pksd_uid
              This is userid pksd will run as. Typically root will start pksd
              (at boot, for example), but nothing that pksd does needs to be
              done as root. It is suggested that you create a special user for
              pksd.

       pksd_gid
              This is group id pksd will run as. Typically root will start
              pksd (at boot, for example), but nothing that pksd does needs to
              be done as root. It is suggested that you create a special group
              for pksd.

       db_dir This is the directory where the database files keydbXXX, worddb,
              and timedb , and the key database file counter num_keydb are
              stored.

       www_port
              This is the port number on which pksd(8) accepts HTTP
              connections.  If it is 0, then HTTP connections are not accepted
              on any port.

       www_readonly
              This controls key updates/submissions via HTTP.  If it is 0,
              then keys may be submitted via HTTP.  The DEFAULT is 1, which
              DOES NOT allow key updates/submissions via HTTP.

       max_reply_keys
              This controls how many keys are returned at the most for
              keyserver queries. You'll want to set this. The default is 0, so
              the keyserver will not return any keys.

       socket_name
              This is the name of the unix domain socket on which pksd(8) will
              listen for control messages from pksdctl(8), including
              notification of new mail messages.

       mail_delivery_client
              This is a command which will be executed whenever mail needs to
              be delivered.  This value is used as the command argument to the
              shell (/bin/sh -c value), so appropriate care should be taken to
              avoid security problems.  The mail message to be delivered is
              passed to the standard input of this command, so options to the
              program should be used to parse the input for delivery
              addresses.

       maintainer_email
              This address is used as the From: address for all mail sent out.

       mail_intro_file
              This is the filename of a file which, if present, is inserted at
              the head of each mail message sent out by pksd(8).  This file is
              used as a part of a MIME message.  If MIME headers, such as
              content-type:, are required, they precede the body, separated by
              a blank line.  If no headers are required, then the first line
              of the file must be blank.

       help_dir
              This is the name of a directory in which the key server help
              files should be found.  The files in this directory should be
              named pks_help.LANG, where LANG is the language of the help
              file, in lower-case.  These files are also used as MIME parts,
              so they are subject to the same formatting requirements as the
              mail_intro_file .

       default_language
              This is a string containing the default language for help
              responses from the server.  The help file for this language, as
              described above, should exist.

       this_site
              This is the email address for this public key server.  See the
              description of incremental messages in pksd(8) for more details.

       syncsite
              This command gives the email address of a peer public key server
              to this one.  This is the only command which can be specified
              more than once.  It should be specified once for each peer
              server.
