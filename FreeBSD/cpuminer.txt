NAME
       minerd - CPU miner for Bitcoin and Litecoin

SYNOPSIS
       minerd [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       minerd is a multi-threaded CPU miner for Bitcoin, Litecoin and other
       cryptocurrencies.  It supports the getwork and getblocktemplate (BIP
       22) methods, as well as the Stratum mining protocol.

       In its normal mode of operation, minerd connects to a mining server
       (specified with the -o option), receives work from it and starts
       hashing.  As soon as a solution is found, it is submitted to the same
       mining server, which can accept or reject it.  When using getwork or
       getblocktemplate, minerd can take advantage of long polling, if the
       server supports it; in any case, fresh work is fetched as needed.  When
       using the Stratum protocol this is not possible, and the server is
       responsible for sending fresh work at least every minute; if it fails
       to do so, minerd may drop the connection and try reconnecting again.

       By default, minerd writes all its messages to standard error.  On
       systems that have a syslog, the --syslog option can be used to write to
       it instead.

       On start, the nice value of all miner threads is set to 19.  On Linux,
       the scheduling policy is also changed to SCHED_IDLE, or to SCHED_BATCH
       if that fails.  On multiprocessor systems, minerd automatically sets
       the CPU affinity of miner threads if the number of threads is a
       multiple of the number of processors.

EXAMPLES
       To connect to a Litecoin mining pool that provides a Stratum server at
       example.com on port 3333, authenticating as worker "foo" with password
       "bar":

              minerd -o stratum+tcp://example.com:3333 -O foo:bar

       To mine to a local Bitcoin testnet instance running on port 18332,
       authenticating with username "rpcuser" and password "rpcpass":

              minerd -a sha256d -o http://localhost:18332 -O rpcuser:rpcpass \
                   --coinbase-addr=mpXwg4jMtRhuSpVq4xS3HFHmCmWp9NyGKt

       To connect to a Litecoin P2Pool node running on my.server on port 9327,
       mining in the background and having output sent to the syslog facility,
       omitting the per-thread hashmeter output:

              minerd -BSq -o http://my.server:9327

OPTIONS
       -a, --algo=ALGORITHM
              Set the hashing algorithm to use.  Default is scrypt.  Possible
              values are:

                  scrypt    scrypt(1024, 1, 1) (used by Litecoin)

                  scrypt:N  scrypt(N, 1, 1) (N must be a power of 2 greater
                            than 1)

                  sha256d   SHA-256d (used by Bitcoin)

       --benchmark
              Run in offline benchmark mode.

       -B, --background
              Run in the background as a daemon.

       --cert=FILE
              Set an SSL certificate to use with the mining server.  Only
              supported when using the HTTPS protocol.

       --coinbase-addr=ADDRESS
              Set a payout address for solo mining.  This is only used in
              getblocktemplate mode, and only if the server does not provide a
              coinbase transaction.  It can be either a base-58 address, or a
              bech32 address (BIP 173).

       --coinbase-sig=TEXT
              Set a string to be included in the coinbase (if allowed by the
              server).  This is only used in getblocktemplate mode.

       -c, --config=FILE
              Load options from a configuration file.  FILE must contain a
              JSON object mapping long options to their arguments (as
              strings), or to true if no argument is required.  Sample
              configuration file:

                   {
                        "url": "stratum+tcp://example.com:3333",
                        "userpass": "foo:bar",
                        "retry-pause": "10",
                        "quiet": true
                   }

       -D, --debug
              Enable debug output.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --no-gbt
              Do not use the getblocktemplate RPC method.

       --no-getwork
              Do not use the getwork RPC method.

       --no-longpoll
              Do not use long polling.

       --no-redirect
              Ignore requests from the server to switch to a different URL.

       --no-stratum
              Do not switch to Stratum, even if the server advertises support
              for it.

       -o, --url=[SCHEME://][USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOST:PORT[/PATH]
              Set the URL of the mining server to connect to.  Supported
              schemes are http, https, stratum+tcp and stratum+tcps.  If no
              scheme is specified, http is assumed.  Specifying a PATH is only
              supported for HTTP and HTTPS.  Specifying credentials has the
              same effect as using the -O option.

              By default, on HTTP and HTTPS, the miner tries to use the
              getblocktemplate RPC method, and falls back to using getwork if
              getblocktemplate is unavailable.  This behavior can be modified
              by using the --no-gbt and --no-getwork options.

       -O, --userpass=USERNAME:PASSWORD
              Set the credentials to use for connecting to the mining server.
              Any value previously set with -u or -p is discarded.

       -p, --pass=PASSWORD
              Set the password to use for connecting to the mining server.
              Any password previously set with -O is discarded.

       -P, --protocol-dump
              Enable output of all protocol-level activities.

       -q, --quiet
              Disable per-thread hashmeter output.

       -r, --retries=N
              Set the maximum number of times to retry if a network call
              fails.  If not specified, the miner will retry indefinitely.

       -R, --retry-pause=SECONDS
              Set how long to wait between retries. Default is 30 seconds.

       -s, --scantime=SECONDS
              Set an upper bound on the time the miner can go without fetching
              fresh work.  This setting has no effect in Stratum mode or when
              long polling is activated.  Default is 5 seconds.

       -S, --syslog
              Log to the syslog facility instead of standard error.

       -t, --threads=N
              Set the number of miner threads.  If not specified, the miner
              will try to detect the number of available processors and use
              that.

       -T, --timeout=SECONDS
              Set a timeout for long polling.

       -u, --user=USERNAME
              Set the username to use for connecting to the mining server.
              Any username previously set with -O is discarded.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and quit.

       -x, --proxy=[SCHEME://][USERNAME:PASSWORD@]HOST:PORT
              Connect to the mining server through a proxy.  Supported schemes
              are: http, socks4, socks5.  Since libcurl 7.18.0, the following
              are also supported: socks4a, socks5h (SOCKS5 with remote name
              resolving).  If no scheme is specified, the proxy is treated as
              an HTTP proxy.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables can be specified in lower case or
       upper case; the lower-case version has precedence. http_proxy is an
       exception as it is only available in lower case.


              http_proxy [SCHEME://]HOST:PORT
                     Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.

              HTTPS_PROXY [SCHEME://]HOST:PORT
                     Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

              ALL_PROXY [SCHEME://]HOST:PORT
                     Sets the proxy server to use if no protocol-specific
                     proxy is set.

       Using an environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect as
       using the -x option.
