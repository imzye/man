NAME
     nfy – a minimal and daemonless notification program for X

SYNOPSIS
     nfy [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     nfy reads input from stdin (only), creates a temporary popup window and
     displays it. Configuration is done by editing the 'config.h' file in the
     source code.

     nfy has non-blocking behaviour, meaning that commands coming after it can
     execute normally without them having to wait for nfy to finish first.
     This is especially useful inside scripts.

     nfy handles multiple notifications by queuing them using a lock file.

OPTIONS
     -v      prints version to stdout and exits.

SIGNALS
     nfy handles only SIGALRM, SIGTERM and SIGINT.  It receives a SIGALRM
     signal by default after the specified duration of the notification.

SEE ALSO
     fcntl(2), alarm(3), signal(3), Xft(3), Xrandr(3)
