Module::Starter::Plugin::TT2(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Module::Starter::Plugin::TT2 - TT2 templates for
       Module::Starter::Template

VERSION
       version 0.125

SYNOPSIS
        use Module::Starter qw(
          Module::Starter::Simple
          Module::Starter::Plugin::Template
          Module::Starter::Plugin::TT2
            ...
        );

        Module::Starter->create_distro( ... );

DESCRIPTION
       This Module::Starter plugin is intended to be loaded after
       Module::Starter::Plugin::Template.  It implements the "renderer" and
       "render" methods, required by the Template plugin.  The methods are
       implemented with Template Toolkit.

       This module's distribution includes a directory, "templates/dir", and a
       file "templates/inline" that contain stock templates for use with the
       InlineStore and DirStore plugins.  The module itself contains default
       templates in its data section.

USAGE
       This module is meant to be used with the template stores in the
       SimpleStore distribution (although you could certainly write your own
       template store).  If you only want to use the built-in templates, you
       could have lines like this in your config file
       ("~/.module-starter/config"):

        author: Lord Poncemby
        email: ponce@peerage.eng
        plugins: Module::Starter::Simple Module::Starter::Plugin::Template
         Module::Starter::Plugin::ModuleStore Module::Starter::Plugin::TT2
        template_module: Module::Starter::Plugin::TT2

       (Where the plugins line is one line.)  This tells Module::Starter to
       look for the templates in the data section of
       Module::Starter::Plugin::TT2, which isn't very interesting, since
       you'll end up getting the same effect as if you'd just used
       Module::Starter without plugins.

       To override this behavior, you'd instruct Module::Starter to look
       somewhere else, either by changing the "template_module" setting,
       changing the MODULE_TEMPLATE_MODULE environment variable, or using a
       different template store altogether (q.v., SimpleStore or other
       plugins).

METHODS
   "renderer"
       As implemented, this method just creates a new Template Toolkit engine
       and stores it in the Module::Starter object.

   "render( $template, \%options )"
       This method passes the given template contents and options to the TT2
       renderer and returns the resulting document.
