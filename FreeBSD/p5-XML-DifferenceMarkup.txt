NAME
       XML::DifferenceMarkup - XML diff and merge

SYNOPSIS
        use XML::DifferenceMarkup qw(make_diff);
        use XML::LibXML;

        $parser = XML::LibXML->new(keep_blanks => 0, load_ext_dtd => 0);
        $d1 = $parser->parse_file($fname1);
        $d2 = $parser->parse_file($fname2);

        $dom = make_diff($d1, $d2);
        print $dom->toString(1);

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements an XML diff producing XML output. Both input and
       output are DOM documents, as implemented by XML::LibXML.

       The diff format used by XML::DifferenceMarkup is meant to be human-
       readable (i.e. simple, as opposed to short) - basically the diff is a
       subset of the input trees, annotated with instruction element nodes
       specifying how to convert the source tree to the target by inserting
       and deleting nodes. To prevent name colisions with input trees, all
       added elements are in a namespace "http://www.locus.cz/diffmark" (the
       diff will fail on input trees which already use that namespace).

       The top-level node of the diff is always <diff/> (or rather <dm:diff
       xmlns:dm="http://www.locus.cz/diffmark"> ... </dm:diff> - this
       description omits the namespace specification from now on); under it
       are fragments of the input trees and instruction nodes: <insert/>,
       <delete/> and <copy/>. <copy/> is used in places where the input
       subtrees are the same - in the limit, the diff of 2 identical documents
       is

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <dm:diff xmlns:dm="http://www.locus.cz/diffmark">
          <dm:copy count="1"/>
        </dm:diff>

       (copy always has the count attribute and no other content). <insert/>
       and <delete/> have the obvious meaning - in the limit a diff of 2
       documents which have nothing in common is something like

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <dm:diff xmlns:dm="http://www.locus.cz/diffmark">
          <dm:delete>
            <old/>
          </dm:delete>
          <dm:insert>
            <new>
              <tree>with the whole subtree, of course</tree>
            </new>
          </dm:insert>
        </dm:diff>

       A combination of <insert/>, <delete/> and <copy/> can capture any
       difference, but it's sub-optimal for the case where (for example) the
       top-level elements in the two input documents differ while their
       subtrees are exactly the same. This case is handled by putting the
       element from the second document into the diff, adding to it a special
       attribute dm:update (whose value is the element name from the first
       document) marking the element change:

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <dm:diff xmlns:dm="http://www.locus.cz/XML/diffmark">
          <top-of-second dm:update="top-of-first">
            <dm:copy count="42"/>
          </top-of-second>
        </dm:diff>

       <delete/> contains just one level of nested nodes - their subtrees are
       not included in the diff (but the element nodes which are included
       always come with all their attributes). <insert/> and <delete/> don't
       have any attributes and always contain some subtree.

       Instruction nodes are never nested; all nodes above an instruction node
       (except the top-level <diff/>) come from the input trees. A node from
       the second input tree might be included in the output diff to provide
       context for instruction nodes when it's an element node whose subtree
       is not the same in the two input documents. When such an element has
       the same name, attributes (names and values) and namespace declarations
       in both input documents, it's always included in the diff (its
       different output trees guarantee that it will have some chindren
       there). If the corresponding elements are different, the one from the
       second document might still be included, with an added dm:update
       attribute, provided that both corresponding elements have non-empty
       subtrees, and these subtrees are so similar that deleting the first
       corresponding element and inserting the second would lead to a larger
       diff. And if this paragraph seems too complicated, don't despair - just
       ignore it and look at some examples.

FUNCTIONS
       Note that XML::DifferenceMarkup functions must be explicitly imported
       (i.e. with "use XML::DifferenceMarkup qw(make_diff merge_diff);")
       before they can be called.

   make_diff
       "make_diff" takes 2 parameters (the input documents) and produces their
       diff. Note that the diff is asymmetric - "make_diff($a, $b)" is
       different from "make_diff($b, $a)".

   merge_diff
       "merge_diff" takes the first document passed to "make_diff" and its
       return value and produces the second document. (More-or-less - the
       document isn't canonicalized, so opinions on its "equality" may
       differ.)

   Error Handling
       Both "make_diff" and "merge_diff" throw exceptions on invalid input -
       their own exceptions as well as exceptions thrown by XML::LibXML. These
       exceptions can usually (probably not always, though - it used to be
       possible to construct an input which would crash the calling process)
       be catched by calling the functions from an eval block.

BUGS
       •   information outside the document element is not processed
