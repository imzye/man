NAME
       Sub::Installer - A cleaner way to install (or reinstall) package
       subroutines

VERSION
       This document describes Sub::Installer version 0.0.3

SYNOPSIS
           use Sub::Installer;

           $installed_ref = PackageName->install_sub({ subname => $sub_ref });

           $installed_ref = PackageName->install_sub({ subname => $sub_code_str });

           $installed_ref = PackageName->reinstall_sub({subname => $other_sub_ref });

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides two universal methods that any package/class can
       use to install subroutines in its own namespace.

INTERFACE
       "PackageName->install_sub(\%sub_specs)"
           This method installs one or more subroutines in the package on
           which it's invoked. Each subroutine is specified as an entry in the
           hash whose reference is passed to the method. The key of each entry
           is the name of the subroutine, and the corresponding value is
           either a subroutine reference, or a character string containing the
           source code of the body of the subroutine.

           For example:

               use Sub::Installer;

               MyClass->install_sub({ new => sub { bless { @[1..$#_] }, $_[0] } });

               # or, equivalently...

               MyClass->install_sub({ new => q{ bless { @[1..$#_] }, $_[0] } });

           In either case, the method call returns a reference to the last
           subroutine that was installed (though this is generally only useful
           if you're installing a single subroutine).

           In other words, calling:

               $ref = $PackageName->install_sub({ $sub_name => $sub_ref });

           is just a cleaner and more maintainable way of writing:

               $ref = do {
                   no strict 'refs';
                   *{$PackageName.'::'.$subname} = $sub_ref;
               }

       "PackageName->reinstall_sub(\%sub_specs)"
           This method acts exactly like install_sub() except that it
           suppresses any "Subroutine subname redefined" warnings.

           That is, calling:

               $PackageName->reinstall_sub({ $sub_name => $sub_ref });

           is just a cleaner and more maintainable way of writing:

               do {
                   no warnings 'redefine';
                   no strict 'refs';
                   *{$PackageName.'::'.$subname} = $sub_ref;
               }

DIAGNOSTICS
       Usage: PackageName->install_sub( \%sub_def )"
       Usage: PackageName->reinstall_sub( \%sub_def )
           You tried to call install_sub() or reinstall_sub() with the wrong
           number of arguments, or without passing it a hash reference
           specifying the subroutines to be installed. A common mistake is to
           pass raw key/value pairs, without putting them in a hash first.

       Can't install invalid code: %s
           You passed a string instead of a subroutine reference, but that
           string wasn't a valid subroutine body. The compiler's actual
           problem with the code appears after the colon.
