NAME
       fpp - the Fortran language preprocessor for FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90.

SYNOPSIS
       fpp [ options ] [ input-file [ output-file ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       fpp is the  preprocessor  for FORTRAN 77 and Fortran  90.  fpp
       optionally  accepts  two  filenames  as   arguments.  input-file and
       output-file  are, respectively, the  input file read and the output
       file written by the preprocessor.  By default standard input and output
       are used.  fpp should be used instead of the cpp preprocessor with the
       Sun FORTRAN 77 compiler.

OPTIONS
       -c_com={yes|no}
              By default, C style comments are recognized. Turn this off by
              specifying -c_com=no

       -Dname Define the preprocessor variable name as 1 (one). This is the
              same as if a -Dname=1 option appeared on the fpp command line,
              or as if a

                     #define name 1

              line appeared in the source file, which is processed by fpp.


       -Dname=def
              Define name as if by a #define directive.  This is the same as
              if a

                     #define name def

              line appeared in the source file that fpp is processing.  The -D
              option has lower precedence than the -U option.  That is, if the
              same name is used in both a -U option and a -D option, the name
              will be undefined regardless of the order of the options.

       -fixed Assumes fixed format input source.

       -free  Assumes free format input source.

       -Idirectory
              Insert directory into the search path for #include files with
              names not beginning with `/'.  directory is inserted ahead of
              the standard list of ``include'' directories.  Thus, #include
              files with names enclosed in double-quotes (") are searched for
              first in the directory of the file with the #include line, then
              in directories named with -I options, and lastly, in directories
              from the standard list.  For #include files with names enclosed
              in angle-brackets (<>), the directory of the file with the
              #include line is not searched.

       -M     Generate a list of makefile dependencies and write them to the
              standard output. This list indicates that the object file which
              would be generated  from the input file depends on the input
              file  as  well  as  the  include  files referenced.

       -macro={yes|no_com|no}
              By default, macros are expanded everywhere.  Turn off macro
              expansion in comments by specifying -macro=no_com and turn off
              macro expansion all together by specifying -macro=no

       -P     Do not put line numbering directives to the output file. This
              directive appears as
              #line-number file-name

       -Uname Remove any initial definition of name, where name is a fpp
              variable that is predefined by a particular preprocessor.  Here
              is a partial list of symbols that may be predefined, depending
              upon the architecture of the system:

                     Operating System:   unix, __unix, and__SVR4
                     Hardware:           sun, __sun, sparc, and__sparc

       -undef Remove initial definitions for all predefined symbols.

       -w0    Don't output warnings from fpp to stderr.

       -Xu    Convert upper-case letters to lower-case, except within
              character-string constants. The default is to not convert upper-
              case letters  to  lower-case.

       -Xw    For fixed form source files (See below) fpp assumes that the
              symbol ' ' (space) is insignificant.  By default for this form
              the 'space' symbol is the delimiter of tokens.

       -Ydirectory
              Use the specified  directory  in place of the standard list of
              directories when searching for files.

       fpp    also understands some FORTRAN 77 compiler options (See f77(1)):

       -e     Accept extended source lines, up to 132 characters long.

       -w     Do not output warnings to stderr.

USAGE
   Source files
       fpp operates on both fixed and free form source files. Files with '.F'
       extension are assumed to be in fixed form, and files with '.F90'
       extensions (and all others) are assumed to be in free form by default.
       There is the '-fixed' option for using fixed form in Fortran 90.  fpp
       recognizes the tab format of a source line when in fixed mode.

       A source file may contain fpp tokens.  fpp tokens are close to those of
       Fortran. They are:

              -      fpp directive names.

              -      symbolic names including Fortran keywords. fpp permits
                     all symbols in names that Fortran does.

              -      constants. Integer, real, double and quadruple precision,
                     binary, octal, hexadecimal including alternate notation,
                     character and hollerith.

              -      comments. There are Fortran comments and fpp comments.

              -      others. Special characters, space, tab, newline, etc.

   Output
       Output consists of a modified copy of the input, plus lines of the
       form:

            #line_number  file_name

       inserted to indicate the original source line number and filename of
       the output line that follows.  There is the '-P' option (See above)
       which disables the generation of these lines.

   Directives
       Syntax and semantics of fpp directives are the same as cpp directives
       (See cpp(1)).

       All fpp directives  start with the hash symbol (#)  as the first
       character on a line. White space (SPACE or TAB characters) can  appear
       after the initial '#' for proper indentation.  The  directives can be
       divided  into the following groups:

       - macro definitions;

       - conditional source code selection;

       - inclusion of external files;

       - line control.

   Macro definition.
       The #define directive is used to define both simple string variables
       and more complicated macros:

       #define name  token-string

       This is the definition of a fpp variable. Wherever 'name' appears in
       the source lines following the definition, 'token-string' will be
       substituted for 'name'.

       #define name(argument [, argument] ...  )  token-string

       This is the definition of a function-like macro.  Occurrences of the
       macro 'name' followed by the comma-separated list of arguments within
       parentheses are substituted by the token string produced from the macro
       definition. Every occurrence of an argument identifier from the macro
       definition's arguments list is substituted by the token sequence
       representing the corresponding macro actual argument.

       In these definitions, spaces between the macro name and the '(' symbol
       are prohibited to prevent the directive being interpreted as a fpp
       variable definition with the rest of the line beginning with the '('
       symbol being interpreted as a token-string.

       #undef name

       Remove any definition for 'name' (produced by 'D' options, #define
       directives or by default). No additional tokens are permitted on the
       directive line after the name.

   Including External Files.
       There are two forms of file inclusion:

       #include "filename"

       #include <filename>

       Read in the contents of filename at this location.  The lines read in
       from the file are processed by fpp as  if it were a part of the current
       file.

       When the  <filename> notation is  used, filename is only searched for
       in the standard ``include'' directories.  See the 'I' and 'Y' options
       above for more detail.  No additional tokens are permitted in the
       directive line after the final  `"'  or `>'.

   Line control.
       #line-number "filename"

       Generate line control information for the next  pass of the compiler.
       The integer-constant is  interpreted as the line number of  the next
       line and the filename is  interpreted  as the name of the file from
       where it comes.  If "filename" is not given, the current filename is
       unchanged.

   Conditional selection of source text.
       There are two forms of conditional selection of source text

       1)
                    #if condition_1
                         block_1
                    #elif condition_2
                         block_2
                    #else
                         block_n
                    #endif

       2)
                    #ifdef name
                         block_1
                    #elif condition
                         block_2
                    #else
                         block_n
                    #endif

       or
                    #ifndef name
                         block_1
                    #elif condition
                         block_2
                    #else
                        block_n
                    #endif

       else- and elif-part are optional.  There may be more than one elif-
       part. Condition is an expression involving fpp constants, macros  and
       intrinsic  functions.  Condition expressions are similar to  cpp
       expressions, and may contain any cpp operations and operands with the
       exception of c long, octal and hexadecimal constants. Additionally, fpp
       will accept and evaluate Fortran logical operations .NOT. .AND.  .OR.
       .EQV. .NEQV. .GT. .LT. .LE. .GE. etc. and logical constants .TRUE.
       .FALSE.

Details
   Scope of macro or variable definitions.
       The scope of a definition begins from the place of its definition and
       encloses all the source lines (and source lines from included files)
       from that definition line to the end of the current file.

       There are the following exceptions to the scope effected by an fpp
       definition:

       - files included by Fortran INCLUDE statements;

       - fpp and Fortran comments;

       - IMPLICIT single letter specifications;

       - FORMAT specifications;

       - numeric, typeless and character constants.

       The scope of the macro effect can be limited by means of the #undef
       directive.

   End of macro definition
       Macro definition can be of any length and is limited only by the
       'newline' symbol. A Macro can be defined in multiple lines. A Macro can
       be continued to the next line with the insertion of '\'. So, the
       occurrence of a 'newline' without a macro-continuation signifies the
       end of the macro definition.

       For example:
       #define long_macro_name(x,\
       y) x*y

   Function-like macro definition
       The number of macro call arguments should be the same as the number of
       arguments in the corresponding macro definition. An error is flagged if
       they don't.

   Cancelling macro definitions of both kinds
       #undef name

       After this directive,  'name' would not interpreted by fpp as a macro
       or variable name. If this name has not been defined earlier as a macro
       name, then the given directive has no effect

   Conditional source code selection
       - Constant-expression

       Subsequent lines up to the matching #else, #elif, or #endif directive,
       appear in the output only if their constant-expression yields a true
       value.

       The lines following the #elif directive appear in the output only if
       all of the following conditions hold:

              -      The constant-expression  in the   preceding #if directive
                     evaluated to .FALSE.  or the name in the preceding #ifdef
                     directive is not defined or the name in the preceding
                     #ifndef directive is defined.

              -      The constant-expression in all intervening #elif
                     directives  evaluated to .FALSE.

              -      The  current constant-expression   evaluates to .TRUE.

       If  the  constant-expression  evaluates to .TRUE., subsequent #elif
       and  #else directives are ignored up to the matching #endif.  Any
       constant-expression allowed in an #if  directive is allowed in  an
       #elif directive.

       The intrinsic function `defined' can be used in a constant-expression
       also.

       The following items are permitted:

              -      C language operations: <, >, ==, !=, >=, <=, +, -, /, *,
                     %, <<, >>, &,  ~, |, &&, || They are interpreted by fpp
                     in accordance to the C language semantics (this facility
                     is provided for compatibility with "old" Fortran programs
                     using cpp)

              -      Fortran language operations: .AND., .OR., .NEQV., .XOR.,
                     .EQV., .NOT.  , .GT., .LT., .LE., .GE., .NE., .EQ., **
                     (power).

              -      Fortran logical constants: .TRUE. , .FALSE.

              Only these items, integer constants, and names can be used
              within a constant-expression. Names which have not been defined
              with the help of the 'D' option, a #define directive or by
              default, get 0 as the value.  The C operation '!=' (not equal)
              can be used in #if or #elif directive, but NOT in #define
              directive, where the symbol '!' is considered as the Fortran
              comment symbol.

       #ifdef name
              Subsequent lines up to the matching  #else, #elif, or #endif
              appear in the output only if the name has been defined, either
              by a #define directive or by the 'D' option, and in the absence
              of an intervening #undef directive. No additional tokens are
              permitted on the directive line after name.

       #ifndef name
              Subsequent lines up to the matching  #else,   #elif, or #endif
              appear in the output only  if name has not been defined, or if
              its definition has been removed with an #undef directive. No
              additional tokens  are permitted on the directive line after
              name.

       #elif constant-expression .
              Any number of #elif directives may  appear   between an #if,
              #ifdef, or #ifndef directive and a matching #else or #endif
              directive.

       #else  This inverts the sense of the conditional directive otherwise in
              effect. If the preceding conditional would indicate that lines
              are to be included, then lines between the #else and the
              matching #endif are ignored.  If the preceding conditional
              indicates that lines would be ignored, subsequent lines are
              included in the output.  Conditional directives and
              corresponding #else directives can be nested.

       #endif End a section of lines begun by one of the conditional
              directives  #if, #ifdef, or #ifndef.  Each such directive must
              have a matching #endif.

   Including External Files
       Is the same as it is for cpp.  Files are searched as follows:

       for  #include "file_name":

              -      in the directory, in which the processed file has been
                     found;

              -      in the directories specified by the -I option;

              -      in the default directory.

       for #include <file_name>:

              -      in the directories specified by the -I option;

              -      in the default directory.

       fpp directives (beginning with the # symbol in the first position of
       lines) can be placed anywhere in a source code, in particular before a
       Fortran continuation line.  The only exception is the prohibition of
       fpp directives within a macro call divided on several lines by means of
       continuation symbols.

   Comments
       fpp permits comments of two kinds:

       1) Fortran language comments.  A source line containing one of the
       symbols 'C', 'c', '*', 'd' or 'D' in the first position, is considered
       as a comment line. Within such lines macro expansions are not
       performed.  The '!' symbol is interpreted as the beginning of a comment
       extending to the end of the line. The only exception is the case when
       this symbol occurs within a constant-expression in #if and #elif
       directives (See above).

       2) fpp comments enclosed in the '/*' and '*/' parasymbols.  They are
       excluded from the output and macro expansions are not performed within
       these symbols.  fpp comments can be nested and for each parasymbol '/*'
       there must be a corresponding parasymbol '*/'.  fpp comments are
       suitable for excluding the compilation of large portions of source
       instead of commenting every line with Fortran comment symbols.

   Intrinsic functions
       The intrinsic function

       defined(name)   or defined name

       Returns:

         .TRUE. - if name is defined as a macro.

         .FALSE.- if the name is not defined.

   Macro expansion
       If, during expansion of a macro, the column width of a line exceeds
       column 72 (for the fixed format) or column 132 (for the free format),
       fpp inserts appropriate continuation lines.

       In the fixed form there is limitation on macro expansions in label
       fields (positions 1-5):

              -      a macro call (together with possible arguments) should
                     not extend more than the column 5 position;

              -      a macro call whose name begins with one of the Fortran
                     comment symbols is considered as a part of a comment;

              -      a macro expansion may produce a text extending beyond the
                     column 5 position. In such a case a warning will be
                     issued.

       In the fixed form when the '-Xw' option has been specified an ambiguity
       may appear if a macro call occurs in a statement position and a macro
       name begins or coincides with a Fortran keyword. For example, in the
       following text:

         #define callp(x)   call f(x)
                 call p(0)

       fpp can not determine with certainty how to interpret the 'call p'
       token sequence. It could be considered as a macro name.  The current
       implementation does the following:

              -      the longer identifier is chosen (callp in this case);

              -      from this identifier the longest macro name or keyword is
                     extracted;

              -      if a macro name has been extracted a macro expansion is
                     performed. If the name begins with some keyword fpp
                     outputs an appropriate warning;

              -      the rest of the identifier is considered as a whole
                     identifier.

       In the above example the macro expansion would be performed and the
       following warning would be output:

       warning: possibly incorrect substitution of macro callp

       It should be noted that this situation appears only when preprocessing
       a fixed format source code and when the space symbol is not interpreted
       as a token delimiter.  It should be said also that if a macro name
       coincides with a keyword beginning part, as in the following case:

            #define INT    INTEGER*8
                    INTEGER k

       then in accordance with the described algorithm, the INTEGER keyword
       will be found earlier than the INT macro name. Thus, there will be no
       warning when preprocessing such a macro definition.

DIAGNOSTICS
       There are three kinds of diagnostic messages:

              -      warnings.  preprocessing of source code is continued and
                     the return value remains to be 0.

              -      errors.  fpp continues preprocessing but sets the return
                     code to a nonzero value, namely number of errors.

              -      fatal error.  fpp cancels preprocessing and returns a
                     nonzero return value.

       The messages produced by fpp are intended to be self-explanatory.  The
       line number and filename where the error occurred are printed along
       with the diagnostic.
