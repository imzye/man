CSQRT(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual               CSQRT(3)

NAME
     csqrt, csqrtf, csqrtl – complex square root functions

LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <complex.h>

     double complex
     csqrt(double complex z);

     float complex
     csqrtf(float complex z);

     long double complex
     csqrtl(long double complex z);

DESCRIPTION
     The csqrt(), csqrtf(), and csqrtl() functions compute the square root of
     z in the complex plane, with a branch cut along the negative real axis.
     In other words, csqrt(), csqrtf(), and csqrtl() always return the square
     root whose real part is non-negative.

RETURN VALUES
     These functions return the requested square root.  The square root of 0
     is +0 ± 0, where the imaginary parts of the input and respective result
     have the same sign.  For infinities and NaNs, the following rules apply,
     with the earlier rules having precedence:

           Input                Result
           k + infinity*I       infinity + infinity*I      (for all k)
           -infinity + NaN*I    NaN ± infinity*I
           infinity + NaN*I     infinity + NaN*I
           k + NaN*I            NaN + NaN*I
           NaN + k*I            NaN + NaN*I
           -infinity + k*I      +0 + infinity*I
           infinity + k*I       infinity + 0*I

     For numbers with negative imaginary parts, the above special cases apply
     given the identity:
           csqrt(conj(z)) = conj(csqrt(z))
     Note that the sign of NaN is indeterminate.  Also, if the real or
     imaginary part of the input is finite and an NaN is generated, an invalid
     exception will be thrown.

STANDARDS
     The csqrt(), csqrtf(), and csqrtl() functions conform to ISO/IEC
     9899:1999 (“ISO C99”).

BUGS
     For csqrt() and csqrtl(), inexact results are not always correctly
     rounded.
