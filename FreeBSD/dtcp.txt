DTCPAUTH(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            DTCPAUTH(8)

NAME
     dtcpauth – Manipulate POP Authorization DB

SYNOPSIS
     dtcpauth [-i] [--init]
     dtcpauth [-d] [--delete] user
     dtcpauth [-l] [--list] user | ALL
     dtcpauth [-u] [--user] user [password]

DESCRIPTION
     The dtcpauth allows the super-user or master POP user to add, delete, or
     reset credential data for a user, or list which records exist.  Only the
     super-user may initialize the database.

     Under normal usage, dtcpauth prompts for a new secret, just like the
     passwd program.  It then updates the authorization DB.

     With the --user or -u switch, the super-user or master POP user can
     create or reset credential data for the specified user.  This switch
     allows the password to be specified on the command line, which avoids the
     usual prompts and checks.  This is mostly useful in a batch environment,
     such as in a script.

     With the --init or -i switch, the super-user can create a new (or zero
     the existing) authorization DB.

     With the --list or -l switch, the super-user or master POP user can
     verify the presence of a record for the indicated user, or list users who
     have records.  Users can verify the presence of their own records with
     this switch.

     With the --delete or -d switch, the super-user or master POP user can
     remove a user entry from the authorization DB.

RETURN VALUES
     dtcpauth will exit with positive value on errors.

FILES
     /usr/local/etc/qpopper/pop.auth
               The APOP authorization database.
