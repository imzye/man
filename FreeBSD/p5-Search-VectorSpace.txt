TITLE
       Search::VectorSpace - a very basic vector-space search engine

SYNOPSIS
               use Search::VectorSpace;

               my @docs = ...;
               my $engine = Search::VectorSpace->new( docs => \@docs, threshold => .04);
               $engine->build_index();

               while ( my $query = <> ) {
                       my %results = $engine->search( $query );
                       print join "\n", keys %results;
               }

DESCRIPTION
       This module takes a list of documents (in English) and builds a simple
       in-memory search engine using a vector space model.  Documents are
       stored as PDL objects, and after the initial indexing phase, the search
       should be very fast.   This implementation applies a rudimentary stop
       list to filter out very common words, and uses a cosine measure to
       calculate document similarity.   All documents above a user-
       configurable similarity threshold are returned.

METHODS
       new docs => ARRAYREF [, threshold => VALUE ]
           Object constructor.  Argument hash must contain a key 'docs' whose
           value is a reference to an array of documents.   The hash can also
           contain an optional threshold setting, between zero and one, to
           serve as a relevance cutoff for search results.

       build_index
           Creates the document vectors and stores them in memory, along with
           a master word list for the document collection.

       search QUERY
           Returns all documents matching the QUERY string above the set
           relevance threshold.  Unlike regular search engines, the query can
           be arbitrarily long, and contain pretty much anything.  It gets
           mapped into a query vector just like the documents in the
           collection were.  Returns a hash in the form RESULT => RELEVANCE,
           where the relevance value is between zero and one.

       get_words STRING
           Rudimentary parser, splits string on whitespace and removes
           punctuation.  Returns a hash in the form WORD => NUMBER, where
           NUMBER is how many times the word was found.

       stem WORD
           Convenience wrapper for Lingua::Stem::stem()
