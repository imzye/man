SYNOPSIS
       mmc [<command> [<args>]] [--help]

       mmc [<command>] --help

DESCRIPTION
       mmc-utils is a tool for configuring MMC storage devices from userspace.

COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
       help | --help | -h | (no arguments)
              Shows the abbreviated help menu in the terminal.

       extcsd read <device>
              Print extcsd data from <device>.

       writeprotect get <device>
              Determine the eMMC writeprotect status of <device>.

       writeprotect set <device>
              Set the eMMC writeprotect status of <device>.  This sets the
              eMMC to be write-protected until next boot.

       disable 512B emulation <device>
              Set the eMMC data sector size to 4KB by disabling emulation on
              <device>.

       gp create <-y|-n|-c> <length KiB> <partition> <enh_attr> <ext_attr>
       <device>
              create general purpose partition for the <device>.  Dry-run only
              unless -y or -c is passed.  Use -c if more partitioning settings
              are still to come.  To set enhanced attribute to general
              partition being created set <enh_attr> to 1 else set it to 0.
              To set extended attribute to general partition set <ext_attr> to
              1,2 else set it to 0.  NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable
              (unreversible) change.

       enh_area set <-y|-n|-c> <start KiB> <length KiB> <device>
              Enable the enhanced user area for the <device>.  Dry-run only
              unless -y or -c is passed.  Use -c if more partitioning settings
              are still to come.  NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable
              (unreversible) change.

       write_reliability set <-y|-n|-c> <partition> <device>
              Enable write reliability per partition for the <device>.  Dry-
              run only unless -y or -c is passed.  Use -c if more partitioning
              settings are still to come.  NOTE!  This is a one-time
              programmable (unreversible) change.

       status get <device>
              Print the response to STATUS_SEND (CMD13).

       bootpart enable <boot_partition> <send_ack> <device>
              Enable the boot partition for the <device>.  Disable the boot
              partition for the <device> with <boot_partition> set to 0.  To
              receive acknowledgment of boot from the card set <send_ack> to
              1, else set it to 0.

       bootbus set <boot_mode> <reset_boot_bus_conditions> <boot_bus_width>
       <device>
              Set Boot Bus Conditions.  <boot_mode> must be
              "single_backward|single_hs|dual" <reset_boot_bus_conditions>
              must be "x1|retain" <boot_bus_width> must be "x1|x4|x8"

       bkops enable <device>
              Enable the eMMC BKOPS feature on <device>.  NOTE!  This is a
              one-time programmable (unreversible) change.

       hwreset enable <device>
              Permanently enable the eMMC H/W Reset feature on <device>.
              NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable (unreversible) change.

       hwreset disable <device>
              Permanently disable the eMMC H/W Reset feature on <device>.
              NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable (unreversible) change.

       sanitize <device>
              Send Sanitize command to the <device>.  This will delete the
              unmapped memory region of the device.

       rpmb write-key <rpmb device> <key file>
              Program authentication key which is 32 bytes length and stored
              in the specified file. Also you can specify '-' instead of key
              file path to read the key from stdin.  NOTE!  This is a one-time
              programmable (unreversible) change.

       rpmb read-counter <rpmb device>
              Counter value for the <rpmb device> will be read to stdout.

       rpmb read-block <rpmb device> <address> <blocks count> <output file>
       [key file]
              Blocks of 256 bytes will be read from <rpmb device> to output
              file or stdout if '-' is specified. If key is specified - read
              data will be verified. Instead of regular path you can specify

       rpmb write-block <rpmb device> <address> <256 byte data file> <key
       file>  Block of 256 bytes will be written from data file to <rpmb
              device>. Also you can specify '-' instead of key file path or
              data file to read the data from stdin.

       cache enable <device>
              Enable the eMMC cache feature on <device>.  NOTE! The cache is
              an optional feature on devices >= eMMC4.5.

       cache disable <device>
              Disable the eMMC cache feature on <device>.  NOTE! The cache is
              an optional feature on devices >= eMMC4.5.

       <cmd> --help
              Show detailed help for a command or subset of commands.


EXAMPLES
       Program authentication key from stdin:
              echo -n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH | mmc rpmb write-key
              /dev/mmcsd0rpmb -

       Write a block of 256 bytes of data to an rpmb device:
              $ (awk 'BEGIN {while (c++<256) printf "a"}' | echo -n
              AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH) | mmc rpmb write-block
              /dev/mmcsd0rpmb 0x02 - -

       Read a block of 256 bytes of data from an rpmb device to stdout:
                $ echo -n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH | mmc rpmb read-
              block /dev/mmcsd0rpmb 0x02 2 /tmp/block -

       Read 2 blocks of 256 bytes from rpmb device to /tmp/block without
       verification:
              $ mmc rpmb read-block /dev/mmcsd0rpmb 0x02 2 /tmp/block
