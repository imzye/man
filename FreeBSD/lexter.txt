NAME
       lexter - a curses falling letters puzzle game

SYNOPSIS
       lexter [ -v | -h | -s | -d dictionary ]

DESCRIPTION
       Lexter is a real-time word puzzle. Arrange the falling letters into
       words to score points. Words can be formed in any direction except
       diagonal.  Palindromes are counted twice (forwards and backwards).
       Lexter supports multiple dictionaries. Letter scores and frequencies
       will vary with each dictionary. In addition to the characters found in
       the dictionary there is a "blank" character. Anytime before the
       character has landed you can press a key to assign it a valid letter.
