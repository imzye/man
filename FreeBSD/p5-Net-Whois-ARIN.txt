NAME
       Net::Whois::ARIN - ARIN whois client

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::Whois::ARIN;

         my $w = Net::Whois::ARIN->new(
                     host    => 'whois.arin.net',
                     port    => 43,
                     timeout => 30,
                 );

         #  fetch raw whois output as a scalar
         my $result = $w->query( '207.173.0.0' );

         #  fetch raw whois output as a list
         my @results = $w->query( 'NET-207-173-0-0-1' );

         #  search for a network record
         my @output = $w->network( '207.173.0.0' );
         foreach my $net (@output) {

                 "%s\t(%s)\t%s\n",
                 $net->OrgName,
                 $net->NetHandle,
                 $net->NetRange,
             );

             # display the network's contact information

         # lookup an autonomous system number
         my($asn) = $w->asn( 5650 );
         printf "AS5650 was assigned to %s\n", $asn->OrgName;

         # search for a point-of-contact by handle
         my @contact = $w->contact('DM2339-ARIN');

         my @contact_records = $w->domain('eli.net');

         # search for an organization record by the OrgId
         my @org = $w->organization('FRTR');

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a Perl interface to the ARIN Whois server.  The
       module takes care of connecting to an ARIN whois server, sending your
       whois requests, and parsing the whois output.  The whois records are
       returned as lists of Net::Whois::ARIN::* instances.

METHODS
       In the calling conventions below "[]"'s represent optional parameters.

       new - create a Net::Whois::ARIN object
             my $o = Net::Whois::ARIN->new(
               [-hostname=> 'whois.arin.net',]
               [-port    => 43,]
               [-timeout => 45,]
               [-retries => 3,]
             );

           This is the constuctor for Net::Whois::ARIN.  The object returned
           can be used to query the whois database.

       query - make a raw query to the whois server
             my @output = $o->query('207.173.112.0');

       network - request a network record
             my @records = $o->network('207.173.112.0');

           This method requires a single argument.  The argument indicates the
           network to use in the whois lookup.  The method returns a list of
           Net::Whois::ARIN::Network records that matched your search
           criteria.

       asn - request an ASN record
             my @record = $o->asn(5650);

           This method requires a single argument.  The argument indicates the
           autonomous system number to use in the whois lookup.  The method
           returns a list of Net::Whois::ARIN::AS objects.

       organization - request an organization record
             my @record = $w->org('ELIX');

       customer - request a customer record
             my @records = $w->customer('ELIX');

       contact - request a point-of-contact record
             my @record = $w->contact('DM2339-ARIN');

       domain - request all records from a given domain
             @output = $w->domain('eli.net');
