NAME
     gitup – A minimalist, dependency-free program to clone/pull Git
     repositories.

SYNOPSIS
     gitup section [-cklrSV] [-C configuration file] [-d display depth]
           [-h commit checksum] [-I ignore paths that contain this string]
           [-p target path] [-t tag] [-u pack file] [-v verbosity]
           [-w commit checksum]

DESCRIPTION
     gitup is a minimalist, dependency-free program used to clone or
     synchronize a local copy of a Git repository.  It is not intended to be a
     full-featured replacement for the devel/git port, but rather, is intended
     to provide a convenient way for users to update FreeBSD source files
     without having to install devel/git (and all of its related dependencies)
     and without the substantial disk overhead that normally accompany local
     Git repositories.

     gitup currently only supports anonymous, encrypted transfers via the
     "Smart HTTP" protocol over HTTPS.

OPTIONS
     Configuration options are stored in /usr/local/etc/gitup.conf and are
     grouped into commonly used sections (additional custom sections can be
     added to this file).  The following command line options can be used to
     override the default and/or section values:

     -C          The location of the configuration file to use.

     -c          Force gitup to clone the repository.

     -d          Limit the display of updated files to the specified number of
                 directories deep.  (0 = display the full path of each file).

     -h          The "have" commit checksum of the repository to use.  Only
                 needed when importing a pack file generated by the official
                 Git client.

     -I          Ignore paths that contain this string.  Regular expressions
                 are supported.

     -k          Save a copy of the pack data.

     -l          Low memory mode -- temporarily stores uncompressed object
                 data to disk instead of memory.

     -p          Path to an alternative local repository (override the
                 `target_directory` that is specified in gitup.conf(5)).  The
                 SHA1 checksum of the new absolute target path is appended to
                 the known paths filename in /var/db/gitup allowing multiple
                 independent copies of the repository to exist.

     -r          Repair the local repository, replacing any files that are
                 missing or have been modified.

     -S          Specify the source IP address on the local machine to use.

     -t          Fetch the commit referenced by the specified tag.

     -u          Skip the download of the pack data and use the specified file
                 instead.

     -v          How verbose the output should be (0 = no output, 1 = show
                 only names of the updated files, 2 = also show all files that
                 are being ignored, 3 = also show commands sent to the server
                 and additional debugging information).

     -V          Display the version number and exit.

     -w          The "want" commit checksum of the repository to retrieve.

FILES
     /usr/local/etc/gitup.conf  Default location of the gitup configuration
                                file.

     /var/db/gitup              Default location where gitup stores its lists
                                of known files.  The files stored here are
                                used during subsequent runs to reconstruct the
                                local repository state and confirm that the
                                local tree is intact.

ENVIRONMENT
     Proxy server host, port, username and password values can be entered in
     "/usr/local/etc/gitup.conf" or can be specified in the https_proxy
     environment variable:

           https://server:port/
           https://username:password@server:port/

CAVEATS
     Because gitup neither uses nor updates the .git directory, it is not a
     drop-in replacement for the official Git client.  gitup should only be
     used on repositories originally cloned with the official Git client if
     there is no intention to ever use the official Git client on that local
     repository again.

     To keep its footprint as small as possible, gitup does not retain pack
     files downloaded from the repository (unless explicitly instructed to do
     so) and does not use a saved pack file (unless explicitly instructed to
     do so).  gitup relies on the known remote files lists stored in
     /var/db/gitup and the current state of the local repository to
     reconstruct data that would normally be stored in the pack file.
     Discrepancies in the local repository will be flagged as errors and gitup
     will attempt to any restore any missing or modified files from the
     server, returning the local repository to a clean state.

     Extra care should be given when specifying a commit to pull as gitup only
     performs shallow clones and does not have access to a repository's full
     commit history.  If a commit is passed in via the -w command line
     argument and that commit exists on a different branch, the Git server
     will neither object nor inform gitup of the branch change and will send a
     pack file that will convert the local repository.  If the change of
     branches is intentional, the relevant section in
     /usr/local/etc/gitup.conf will need to be manually updated.

EXAMPLES
     Using the configuration options for commonly used repositories/branches
     stored in /usr/local/etc/gitup.conf, to clone/pull a copy of the most
     recent revision of stable/12:

           gitup stable

     To retrieve a copy of freebsd-ports at commit
     0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567:

           gitup ports -w 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567

EXIT STATUS
     gitup returns EXIT_SUCCESS upon successful operation, returns 2 if a
     repair has occurred and returns EXIT_FAILURE upon any unsuccessful
     operation.
