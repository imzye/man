FXP(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 FXP(4)

NAME
     fxp – Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device fxp

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_fxp_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The fxp driver provides support for Ethernet adapters based on the Intel
     i82557, i82558, i82559, i82550, and i82562 chips.  The driver supports
     TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload for both transmit and receive on i82550 and
     i82551.  On i82559 only TCP/UDP checksum offload for receive is
     supported.  TCP segmentation offload (TSO) for IPv4 as well as VLAN
     hardware tag insertion/stripping is supported on i82550 and i82551.  Wake
     On Lan (WOL) support is provided on all controllers except i82557,
     i82259ER and early i82558 revisions.

     The fxp driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect   Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                  autoselected mode can be overridden by adding the media
                  options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP  Set 10Mbps operation.

     100baseTX    Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.

     The fxp driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex  Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex  Force half duplex operation.

     Note that 100baseTX media type is not available on the Pro/10.  For
     further information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

     The fxp driver supports reception and transmission of extended frames for
     vlan(4).  This capability of fxp can be controlled by means of the
     vlanmtu parameter to ifconfig(8).

     The fxp driver also supports a special link option:

     link0  Some chip revisions have loadable microcode which can be used to
            reduce the interrupt load on the host cpu.  Not all boards have
            microcode support.  Setting the link0 flag with ifconfig(8) will
            download the microcode to the chip if it is available.

HARDWARE
     Adapters supported by the fxp driver include:

     •   Intel EtherExpress PRO/10
     •   Intel InBusiness 10/100
     •   Intel PRO/100B / EtherExpressPRO/100 B PCI Adapter
     •   Intel PRO/100+ Management Adapter
     •   Intel PRO/100 VE Desktop Adapter
     •   Intel PRO/100 VM Network Connection
     •   Intel PRO/100 M Desktop Adapter
     •   Intel PRO/100 S Desktop, Server and Dual-Port Server Adapters
     •   Many on-board network interfaces on Intel motherboards

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).  The following variables are available as both
     loader(8) tunables and sysctl(8) variables:

     dev.fxp.%d.int_delay
             Maximum amount of time, in microseconds, that an interrupt may be
             delayed in an attempt to coalesce interrupts.  This is only
             effective if the Intel microcode is loaded.  The accepted range
             is 300 to 3000, the default is 1000.

     dev.fxp.%d.bundle_max
             Number of packets that will be bundled, before an interrupt is
             generated.  This is only effective if the Intel microcode is
             loaded.  The accepted range is 1 to 65535, the default is 6.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as sysctl(8) variables.

     dev.fxp.%d.rnr
             This is a read-only variable and shows the number of events of
             RNR (resource not ready).

     dev.fxp.%d.stats
             This is a read-only variable and displays useful MAC counters
             maintained in the driver.

DIAGNOSTICS
     fxp%d: couldn't map memory  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     fxp%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     fxp%d: Failed to malloc memory  There are not enough mbuf's available for
     allocation.

     fxp%d: device timeout  The device has stopped responding to the network,
     or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).

     fxp%d: Microcode loaded, int_delay: %d usec  bundle_max: %d  The chip has
     successfully downloaded the microcode, and changed the parameterized
     values to the given settings.

HISTORY
     The fxp device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 2.1.

AUTHORS
     The fxp device driver was written by David Greenman.  It has then been
     updated to use the busdma API and made endian-clean by Maxime Henrion.
     This manual page was written by David E. O'Brien.
