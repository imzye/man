NAME
       sdcv - console version of StarDict program

SYNOPSIS
       sdcv [ options ] [list of words]

DESCRIPTION
       sdcv is a simple, cross-platform text-based utility for working with
       dictionaries in StarDict format.  Each word from "list of words" may be
       a string with a leading '/' for using a Fuzzy search algorithm, with a
       leading '|' for using full-text search, and the string may contain '?'
       and '*' for regexp search.  It works in interactive and non-interactive
       mode.  To exit from interactive mode press Ctrl+D.  In interactive
       mode, if sdcv was compiled with readline library support, you can use
       the UP and DOWN keys to cycle through history.

OPTIONS
       -h  --help
               Display help message and exit

       -v --version
               Display version and exit

       -l --list-dicts
               Display list of available dictionaries and exit

       -u --use-dict filename
               For search use only dictionary with this bookname

       -n --non-interactive
               For use in scripts

       -x --only-data-dir
               For use in scripts: only use the dictionaries in data-dir, do
               not search in user and system directories

       -e --exact-search
               Do not fuzzy-search for similar words, only return exact
               matches

       -j --json
               Print the results of list-dicts and searches as json, not as
               plain text.  For use in automatically processing the results of
               a dictionary lookup.

       --utf8-output
               Force sdcv to not convert to locale charset, output in utf8

       --utf8-input
               Force sdcv to not convert from locale charset, assume that
               input is in utf8

       --data-dir path/to/directory
               Use this directory as the path to the stardict data directory.
               This means that sdcv searches for dictionaries in data-dir/dic
               directory.

       --color Use ANSI escape codes for colorizing sdcv output (does not work
               with json output).

FILES
       /usr/local/share/stardict/dic

       $(XDG_DATA_HOME)/stardict/dic

              Place where sdcv expects to find dictionaries.  Instead of
              /usr/local/share/stardict/dic you can use any directory you
              want, just set the STARDICT_DATA_DIR environment variable.  For
              example, if you have dictionaries in /mnt/data/stardict-
              dicts/dic, set STARDICT_DATA_DIR to /mnt/data/stardict-dicts.

       $(XDG_DATA_HOME)/sdcv_history

              This file includes the last $(SDCV_HISTSIZE) words, which you
              sought with sdcv.  SDCV uses this file only if it was compiled
              with readline library support.

       $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/sdcv_ordering

              This is a text file containing one dictionary bookname per line.
              It specifies in which order the results of a search should be
              shown.

ENVIRONMENT
       Environment Variables Used By sdcv:

       STARDICT_DATA_DIR   If set, sdcv uses this variable as the data
                           directory, this means that sdcv searches
                           dictionaries in $STARDICT_DATA_DIR/dic

       SDCV_HISTSIZE       If set, sdcv writes in
                           $(XDG_DATA_HOME)/sdcv_history (or $(SDCV_HISTFILE))
                           the last $(SDCV_HISTSIZE) words, which you look up
                           using sdcv. If it is not set, then the last 2000
                           words are saved in $(XDG_DATA_HOME)/sdcv_history.

       SDCV_HISTFILE       If set, sdcv writes it's history to
                           $(SDCV_HISTFILE). If it is not set, then the
                           default $(XDG_DATA_HOME)/sdcv_history path will be
                           used.

       SDCV_PAGER          If SDCV_PAGER is set, its value is used as the name
                           of the program to use to display the dictionary
                           article.
