SYNOPSIS
           use Net::LDAP::AutoDNs;

           my $obj = Net::LDAP::AutoDNs->new();

           print $obj->{users}."\n";
           print $obj->{usersScope}."\n";
           print $obj->{dns}."\n";
           print $obj->{groups}."\n";
           print $obj->{groupsScope}."\n";

METHODS
   new
       Creates a new Net::LDAP::AutoDNs object.

       hash args

       methods

       This is a comma seperated list of methods to use.

       The currently supported ones are listed below and checked in the listed
       order.

           hostname
           env
           devldap
           EESDPenv

       The naming of those wraps around to the similarly named methodes.

           #Only the hostname methode will be tried.
           my $obj=Net::LDAP::AutoDNs->({methodes=>"hostname"});

           #First the env methdoe will be tried and then the hostname methode.
           my $obj=Net::LDAP::AutoDNs->({methodes=>"env,hostname"})

   newEESDP
       Creates a new Net::LDAP::AutoDNs object in a EESDP LDAP Standard
       method.

   byDevLDAP
       This sets it up using the information found under '/dev/ldap/'.

       More information on this can be found at
       http://eesdp.org/eesdp/ldap-kmod.html .

   byEnv
       This sets it up using $ENV{AutoDNbase} for the base.

   byEESDPenv
       Populates all DNs using the EESDP LDAP Standard in regards to
       environmental values.

   byHostname
       Sets the DNs based on the hostname. The last subdomain is chopped off
       and each '.' is replaced with a ',dc='. This means 'host.foo.bar'
       becomes 'dc=foo,dc=bar'.

       Returns true if it succeeds.

Error Codes
       $obj->{error} is defined, there is an error.

   0
       Methode not implemented yet.

   1
       Retrieving hostname failed. Most likely caused by 'hostname' not being
       in the path.

   2
       None of the methodes returned matched or returned true.

   3
       Either the system does not support /dev/ldap/.
