BOOTPTEST(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           BOOTPTEST(8)

NAME
     bootptest – send BOOTP queries and print responses

SYNOPSIS
     bootptest [-f bootfile] [-h] [-m magic_number] server-name
               [template-file]

DESCRIPTION
     The bootptest utility sends BOOTP requests to the host specified as
     server-name at one-second intervals until either a response is received,
     or until ten requests have gone unanswered.  After a response is
     received, bootptest will wait one more second listening for additional
     responses.

OPTIONS
     -f bootfile
             Fill in the boot file field of the request with bootfile.

     -h      Use the hardware (Ethernet) address to identify the client.  By
             default, the IP address is copied into the request indicating
             that this client already knows its IP address.

     -m magic_number
             Initialize the first word of the vendor options field with
             magic_number.

     A template-file may be specified, in which case bootptest uses the
     (binary) contents of this file to initialize the options area of the
     request packet.

AUTHORS
     The bootptest utility is a combination of original and derived works.
     The main program module (bootptest.c) is original work by Gordon W. Ross
     <gwr@mc.com>.  The packet printing module (print-bootp.c) is a slightly
     modified version of a file from the BSD tcpdump(1) program.

     This program includes software developed by the University of California,
     Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and its contributors.  (See the copyright
     notice in print-bootp.c.)
