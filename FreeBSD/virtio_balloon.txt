NAME
     virtio_balloon – VirtIO Memory Balloon driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device virtio_balloon

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           virtio_balloon_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The virtio_balloon device driver provides support for VirtIO memory
     balloon devices.

     The memory balloon allows the guest to, at the request of the hypervisor,
     return memory allocated to the hypervisor so it can be made available to
     other guests.  The hypervisor can later signal the balloon to return the
     memory.

     <bryanv@FreeBSD.org>.  It first appeared in FreeBSD 9.0.
