NAME
       Test::NoTabs - Check the presence of tabs in your project

SYNOPSIS
       "Test::NoTabs" lets you check the presence of tabs in your perl code.
       It report its results in standard "Test::Simple" fashion:

         use Test::NoTabs tests => 1;
         notabs_ok( 'lib/Module.pm', 'Module is tab free');

       Module authors can include the following in a t/notabs.t and have
       "Test::NoTabs" automatically find and check all perl files in a module
       distribution:

         use Test::NoTabs;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       or

         use Test::NoTabs;
         all_perl_files_ok( @mydirs );

DESCRIPTION
       This module scans your project/distribution for any perl files
       (scripts, modules, etc) for the presence of tabs.

FUNCTIONS
   all_perl_files_ok( [ @directories ] )
       Applies notabs_ok() to all perl files found in @directories (and sub
       directories). If no <@directories> is given, the starting point is one
       level above the current running script, that should cover all the files
       of a typical CPAN distribution. A perl file is *.pl or *.pm or *.t or a
       file starting with "#!...perl"

       If the test plan is defined:

         use Test::NoTabs tests => 3;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       the total number of files tested must be specified.

   notabs_ok( $file [, $text] )
       Run a tab check on $file. For a module, the path (lib/My/Module.pm) or
       the name (My::Module) can be both used.
