MULTIDUMP(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           MULTIDUMP(1)

NAME
     multidump – run multiple rtpdumps simultaneously

SYNOPSIS
     multidump [-F format] [-t minutes] [-x bytes] basename [address]/port
               [...]

DESCRIPTION
     multidump runs multiple rtpdump(1) sessions simultaneously.  For every
     [address]/port, one rtpdump(1) process is started accordingly.  The dumps
     are stored in basename.*, numbered from basename.1 increasingly.  The -F,
     -t and -x flags, if present, are passed to every rtpdump(1) process.

     If the -t flags is used, multidump will wait for all the rtpdump(1)
     processes to finish.  Otherwise, multidump will need to be killed with a
     signal, in which case it kills the running processes as well.
