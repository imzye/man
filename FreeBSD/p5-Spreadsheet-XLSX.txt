NAME
       Spreadsheet::XLSX - Perl extension for reading MS Excel 2007 files.

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Iconv;
           my $converter = Text::Iconv->new("utf-8", "windows-1251");

           # Text::Iconv is not really required.
           # This can be any object with the convert method. Or nothing.

           use Spreadsheet::XLSX;

           my $excel = Spreadsheet::XLSX->new('test.xlsx', $converter);

           foreach my $sheet (@{$excel->{Worksheet}}) {

               printf("Sheet: %s\n", $sheet->{Name});

               $sheet->{MaxRow} ||= $sheet->{MinRow};

               foreach my $row ($sheet->{MinRow} .. $sheet->{MaxRow}) {

                   $sheet->{MaxCol} ||= $sheet->{MinCol};

                   foreach my $col ($sheet->{MinCol} ..  $sheet->{MaxCol}) {

                       my $cell = $sheet->{Cells}[$row][$col];

                       if ($cell) {
                           printf("( %s , %s ) => %s\n", $row, $col, $cell->{Val});
                       }

                   }

               }

           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a (quick and dirty) emulation of Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
       for Excel 2007 (.xlsx) file format.  It supports styles and many of
       Excel's quirks, but not all.  It populates the classes from
       Spreadsheet::ParseExcel for interoperability; including Workbook,
       Worksheet, and Cell.

SEE ALSO
       Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX
         This module (Spradsheet::XLSX) has some serious issues with the way
         it uses regexs for parsing the XML.  I would strongly encourage
         switching to Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX which takes a more reliable
         approach.

       Text::CSV_XS, Text::CSV_PP
       Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
       Spreadsheet::ReadSXC
       Spreadsheet::BasicRead
         for xlscat likewise functionality (Excel only)

       Spreadsheet::ConvertAA
         for an alternative set of cell2cr() / cr2cell() pair

       Spreadsheet::Perl
         offers a Pure Perl implementation of a spreadsheet engine. Users that
         want this format to be supported in Spreadsheet::Read are hereby
         motivated to offer patches. It's not high on my todo-list.

       xls2csv
         <https://metacpan.org/release/KEN/xls2csv-1.07> offers an alternative
         for my "xlscat -c", in the xls2csv tool, but this tool focusses on
         character encoding transparency, and requires some other modules.

       Spreadsheet::Read
         read the data from a spreadsheet (interface module)
