NAME
       XML::Atom::Filter - easy creation of command line Atom processing tools

VERSION
       Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
           package Uppercaser;
           use XML::Atom::Filter;
           use base qw( XML::Atom::Filter );

           sub entry {
               my ($class, $e) = @_;
               $e->content(uc $e->content);
           }

           package main;
           Uppercaser->filter;

DESCRIPTION
       "XML::Atom::Filter" supports creation of command line tools to filter
       and process Atom feeds.

USAGE
   XML::Atom::Filter->new()
       Creates an instance of the identity filter. "XML::Atom::Filter" can be
       used as a class or an instance.

   $f->filter([ $fh ])
       Reads an Atom feed document and applies the filtering process to it.
       The Atom feed is read from $fh, or "STDIN" if not given. After the feed
       is read and parsed, it will be run through the "pre", "entry" (entry by
       entry), and "post" methods.

   $f->pre($feed)
       Prepares to process the entries of the feed, an "XML::Atom::Feed"
       object. By default, no operation is performed.

   $f->entry($entry)
       Processes an entry of the feed, an "XML::Atom::Entry" object. Returns
       the new or modified entry reference, or "undef" if the entry should be
       removed from the filtered feed. By default, no change is made.

       If your filter modifies the content of the entry, you must also modify
       the entry's "id". The Atom feed specification requires entries' "id"
       fields to be universally unique.

   $f->post($feed)
       Postprocesses the feed, an "XML::Atom::Feed" object, after the entries
       are individually processed. By default, the feed's XML is printed to
       "STDOUT".
