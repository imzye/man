HYPRPICKER(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          HYPRPICKER(1)

NAME
     hyprpicker – wlroots-compatible wayland color picker

SYNOPSIS
     hyprpicker [-anh] [-f fmt]

DESCRIPTION
     The hyprpicker utility is a color-picker with support for various output
     formats.  When hyprpicker is invoked the cursor is transformed into a
     magnifying lens, and clicking on any pixel of the screen will print out
     that pixels color to the standard output.  The default output format is
     hexadecimal, but that can be configured with the -f option.

     The options are as follows:

     -a, --autocopy
             Automatically copy the output of hyprpicker to the clipboard.
             This option requires that the wl-copy(1) command is installed on
             system.

     -f fmt, --format=fmt
             Select the format to output the selected pixels color in.  The
             argument fmt is case-insensitive.  The available options are:

             cmyk    (“C% M% Y% K%”)
             hex     (“#RRGGBB”)
             rgb     (“R G B”)
             hsl     (“H S% L%”)
             hsv     (“H S% V%”)

             The default format is hex.

     -n, --no-fancy
             Disable colored output.  Default behavior is to color the output
             in the same color as the selected pixel.

     -h, --help
             Display a help message and exit successfully from the program.

ENVIRONMENT
     NO_COLOR  If set, disables colored output.

EXIT STATUS
     The hyprpicker utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Get a pixels color:

           $ hyprpicker

     Get a pixels color in HSL, wrapped in a CSS hsl() function:

           $ hyprpicker -f hsl | sed 's/^/rgb(/; s/$/)/; y/ /,/'
