NAME
       Email::MessageID - Generate world unique message-ids.

VERSION
       version 1.408

SYNOPSIS
         use Email::MessageID;

         my $mid = Email::MessageID->new->in_brackets;

         print "Message-ID: $mid\x0D\x0A";

DESCRIPTION
       Message-ids are optional, but highly recommended, headers that identify
       a message uniquely. This software generates a unique message-id.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

METHODS
   new
         my $mid = Email::MessageID->new;

         my $new_mid = Email::MessageID->new( host => $myhost );

       This class method constructs an Email::MessageID object containing a
       unique message-id. You may specify custom "host" and "user" parameters.

       By default, the "host" is generated from "Sys::Hostname::hostname".

       By default, the "user" is generated using "Time::HiRes"'s
       "gettimeofday" and the process ID.

       Using these values we have the ability to ensure world uniqueness down
       to a specific process running on a specific host, and the exact time
       down to six digits of microsecond precision.

   create_host
         my $domain_part = Email::MessageID->create_host;

       This method returns the domain part of the message-id.

   create_user
         my $local_part = Email::MessageID->create_user;

       This method returns a unique local part for the message-id.  It
       includes some random data and some predictable data.

   in_brackets
       When using Email::MessageID directly to populate the "Message-ID"
       field, be sure to use "in_brackets" to get the string inside angle
       brackets:

         header => [
           ...
           'Message-Id' => Email::MessageID->new->in_brackets,
         ],

       Don't make this common mistake:

         header => [
           ...
           'Message-Id' => Email::MessageID->new->as_string, # WRONG!
         ],
