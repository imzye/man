NAME
       ExtUtils::F77 - Simple interface to F77 libs

DESCRIPTION
       This module tries to figure out how to link C programs with Fortran
       subroutines on your system. Basically one must add a list of Fortran
       runtime libraries. The problem is their location and name varies with
       each OS/compiler combination! It was originally developed to make
       building and installation of the PGPLOT module easier, which links to
       the pgplot Fortran graphics library. It is now used by a number of perl
       modules.

       This module tries to implement a simple 'rule-of-thumb' database for
       various flavours of UNIX systems.  A simple self-documenting Perl
       database of knowledge/code for figuring out how to link for various
       combinations of OS and compiler is embedded in the modules Perl code.
       Please help save the world by submitted patches for new database
       entries for your system at <https://github.com/PDLPorters/extutils-f77>

       Note the default on most systems is now to search for a generic 'GNU'
       compiler which can be gfortran, g77, g95 or fort77 (in that order based
       on usage) and then find the appropriate link libraries automatically.
       (This is the 'Generic' 'GNU' database entry in the code.)

       The target compiler can be explicitly overriden by setting the
       environment variable F77, e.g.

        % setenv F77 "x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gfortran"
        % perl -MExtUtils::F77 -e 'print ExtUtils::F77->compiler, "\n"'

       The library list which the module returns can be explicitly overridden
       by setting the environment variable F77LIBS, e.g.

         % setenv F77LIBS "-lfoo -lbar"
         % perl -MExtUtils::F77 -e 'print ExtUtils::F77->runtime, "\n"'
         ...

SYNOPSIS
         use ExtUtils::F77;               # Automatic guess
         use ExtUtils::F77 qw(sunos);     # Specify system
         use ExtUtils::F77 qw(linux g77); # Specify system and compiler
         $fortranlibs = ExtUtils::F77->runtime;

METHODS
       The following are all class methods.

   runtime
       Returns a list of F77 runtime libraries.

         $fortranlibs = ExtUtils::F77->runtime;

   runtimeok
       Returns TRUE only if runtime libraries have been found successfully.

   trail_
       Returns true if F77 names have trailing underscores.

   compiler
       Returns command to execute the compiler (e.g. 'f77').

   cflags
       Returns compiler flags.

   testcompiler
       Test to see if compiler actually works.

DEBUGGING
       To debug this module, and/or get more information about its workings,
       set $ExtUtils::F77::DEBUG to a true value. If set, it will "warn"
       various information about its operations.

       As of version 1.22, this module will no longer print or warn if it is
       working normally.
