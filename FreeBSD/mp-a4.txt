DESCRIPTION
       The mp program reads each filename in sequence and generates a
       prettified version of the contents in POSTSCRIPT format. By default the
       output is sent to standard output. If you use one of the different
       names, output is sent direct to the printer.

       mailp will print out mail messages.

       newsp will print out USENET news articles.

       digestp will print out USENET digest files.

       filep will print out ordinary ASCII files.

       filofaxp will print out in Filofax personal organiser format.

       franklinp will print out in Franklin Planner personal organiser format.

       timemanp will print out in Time Manager personal organiser format.

       timesysp will print out in Time/System International personal organiser
       format.

       These programs will use the PRINTER or LPDEST environment variables to
       determine which printer the output is sent to.

       If no filename argument is provided, mp reads the standard input.  If
       the standard input is a terminal, input is terminated by an EOF signal,
       usually Ctrl-D.

       Mail items, news articles, ordinary ASCII files, complete mail folders,
       and digests are all acceptable input formats for mp.  The output format
       includes grayscale lozenges containing banner information at the top
       and bottom of every page.

       The program is conveniently used in conjunction with the print button
       of the SunView/xnews(1) mailtool(1) programs, or the pipe command
       provided by mail(1).  Add the following two lines to your .mailrc file:
                 set printmail='mp -printer'
                 set cmd="mp -printer &"

       Source the .mailrc file, and you are ready to use mp.  For printing
       ordinary ASCII files, the following alias (to be placed in your .cshrc
       file) may also prove useful:
                 alias print 'mp -o -printer -s "\!*" <\!*'

OPTIONS
       -a4    Use A4 paper size (8.5 x 11.4 inches).

       -addhdr type
              Add type to the list of mail or news headers to be printed.

       -article
              Format the file as a news article.  The top banner contains the
              text: "Article from newsgroup ", where newsgroup is the first
              news group found on the Newsgroups: line.

       -chars #
              The maximum number of characters to extract from the gecos field
              of the users /etc/passwd entry. The default is 18.

       -columns #
              Number of columns of output per page. This value will override
              the default value in the prologue file.

       -content
              Instead of using "\nFrom" to denote the start of new mail
              messages, mp will look for (and use) the value of the Content-
              Length: mail header. If the Content-Length doesn't take you to
              the next "\nFrom", then it's wrong, and mp falls back to looking
              for the next "\nFrom" in the mail folder.

       -digest
              Format the file as a digest.

       -elm   Assume the ELM mail frontend intermediate file format. Used when
              printing messages from within ELM (using the "p" command),
              especially for printing tagged messages. This option must be
              specified in your ELM option setup.

       -filofax
              Format the file for use with a Filofax personal organiser.

       -folder
              Format the file as a mail folder, printing multiple messages.

       -franklin
              Format the file for use with a Franklin Planner personal
              organiser.

       -from  Instead of printing who the mail article is for, the top header
              will contain who the mail article is from. A useful option for
              people with their own personal printer.

       -F     Synonym for -from for backwards compatiblity with earier
              versions.

       -help  Print the usage message for mp

       -landscape
              Format output in landscape mode.  Two pages of text will be
              printed per sheet of paper.

       -linelength #
              Maximum number of characters on each line of output. This value
              will override the default value in the prologue file.

       -modtime
              Use the files last modification time (rather than the current
              time) in the mp banner. Note that this only works when the files
              are supplied on the command line (as opposed to standard input).

       -nobanner
              If the output is destined for a printer, than banner printing is
              disabled.  Most of the information that typically appears on the
              banner sheet is output in the mp banners.

       -number
              Print the line number on each line output.

       -pagelength #
              Maximum number of lines on each page of output. This value will
              override the default value in the prologue file.

       -printer name
              Send output to the named printer. Otherwise send output to the
              printer named in the PRINTER or LPDEST environment variables.

       -ps    If the mail or digest message just has PostScript as the text of
              the message, then this is normally just passed straight through.
              Specifying this option, causes PostScript to be printed as text.

       -prologue name
              Employ the file name as the POSTSCRIPT prologue file, overriding
              any previously defined file names.

       -remhdr type
              Add type to the list of mail or news headers which will not be
              printed.

       -subject text
              Use  text as the new subject for the printout. If you are
              printing ordinary ASCII files which have been specified on the
              command line, the the subject will default to the name of each
              of these files.

       -tab # The number of spaces to output when encountering a tab
              character.

       -text  Format the file as an ordinary ASCII text file.

       -timeman
              Format the file for use with the Time Manager personal
              organiser.

       -timesys
              format the file for use with the Time/System International
              personal organiser.

       -us    Use US paper size (8.5 x 11 inches).

       -version
              Print the version number of this release of mp.

       -words #
              The maximum number of words to extract from the gecos field of
              the users /etc/passwd entry. The default is 3.

       -wrap  Wrap words onto the next line of output.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The default output printer is determined by looking at the PRINTER
       environment variable for BSD systems or the LPDEST environment variable
       for System V systems.

       The mp prologue file is determined by first looking for the environment
       variable MP_PROLOGUE, which specifies the directory where mp prologue
       files are to be found.  If MP_PROLOGUE is not found, then the default
       directory is assumed (/usr/local/share/mp/mp.pro.ps).

       The following prologue files are provided:

              mp.pro.ps
