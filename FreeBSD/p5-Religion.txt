NAME
       Religion - Generate tracebacks and create and install die() and
        warn() handlers.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a second go at a module to simplify installing die() and warn()
       handlers, and to make such handlers easier to write and control.

       For most people, this just means that if use "use Religion;" then
       you'll get noticably better error reporting from warn() and die(). This
       is especially useful if you are using eval().

       Religion provides four classes, WarnHandler, DieHandler,
       WarnPreHandler, and DiePreHandler, that when you construct them return
       closures that can be stored in variables that in turn get invoked by
       $SIG{__DIE__} and $SIG{__WARN__}. Note that if Religion is in use, you
       should not modify $SIG{__DIE__} or $SIG{__WARN__}, unless you are
       careful about invoking chaining to the old handler.

       Religion also provides a TraceBack function, which is used by a
       DieHandler after you die() to give a better handle on the current scope
       of your situation, and provide information about where you were, which
       might influence where you want to go next, either returning back to
       where you were, or going on to the very last. [Sorry - Ed.]

       See below for usage and examples.

USAGE
       DieHandler SUB
               Invoke like this:

                $Die::Handler = new DieHandler sub {
                       #...
                };

               where "#..." contains your handler code. Your handler will
               receive the following arguments:

                 $message, $full_message, $level, $eval,
                                   $iline, $ifile, $oline, $ofile, $oscope

               $message is the message provided to die(). Note that the
               default addition of " at FILE line LINE.\n" will have been
               stripped off if it was present.  If you want to add such a
               message back on, feel free to do so with $iline and $ifile.

               "$full_message) is the message with a scope message added on if
               there was no newline at the end of $message. Currently, this is
               not the original message that die() tacked on, but something
               along the lines of " at line 3 of the eval at line 4 of
               Foo.pl\n"."

               $eval is non-zero if the die() was invoked inside an eval.

               The rest of the arguments are explained in the source for
               Religion::TraceBack. Yes, I need to document these, but not
               just now, for they are a pain to explain.

               Whenever you install a DieHandler, it will automatically store
               the current value of $Die::Handler so it can chain to it. If
               you want to install a handler only temporarily, use local().

               If your handler returns data using "return" or by falling off
               the end, then the items returns will be used to fill back in
               the argument list, and the next handler in the chain, if any,
               will be invoked. Don't fall off the end if you don't want to
               change the error message.

               If your handler exits using "last", then no further handlers
               will be invoked, and the program will die immediatly.

               If your handler exits using "next", then the next handler in
               the chain will be invoked directly, without giving you a chance
               to change its arguments as you could if you used "return".

               If your handler invokes die(), then die() will proceed as if no
               handlers were installed. If you are inside an eval, then it
               will exit to the scope enclosing the eval, otherwise it will
               exit the program.

       WarnHandler SUB
               Invoke like this:

                $Warn::Handler = new WarnHandler sub {
                       #...
                };

               For the rest of its explanation, see DieHandler, and subsitute
               warn() for die(). Note that once the last DieHandler completes
               (or "last" is invoked) then execution will return to the code
               that invoked warn().

       DiePreHandler SUB
               Invoke like this:

                $Die::PreHandler = new DiePreHandler sub {
                       #...
                };

               This works identically to $Die::Handler, except that it forms a
               separate chain that is invoked before the DieHandler chain.
               Since you can use "last" to abort all the handlers and die
               immediately, or change the messages or scope details, this can
               be useful for modifying data that all future handlers will see,
               or to dispose of some messages from further handling.

               This is even more useful in $Warn::PreHandler, since you can
               just throw away warnings that you know aren't needed.

       WarnPreHandler SUB
               Invoke like this:

                $Warn::PreHandler = new WarnPreHandler sub {
                       #...
                };

               This works identically to $Warn::Handler, except that it forms
               a separate chain that is invoked before the WarnHandler chain.
               Since you can use "last" to abort all the handlers and return
               to the program, or change the messages or scope details, this
               can be useful for modifying data that all future handlers will
               see, or to dispose of some messages.

               This is very useful, since you can just throw away warnings
               that you know aren't needed.

EXAMPLES
       A dialog error message:
                $Die::Handler = new DieHandler sub {
                   my($msg,$fmsg,$level,$eval) = @_;
                   if($eval) {
                               # if we are in an eval, skip to the next handler
                               next;
                       } else {
                               # show a message box describing the error.
                               print "ShowMessageBox $fmsg";

                               # force the program to exit
                               exit 0;
                               next;
                       }
                };

       A handler that changes die() messages back to the original format
                local($Die::Handler) = new DieHandler sub {
                   my($msg,$fmsg,$level,@trace) = @_;

                       $fmsg = $msg . ((substr($msg,-1,1) ne "\n") ?
                                                " at $trace[2] line $trace[1].\n"
                                                : "");
                       return ($msg,$fmsg);
                };

       A warn handler that does nothing.
                $Warn::Handler = new WarnHandler sub {next;};

       A warn prehandler that throws away a warning.
                $Warn::PreHandler = new WarnPreHandler sub {
                       my($msg,$fmsg,$level,$eval) = @_;
                       if($msg =~ /Use of uninitialized/) {
                               last;
                       }
                       next;
                };
