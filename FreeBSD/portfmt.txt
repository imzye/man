PORTCLIPPY(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          PORTCLIPPY(1)

NAME
     portclippy – lint FreeBSD Ports Collection Makefiles

SYNOPSIS
     portclippy [--strict] [Makefile]

DESCRIPTION
     portclippy is a tool for linting FreeBSD Ports Collection Makefiles.

     At the moment it only checks variable order and is a companion tool for
     portlint(1).

     If the optional Makefile argument is not given, the Makefile will be read
     from stdin.

     portclippy will output a skeleton view of the port.  It can be used to
     check if a variable is in the right position.  It is heavily inspired by
     Chapter 15 of the Porter's Handbook and provides an objective measure for
     it.

     Variables in wrong positions will be marked with -.  The position they
     should appear in is marked with a +.

     Variables that start with an underscore _ will be ignored.

     The following options are available:

     --strict
             For unknown variables do not check if they are referenced
             elsewhere in the Makefile and always report them.  Without this
             option referenced but otherwise unknown variables will be
             ignored.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of portclippy:

     CLICOLOR_FORCE  If defined portclippy will output text with ANSI colors
                     even when stdout is not a tty or NO_COLOR is set.

     NO_COLOR        If defined colors will be disabled.

EXIT STATUS
     portclippy will exit with 0 if it could not find a problem, and >0 if
     there are issues.

EXAMPLES
     $ portclippy Makefile
     # BLOCK_PORTNAME
     PORTNAME
     DISTVERSION
     CATEGORIES
     MASTER_SITES

     # BLOCK_MAINTAINER

     LICENSE_FILE

     # BLOCK_DEPENDS
     +RUN_DEPENDS

     # BLOCK_USES
     +USES

     -RUN_DEPENDS

     The output of portclippy is inspired by unified diff(1) output.  Here
     RUN_DEPENDS is in the wrong position (marked with -) and should be moved
     to before USES (marked with +).
