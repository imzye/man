NAME
       pure-perl-make - a perl 'make' replacement

SYNOPSIS
         pure-perl-make [-D] [-n] [-p] [-g] [-f Makefile] [-C directory]
           [--analyse-redundancy]
           [targets] [vars]

DESCRIPTION
       Performs the same function as make(1) but is written entirely in perl.
       A subset of GNU make extensions is supported.  For details see Make for
       the underlying perl module.

FLAGS
   -D
       Don't build, just "DumperX" in Data::Dumper the Make object.

   -n
       Don't build, just print what building would have done.

   -p
       Don't build, just print the expanded makefile.

   -g
       Turn on "GNU" in Make.

   --analyse-redundancy
       See if there are direct dependencies that are redundant with indirect
       dependencies. E.g.:

           all: L1 L2 # no need to specify L2
           L1: L2

BUGS
       •   No -k flag
