WINETRICKS(1)                Wine Package Manager                WINETRICKS(1)

NAME
       winetricks - manage virtual Windows environments using Wine

SYNOPSIS
       winetricks  [options] [verb ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       winetricks is an easy way to work around common problems in Wine.

       It provides simple commands to tweak Wine settings, download and
       install missing Windows DLLs and fonts, or install various applications
       with appropriate workarounds for the current version of Wine.

       It can be used via GUI or command line.  The command-line mode is
       intended both for interactive use and as a building block in fancier
       Wine frontends and in automated regression testing.

       winetricks with no arguments displays a GUI using either Zenity or
       Kdialog.

              If set, this specifies the location of the default .wine
              directory ( usually $HOME/.wine ).
