Regexp::Common::profanity_us(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Regexp::Common::profanity_us -- provide regexes for U.S. profanity

SYNOPSIS
         use Regexp::Common qw /profanity_us/;

         my $RE = $RE{profanity}{us}{normal}{label}{-keep}{-dist=>3};

         while (<>) {
             warn "PROFANE" if /$RE/;
         }

       Or easier

        use Regexp::Profanity::US;

        $profane = profane     ($string);
        @profane = profane_list($string);

OVERVIEW
       Instead of a dry technical overview, I am going to explain the
       structure of this module based on its history. I consult at a company
       that generates customer leads primarily by having websites that attract
       people (e.g.  lowering loan values, selling cars, buying real estate,
       etc.). For some reason we get more than our fair share of profane
       leads. For this reason I was told to write a profanity checker.

       For the data that I was dealing with, the profanity was most often in
       the email address or in the first or last name, so I naively started
       filtering profanity with a set of regexps for that sort of data. Note
       that both names and email addresses are unlike what you are reading
       now: they are not whitespace-separated text, but are instead labels.

       Therefore full support for profanity checking should work in 2 entirely
       different contexts: labels (email, names) and text (what you are
       reading).  Because open-source is driven by demand and I have no need
       for detecting profanity in text, only "label" is implemented at the
       moment. And you know the next sentence: "patches welcome" :)

   Spelling Variations Dictated by Sound or Sight
       Creative use of symbols to spell words (el33t sp3@k)

       Now, within labels, you can see normal ascii or creative use of
       symbols:

       Here are some normal profane labels:
         suckmycock@isp.com
         shitonastick

       And here they are in ascii art:
         s\/cKmyc0k@aol.com
         sh|+0naST1ck

       A CPAN module which does a great job of "drawing words" is
       Acme::Tie::Eleet.  I thought I knew all of the ways that someone could
       "inflate" a letter so that dirty words could bypass a profanity
       checker, but just look at all these:

        %letter =
           ( a => [ "4", "@" ],
             c => "(",
             e => "3",
             g => "6",
             h => [ "|-|", "]-[" ],
             k => [ "|<", "]{" ],
             i => "!",
             l => [ "1", "|" ],
             m => [ "|V|", "|\\/|" ],
             n => "|\\|",
             o => "0",
             s => [ "5", "Z" ],
             t => [ "7", "+"],
             u => "\\_/",
             v => "\\/",
             w => [ "vv", "\\/\\/" ],
             'y' => "j",
             z => "2",
             );

       Soundex respelling

       Which of course brings me to the final way to take normal text and vary
       it for the same meaning: soundex.

       The way a word sounds can lead to different spellings. For example, we
       have
        shitonastick

       Which we can soundex out as:
        shitonuhstick

       Or, given:
        nigger

       We can rewrite it as:
        nigga
        nigguh
        niggah

       There are two CPAN modules, Text::Soundex and Text::Metaphone which do
       this sort of thing, but after they resolved "shit" and "shot" to the
       same soundex, I forgot about them :).

       So to conclude this OVERVIEW, (or is that oV3r\/ieW :), this module
       does profanity checking for:

         labels and not text

       and for:

         normal and not eleet spelling

       with a bit of hedging to support soundexing (and only definite obscene
       words are searched for. Ambiguous / contextual searching is left as an
       exercise for the reader).

       In Regexp::Common terminology, which is the infrastructure on which
       this module is built, we have only the following regexp for your
       string-matching ecstasy:

           $RE{profanity}{us}{normal}{label}

       and patches are welcome for:

           $RE{profanity}{us}{label}{eleet}
           $RE{profanity}{us}{text}{normal}
           $RE{profanity}{us}{text}{eleet}

       But do note this if you plan to implement text parsing,

       "[^:alpha:]" and not "\b" should be used because "_" does not form a
       word boundary and so

         \bshit\b

       will match

         shit head

       and

         shit-head

       but not

         shit_head

       Another thing about text is that it may be resolved into labels by
       splitting on whitespace. Thus, one could have one engine and a
       different pre-processor.

USAGE
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description
       of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

       This module reads one flag, "-dist" which is used to set the amount of
       characters that can appear between components of an obscene phrase.
       For example

         suck!!!my!!!cock

       will match the following regular expression

         suck-my-cock

       as long as the flag "-dist" is set to 3 or greater because this module
       changes "-" into ".{0,$dist}" with $dist defaulting to 7.  Why such a
       large default? It is done so that the profanity list can omit certain
       words such as my or your. Take this:

         poop on your face

       We have the following regular expression

         poop--face

       which is transformed to

         poop.{0,7}.{0,7}face

       which will match the possible prepositions and adjectives in between
       "poop" and "face" and also match the hideous term "poopface".

   Capturing
       Under "-keep" (see Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire word

       regexps.

       who refactored this module completely of his own volition and in spite
       of his hectic schedule. He turned this module from an unsophisticated
       hack into something worth others using.

       Useful brain picking came from William McKee of Knowmad Consulting on
       the Data::FormValidator mailing list.
