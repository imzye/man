NAME
       Ogg::Vorbis - Perl extension for Ogg Vorbis streams

SYNOPSIS
         use Ogg::Vorbis;
         $ogg = Ogg::Vorbis->new;
         open(INPUT, "< file.ogg");
         open(OUTPUT, "> file.pcm");
         $ogg->open(INPUT);
         $info = $ogg->info;
         %comments = %{$ogg->comment};
         $buffer = '-' x 4096;
         while ($bytes = $ogg->read($buffer,4096,0,2,1,$current_bitstream) > 0) {
           syswrite(OUTPUT, $buffer, $bytes);
         }
         $ogg->clear;
         close(OUTPUT);
         close(INPUT);

DESCRIPTION
       This is an object-oriented interface to the Ogg Vorbis libvorbisfile
       convenience library.  To create a vorbisfile object, call
       Ogg::Vorbis->new.  You can then open it on input streams with the
       open() method, read data from it with read() method, and clean up with
       clear().  Other methods for obtaining information are available as in
       libvorbisfile.

       The info() method returns an Ogg::Vorbis::Info object.  You can access
       the various fields of the vorbis_info struct with methods of the same
       name.

       The comment() method returns a hash of comment name => value entries.

       Currently libvorbisfile does not support writing or encoding, so you
       cannot change comment values or encode a new file, but the
       functionality to do so will be added soon.
