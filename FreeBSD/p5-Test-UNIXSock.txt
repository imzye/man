NAME
       Test::UNIXSock - testing UNIX domain socket program

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::UNIXSock;

           my $server = Test::UNIXSock->new(
               code => sub {
                   my $path = shift;
                   ...
               },
           );
           my $client = MyClient->new( sock => $server->path );
           undef $server; # kill child process on DESTROY

       Using memcached:

           use Test::UNIXSock;

           my $memcached = Test::UNIXSock->new(
               code => sub {
                   my $path = shift;

                   exec $bin, '-s' => $path;
                   die "cannot execute $bin: $!";
               },
           );
           my $memd = Cache::Memcached->new({servers => [$memcached->path]});
           ...

       And functional interface is available:

           use Test::UNIXSock;
           test_unix_sock(
               client => sub {
                   my ($path, $server_pid) = @_;
                   # send request to the server
               },
               server => sub {
                   my $path = shift;
                   # run server
               },
           );

DESCRIPTION
       Test::UNIXSock is a test utility to test UNIX domain socket server
       programs.

       This is based on Test::TCP.

METHODS
       test_unixsock
           Functional interface.

               test_unixsock(
                   client => sub {
                       my $path = shift;
                       # send request to the server
                   },
                   server => sub {
                       my $path = shift;
                       # run server
                   },
                   # optional
                   path => "/tmp/mytest.sock", # if not specified, create a sock in tmpdir
                   max_wait => 3, # seconds
               );

       wait_unix_sock
               wait_unix_sock({ path => $path });

           Waits for a particular path is available for connect.

Object Oriented interface interface
       my $server = Test::UNIXSock->new(%args);
           Create new instance of Test::UNIXSock.

           Arguments are following:

           $args{auto_start}: Boolean
               Call "$server->start()" after create instance.

               Default: true

           $args{code}: CodeRef
               The callback function. Argument for callback function is:
               $code->($pid).

               This parameter is required.

           $args{max_wait} : Number
               Will wait for at most $max_wait seconds before checking port.

               See also Net::EmptyPort.

               Default: 10

       $server->start()
           Start the server process. Normally, you don't need to call this
           method.

       $server->stop()
           Stop the server process.

       my $pid = $server->pid();
           Get the pid of child process.

       my $port = $server->port();
           Get the port number of child process.
