SRC.CONF(5)               FreeBSD File Formats Manual              SRC.CONF(5)

NAME
     src.conf – source build options

DESCRIPTION
     The src.conf file contains variables that control what components will be
     generated during the build process of the FreeBSD source tree; see
     build(7).

     The src.conf file uses the standard makefile syntax.  However, src.conf
     should not specify any dependencies to make(1).  Instead, src.conf is to
     set make(1) variables that control the aspects of how the system builds.

     The default location of src.conf is /etc/src.conf, though an alternative
     location can be specified in the make(1) variable SRCCONF.  Overriding
     the location of src.conf may be necessary if the system-wide settings are
     not suitable for a particular build.  For instance, setting SRCCONF to
     /dev/null effectively resets all build controls to their defaults.

     The only purpose of src.conf is to control the compilation of the FreeBSD
     source code, which is usually located in /usr/src.  As a rule, the system
     administrator creates src.conf when the values of certain control
     variables need to be changed from their defaults.

     In addition, control variables can be specified for a particular build
     via the -D option of make(1) or in its environment; see environ(7).

     The environment of make(1) for the build can be controlled via the
     SRC_ENV_CONF variable, which defaults to /etc/src-env.conf.  Some
     examples that may only be set in this file are WITH_DIRDEPS_BUILD, and
     WITH_META_MODE, and MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX as they are environment-only
     variables.

     The values of variables are ignored regardless of their setting; even if
     they would be set to “FALSE” or “NO”.  The presence of an option causes
     it to be honored by make(1).

     This list provides a name and short description for variables that can be
     used for source builds.

     WITHOUT_ACCT
             Do not build process accounting tools such as accton(8) and
             sa(8).

     WITHOUT_ACPI
             Do not build acpiconf(8), acpidump(8) and related programs.

             Do not build apm(8), apmd(8) and related programs.

     WITHOUT_ASSERT_DEBUG
             Compile programs and libraries without the assert(3) checks.

     WITHOUT_AT
             Do not build at(1) and related utilities.

     WITHOUT_ATM
             Do not build programs and libraries related to ATM networking.

             modules.

     WITHOUT_AUTO_OBJ
             Disable automatic creation of objdirs.  This is enabled by
             default if the wanted OBJDIR is writable by the current user.

             This must be set in the environment, make command line, or
             /etc/src-env.conf, not /etc/src.conf.

     WITH_BEARSSL
             Build the BearSSL library.

             BearSSL is a tiny SSL library suitable for embedded environments.
             For details see http://www.BearSSL.org/

             This library is currently only used to perform signature
             verification and related operations for Verified Exec and
             loader(8).  When set, these options are also in effect:

             WITH_LOADER_EFI_SECUREBOOT (unless WITHOUT_LOADER_EFI_SECUREBOOT
             is set explicitly)
             WITH_LOADER_VERIEXEC (unless WITHOUT_LOADER_VERIEXEC is set
             explicitly)
             WITH_LOADER_VERIEXEC_VECTX (unless WITHOUT_LOADER_VERIEXEC_VECTX
             is set explicitly)
             WITH_VERIEXEC (unless WITHOUT_VERIEXEC is set explicitly)

     WITHOUT_BHYVE
             Do not build or install bhyve(8), associated utilities, and
             examples.

             This option only affects amd64/amd64.

     WITH_BHYVE_SNAPSHOT
             Include support for save and restore (snapshots) in bhyve(8) and
             bhyvectl(8).

             This option only affects amd64/amd64.

     WITH_BIND_NOW
             Build all binaries with the DF_BIND_NOW flag set to indicate that
             the run-time loader should perform all relocation processing at
             process startup rather than on demand.

     WITHOUT_BLACKLIST
             Set this if you do not want to build blacklistd(8) and
             blacklistctl(8).  When set, these options are also in effect:

             WITHOUT_BLACKLIST_SUPPORT (unless WITH_BLACKLIST_SUPPORT is set
             explicitly)

     WITHOUT_BLACKLIST_SUPPORT
             Build some programs without libblacklist(3) support, like
             fingerd(8), ftpd(8), and sshd(8).

     WITHOUT_BLUETOOTH
             Do not build Bluetooth related kernel modules, programs and
             libraries.

     WITHOUT_BOOT
             Do not build the boot blocks and loader.

     WITHOUT_BOOTPARAMD
             Do not build or install bootparamd(8).

     WITHOUT_BOOTPD
             Do not build or install bootpd(8).

     WITHOUT_BSDINSTALL
             Do not build bsdinstall(8), sade(8), and related programs.

     WITHOUT_BSD_CPIO
             Do not build the BSD licensed version of cpio based on
             libarchive(3).

     WITHOUT_BSNMP
             Do not build or install bsnmpd(1) and related libraries and data
             files.

     WITHOUT_BZIP2
             Do not build contributed bzip2 software as a part of the base
             system.  The option has no effect yet.  When set, these options
             are also in effect:

             WITHOUT_BZIP2_SUPPORT (unless WITH_BZIP2_SUPPORT is set
             explicitly)

     WITHOUT_BZIP2_SUPPORT
             Build some programs without optional bzip2 support.

     WITHOUT_CALENDAR
             Do not build calendar(1).

     WITHOUT_CAPSICUM
             Do not build Capsicum support into system programs.  When set, it
             enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_CASPER

     WITHOUT_CAROOT
             Do not add the trusted certificates from the Mozilla NSS bundle
             to base.

     WITHOUT_CASPER
             Do not build Casper program and related libraries.

     WITH_CCACHE_BUILD
             Use ccache(1) for the build.  No configuration is required except
             to install the devel/ccache package.  When using with distcc(1),
             set CCACHE_PREFIX=/usr/local/bin/distcc.  The default cache
             directory of $HOME/.ccache will be used, which can be overridden
             by setting CCACHE_DIR.  The CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK option defaults
             to content when using the in-tree bootstrap compiler, and mtime
             when using an external compiler.  The CCACHE_CPP2 option is used
             for Clang but not GCC.

             Sharing a cache between multiple work directories requires using
             a layout similar to /some/prefix/src /some/prefix/obj and an
             environment such as:

                   CCACHE_BASEDIR='${SRCTOP:H}' MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX='${SRCTOP:H}/obj'

             See ccache(1) for more configuration options.

     WITHOUT_CCD
             Do not build geom_ccd(4) and related utilities.

     WITHOUT_CDDL
             Do not build code licensed under Sun's CDDL.  When set, it
             enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_CTF
             WITHOUT_LOADER_ZFS
             WITHOUT_ZFS

     WITHOUT_CLANG
             Do not build the Clang C/C++ compiler during the regular phase of
             the build.  When set, it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_CLANG_EXTRAS
             WITHOUT_CLANG_FORMAT
             WITHOUT_CLANG_FULL
             WITHOUT_LLVM_COV

     WITHOUT_CLANG_BOOTSTRAP
             Do not build the Clang C/C++ compiler during the bootstrap phase
             of the build.  To be able to build the system, either gcc or
             clang bootstrap must be enabled unless an alternate compiler is
             provided via XCC.

     WITH_CLANG_EXTRAS
             Build additional clang and llvm tools, such as bugpoint and
             clang-format.

     WITH_CLANG_FORMAT
             Build clang-format.

     WITHOUT_CLANG_FULL
             Avoid building the ARCMigrate, Rewriter and StaticAnalyzer
             components of the Clang C/C++ compiler.

     WITHOUT_CLANG_IS_CC
             Do not install links to the Clang C/C++ compiler as /usr/bin/cc,
             /usr/bin/c++ and /usr/bin/cpp.

     WITHOUT_CLEAN
             Do not clean before building world and/or kernel.

     WITHOUT_CPP
             Do not build cpp(1).

     WITHOUT_CROSS_COMPILER
             Do not build any cross compiler in the cross-tools stage of
             buildworld.  When compiling a different version of FreeBSD than
             what is installed on the system, provide an alternate compiler
             with XCC to ensure success.  When compiling with an identical
             version of FreeBSD to the host, this option may be safely used.
             This option may also be safe when the host version of FreeBSD is
             close to the sources being built, but all bets are off if there
             have been any changes to the toolchain between the versions.
             When set, it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_CLANG_BOOTSTRAP
             WITHOUT_ELFTOOLCHAIN_BOOTSTRAP
             WITHOUT_LLD_BOOTSTRAP

     WITHOUT_CRYPT
             Do not build any crypto code.  When set, it enforces these
             options:

             WITHOUT_DMAGENT
             WITHOUT_KERBEROS
             WITHOUT_KERBEROS_SUPPORT
             WITHOUT_LDNS
             WITHOUT_LDNS_UTILS
             WITHOUT_OPENSSH
             WITHOUT_OPENSSL
             WITHOUT_OPENSSL_KTLS
             WITHOUT_PKGBOOTSTRAP
             WITHOUT_SVN
             WITHOUT_SVNLITE
             WITHOUT_UNBOUND
             WITHOUT_ZFS

             When set, these options are also in effect:

             WITHOUT_GSSAPI (unless WITH_GSSAPI is set explicitly)

     WITH_CTF
             Compile with CTF (Compact C Type Format) data.  CTF data
             encapsulates a reduced form of debugging information similar to
             DWARF and the venerable stabs and is required for DTrace.

     WITHOUT_CUSE
             Do not build CUSE-related programs and libraries.

     WITHOUT_CXGBETOOL
             Do not build cxgbetool(8)

             This is a default setting on arm/armv6, arm/armv7, mips/mips,
             mips/mips64, powerpc/powerpc, riscv/riscv64 and riscv/riscv64sf.

     WITH_CXGBETOOL
             Build cxgbetool(8)

             This is a default setting on amd64/amd64, arm64/aarch64,
             i386/i386 and powerpc/powerpc64.

     WITHOUT_CXX
             Do not build C++ headers and runtime libraries.  It also prevents
             building binaries and libraries written in C++, including
             devd(8).  When set, it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_CLANG
             WITHOUT_CLANG_EXTRAS
             WITHOUT_CLANG_FORMAT
             WITHOUT_CLANG_FULL
             WITHOUT_DTRACE_TESTS
             WITHOUT_GOOGLETEST
             WITHOUT_LLVM_COV
             WITHOUT_OFED
             WITHOUT_OFED_EXTRA
             WITHOUT_OPENMP
             WITHOUT_PMC
             WITHOUT_TESTS

     WITHOUT_DEBUG_FILES
             Avoid building or installing standalone debug files for each
             executable binary and shared library.

     WITHOUT_DIALOG
             Do not build dialog(1), dialog(3), dpv(1), and dpv(3).  When set,
             it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_BSDINSTALL

     WITHOUT_DICT
             Do not build the Webster dictionary files.

     WITH_DIRDEPS_BUILD
             This is an experimental build system.  For details see
             http://www.crufty.net/sjg/docs/freebsd-meta-mode.htm.  Build
             commands can be seen from the top-level with:
                   make show-valid-targets
             The build is driven by dirdeps.mk using DIRDEPS stored in
             Makefile.depend files found in each directory.

             The build can be started from anywhere, and behaves the same.
             The initial instance of make(1) recursively reads DIRDEPS from
             Makefile.depend, computing a graph of tree dependencies from the
             current origin.  Setting NO_DIRDEPS skips checking dirdep
             dependencies and will only build in the current and child
             directories.  NO_DIRDEPS_BELOW skips building any dirdeps and
             only build the current directory.

             This also utilizes the WITH_META_MODE logic for incremental
             builds.

             The build hides commands executed unless NO_SILENT is defined.

             Note that there is currently no mass install feature for this.

             When set, it enforces these options:

             WITH_INSTALL_AS_USER

             When set, these options are also in effect:

             WITH_META_MODE (unless WITHOUT_META_MODE is set explicitly)
             WITH_STAGING (unless WITHOUT_STAGING is set explicitly)
             WITH_STAGING_MAN (unless WITHOUT_STAGING_MAN is set explicitly)
             WITH_STAGING_PROG (unless WITHOUT_STAGING_PROG is set explicitly)
             WITH_SYSROOT (unless WITHOUT_SYSROOT is set explicitly)

             This must be set in the environment, make command line, or
             /etc/src-env.conf, not /etc/src.conf.

     WITH_DIRDEPS_CACHE
             Cache result of dirdeps.mk which can save significant time for
             subsequent builds.  Depends on WITH_DIRDEPS_BUILD.

             This must be set in the environment, make command line, or
             /etc/src-env.conf, not /etc/src.conf.

     WITHOUT_DMAGENT
             Do not build dma Mail Transport Agent.

     WITHOUT_DOCCOMPRESS
             Do not install compressed system documentation.  Only the
             uncompressed version will be installed.

     WITH_DTRACE_TESTS
             Build and install the DTrace test suite in
             /usr/tests/cddl/usr.sbin/dtrace.  This test suite is considered
             experimental on architectures other than amd64/amd64 and running
             it may cause system instability.

     WITHOUT_DYNAMICROOT
             Set this if you do not want to link /bin and /sbin dynamically.

     WITHOUT_EE
             Do not build and install edit(1), ee(1), and related programs.

     WITHOUT_EFI
             Set not to build efivar(3) and efivar(8).

             This is a default setting on mips/mips, mips/mips64,
             powerpc/powerpc and powerpc/powerpc64.

     WITH_EFI
             Build efivar(3) and efivar(8).

             This is a default setting on amd64/amd64, arm/armv6, arm/armv7,
             arm64/aarch64, i386/i386, riscv/riscv64 and riscv/riscv64sf.

     WITHOUT_ELFTOOLCHAIN_BOOTSTRAP
             Do not build ELF Tool Chain tools (addr2line, nm, size, strings
             and strip) as part of the bootstrap process.  An alternate
             bootstrap tool chain must be provided.

     WITHOUT_EXAMPLES
             Avoid installing examples to /usr/share/examples/.

     WITH_EXPERIMENTAL
             Include experimental features in the build.

     WITH_EXTRA_TCP_STACKS
             Build extra TCP stack modules.

     WITHOUT_FDT
             Do not build Flattened Device Tree support as part of the base
             system.  This includes the device tree compiler (dtc) and libfdt
             support library.

     WITHOUT_FILE
             Do not build file(1) and related programs.  When set, it enforces
             these options:

             WITHOUT_SVNLITE

     WITHOUT_FINGER
             Do not build or install finger(1) and fingerd(8).

     WITH_GOOGLETEST
             Build and install GoogleMock library (libgmock, -lgmock),
             GoogleTest library (libgtest, -lgtest), and dependent tests.

             This is a default setting on amd64/amd64, arm/armv6, arm/armv7,
             arm64/aarch64, i386/i386, powerpc/powerpc, powerpc/powerpc64,

     WITHOUT_ICONV
             Do not build iconv as part of libc.

     WITHOUT_INCLUDES
             Do not install header files.  This option used to be spelled
             NO_INCS.  The option does not work for build targets.

     WITHOUT_INET
             Do not build programs and libraries related to IPv4 networking.
             When set, it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_INET_SUPPORT

     WITHOUT_INET6
             Do not build programs and libraries related to IPv6 networking.
             When set, it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_INET6_SUPPORT

     WITHOUT_INET6_SUPPORT
             Build libraries, programs, and kernel modules without IPv6
             support.

     WITHOUT_INETD
             Do not build inetd(8).

     WITHOUT_INET_SUPPORT
             Build libraries, programs, and kernel modules without IPv4
             support.

     WITH_INIT_ALL_PATTERN
             Build the base system or kernel with stack variables initialized
             to (compiler defined) debugging patterns on function entry.  This
             option requires the clang compiler.

     WITH_INIT_ALL_ZERO
             Build the base system or kernel with stack variables initialized
             to zero on function entry.  This option requires that the clang
             compiler be used.

     WITHOUT_INSTALLLIB
             Set this to not install optional libraries.  For example, when
             creating a nanobsd(8) image.  The option does not work for build
             targets.

     WITH_INSTALL_AS_USER
             Make install targets succeed for non-root users by installing
             files with owner and group attributes set to that of the user
             running the make(1) command.  The user still must set the DESTDIR
             variable to point to a directory where the user has write
             permissions.

     WITHOUT_IPFILTER
             Do not build IP Filter package.

     WITHOUT_IPFW
             Do not build IPFW tools.

     WITHOUT_IPSEC_SUPPORT
             Do not build the kernel with ipsec(4) support.  This option is
             needed for ipsec(4) and tcpmd5(4).

     WITHOUT_ISCSI
             Do not build iscsid(8) and related utilities.

     WITHOUT_JAIL
             Do not build tools for the support of jails; e.g., jail(8).

     WITHOUT_KDUMP
             Do not build kdump(1) and truss(1).

     WITHOUT_KERBEROS
             Set this to not build Kerberos 5 (KTH Heimdal).  When set, these
             options are also in effect:

             WITHOUT_GSSAPI (unless WITH_GSSAPI is set explicitly)
             WITHOUT_KERBEROS_SUPPORT (unless WITH_KERBEROS_SUPPORT is set
             explicitly)

     WITHOUT_KERBEROS_SUPPORT
             Build some programs without Kerberos support, like ssh(1),
             telnet(1), sshd(8), and telnetd(8).

     WITH_KERNEL_RETPOLINE
             Enable the "retpoline" mitigation for CVE-2017-5715 in the kernel
             build.

     WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS
             Do not install kernel debug symbol files.

     WITHOUT_KVM
             Do not build the libkvm library as a part of the base system.
             The option has no effect yet.  When set, these options are also
             in effect:

             WITHOUT_KVM_SUPPORT (unless WITH_KVM_SUPPORT is set explicitly)

     WITHOUT_KVM_SUPPORT
             Build some programs without optional libkvm support.

     WITHOUT_LDNS
             Setting this variable will prevent the LDNS library from being
             built.  When set, it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_LDNS_UTILS
             WITHOUT_UNBOUND

     WITHOUT_LDNS_UTILS
             Setting this variable will prevent building the LDNS utilities
             drill(1) and host(1).

     WITHOUT_LEGACY_CONSOLE
             Do not build programs that support a legacy PC console; e.g.,
             kbdcontrol(1) and vidcontrol(1).

     WITHOUT_LIB32
             On 64-bit platforms, do not build 32-bit library set and a
             ld-elf32.so.1 runtime linker.

             This is a default setting on arm/armv6, arm/armv7, arm64/aarch64,
             i386/i386, mips/mips, powerpc/powerpc, riscv/riscv64 and
             riscv/riscv64sf.

     WITHOUT_LIBCPLUSPLUS
             Set to avoid building libcxxrt and libc++.

     WITH_LIBSOFT
             On armv6 only, enable soft float ABI compatibility libraries.
             This option is for transitioning to the new hard float ABI.

     WITHOUT_LLD
             Do not build LLVM's lld linker.

     WITHOUT_LLDB
             Do not build the LLDB debugger.

             mips/mips64, riscv/riscv64 and riscv/riscv64sf.

     WITH_LLDB
             Build the LLDB debugger.

             This is a default setting on amd64/amd64, arm64/aarch64,
             i386/i386, powerpc/powerpc and powerpc/powerpc64.

     WITHOUT_LLD_BOOTSTRAP
             Do not build the LLD linker during the bootstrap phase of the
             build.  To be able to build the system an alternate linker must
             be provided via XLD.

     WITHOUT_LLD_IS_LD
             Do not install a /usr/bin/ld symlink to ld.lld.  The system will
             not have a usable tool chain unless a linker is provided some
             other way.

     WITH_LLVM_ASSERTIONS
             Enable debugging assertions in LLVM.

     WITH_LLVM_BINUTILS
             Install LLVM's binutils (ar, addr2line, nm, etc.) instead of ELF
             Tool Chain's.

     WITHOUT_LLVM_COV
             Do not build the llvm-cov(1) tool.

     WITHOUT_LLVM_CXXFILT
             Install ELF Tool Chain's cxxfilt as c++filt, instead of LLVM's
             llvm-cxxfilt.

     WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_AARCH64
             Do not build LLVM target support for AArch64.  The
             LLVM_TARGET_ALL option should be used rather than this in most
             cases.

     WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_ALL
             Only build the required LLVM target support.  This option is
             preferred to specific target support options.  When set, these
             options are also in effect:

             WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_AARCH64 (unless WITH_LLVM_TARGET_AARCH64 is
             set explicitly)
             WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_ARM (unless WITH_LLVM_TARGET_ARM is set
             explicitly)
             WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_MIPS (unless WITH_LLVM_TARGET_MIPS is set
             explicitly)

             explicitly)

     WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_ARM
             Do not build LLVM target support for ARM.  The LLVM_TARGET_ALL
             option should be used rather than this in most cases.

     WITH_LLVM_TARGET_BPF
             Build LLVM target support for BPF.  The LLVM_TARGET_ALL option
             should be used rather than this in most cases.

     WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_MIPS
             Do not build LLVM target support for MIPS.  The LLVM_TARGET_ALL
             option should be used rather than this in most cases.

     WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_POWERPC
             Do not build LLVM target support for PowerPC.  The
             LLVM_TARGET_ALL option should be used rather than this in most
             cases.

     WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_RISCV
             Do not build LLVM target support for RISC-V.  The LLVM_TARGET_ALL
             option should be used rather than this in most cases.

     WITHOUT_LLVM_TARGET_X86
             Do not build LLVM target support for X86.  The LLVM_TARGET_ALL
             option should be used rather than this in most cases.

             This is a default setting on powerpc/powerpc and
             powerpc/powerpc64.

     WITHOUT_LOADER_UBOOT
             Disable building of ubldr.

             This is a default setting on amd64/amd64, arm64/aarch64,
             i386/i386, riscv/riscv64 and riscv/riscv64sf.

     WITH_LOADER_UBOOT

             This is a default setting on arm/armv6, arm/armv7, mips/mips,
             mips/mips64, powerpc/powerpc and powerpc/powerpc64.

     WITH_LOADER_VERBOSE
             Build with extra verbose debugging in the loader.  May explode
             already nearly too large loader over the limit.  Use with care.

     WITH_LOADER_VERIEXEC
             Enable building loader(8) with support for verification similar
             to Verified Exec.

             Depends on WITH_BEARSSL.  When set, these options are also in
             effect:

             WITH_LOADER_EFI_SECUREBOOT (unless WITHOUT_LOADER_EFI_SECUREBOOT
             is set explicitly)
             WITH_LOADER_VERIEXEC_VECTX (unless WITHOUT_LOADER_VERIEXEC_VECTX
             is set explicitly)

     WITH_LOADER_VERIEXEC_PASS_MANIFEST
             Enable building loader(8) with support to pass a verified
             manifest to the kernel.  The kernel has to be built with a module
             to parse the manifest.

             Depends on WITH_LOADER_VERIEXEC.

     WITHOUT_LOADER_ZFS
             Do not build ZFS file system boot loader support.

     WITHOUT_LOCALES
             Do not build localization files; see locale(1).

     WITHOUT_LOCATE
             Do not build locate(1) and related programs.

     WITHOUT_LPR
             Do not build lpr(1) and related programs.

     WITHOUT_LS_COLORS
             Build ls(1) without support for colors to distinguish file types.

     WITHOUT_MAIL
             Do not build any mail support (MUA or MTA).  When set, it
             enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_DMAGENT
             WITHOUT_MAILWRAPPER
             WITHOUT_SENDMAIL

     WITHOUT_MAILWRAPPER
             Do not build the mailwrapper(8) MTA selector.

     WITHOUT_MAKE
             Do not install make(1) and related support files.

     WITHOUT_MAKE_CHECK_USE_SANDBOX
             Do not execute “make check” in limited sandbox mode.  This option
             should be paired with WITH_INSTALL_AS_USER if executed as an
             unprivileged user.  See tests(7) for more details.

     WITHOUT_MALLOC_PRODUCTION
             Enable assertions and statistics gathering in malloc(3).  It also
             defaults the A and J runtime options to on.

     WITHOUT_MAN
             Do not build manual pages.  When set, these options are also in
             effect:

             WITHOUT_MAN_UTILS (unless WITH_MAN_UTILS is set explicitly)

     WITHOUT_MANCOMPRESS
             Do not install compressed man pages.  Only the uncompressed
             versions will be installed.

     WITH_MANSPLITPKG
             Split man pages into their own packages during make package.

     WITHOUT_MAN_UTILS
             Do not build utilities for manual pages, apropos(1),
             makewhatis(1), man(1), whatis(1), manctl(8), and related support
             files.

     WITH_META_MODE
             Create make(1) meta files when building, which can provide a
             reliable incremental build when using filemon(4).  The meta file
             is created in OBJDIR as target.meta.  These meta files track the
             command that was executed, its output, and the current directory.
             The filemon(4) module is required unless NO_FILEMON is defined.
             When the module is loaded, any files used by the commands
             executed are tracked as dependencies for the target in its meta
             file.  The target is considered out-of-date and rebuilt if any of
             these conditions are true compared to the last build:
             •   The command to execute changes.
             •   The current working directory changes.
             •   The target's meta file is missing.
             •   The target's meta file is missing filemon data when filemon
                 is loaded and a previous run did not have it loaded.
             •   [requires filemon(4)] Files read, executed or linked to are
                 newer than the target.
             •   [requires filemon(4)] Files read, written, executed or linked
                 are missing.
             The meta files can also be useful for debugging.

             The build hides commands that are executed unless NO_SILENT is
             defined.  Errors cause make(1) to show some of its environment
             for further debugging.

             The build operates as it normally would otherwise.  This option
             originally invoked a different build system but that was renamed
             to WITH_DIRDEPS_BUILD.

             This must be set in the environment, make command line, or
             /etc/src-env.conf, not /etc/src.conf.

     WITHOUT_MLX5TOOL
             Do not build mlx5tool(8)

             Do not build nc(1) utility.

     WITHOUT_NETGRAPH
             Do not build applications to support netgraph(4).  When set, it
             enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_ATM
             WITHOUT_BLUETOOTH

             When set, these options are also in effect:

             explicitly)

     WITHOUT_NETGRAPH_SUPPORT
             Build libraries, programs, and kernel modules without netgraph
             support.

     WITHOUT_NIS
             Do not build NIS(8) support and related programs.  If set, you
             might need to adopt your nsswitch.conf(5) and remove ‘nis’
             entries.

     WITHOUT_NLS

             is set.

     WITHOUT_NTP
             Do not build ntpd(8) and related programs.

     WITHOUT_NVME

             client from ports.

     WITHOUT_OPENMP
             Do not build LLVM's OpenMP runtime.

             This is a default setting on arm/armv6, arm/armv7, mips/mips,
             mips/mips64 and powerpc/powerpc.

     WITH_OPENMP

             This is a default setting on arm/armv6, arm/armv7, i386/i386,
             mips/mips, mips/mips64, powerpc/powerpc, powerpc/powerpc64,
             riscv/riscv64 and riscv/riscv64sf.

     WITH_OPENSSL_KTLS
             Include kernel TLS support in OpenSSL.

             This is a default setting on amd64/amd64 and arm64/aarch64.

     WITHOUT_PAM
             Do not build PAM library and modules.  This option is deprecated
             and does nothing.  When set, these options are also in effect:

             WITHOUT_PAM_SUPPORT (unless WITH_PAM_SUPPORT is set explicitly)

     WITHOUT_PAM_SUPPORT
             Build some programs without PAM support, particularly ftpd(8) and
             ppp(8).

     WITHOUT_PF
             Do not build PF firewall package.  When set, it enforces these
             options:

             WITHOUT_AUTHPF

             This is a default setting on mips/mips64.

     WITH_PROFILE
             Build profiled libraries for use with gprof(8).  This option is
             deprecated and is not present in FreeBSD 14.

             This is a default setting on amd64/amd64, arm/armv6, arm/armv7,
             arm64/aarch64, i386/i386, mips/mips, powerpc/powerpc,
             powerpc/powerpc64, riscv/riscv64 and riscv/riscv64sf.

             Do not build quota(1) and related programs.

     WITHOUT_RADIUS_SUPPORT
             Do not build radius support into various applications, like
             pam_radius(8) and ppp(8).

     WITH_RATELIMIT
             Build the system with rate limit support.

             This makes SO_MAX_PACING_RATE effective in getsockopt(2), and
             txrlimit support in ifconfig(8), by proxy.

     WITHOUT_RBOOTD
             Do not build or install rbootd(8).

     WITH_REPRODUCIBLE_BUILD
             Exclude build metadata (such as the build time, user, or host)
             from the kernel, boot loaders, and uname output, so that builds
             produce bit-for-bit identical output.

             Do not build the 4.4BSD legacy docs.

     WITHOUT_SHARED_TOOLCHAIN
             Build the toolchain binaries as statically linked executables.
             The set includes cc(1), make(1) and necessary utilities like
             assembler, linker and library archive manager.

     WITH_SORT_THREADS
             Enable threads in sort(1).

     WITHOUT_SOURCELESS
             Do not build kernel modules that include sourceless code (either
             microcode or native code for host CPU).  When set, it enforces
             these options:

             WITHOUT_SOURCELESS_HOST
             WITHOUT_SOURCELESS_UCODE

     WITHOUT_SOURCELESS_HOST

     WITHOUT_SSP
             Do not build world with propolice stack smashing protection.

             This is a default setting on mips/mips and mips/mips64.

     WITH_SSP
             Build world with propolice stack smashing protection.

             This is a default setting on amd64/amd64, arm/armv6, arm/armv7,
             arm64/aarch64, i386/i386, powerpc/powerpc, powerpc/powerpc64,
             riscv/riscv64 and riscv/riscv64sf.

     WITH_STAGING
             Enable staging of files to a stage tree.  This can be best
             thought of as auto-install to DESTDIR with some extra meta data
             to ensure dependencies can be tracked.  Depends on
             WITH_DIRDEPS_BUILD.  When set, these options are also in effect:

             WITH_STAGING_MAN (unless WITHOUT_STAGING_MAN is set explicitly)
             WITH_STAGING_PROG (unless WITHOUT_STAGING_PROG is set explicitly)

             This must be set in the environment, make command line, or
             /etc/src-env.conf, not /etc/src.conf.

     WITH_STAGING_MAN
             Enable staging of man pages to stage tree.

     WITH_STAGING_PROG
             Enable staging of PROGs to stage tree.

     WITH_STALE_STAGED
             Check staged files are not stale.

     WITHOUT_STATS
             Neither build nor install library “libstats” and dependent
             binaries.

     WITH_SVN
             Install svnlite(1) as svn(1).

     WITH_SVNLITE
             Build svnlite(1) and related programs.

     WITHOUT_SYSCONS
             Do not build syscons(4) support files such as keyboard maps,
             fonts, and screen output maps.

     WITH_SYSROOT
             Enable use of sysroot during build.  Depends on
             WITH_DIRDEPS_BUILD.

             This must be set in the environment, make command line, or
             /etc/src-env.conf, not /etc/src.conf.

     WITHOUT_SYSTEM_COMPILER
             Do not opportunistically skip building a cross-compiler during
             the bootstrap phase of the build.  Normally, if the currently
             installed compiler matches the planned bootstrap compiler type
             and revision, then it will not be built.  This does not prevent a
             compiler from being built for installation though, only for
             building one for the build itself.  The WITHOUT_CLANG option
             controls that.

     WITHOUT_SYSTEM_LINKER
             Do not opportunistically skip building a cross-linker during the
             bootstrap phase of the build.  Normally, if the currently
             installed linker matches the planned bootstrap linker type and
             revision, then it will not be built.  This does not prevent a
             linker from being built for installation though, only for
             building one for the build itself.  The WITHOUT_LLD option
             controls that.

             This option is only relevant when WITH_LLD_BOOTSTRAP is set.

     WITHOUT_TALK
             Do not build or install talk(1) and talkd(8).

     WITHOUT_TCP_WRAPPERS
             Do not build or install tcpd(8), and related utilities.

     WITHOUT_TCSH
             Do not build and install /bin/csh (which is tcsh(1)).

     WITHOUT_TELNET
             Do not build telnet(1) and related programs.

     WITHOUT_TESTS
             Do not build nor install the FreeBSD Test Suite in /usr/tests/.
             See tests(7) for more details.  This also disables the build of
             all test-related dependencies, including ATF.  When set, it
             enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_DTRACE_TESTS

             When set, these options are also in effect:

             WITHOUT_GOOGLETEST (unless WITH_GOOGLETEST is set explicitly)
             WITHOUT_TESTS_SUPPORT (unless WITH_TESTS_SUPPORT is set
             explicitly)

     WITHOUT_TESTS_SUPPORT
             Disable the build of all test-related dependencies, including
             ATF.  When set, it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_GOOGLETEST

     WITHOUT_TEXTPROC
             Do not build programs used for text processing.

     WITHOUT_TFTP
             Do not build or install tftp(1) and tftpd(8).

     WITHOUT_TOOLCHAIN
             Do not install header or programs used for program development,
             compilers, debuggers etc.  When set, it enforces these options:

             WITHOUT_CLANG
             WITHOUT_CLANG_EXTRAS
             WITHOUT_CLANG_FORMAT
             WITHOUT_CLANG_FULL
             WITHOUT_INCLUDES
             WITHOUT_LLD
             WITHOUT_LLDB
             WITHOUT_LLVM_BINUTILS
             WITHOUT_LLVM_COV

     WITHOUT_UNBOUND
             Do not build unbound(8) and related programs.

     WITHOUT_UNIFIED_OBJDIR
             Use the historical object directory format for build(7) targets.
             For native-builds and builds done directly in sub-directories the
             format of ${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX}/${.CURDIR} is used, while for
             cross-builds
             ${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX}/${TARGET}.${TARGET_ARCH}/${.CURDIR} is used.

             This option is transitional and will be removed before the 12.0
             release, at which time will be enabled permanently.

             This must be set in the environment, make command line, or
             /etc/src-env.conf, not /etc/src.conf.

     WITHOUT_USB
             Do not build USB-related programs and libraries.

     WITHOUT_USB_GADGET_EXAMPLES
             Do not build USB gadget kernel modules.

     WITHOUT_UTMPX
             Do not build user accounting tools such as last(1), users(1),
             who(1), ac(8), lastlogin(8) and utx(8).

     WITH_VERIEXEC
             Enable building veriexec(8) which loads the contents of verified
             manifests into the kernel for use by mac_veriexec(4)

             Depends on WITH_BEARSSL.

     WITHOUT_VI
             Do not build and install vi, view, ex and related programs.

     WITHOUT_VT
             Do not build vt(4) support files (fonts and keymaps).

     WITHOUT_WARNS
             Set this to not add warning flags to the compiler invocations.
             Useful as a temporary workaround when code enters the tree which
             triggers warnings in environments that differ from the original
             developer.

     WITHOUT_WERROR
             Set this to not treat compiler warnings as errors.  Useful as a
             temporary workaround when working on fixing compiler warnings.
             When set, warnings are still printed in the build log but do not
             fail the build.

     WITHOUT_WIRELESS
             Do not build programs used for 802.11 wireless networks;
             especially wpa_supplicant(8) and hostapd(8).  When set, these
             options are also in effect:

             WITHOUT_WIRELESS_SUPPORT (unless WITH_WIRELESS_SUPPORT is set
             explicitly)

     WITHOUT_WIRELESS_SUPPORT
             Build libraries, programs, and kernel modules without 802.11
             wireless support.

     WITHOUT_WPA_SUPPLICANT_EAPOL
             Build wpa_supplicant(8) without support for the IEEE 802.1X
             protocol and without support for EAP-PEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-LEAP, and
             EAP-TTLS protocols (usable only via 802.1X).

     WITHOUT_ZFS
             Do not build ZFS file system kernel module, libraries, and user
             commands.

     WITHOUT_ZONEINFO
             Do not build the timezone database.  When set, it enforces these
             options:

             WITHOUT_ZONEINFO_LEAPSECONDS_SUPPORT

     WITH_ZONEINFO_LEAPSECONDS_SUPPORT
             Build leapsecond information in to the timezone database.
