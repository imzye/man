RUE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 RUE(4)

NAME
     rue – RealTek RTL8150 USB to Fast Ethernet controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device rue

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_rue_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The rue driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the
     RealTek RTL8150 USB to Fast Ethernet controller chip.

     The RTL8150 contains an integrated Fast Ethernet MAC, which supports both
     10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.  Although designed
     to interface with 100Mbps peripheral, the existing USB standard specifies
     a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.  Users should therefore not expect to
     actually achieve 100Mbps speeds with this device.

     The rue driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable auto selection of the media type and options.
                      The user can manually override the auto selected mode by
                      adding media options to the /etc/rc.conf file.

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The mediaopt option can also be
                      used to select either full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The mediaopt
                      option can also be used to select either full-duplex or
                      half-duplex modes.

     The rue driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The rue driver supports RealTek RTL8150 based USB Ethernet adapters
     including:

     •   Buffalo (Melco Inc.) LUA-KTX
     •   Green House GH-USB100B
     •   LinkSys USB100M
     •   Billionton 10/100 FastEthernet USBKR2

DIAGNOSTICS
     rue%d: watchdog timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
     transmit command was issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the
     transmission before a timeout expired.

     rue%d: rx list init failed  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the
     transmitter ring.

     rue%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.
