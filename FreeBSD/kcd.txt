       KCD_DIR] `


DESCRIPTION
       kcd is a set of programs that help you navigate through directories
       easily.  kcd works by consulting the directory tree file for the list
       of directories available.  By default the file is named
       ~/.kcd.save.kcd.gz but may change according to the kcd configuration
       file.  This file is automatically created when kcd is run for the first
       time.


       When you type the command without any parameter, it will display the
       saved entire directory tree and place the highlight bar on the current
       directory.  You can use arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End
       keys to move the highlight bar to the desired directory.  Pressing
       Enter will exit kcd and jump the the selected directory.  If you choose
       to remain in the current directory, just press F10.


       Besides using arrow keys, etc. to move the highlight bar,  you may type
       the some text string to limit the highlight bar to move between items
       containing the string.  The text string is shown at the bottom of the
       screen inside [...].  To restore highlight bar behavior,  press Tab
       key.


       If you know the name of directory you want to change to,  you can type
       only a part of directory name as DIR_SHORTCUT parameter.  If kcd found
       from that there are more than 4 directories contain the text,  it will
       list all matched directories.  You can again use arrow keys, Page Up,
       Page Down, etc. to move the highlight bar and press Enter.  If there
       are less than or equal 4 matched directory, kcd will pick a directory
       and jump.  Repeat the same kcd command will go to the next matched one,
       and so on.  You may change the number of matched directory threshold to
       any value other than 4 by modifying configuration file.  See the
       CONFIGURATION FILE section below.  Optionally, you may specify
       MATCH_NUMBER so that the directory corresponding to the number in the
       matched list is used and kcd jump to that directory immediately.


       The DIR_SHORTCUT may contain special symbols / and // to force the
       matching of parent directories as well.  For example


                 kcd usr/bin


       matches /usr/bin and /usr/sbin but not /usr/local/bin since the
       directory containing usr and bin must appeared right next to each
       other.  On the other hand


                 kcd usr//bin


       allows any number of directories between the usr and bin and also
       matches /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib/mozilla/bin.


   OPTIONS
       -b [DIR_SHORTCUT]
              Display bookmarks matching DIR_SHORTCUT, or all bookmark if
              DIR_SHORTCUT is not supplied.


       -ba [DIR [...]]
              Bookmark specified directories.  If none is specified, the
              current directory is used.


       -br [DIR [...]]
              Remove bookmark from specified directories.  If none is
              specified, the current directory is used.


       -B     Search all directories, not just bookmarked ones.


       --config
              Display current configuration (excluding screen attributes)
              obtained from SYSCONFDIR/kcd.conf and ~/.kcd.conf.  SYSCONFDIR
              is the directory given to --sysconfdir option during configure,
              which usually is /etc, /usr/etc or /usr/local/etc.


       --configattr
              Display current screen attribute configuration.


       --features
              Display availability of all features:

              xterm/rxvt resize
                     Yes if kcd can redraw itself if the size of xterm/rxvt
                     terminal changes.

              mouse support
                     Yes if kcd can response to mouse click.

              default scroll bar
                     Yes if scroll bar will be used.  It can be overridden by
                     ScrollBar command in configuration file.


       -h, --help
              Display help message.


       --helpinst
              Display help for shell alias/function installation.


       -M     Don't scan directories given by MountDir.


       -p PROFILE
              Use the specified configuration profile.  This must be the first
              option present in the command line.


       --profiles
              Display the list of configuration profiles available.


       -r     Rescan directory tree using the default mode as specified in
              configuration file.


       -rf    Rescan directory using full scan mode.  kcd will ignore all
              previously saved directory tree information and start scanning
              from scratch.  By default, the smart scan mode is used whenever
              possible to reduce time needed for directory scanning.

              The full scan mode is provided in case you change configuration
              files - some command may not affect directory tree until you
              rescan in full mode.

              Another possible problem is that some old file system may not
              have the change time (which is updated when directory permission
              is changed) so that kcd cannot correctly update the directory
              tree.  (msdos file system is an example, but fortunately we
              cannot change their directory permission anyway.)


       -rp DIR
              Rescan part of directory tree beginning at DIR.


       -rq    Rescan directory tree using the quiet mode, overriding default
              mode.  No current progress is displayed.


       -rQ    Rescan directory tree using the verbose mode (opposite of -rq ),
              overriding default mode.  Current checked directory is
              displayed.


       -t [DIR]
              Display partial directory tree beginning with DIR.  If DIR is
              not specified, the current directory is used.


       -tr [DIR]
              Like -t but rescan directory tree before display.


       -T     Display full directory tree.


       -v, --version
              Display version number.


       Rescan options can be combined, i.e., `kcd -rf -rq' is the same as `kcd
       -rfq'.


       Following parameters are useful when you type `kcd' and get a command
       not found error.   `kcd' is actually a shell function or shell alias so
       it must be setup before you can type any kcd command.  You will have to
       use `kcdmain' as the command name (since kcd command is not available
       yet).


       -ia    Install shell alias when kcd is installed in /usr/bin.


       -ic    Install shell alias for csh or tcsh when kcd is installed in
              /usr/bin.


       -if    Install shell function when kcd is installed in /usr/bin.


       -ias KCD_DIR
              Install shell alias when kcd is installed in the specified
              directory KCD_DIR.


       -ics KCD_DIR
              Install shell alias for csh or tcsh when kcd is installed in the
              specified directory KCD_DIR.


       -ifs KCD_DIR
              Install shell function when kcd is installed in the specified
              directory KCD_DIR.


DIRECTORY TREE WINDOW
       The directory tree window appears when you type kcd without any other
       parameter.   Initially kcd is in the navigation mode.  You can use
       arrow keys to move the highlight bar to any directory you want.  There
       is another mode called find mode which can be distinguish from
       navigation mode by the string ` Find: ' displayed at the bottom of the
       screen.  Pressing arrow keys will move the highlight bar to the nearest
       directory containing the search string inside the brackets ([...]).
       Displayed at the last row on screen is the full path name of
       highlighted directory.



   KEYS IN NAVIGATION MODE
       Arrow keys, Page up, Page down, Home and End
              Move the highlight bar.


       Space bar or Enter
              Change to the highlighted directory and exit.


       F10 or ^C (Ctrl-C)
              Exit without changing directory.


       F8     Repaint screen.


       F9     Switch between status display: Destination directory <--> Key
              help.


       Center key on numeric keypad
              Center highlight bar on the middle of the screen.


       Characters from `a' to `z', from `A' to `Z' and from `0' to `9'
              Switch to find mode.


       `,' and `.'
              Panning screen left/right.  This works when the directory tree
              is too wide to fit the screen.



   KEYS IN FIND MODE
       Any characters, Ins, Del, Backspace, left arrow, right arrow
              Edit search string


       Up arrow or Page up, down arrow or Page down
              Go to the previous or next directory that match the search
              string


       Backspace or Del when the search string is empty or Tab
              Return to navigation mode


       Space bar or Enter
              Change to the highlighted directory and exit.


       F10 or ^C (Ctrl-C)
              Exit without changing directory.


       F8     Repaint screen.


       For terminals without function keys, you can press ^F+num where num is
       from 0 to 9 to get the same result.  ^F+1 (Press and hold `Ctrl' key,
       press and release `F', release `Ctrl', then press `1') is the same as
       F1.  Similarly ^F+2 to ^F+9 correspond to F2 to F9 respectively.  To
       emulate F10, use ^F+0.


   DIRECTORY LEGENDS
       All accessible directories (except links) are shown as green (color
       console) or underlined (B&W console) and can be selected.



       /dev and /proc plus other directories specified in SkipDir setting are
       shown with [skipped].  Subdirectories inside skipped directories are
       not displayed but you may able to access them using shell's cd command.


       Directories with [*] means that it is not present in the saved file.
       They are added automatically to the screen when current directory is
       not in the file.  The changes are not written to the file.  So you have
       to rescan directory if you do not intend to skip them.


       Directories without execute permission are shown with [unreadable].
       You cannot change to this directory.


       Directories without read permission but with execute permission are
       also shown with [unreadable] you cannot read the content of the
       directory (using the ls command).


       Symbolic links are shown with -> and the destination directory.
       Selecting a symbolic link will jump to its destination directory while
       still staying in kcd.  You can navigate further or just press Enter to
       jump there.  Some symbolic links may point to a directory outside the
       saved directory tree given in the StartDir configuration command.
       These are displayed with [outside tree] Enter will jump there
       immediately.


   ALTERNATE KEY BINDING
       You may change the keys used in kcd via KeyBinding configuration
       commands.  Besides the default or kcd mode, Vi and Emacs modes are
       available.  The following is the summary of keys available in these two
       modes.  All arrow key, PageUp, PageDown, function keys retains the same
       meaning as the default key binding.


   Vi Mode
       0, ^   First directory of line


       $      Last directory of line


       h, b, B
              Previous directory


       l, w, W
              Next directory


       k, -   Up


       j, +, _
              Down


       ^B     Previous page


       ^F     Next page


       ^U, ^Y Scroll up


       ^D, ^E Scroll down


       gg     First page


       G      Last page


       /      Search forward


       ?      Search backward


       ^L     Refresh screen


       q, ZQ, ^C
              Quit


       For most commands, a number prefix to indicate the repeat count, such
       as 5^B representing previous 5 pages, is supported.


   Emacs mode
       C-a    First directory of line


       C-e    Last directory of line


       C-b, M-b
              Previous directory


       C-f, M-f
              Next directory


       C-p    Up


       C-n    Down


       M-v    Previous page


       C-v    Next page


       C-s    Search forward


       C-r    Search backward


       C-c    Quit



CONFIGURATION FILE
       kcd consults settings in /etc/kcd.conf, /usr/etc/kcd.conf,
       /usr/local/etc/kcd.conf and ~/.kcd.conf, (in that order), each time the
       program executes if available.  Commands in the latter configuration
       file will usually override the former one.  However, you have to use
       the ClearStartDir and ClearSkipDir commands in ~/.kcd.conf, for
       example, if you want to undo StartDir and SkipDir commands in
       /etc/kcd.conf.


       The syntax of each command is

                 command_name = value


       All command names are case-insensitive.  Values, however, depends on
       whether the command requests a double quoted value or not.  Only values
       NOT in double quotes are treated as case-insensitive.


       There are 2 possible ways to specify value for double quoted string:
       glob, and regular expression.


       Glob uses characters like `?' and `*' as wildcards.  It is placed
       within a pair of double quotes like "/usr/lib/lib*".


       Regular expression uses extended regular expression format and is
       placed within double quotes prefixed by either `R' or `r' such as
       r"/usr/lib/lib[a-z]-.*".  kcd automatically adds a `^' and `$' at the
       beginning and the end of string, respectively.


       The symbol `#' serves as comment and all characters starting from `#'
       till end of line are ignored.   The `#' inside double quotes, however,
       will be treated as part of value passed to the command.


   COMMAND SUMMARY
       SkipDir   (allowed value = directory /r"directory", optional GlobDot
       and GlobPath override allowed)
              This tell kcd to skip scanning for directories inside the
              specified directory name.   Multiple SkipDir commands are
              allowed.  /dev and /proc are automatically excluded from the
              list of directories to be scanned.  Directory name must be
              inside a pair of double quote ("...").

              You may override the current GlobDot and GlobPath settings for
              this SkipDir command.  Just specify each setting separated by
              comma after the directory name.

              Example:  SkipDir = "/cdrom"
                        SkipDir = "~/*rc", GlobDot=yes


       StartDir  (allowed value = directory )
              This tell kcd to start scanning from the specified directories.
              Multiple StartDir commands are allowed.  In that case, kcd will
              generate output containing multiple directory trees.   Directory
              name must be inside a pair of double quote ("...").  If no
              StartDir is specified,  kcd starts scanning from the root
              directory.  Wild cards are not supported by StartDir.

              Example:  StartDir = "~"


       MountDir  (allowed value = directory , with optional actions
       All/Tree/Skip)
              This tell kcd to handle the specified directory according to the
              action given:

              All Always scan regardless if search string is provided in the
              command line.

              Tree Scan only when search string is not supplied.

              Skip Always skip scanning.

              If the action is not provided, the default Skip action is used.

              Multiple actions, separated by commas can be specified.  However
              this is intended for features to be introduced later.

              Wild cards are not supported by MountDir.

              Example:  MountDir = "/mnt/floppy", Skip
                        MountDir = "/mnt/usb", All

              Note: Directories given by MountDir should not overlap.  The
              following does not work

                        MountDir = "/mnt/mount_c", All
                        MountDir = "/mnt/mount_c/temp", Skip

              Use the following instead

                        MountDir = "/mnt/mount_c", All
                        SkipDir = "/mnt/mount_c/temp"



       QuietFullScan  (allowed value = yes/no, default value = no)
              This command toggle progress report when kcd scan for
              directories using full scan mode.  Only the last QuietFullScan
              command are effective.  This option can be overridden by -rq or
              -rQ.

              Example:  QuietFullScan = yes


       QuietSmartScan (allowed value = yes/no, default value = no)
              This command is similar to QuietFullScan but is intended for
              smart scan mode.  This option can be overridden by `-rq' or
              `-rQ'.


       QuietPartialScan    (allowed value = yes/no, default value = no)
              This command is similar to QuietFullScan but is intended for
              `-rp' option.  This option can be overridden by `-rq' or `-rQ'.


       SortTree  (allowed value = yes/no, default value = yes)
              This command cause kcd to sort the directory tree.  If you
              change the SortTree value from yes to no,  directory tree must
              be rescanned using full scan mode to make this command to
              properly restore the original order.


       GraphicChar    (allowed value = yes/no, default value = yes)
              Choose whether special line graphic and arrow characters are
              used.  If `no' is given, simple characters such as `+', `|',
              `>', etc. is used instead.


       ScrollBar (allowed value = yes/no, default value = yes for ncurses
       version >= 4.2)
              Choose whether scroll bars will be displayed.


       MouseScrollRate     (allowed value: any number >= 0, default value = 2)
              Select scrolling rate when mouse button is held down.  Unit is
              in 0.1 sec.  Set to 0 disable this feature.


       CaseSensitiveSort   (allowed value = yes/no, default value = no)
              Choose between case-sensitive or case-insensitive sort.
              SortTree must be set to yes in order for this to be effective.


       ClearSkipDir   (allowed value = all/"directory"/r"directory")
              Do not skip the specified directory previously set as SkipDir.
              If `all' is used, ClearSkipDir discards all directory.  /dev and
              /proc are not affected by this command.

              Example:  ClearSkipDir = all
                        ClearSkipDir = "/dosc"


       ClearStartDir  (allowed value = all/"directory"/r"directory")
              Do not use the specified directory previously set as StartDir.
              If `all' is used, ClearStartDir discards all StartDir directory.


       ClearMountDir  (allowed value = all/"directory"/r"directory")
              Do not use the specified directory previously set as MountDir.
              If `all' is used, ClearMountDir discards all MountDir directory.


       SpaceSelect    (allowed value = yes/no, default value = yes)
              Setting this to no, when in find mode, pressing spacebar will
              not select the highlighted directory but proceed looking for the
              directory containing the space.


       ShowListThreshold   (allowed value: any numbers >= 0, default value =
       4)     If the number of matched directories given in the command line
              is less than or equal this number, kcd will jump immediately.
              Otherwise, the list of all matches are shown.


       ShowNewDir     (allowed value = yes/no/multi, default value = multi
              Choose whether the new directory will be displayed when kcd
              decides to jump without showing list of matches.  `Multi' means
              display only when there are multiple matches.


       FuzzySize (allowed value: any numbers >= 0, default value = 10)
              If there is no matched directories given in the command line,
              kcd will search for directories that provide the closest match.
              The number of matches is given by this configuration.


       GlobDot   (allowed value = yes/no, default value = no)
              Select whether wildcard can match the leading `.' in the path
              name.  It effects only commands following it.


       GlobPath  (allowed value = yes/no, default value = no)
              Select whether wildcard can match the `/' in the path name.  It
              effects only commands following it.


       DefaultBackground   (allowed value =
       Black/Red/Green/Yellow/Blue/Magenta/Cyan/White, default value = Black)
              Select background color for the directory tree window.


       DefaultTree    (allowed value = quoted string)
              This specifies the default subtree displayed in directory tree
              mode.  It can be overriden by `-t' or `-T' options.



       KeyBinding     (allowed value = default/kcd/vi/emacs, default value =
       default)
              Select a particular key binding.



   SCREEN ATTRIBUTE COMMAND SUMMARY
       Screen attribute command for color display has the following syntax:

            <ITEM>ColorAttr = [normal | <ATTR> ...] <FG_COLOR> on <BG_COLOR>

       while for black and white display is:

            <ITEM>BWAttr = [normal | <ATTR>]

       Available values for <ITEM>:

       Normal Majority of main window area, including line drawing characters,
              inaccessible directories, [*], [skipped] and [unreadable].


       Dir    Directory names.


       HighlightDir
              Highlighted directory names.


       SymLink
              Symbolic links.


       HighlightSymLink
              Highlighted symbolic links.


       Title  Program name, text entered in find mode.


       Status Status bar.


       More   Small area on rightmost column of display area that `+' is
              displayed when window content is too wide to fit on the screen.


       ScrollArrow
              Arrows on the scroll bars.


       ScrollBlock
              The moving block on the scroll bars.


       ScrollBar
              Background of the scroll bars.


       Available values for <ATTR>:
            Standout   Underline   Reverse   Blink   Dim   Bold


       Available values for <FG_COLOR> and <BG_COLOR>:
            Black   Red   Green   Yellow
            Blue   Magenta   Cyan   White


       <BG_COLOR> can also be Default which means that the background color of
       the directory tree window is used here.


       Example:  # Change both foreground and background
                 NormalColorAttr = cyan on black
                 DirColorAttr = bold red on blue
                 SymLinkColorAttr = blue on white
                 # Change only foreground
                 NormalColorAttr = cyan on default
                 # For black and white display
                 NormalBWAttr = normal
                 DirBWAttr = underline
                 TitleBWAttr = bold reverse


       Note: Whether a particular combination of attributes and/or colors
       works is terminal dependent.



   QUOTING RULES
       The following symbols have special meanings inside double quotes values
       (such as in SkipDir command):


                 \  '  "  `  ~


       and


                 *  ?  [  ]


       for glob, or


                 ^  .  [  ]  $  (  )  |  *  +  ?  {  }


       for regular expression.  Currently the commands SkipDir, ClearSkipDir,
       ClearStartDir, ClearMountDir can accept glob or regular expression.


       `~' and `~username', where username is an account name, are properly
       expanded to home directory when it appears at the beginning of the
       string.  The special symbols ``' and `'' are reserved for future use.


       Control characters can be entered using \xHH quoting where HH is the
       hexadecimal value of the character.



   GLOB SPECIAL CHARACTERS
       Shell wildcards normally does not match `/' and the leading `.' but the
       behavior can be overridden using GlobPath and GlobDot commands
       respectively.  Here is the list of wildcard pattern that kcd
       recognizes:


       *      Match any characters


       ?      Match single character


       [set]  Match single character in the set Example: "lib[cm]" matches
              libc and libm.


       [!set] Match single character not in the set Example: "lib[!m]" matches
              libc but not libm.


       [^set] Same as [!set] but only available if in some cases.  If glibc is
              your C library (true on Linux), it works when the environment
              variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set.


       [from-to]
              Match single character within the range Example: "x[a-m]m"
              matches xbm but not xpm.


       [:class:]
              Match single character in the class where class can be one of
              alpha     upper     lower     digit     alnum xdigit   space
                   print     punct     graph cntrl    blank


       Example:
                 SkipDir = "~/.*"
                 SkipDir = "~/*/CVS"


       Note that the matching rules depends on the C library in your system.
       The above rules apply when you have POSIX.2 conforming library.  System
       with older libraries may not accept some of the rules.


       If you want these symbols inside double quotes to actually refer to the
       characters.  You have to add an extra `\' in front of them.  Note that
       here, `*'band `?' refer to characters inside directory name,  not
       wildcards.


       For example:


                 SkipDir = "~/\`Cool\?\'"


       is used to skip the directory named


                 `Cool?'

       (the enclosing quotes and the question mark are parts of the directory
       name) inside your home directory.  (You may not know that can created
       this kind of weird directory name!)



   REGULAR EXPRESSION SPECIAL CHARACTERS
       For information check Section 7 of `regex' man pages, i.e., type `man 7
       regex' in command line.



   SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE
       Following is for directory tree starting from root directory:

       # Sample configuration file for kcd
       SkipDir = "/cdrom"  # Ignore cdrom mounting point
       SkipDir = "/dosc"   # MSDOS C: partition

       Following is for directory tree starting from home directory:

       # Another sample configuration file for kcd
       StartDir = "~"      # Start from home directory
       SkipDir = "~/.terminfo"  # No scan inside .terminfo
       QuietFullScan = yes
       QuietSmartScan = yes


   PROFILES
       This feature allows kcd to behave differently depending on the invoked
       profile name.  The following is an example of configuration file
       containing multiple profiles.

       [kcd]
       StartDir = "/"
       [hcd]
       StartDir = "~"


       With the example above, two shell functions/aliases are introduced,
       `kcd' and `hcd'.  If you type `kcd' in the command line, the entire
       system is searched and displayed.  But if you want to restrict to only
       inside home directory, you can use `hcd' command instead.  More
       profiles can be introduced using in similar manner.  There is no limit
       on the number of profiles.  The only restriction is the name of the
       profile.  The profile name must be a valid C or C++ identifier, i.e.,
       contains only alphanumeric characters or underscore and must not begin
       with a number.


       There are two special profiles, `*' and `kcd'.  The `*' profile is the
       default profile and is used for commands when no profile name is
       specified.  The `kcd' profile is always created regardless if it
       actually appears in the configuration file.  An ordinary profile
       (including `kcd'), when declared, will be initialized from the current
       configuration of `*'.  Afterward, any changes to `*' does not affect
       the previously initialized one.  Here is an example.

       ShowListThreshold = 3    # No profile specified yet,
                           # store in [*]
       [kcd]               # Copy configuration from [*]
                           # So the ShowListThreshold
                           # command also applies to [kcd]
       StartDir = "/"
       [*]
       SkipDir = "~/.*"    # Add SkipDir command to [*]
                           # Does not affect [kcd]
       [hcd]               # Inherit ShowListThreshold
                           # and SkipDir from [*]
       StartDir = "~"
       [ucd]               # Inherit ShowListThreshold
                           # and SkipDir from [*]
       StartDir = "/home"


       Note: Profile may not work on some shells such as ash.  bash and tcsh
       work fine.


COMMON ERROR MESSAGES
   Shell message reporting that it cannot find a particular file or directory
       (the actual message depends on the shell used).
       For example, bash displays `bash: dirname: No such file or directory'

       Cause: kcd attempts to change to a directory that no longer exists.

       Solution:
              Rescan directory.


   `kcd: cannot find a link containing the string ...'
       Cause: kcd cannot find any directory matching specified string given in
              the command line.  This may due to:

              1. There may be some typos in directory name given.
              Solution: Retype the correct name.

              2. The desired directory is created after the last directory
              scan.
              Solution: Rescan directory.

              3. kcd has been configured to skip it.
              Solution: Change directory manually by the `cd' command or
              modify the configuration file (See the previous section).



   `kcd: your ncurses library is bad. Refer to kcd README file for solution'
       Cause:

       1. ncurses library (libncurses.a or libncurses.so.X.X.X) in /usr/lib)
       and header file (/usr/include/curses.h) do not match.

       2. The library is built based using a different configuration, compiler
       or library that is incompatible with the current installed ones.

       3. The library is built not to support C++ applications.


       Solution:
              Recompile kcd.
