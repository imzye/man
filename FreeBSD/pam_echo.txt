PAM_ECHO(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            PAM_ECHO(8)

NAME
     pam_echo – Echo PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_echo [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     The echo service module for PAM displays its arguments to the user,
     separated by spaces, using the current conversation function.

     If the % character occurs anywhere in the arguments to pam_echo, it is
     assumed to introduce one of the following escape sequences:

     %H    The name of the host on which the client runs (PAM_RHOST).

     %s    The current service name (PAM_SERVICE).

     %t    The name of the controlling tty (PAM_TTY).

     %U    The applicant's user name (PAM_RUSER).

     %u    The target account's user name (PAM_USER).

     Any other two-character sequence beginning with % expands to the
     character following the % character.
