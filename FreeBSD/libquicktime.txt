NAME
       lqtplay - simple quicktime movie player for X11.

SYNOPSIS
       lqtplay [ options ] file

DESCRIPTION
       lqtplay just plays the given quicktime movie in a window on your X11
       display.  Sound is played using a OSS dsp device or Alsa (if
       available).  Some info about the movie and some other stuff is printed
       on stderr.  No fancy GUI.  The only interactive element is that you can
       resize the window, and lqtplay will adapt the video size if support for
       hardware-scaled video is available.

       lqtplay comes with libquicktime and uses libquicktime to read and
       decode the movies.  It is a sample application and intentionally kept
       simple.  If you want a full-featured media player, have a look at
       gstreamer.

OPTIONS
       -noxv  Don't use the Xvideo extension for accelerated video playback
              (YUV->RGB color space conversion + video scaling in hardware).

       -nogl  Don't use OpenGL (via GLX extension) for video scaling.  By
              default lqtplay tries to use 3D textures to scale RGB frames in
              hardware if DRI is available.

       -noalsa
              Don't use Alsa for audio output.  By default lqtplay uses Alsa
              if it was available at compile time.

       The usual toolkit options (like -geometry) are accepted too.
