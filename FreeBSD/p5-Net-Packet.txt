NAME
       Net::Packet - a framework to easily send and receive frames from layer
       2 to layer 7

SYNOPSIS
          # Load all modules, it also initializes a Net::Packet::Env object,
          # and imports all utility subs and constants in current namespace
          # WARNING: this is not the prefered way to use Net::Packet
          use Net::Packet;

          # Build IPv4 header
          my $ip = Net::Packet::IPv4->new(dst => '192.168.0.1');

          # Build TCP header
          my $tcp = Net::Packet::TCP->new(dst => 22);

          # Assamble frame, it will also open a Net::Packet::DescL3 descriptor
          # and a Net::Packet::Dump object
          my $frame = Net::Packet::Frame->new(l3 => $ip, l4 => $tcp);

          $frame->send;

          # Print the reply just when it has been received
          until ($Env->dump->timeout) {
             if ($frame->recv) {
                print $frame->reply->l3, "\n";
                print $frame->reply->l4, "\n";
                last;
             }
          }

          # Alternative way of using Net::Packet, which is the recommanded way
          # First thing to do, get a default Env object. It will contain all
          # information regarding your default interface setup and some
          # specific options regarding Net::Packet framework behaviour
          use Net::Packet::Env qw($Env);

          # Then, load modules you need to accomplish your work
          require Net::Packet::DescL3;
          require Net::Packet::Dump;
          require Net::Packet::Frame;
          require Net::Packet::IPv4;
          require Net::Packet::TCP;

          # We manually create Desc and Dump objects to have complete control
          # on Net::Packet framework behaviour
          my $desc = Net::Packet::DescL3->new(
             target => '192.168.0.1',
          );

          my $dump = Net::Packet::Dump->new(
             filter        => 'tcp',
             keepTimestamp => 1,
          );
          $dump->start;

          # Build IPv4 header
          my $ip = Net::Packet::IPv4->new(dst => '192.168.0.1');

          # Build TCP header
          my $tcp = Net::Packet::TCP->new(dst => 22);

          # Assamble frame. Because we have created Desc and Dump objects,
          # they will not be automatically created here
          my $frame = Net::Packet::Frame->new(l3 => $ip, l4 => $tcp);
          $frame->send;

          until ($dump->timeout) {
             if ($frame->recv) {
                print $frame->reply->l3, "\n";
                print $frame->reply->l4, "\n";
                last;
             }
          }

          $dump->stop;
          $dump->clean;

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a unified framework to craft, send and receive packets
       at layers 2, 3, 4 and 7.

       Basically, you forge each layer of a frame (Net::Packet::IPv4 for layer
       3, Net::Packet::TCP for layer 4; for example), and pack all of this
       into a Net::Packet::Frame object. Then, you can send the frame to the
       network, and receive its response easily, because the response is
       automatically searched for and matched against the request (not
       implemented for all layers).

       If you want some layer 2, 3 or 4 protocol encoding/decoding to be
       added, just ask, and give a corresponding .pcap file ;). You can also
       subscribe to netpacket-users@gomor.org by sumply sending an e-mail
       requesting for it.

       You should study various pod found in all classes, example files found
       in examples directory that come with this tarball, and also tests in t
       directory.
