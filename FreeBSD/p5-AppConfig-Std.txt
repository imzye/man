NAME
       AppConfig::Std - subclass of AppConfig that provides standard options

SYNOPSIS
           use AppConfig::Std;

           $config = AppConfig::Std->new();

           # all AppConfig methods supported
           $config->define('foo');            # define variable foo
           $config->set('foo', 25);           # setting a variable
           $val = $config->get('foo');        # getting variable
           $val = $config->foo();             # shorthand for getting

           $config->args(\@ARGV);             # parse command-line
           $config->file(".myconfigrc")       # read config file

DESCRIPTION
       AppConfig::Std is a Perl module that provides a set of standard
       configuration variables and command-line switches.  It is implemented
       as a subclass of AppConfig; AppConfig provides a general mechanism for
       handling global configuration variables.

       The features provided by AppConfig::Std are:

       •   Standard command-line arguments: -help, -doc, -version, -verbose,
           and -debug. AppConfig::Std handles the -help, -doc, and -version
           switches for you, so you don't need to duplicate that code in all
           of your scripts.  These are described below.

       •   The ARGCOUNT default is set to 1. This means that by default all
           switches are expected to take a value. To change this, set the
           ARGCOUNT parameter when defining the variable:

               $config->define('verbose', { ARGCOUNT => 0 } );

       Please read the copious documentation for AppConfig to find out what
       else you can do with this module.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       The module adds five standard configuration variables and command-line
       switches. You can define additional variables as you would with
       AppConfig.

   HELP
       The -help switch will result in a short help message.  This is
       generated using Pod::Usage, which displays the OPTIONS section of your
       pod. The script will exit with an exit value of 0.

   DOC
       The -doc switch will result in the entire documentation being formatted
       to the screen.  This is also done with Pod::Usage.  The script will
       exit with an exit value of 0.

   VERSION
       The -version switch will display the version of the invoking script.
       This assumes that you have defined $VERSION in your script with
       something like the following:

           use vars qw( $VERSION );
           $VERSION = sprintf("%d.%02d", q$Revision: 1.7 $ =~ /(\d+)\.(\d+)/);

       The script will exit with an exit value of 0.

   DEBUG
       The -debug switch just sets the debug variable.  This is useful for
       displaying information in debug mode:

           $foobar->dump() if $config->debug;

   VERBOSE
       The -verbose switch just sets the verbose variable.  This is useful for
       displaying verbose information as a script runs:

           print STDERR "Running foobar\n" if $config->verbose;

TODO
       Please let me know if you have ideas for additional switches, or other
       modifications. Things currently being mulled:

       •   Support brief switches, such as -h as well as -help.  This could be
           a config option for the constructor.

       •   Include a sample script called mkscript, which would create a
           template script along with Makefile.PL, MANIFEST, etc.  Kinda of a
           h2xs for scripts.

EXAMPLE
       The following is the outline of a simple script that illustrates use of
       the AppConfig::Std module:

           #!/usr/bin/perl -w
           use strict;
           use AppConfig::Std;

           use vars qw( $VERSION );
           $VERSION = '1.0';

           my $config = AppConfig::Std->new();

           # parse command-line and handle std switches
           $config->args(\@ARGV);

           exit 0;

           __END__

           =head1 NAME

           standard pod format documentation

       The pod documentation is expected to have the NAME, SYNOPSIS,
       DESCRIPTION, and OPTIONS sections. See the documentation for "pod2man"
       for more details.
