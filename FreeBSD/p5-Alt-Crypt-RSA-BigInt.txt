Alt::Crypt::RSA::BigInt(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Alt::Crypt::RSA::BigInt - RSA public-key cryptosystem, using
       Math::BigInt

DESCRIPTION
       This is a modification of the Crypt::RSA module to remove all use and
       dependencies on Pari and Math::Pari.

       This first version is intended to be a plug-in replacement for
       Crypt::RSA, with no user-visible changes.  This means some issues will
       remain unresolved until future versions.

       Math::Pari is completely removed.  This includes the two modules:

          - Crypt::Primes   =>   Math::Prime::Util
          - Crypt::Random   =>   Math::Prime::Util

       All operations are now performed using Math::BigInt, and prefer the GMP
       and Pari backends.

PERFORMANCE
       Performance using GMP is 3-10 times faster than Crypt::RSA 1.99.

       Using Math::BigInt::Pari, it is about half the speed at signing, and on
       par when verifying.

       If neither GMP nor Pari are available, performance is very slow, from
       10x to 200x slower.  However this is an environment where the original
       code could not run.
