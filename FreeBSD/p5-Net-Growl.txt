NAME
       Net::Growl - Growl Notifications over the network.

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Growl;
        register(host => 'thegrowlhost',
                 application=>"My App",
                 password=>'Really Secure', )  if ! $ALREADY_REGISTERED;
        notify(
               application=>"My App",
               title=>'warning',
               description=>'some text',
               priority=>2,
               sticky=>'True',
               password=>'Really Secure',
        );

DESCRIPTION
       A simple interface to send Mac OS X Growl notifications across the
       network.  Growl only needs to be installed on the receiving Mac not on
       the machine using this module.

       To use register your app using 'register', send using 'notify' - it
       that easy.

INTERFACE
   register
        Usage: register(host=>'thegrowlhost', application=>"My App", password=>'Really Secure') ;
        Description:  Registers the application and all the possible kinds of notifications it sends.

   notify
        Usage: notify(application=>"My App", title=>'warning', description=>'some text',
                      priority=>2,  sticky=>'True', password=>'Really Secure',);
        Description: Actual configures and sends a notification.

DIAGNOSTICS
   General Debugging:
       Go to System Preferences -> Growl -> General  and 'enable logging'  and
       open Console.app.  Messages are logged - and debugging is much easier.

   Internal OO API only:
       If no notifications are received, and Growl crashes, and you are not
       using a password -- you've hit a known bug.  Use a password! This is a
       network app and open to abuse. Also this is the only known workaround.
       The module will not work without passwords enabled.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       You must enable network notifications, and set a password in the Growl
       preference panel of System Preferences, on the mac recieving the
       notifications.

DEPENDENCIES
       Growl (http://growl.info) on the computer receiving the notifications
       (not necessarily on computer sending the notifications).

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       Does not work with Growl version previous to 0.6 as network support was
       not available.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       This module currently REQUIRES that you use a password, for network
       notification. This is not true of the Growl Framework. This should be
       fixed in a future release.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to
       "bug-net-growl@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
       <http://rt.cpan.org>.
