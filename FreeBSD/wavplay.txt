NAME
       wavplay, wavrec - play and record WAV files

SYNOPSIS
       wavplay [-h,--help] [-q] [-s rate] [-S] [-M] [-b bits] [-i] [-k
       ipc-key] [-R] [-l] [-u] [-L] [-U] [-V,--version] [input-files]

       wavrec [-h,--help] [-q] [-s rate] [-S] [-M] [-b bits] [-t secs] [-k
       ipc-key] [-R] [-l] [-u] [-L] [-U] [-V,--version] [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       wavplay plays a WAV format file to the audio device (by default
       /dev/dsp ) reading WAV parameters from the input file header.
       (Command-line options will override these defaults, if you know better
       or for special effects.)

       wavrec samples the audio device and writes a WAV file.  Command-line
       options provide complete control over the resolution and duration of
       sampling.

       Both wavplay and wavrec allow the audio device to be locked for
       exclusive access.

       -s rate

       -k key specify the IPC key for device-locking semaphores.  The default
              is 0x33333333.

AUTHOR
       wavplay was almost totally rewritten for version 1.0 by Warren W.  Gay
       (ve3wwg@gmail.com) replacing earlier code by Andre Fuechsel
       (af1@irz.inf.tu-dresden.de).  Erik de Castro Lopo (erikd@zip.com.au)
       wrote the WAV header I/O routines.  This manual page was written by
       Stephen Crane (jsc@cs.city.ac.uk).
