NAME
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::Authen::Passphrase - Inflate/deflate
       columns to Authen::Passphrase instances

SYNOPSIS
           __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw(InflateColumn::Authen::Passphrase));

           __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
               id => {
                   data_type         => 'integer',
                   is_auto_increment => 1,
               },
               passphrase_rfc2307 => {
                   data_type          => 'text',
                   inflate_passphrase => 'rfc2307',
               },
               passphrase_crypt => {
                   data_type          => 'text',
                   inflate_passphrase => 'crypt',
               },
           );

           __PACKAGE__->set_primary_key('id');


           # in application code
           $rs->create({ passphrase_rfc2307 => Authen::Passphrase::RejectAll->new });

           my $row = $rs->find({ id => $id });
           if ($row->passphrase_rfc2307->match($input)) { ...

DESCRIPTION
       Provides inflation and deflation for Authen::Passphrase instances from
       and to either RFC 2307 or crypt encoding.

       To enable both inflating and deflating, "inflate_passphrase" must be
       set to a valid passhrase encoding. Currently the only supported
       encodings are "rfc2307" and "crypt". The specified encoding will be
       used both when storing "Authen::Passphrase" instances in columns, and
       when creating "Authen::Passphrase" instances from columns. See
       Authen::Passphrase for details on passphrase encodings.

       Note that not all passphrase schemes supported by "Authen::Passphrase"
       can be represented in either RFC 2307 or crypt encoding. Chose the kind
       of passphrase encoding you're using based on the encoding the
       passphrase algorithms you're using support.

       When trying to encode a passphrase instance with an encoding that
       doesn't support it, an exception will be thrown. Similarly, when trying
       to load a passphrase instance from a faulty or unknown encoded
       representation, an exception will be thrown.

METHODS
   register_column
       Chains with the "register_column" method in "DBIx::Class::Row", and
       sets up passphrase columns appropriately. This would not normally be
       directly called by end users.
