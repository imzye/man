UMS(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 UMS(4)

NAME
     ums – USB mouse driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ums
           device hid
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ums_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ums driver provides support for mice that attach to the USB port.
     Supported are mice with any number of buttons and mice with a wheel.

     The /dev/ums0 device presents the mouse as a sysmouse or mousesystems
     type device.  See moused(8) for an explanation of these mouse types.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     hw.usb.ums.debug
             Debug output level, where 0 is debugging disabled and larger
             values increase debug message verbosity.  Default is 0.

FILES
     /dev/ums0  blocking device node

EXAMPLES
     Use the first USB mouse on the system as your console mouse:

           moused -p /dev/ums0 -t auto

     To be able to use the USB mouse under X, change the "Pointer" section in
     xorg.conf to the following:

           Device /dev/ums0
           Protocol Auto

     If you want to be able to use the mouse in both virtual consoles as well
     as in X change it to:

           Device /dev/sysmouse
           Protocol Auto
