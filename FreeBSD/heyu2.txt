NAME
       Heyu - a control program for the  X-10 CM11A serial interface

USAGE
       heyu [options] command [parameter(s)]

       Run ´heyu help´ for a description of the Heyu options and commands
       available in the current version.


DESCRIPTION
       Heyu is a program for controlling an X-10 CM11A 2-Way Computer
       Interface.  This is the control device manufactured by X-10 (USA) Inc.
       and found in their ActiveHome(TM) CK11A kit.  Equivalent (rebranded)
       devices have been sold as the IBM HD11A Home Director and the RCA
       HC60CRX Home Control Interface.  220 Volt versions of the CM11A are
       sold in Europe as variously named CM11x models (depending on AC plug
       style) and in the UK as the CM12U.

       The CM11A can remotely control lights and appliances in your house by
       signaling over the AC house wiring.  It can store lists of X10 signals
       and send them at scheduled times.  It can respond to some X10 signals
       by sending out other X10 signals.  With Heyu, it can respond to X10
       signals by executing an arbitrary command or script selected by the
       user.

       Limited support is provided for the IBM HD16A, an earlier version of
       the Home Director without clock or battery backup and known as the
       CM10A - see special CM10A configuration instructions in the TTY
       directive section of man page x10config(5).

       Heyu supports an auxiliary input device on a second serial port for X10
       RF signals.  Supported devices are the WGL W800RF32A, the X-10 MR26A,
       and the RFXCOM X10 RF Receivers. A network version of the RFXCOM
       receiver, RFXLAN, is also supported.

       The W800RF32A is manufactured by WGL & Associates
       (http://www.wgldesigns.com).  It is available in both a 310 MHz version
       for operation in the USA and Canada and a 433.92 MHz version
       (W800RF32AE) for European and other countries.  It can receive signals
       from standard, entertainment, and security X10 transmitters.

       The X-10 MR26A is usually bundled with a univeral remote in a package
       by X-10 but is also available individually.  It can receive standard
       and entertainment X10 signals but not security X10 signals.

       The RFXCOM X10 receiver is supported in W800RF32 emulation mode and has
       the same capabilities.  It is a USB device but has a built-in FTDI USB-
       to-Serial converter and communication with it is the same as with a
       serial port (assuming your OS supports the FTDI chipset, as does
       Linux).

       Heyu also supports the X-10 CM17A "Firecracker", a small serial dongle
       which can transmit X10 commands via RF signals to a transceiver plugged
       into the power line.  The CM17A and CM11A coexist on the same serial
       port - no additional serial port is required.
       As far as can be determined there is no version of the CM17A which
       transmits at an RF frequency other than the 310 MHz used for X10
       transceivers in North America.  A compile option is provided to compile
       Heyu without CM17A support for users outside North America or those who
       simply have no interest in this device. (See the file "INSTALL"
       included in the Heyu distribution directory.)

       Heyu depends on a configuration file to tell it on what serial port the
       CM11A is connected and to provide it with various other user options.
       Heyu will not run without the configuration file.  See x10config(5) for
       more information.  The standard pathnames Heyu assumes for this file
       are either $HOME/.heyu/x10config or /etc/heyu/x10.conf, in that order,
       but the user can specify a non-standard pathname at the command line or
       with an environment variable.  (Operating systems other than Linux may
       store the configuration file in a different directory by default.)  The
       directory where Heyu finds the configuration file is Heyu´s "base"
       directory.  Heyu requires that this directory be writable.

       The CM11A connects to a computer via an RS232 serial port (or a USB-to-
       Serial adapter for newer systems without an RS232 serial port).  It can
       store about 128 events;  each event can turn on, turn off, or dim one
       or more X10 modules.  The CM11A box has a battery backed clock which
       the computer can read.  The data is stored in an EEPROM.

       You could just put a bunch of Heyu commands in your crontab, but this
       doesn´t work if your system is down for backups, or has crashed, or if
       someone´s tripped over the RS232 cable and unplugged it, and it
       clutters up the crontab.  For most users, it´s much easier to upload a
       schedule of events into the CM11A´s EEPROM.

       Special note: If you have chosen to locate the Heyu configuration file
       under your home directory and then run Heyu commands in crontab, Heyu
       won´t be able to automatically find the configuration file since it
       will be running as user 'root'.  In this situation, specify the full
       path to the configuration file with either the '-c' Heyu command line
       switch or with the environment variable X10CONFIG.
       Also, specify the full Heyu executable pathspec, e.g.,
       /usr/local/bin/heyu, if your crontab path does not include the
       directory where the Heyu executable is located.

       The timers and macros to be uploaded the the CM11A´s EEPROM are stored
       in a file.  The default is $HOME/.heyu/x10.sched or
       /etc/heyu/x10.sched.  See x10sched(5) for the layout of the file.

       X10 modules are identified by a one-letter housecode ranging from A to
       P (for 16 different codes) and a number from 1 to 16, for a total of
       256 possible unit codes. The character ´*´ is interpreted to mean all
       units 1-16 (but must be escaped if entered on the command line).

       Heyu spawns a relay daemon that gathers the CM11A output for any
       process that wants it.  This allows running the monitor while sending
       on/off commands.  Just as important is that it also catches power fail
       messages and responds to them immediately.

       As of version 2, a state engine daemon may optionally be started which
       will maintain a record of the state of each module on the system, and
       which has the capability of executing scripts.

       Heyu supports multiple CM11A units connected to different serial ports
       on the same computer.  The configuration files for each CM11A must be
       stored in different directories - it´s usually most convenient to store
       them in subdirectories /0 through /9 of the normal locations.  Each
       CM11A operates independently of the others (except for communication
       via the house wiring) and has its own set of associated files.


OPTIONS
       -v   Enable verbose mode

       -c  <pathname>  Specify full configuration file pathname

       -s  <pathname>  Specify full schedule file pathname

       -0 ... -9  Look for config file in subdirectory /0 ... /9 of standard
       location, e.g., $HOME/.heyu/3/x10config


COMMANDS
       Heyu´s commands are divided into Administrative, State, Direct, and
       CM17A "Firecracker" commands.

       Administrative commands generally control some feature of the CM11A or
       display information from the CM11A, or display information about Heyu
       or about the user´s configuration.

       State commands return in various formats information about the state of
       modules on the user´s system which has already been stored in the
       tables maintained by Heyu Engine.  They don´t attempt to update these
       tables.  They are primarily intended to be called by scripts.  Note
       however that scripts launched by the Heyu state engine (excluding
       heyuhelper) are passed an environment which already contains most all
       the state information.  Any of the state commands require that the Heyu
       state engine daemon (heyu_engine) be running.

       Direct commands are used to transmit specific module control
       instructions out over the AC power line through the CM11A interface.

       CM17A "Firecracker" commands transmit X10 RF signals if there is a
       CM17A device connected to the serial port.


ADMINISTRATIVE COMMANDS
       date   Gets current date and time from the CM11A clock/calendar and
              displays it in a form suitable for feeding to date(1) as input.

       erase  Erases the CM11A´s EEPROM.  All events, macros, etc  are
              permanently gone.

       info   Displays the current setting of CM11A´s clock, base housecode,
              battery timer, and monitored housecode registers.  It also
              displays the status of the uploaded timer schedule, if any.

       help   Displays a list of the commands that are available.  If executed
              with the name of a command as a parameter, it will display the
              the syntax for that command only.  If executed with the
              parameter ´admin´, ´state´, ´direct´, ´cm17a´, ´shutter´,
              ´rfxsensor´, or ´rfxmeter´ it will display only the commands of
              that type.


       syn    Displays built-in synonyms for many of the common direct
              commands.

       <scene_label>
              Executes a scene or user-defined synonym (usersyn) from the
              user´s configuration file.

       show   Display various information from the user´s configuration file
              or about the state of the system. Run ´heyu show´ with no other
              parameters to see the options available in the current release.

       upload By itself (heyu upload), the upload command reads timers,
              triggers, and macros from the user´s schedule file, processes it
              and creates a binary memory image, and uploads this image into
              the CM11A´s EEPROM.

              Upon successful completion, the following files are written to
              the hard drive in Heyu´s base directory.

              x10record   -  Heyu´s memory of the mode and time of the most
              recent uploaded schedule.  (This _must_ remain intact for Heyu
              to know how to reset the CM11A clock when required.)

              x10macroxref - A listing of the EEPROM addresses of uploaded
              macros for use by Heyu´s state engine and monitor.

              x10image    -  The 1024 byte binary image of the EEPROM.  It´s
              also used by Heyu´s state engine and monitor

              report.txt  -  The full details of Heyu´s processing of data
              uploaded to the EEPROM.

              If there are errors in the schedule file, the load will abort
              without changing anything.

              The upload command with the check option (heyu upload check)
              will check the config file and report any errors.  The only file
              written to the hard drive is the same ´report.txt´ mentioned
              above. (A configuration file directive can be used to force
              writing the other files with a ".check" extension.)

              The upload command with the croncheck option (heyu upload
              croncheck) is only applicable when Heyu is configured to operate
              in HEYU mode (see x10config(5) for a description of the MODE
              directive).  It repeats the data processing Heyu would do if
              ´heyu upload check´ were executed daily for the next 366 days
              and writes a file ´cronreport.txt´ to the hard drive with a
              daily summary.  (Its purpose is to prevent unpleasant surprises
              if 'heyu upload' is to be executed automatically as a cron job.)

              The upload command with the status option (heyu upload status)
              or the cronstatus option (heyu upload cronstatus) reports the
              number of days before the currently uploaded schedule will
              expire. These options are useful primarily when Heyu is
              configured to operate in HEYU mode, where the period of validity
              of the schedule is variable at the user´s option.  The
              difference between the two, i.e., status and cronstatus, is that
              ´status´ displays a human-readable message whereas ´cronstatus´
              displays only the number of days (or an error code) for
              convenient parsing in a cron script.  The codes are:

                >= 0  Number of days until expiration (0 = Today is last day)
                  -1  SCHEDULE_EXPIRED  (Schedule must be reloaded)
                  -2  NO_EXPIRATION     (Schedule contains no timers)
                  -3  NO_RECORD_FILE    (No schedule has been uploaded)
                  -4  BAD_RECORD_FILE   (File x10record is corrupted.)

       catchup
              Reads the EEPROM image binary file x10image saved when a
              schedule is uploaded and immediately executes in chronological
              order the commands in the macros for each timed event scheduled
              for today´s date, beginning at 00:00 hours and continuing up
              until the current system time.

       trigger
              An uploaded macro can only be executed by an uploaded timer or
              if triggered by a powerline command.  The 'heyu trigger Hu
              on|off' command emulates a powerline trigger by looking up the
              trigger condition and macro commands in the x10image and
              x10macroxref files saved by Heyu when a schedule is uploaded.
              It then executes them as direct commands.  Macro delays are
              ignored.

       macro  Using the x10macroxref and x10image files saved when a schedule
              is uploaded, ´heyu macro <label>´ looks up the commands
              comprising the macro with the argument label and immediately
              executes them as direct commands.  Macro delays are ignored.

       monitor
              When executed in a separate terminal window, all X10 events sent
              and received by the CM11A interface will be displayed in this
              window.  The output goes to stdout and may be redirected to a
              file (however the log file generated by the Heyu state engine
              process contains the same information, and more).  The events
              are time-stamped and identified as to their source with the
              following codes:
              sndc  - Sent from the Heyu command line.
              snda  - Transceived from RF by the heyu_aux daemon.
              snds  - Sent by Heyu from within a script. (*)
              sndp  - Sent by Heyu from within a power-fail script. (*)
              sndm  - Sent by an uploaded macro when initiated by a Timer.
              sndt  - Sent by an uploaded macro when initiated by a Trigger.
              rcvi  - Received over the AC power line.
              rcvt  - A Trigger signal which initiated an uploaded macro.
              rcva  - RF signals received from the heyu_aux daemon.

              (*) When that script is launched by the Heyu state engine
              daemon.

       start  Starts the Heyu relay daemon and other configured daemons, i.e.,
              it will also start the Heyu Engine daemon if the directive
              ´START_ENGINE AUTO´ appears in the configuration file and will
              start the Heyu Auxilliary daemon if the ´TTY_AUX ...´ directive
              appears in the configuration file.

       restart
              Directs all running Heyu background processes - heyu_relay,
              heyu_engine, heyu_aux - plus Heyu monitors, to re-read the
              configuration file and incorporate any changes since these
              processes were started.

       stop   Kills the heyu_relay daemon that gathers input from the tty
              port.  This will also cause heyu_engine, heyu_aux, and any
              monitors to stop.  It can only kill the processes that you have
              permissions to stop.

       engine Starts the Heyu state engine daemon, heyu_engine, a background
              process which maintains a record of the state of each module
              based on X10 signals sent or received, and which can launch
              scripts based on these signals.  If so enabled in the
              configuration file, its output, similar to that of the monitor,
              is written to a log file.
              This command will not be needed if the directive "START_ENGINE
              AUTO" is included in the configuration file and Heyu's
              background processes are initiated by running ´heyu start´.

              Whenever changes are made to the configuration file, the engine
              must be restarted for the changes to be incorporated.  (Run
              ´heyu restart´ to restart it.)

              Warning: The record of module states maintained by the state
              engine can be in disagreement with reality for any number of
              reasons and should never be relied on for critical applications.

       aux    Starts the auxiliary daemon heyu_aux, a background process which
              allows X10 commands to be input to Heyu via RF signals from a
              W800RF32A, MR26A, or RFXCOM serial receiver, or from an RFXLAN
              network receiver.  The serial port to which the receiver is
              connected, or the network address in case of RFXLAN, and the
              receiver device type must be specified in the configuration file
              with the TTY_AUX directive.

              This command will not be needed if Heyu's background processes
              are initiated with the ´heyu start´ command.

       script_ctrl
              Globally disables (´heyu script_ctrl disable´) or enables (´heyu
              script_ctrl enable´) launching of scripts by Heyu.  This command
              overrides the configuration directive SCRIPT_CTRL (or its
              default value of ENABLE).

       initstate
              If no housecode is specified, initializes the entire X10 state
              table to zero.  With a housecode (heyu initstate H), initializes
              the state table to zero for just that housecode.

       initothers
              Initialize the cumulative received address state table to zero.

       reset  The default action for reset is to clear the registers in the
              the CM11A and to set it to the default housecode defined in the
              configuration file.  The CM11A will then track state changes for
              that housecode in its internal registers.  If a housecode is
              specified as an argument, the CM11A will be set to track state
              changes on that housecode instead.  Note that the state recorded
              in the CM11A internal registers is completely independent of the
              all-housecode states tracked by the Heyu state engine.

       setclock
              Reads the system clock and loads it into the CM11A.  This is
              adjusted for local daylight savings time and for the mode of an
              uploaded schedule, if any.  As of Heyu version 2, the CM11A
              clock is maintained on local Standard Time throughout the year.

       readclock
              Displays the date and time for the CM11A and system clocks.  The
              raw data from the CM11A clock is adjusted for local daylight
              savings time and for the mode of an uploaded schedule, if any.

              Resets the CM11A battery timer to zero.

       purge  Cancel any pending delayed macros, i.e., delayed macros which
              have been called by a timer or trigger but have not yet been
              executed.

       clear  Clear the CM11A unit status registers for the monitored
              housecode.

       utility
              Several infrequently-used options are available:

              ´heyu utility syscheck´ displays clock/calendar/timezone
              information obtained from the system by Heyu.  Use this to make
              sure that your system´s time configuration is what you think it
              ought to be.

              ´heyu utility dawndusk´ displays the times of Dawn and Dusk for
              today.

              ´heyu utility suntable [-r|-c|-n|-a|-o [-]nn] [-s] [-w] [yyyy]´
              writes a file to the hard drive containing a daily table of Dawn
              and Dusk as computed by Heyu for your Longitude, Latitude, and
              Timezone, for the current year or for year yyyy. By default,
              Dawn and Dusk are as defined by the DAWNDUSK_DEF directive in
              your configuration file, times displayed are Civil (i.e., wall-
              clock) times, and the table is 80 columns wide.
              Switches -r, -c, -n, -a or -o [-]nn direct Heyu to use the
              definition of Dawn and Dusk as either Sunrise/Sunset, or Civil,
              Nautical or Astronomical Twilight, or a specified position of
              the Sun centre in angle minutes below the horizon (actually
              above the horizon if -nn), respectively, overriding the
              definition of Dawn and Dusk from your configuration file.
              Switch -s displays times as Standard Time throughout the year
              instead of Civil Time.
              Switch -w writes the table in wide (135 column) format instead
              of the default 80 columns.  (Printing this table on US Letter or
              A4 size paper requires landscape orientation and an 8-point
              fixed font.)

              ´heyu utility calibrate´ provides the timing loop calibration
              needed for CM17A Firecracker "fast" commands and some
              experimental commands.

              ´heyu utility masks´ displays the numerical value of the mask
              environment variables for Heyu and Xtend environments.  (For use
              with ´heyu heyu_state´, ´heyu heyu_rawstate´, and ´heyu
              xtend_state´.)

       logmsg Writes its quoted-text argument (max length 80 characters) as a
              time-stamped entry in the Heyu logfile and on the monitor
              screen.  (There´s no checking to see whether either the engine
              or monitor is actually running.)  This is primarily intended for
              making occasional notes while testing and may or may not play
              well if executed in the midst of X10 power line activity.  It
              will also increase the size of the spool file by a few bytes
              more than the length of the text, so should be used sparingly.
              Example:
                heyu logmsg "Awaiting signals from my new wall switch and
              transceiver."

       cm10a_init
              Manually re-initialize a CM10A interface provided Heyu has been
              configured for a CM10A instead of a CM11A.  Note that when thus
              configured, the Heyu relay should handle this automatically
              after a power interruption.

       wait   Wait until execution of an uploaded macro has completed before
              returning.  This is primarily intended for use when a script or
              shell command is launched by an X10 command executed within an
              uploaded macro, i.e., with launch source SNDM or SNDT, when it´s
              important to be certain that the execution of the macro has been
              completed.  If the timeout parameter is omitted, the default
              timeout is 30 seconds.  This command operates by repeatedly
              pinging the CM11A once a second until it echoes back the ping
              character.

       restore_groups
              Primarily intended for use following an interruption of AC
              power, this command sends the X10 signals to all modules defined
              as supporting extended code groups to restore the group
              assignments and xconfig mode to the settings preserved in the
              X10 state file.  (Run ´heyu show groups H´ to display the group
              settings.)

       logtail
              Calls the system ´tail´ command to display the last N lines of
              the Heyu log file.  If parameter N is omitted, the default for
              the system tail command, typically 10 lines, is displayed.  The
              directory where the log file is maintained must have been
              specified with the LOG_DIR directive in the Heyu configuration
              file.

       launch Launches a script defined by a SCRIPT directive provided a
              restricted subset of the launch conditions are satisfied.  For
              all scripts, the sources, keywords, and flags other than global
              flags are disregarded in the launch conditions.

              For a Normal script, function tokens on, off, dim, and changed
              are interpreted as representing the on/off/dim/changed state of
              the specified module addresses rather than signals.  All other
              function tokens are disregarded.  The launch condition is
              satisfied if any one of the state comparisons is TRUE and all
              the global flags are TRUE.
              For an Address script the launch conditions are satisfied when a
              module is in the addressed state and the global flags are true.

              The syntax is:
                 heyu launch [-e] [-L<n>] <script_label>
              For a Normal or Address script, the -e switch instructs Heyu to
              ignore the functions and addresses and test only the global
              flags in the launch conditions, as if it were an -exec script.

              Each set of launch conditions for a script is tested in the same
              order as for a script launched by an X10 signal.  For a script
              with multiple launchers, the testing can be confined to a single
              launcher by providing the launcher number <n> with the -L<n>
              switch.  Launcher numbers start at 0 for each script and are
              displayed in square "[]" brackets following the script label in
              ´heyu show launchers´ command when there is more than one. (If
              there is only one set of launch conditions, the launcher number
              will always be 0 and is not displayed.)

              Examples:

              For the directive:
                SCRIPT -l CheckLights A1-16 on notnight nosrc; B1-16 on
              notnight nosrc :: ...
                heyu launch CheckLights
                heyu launch -L1 CheckLights


       version
              Prints the version number and then exits.



STATE COMMANDS
       These commands are primarily intended for external scripts or programs
       to obtain state information from Heyu which has previously been stored
       in the state tables maintained by the Heyu engine.  Scripts and
       programs launched by the Heyu engine already have access to complete
       state information via the environment variables passed to them.  For a
       more human-readable display, use the ´heyu show housemap [H]´ command.


       These commands will display the various states of a module.  The
       parameter is a single-unit housecode|unit string ´Hu´ or just a
       housecode ´H´.  (An alias is also accepted.)  For the flagstate
       command, the parameter is just the number of the flag (1-N).

       The format for some of the state commands has been changed to the
       following.  See below for the older formats, which are still available.

          enginestate     State engine daemon is running (1) or not running
       (0)
          armedstate      Bitmap: 1 = Armed, 2 = Home, 4 = ArmPending, 8 =
       tamper
          sensorfault     Bitmap: 1 = Low battery, 2 = Inactive, 8 = tamper
          flagstate  n    State of flag n as either 1 (set) or 0 (clear)
          nightstate      State of night flag as 1 (night) or 0 (notnight)
          darkstate       State of dark flag as 1 (dark) or 0 (notdark)
                          (Dark is defined by config directive ISDARK_OFFSET)
          sunstate        Bitmap: 1 = Night, 2 = Dark


       In the following, specifying a housecode|unit (Hu) will display the
       boolean value 1 or 0 representing that Hu is in or not in that state,
       respectively.  Specifying only the Housecode will display a unit bitmap
       (as an integer) of the units which are in that state, with bit 0
       corresponding to unit 1, bit 1 to unit 2, bit 2 to unit 3, etc.
          onstate   H[u]    On state
          offstate   H[u]   Off state (not On)
          dimstate  H[u]    Dim state
          addrstate H[u]    Addressed state
          chgstate  H[u]    Changed state
          fullonstate  H[u]  Fully On state (On and not Dim)
          alertstate H[u]   Alert state
          clearstate H[u]   Clear state
          auxalertstate H[u]   AuxAlert state
          auxclearstate H[u]   AuxClear state
          lobatstate H[u]   Low Battery state for sensors
          validstate H[u]  Function processed state (*)
          activestate H[u]  Active state for sensors
          inactivestate H[u]  Inactive state for sensors
          spendstate H[u]   Status-pending flags (**)
          statusstate H[u]  Deprecated - same as spendstate H[u]


       (*) validstate H[u] indicates that a signal supported by the module
       type at H[u] has been sent or received in the Heyu State Engine since
       Heyu was started.


       (**) When Heyu sends or receives a status or xstatus signal, the Heyu
       State Engine sets a status-pending flag for the addressed unit in its
       state table.  When it receives a StatusOn, StatusOff, or xStatusAck
       return signal from a 2-way module, it resets this flag for the
       addressed unit.
       If the status-pending flag remains set after an expected response time
       (which may be a few seconds), it´s an indication that something is
       wrong - possibly a missed signal, a tripped circuit breaker or GFI, or
       a 2-way module unplugged or simply gone bad.
       Note that most common modules are only 1-way and don´t respond to a
       status request. The state of the status-pending flag is therefore
       meaningless for those modules.  Note also that the status-pending flag
       will NOT be reset for 2-way modules (like many SwitchLinc and LampLinc
       modules) which return a brightness level rather than a
       StatusOn/StatusOff signal.

       The ´sensorfault´ command provides a quick check of sensors defined by
       their module types in an ALIAS directive as being security sensors.
       A displayed value of 0 indicates all security sensors are operating
       normally, otherwise the consolidated bitmap with 1 indicates a low
       battery in one or more sensors, and the bitmap with 2 indicates one or
       more sensors haven´t reported in the elapsed time defined by the
       INACTIVE_TIMEOUT configuration directive.  Run ´heyu show sensors´ for
       a detailed report identifying the individual sensors with problems.


       The old format is available for compatibility by setting the
       configuration directive OLD_STATE_FORMAT to YES.  The commands require
       a housecode|unit parameter Hu and display the output in the heyuhelper
       style.  Example outputs are shown in parentheses for Hu = B8.

          onstate   Hu    State of Hu as either On or Off  (b8On, b8Off)
          dimstate  Hu    State of Hu as Dim, On, or Off  (b8Dim, b8On, b8Off)
          addrstate Hu    Addressed state of Hu  (b8Addr, b8Unaddr)
          chgstate  Hu    Changed state of Hu  (b8Chg, b8Unchg)

       The following command displays the state of all units on housecode H as
       a 16 character ASCII string.  Characters 1-16 represent respectively
       the states of Units 1-16, each as a (lower-case) hexadecimal digit
       0-0xf formed by adding together the state values On = 8, Dimmed = 4,
       Changed = 2, Addressed = 1.
          statestr  H    (8c30000000000000)

       The above example indicates H1 is On, H2 is On and Dimmed, H3 was
       changed to Off by the most recent command on housecode H and remains
       addressed, and H4-16 are all Off and unaddressed.

       The following return the current brightness or native level of module
       Hu as recorded by the Heyu state engine.  (For Hu addresses of X10
       security sensors, the security data byte is returned.)

          dimlevel  Hu    Brighness level of Hu as 0-100%  (50)
          rawlevel  Hu    Native level (0-210, 1-32, or 0-63) of Hu (32)

       The following return respectively the stored brightness level 0-100%
       and stored native level for modules which retain the memory of a
       previous setting, e.g., lamp modules which support the Resume or On-
       Level feature, or shutter controllers which store a limit value.  The
       level returned for modules without a memory feature will be just the
       maximum level for that module type. (For Hu addresses of two-channel
       X10 security sensors configured in dual mode, the security data byte
       for the Aux channel is returned.)

          memlevel  Hu    Stored brightness level of Hu as 0-100%
          rawmemlevel Hu  Stored native level of Hu

          counter N       Value of counter N

       The following return the state bitmap of a module as a decimal integer.
       See x10scripts(5) for the meaning of each bit, which differs for Heyu
       and Xtend bitmaps.  These are the values of the variables provided in
       the script environment as ´X10_Hu´.

          heyu_state  Hu  Heyu script environment state bitmap with dimlevel
       as a percentage of full brightness.
          heyu_rawstate Hu Heyu script environment state bitmap with native
       level (0-210, 1-32, 0-63, 0-15, 0-255).
          heyu_vflagstate Hu  Heyu script environment vFlag state bitmap
          xtend_state Hu  Xtend script environment state bitmap

          rcstemp H  Retrieves the stored value of temperature from an RCS
       compatible thermometer which has previously been stored in the Heyu
       Engine state tables by either an automatic report or resulting from a
       query of the thermometer.

       The following command directs the state engine to write an updated
       state file to the hard drive.

          fetchstate

       This command should be required only if the configuration directive
       AUTOFETCH has been changed to NO, _and_ it´s important to know the
       addressed/unaddressed state of a module.  Here´s why:
       The state engine automatically updates the state file whenever an X10
       function is sent or received, but not when an X10 address is sent or
       received until the X10 function which normally follows.  The state file
       is used only when a state command, e.g., ´onstate´ or ´dimstate´
       command is issued from the command line.  (The environment variables
       supplied by Heyu when a script is launched by the state engine are
       created directly from the engine´s memory record and not the state
       file.)

       Of the state commands, only ´addrstate´, ´heyu_state´, ´xtend_state´
       report the addressed state of a module or modules.  If the
       configuration directive AUTOFETCH retains its default value of YES,
       these commands will automatically call for an update of the state file.
       If AUTOFETCH is changed to NO _and_ an X10 address is sent or received
       without a following X10 function, then it will be necessary to execute
       ´heyu fetchstate´ before the any of the above mentioned state commands
       in order for the reported addressed state to be correct.

       Example: If AUTOFETCH is set to NO and the following sequence of X10
       signals is received:
          address unit 1 : housecode A
          function    On : housecode A
          address unit 2 : housecode A

       Then the command ´heyu addrstate An´ will incorrectly show A1 as
       addressed and A2 as unaddressed unless ´heyu fetchstate´ is run first.

       (The above may be a little confusing but the vast majority of users can
       safely ignore both the ´fetchstate´ command and the AUTOFETCH
       configuration directive.)

       The following state commands retrieve data received from RFXSensors and
       stored in Heyu´s state tables.  See man page x10rfxsensors(5) for
       details.

          rfxtemp Hu  Stored Temperature
          rfxrh Hu    Stored Relative Humidity
          rfxbp Hu    Stored Barometric Pressure
          rfxvs Hu    Stored Supply Voltage
          rfxvad Hu   Stored A/D Voltage
          rfxvadi Hu  Stored internal A/D Voltage
          rfxpot Hu   Stored Potentiometer setting
          rfxtemp2 Hu Stored Second Temperature
          rfxlobat Hu Stored Low Battery status (1 = Low, 0 = Normal)


       The following state commands retrieve data received from RFXMeters and
       stored in Heyu's state tables.  See man page x10rfxmeters(5) for
       details.

          rfxpower Hu  Stored Watt-Hour meter reading.
          rfxpanel [N] Stored total Watt-Hour reading for power panel N
          rfxwater Hu  Stored Water meter reading
          rfxgas   Hu  Stored Gas meter reading
          rfxpulse Hu  Stored Pulse meter reading
          rfxcount Hu  Stored raw counter reading


       The following state commands retrieve data received from the DigiMax
       210 Thermostat.  See man page x10digimax(5) for details.

          dmxtemp     Hu  Stored current temperature (C)
          dmxsetpoint Hu  Stored setpoint temperature (C)
          dmxstatus   Hu  Stored On/Off status (1 = On)
          dmxmode     Hu  Stored Heat/Cool mode (1 = Heat)


       The following state commands retrieve data received from Oregon
       Temperature/Relative Humidity/Barometric Pressure sensors or from Wind
       or Rain sensors.  See man page x10oregon(5) for details.

          oretemp      Hu  Stored temperature reading.
          orerh        Hu  Stored Relative Humidity.
          orebp        Hu  Stored Barometric Pressure.
          orewindavsp  Hu  Stored Wind Average Speed.
          orewindsp    Hu  Stored Wind Instantaneous Speed.
          orewinddir   Hu  Stored Wind Direction angle.
          orerainrate  Hu  Stored Rainfall Rate.
          oreraintot   Hu  Stored Rainfall Total Accumulation.
          elscurr      Hu  Stored Electrisave Current reading.

       The following command allows an external program to store Temp/RH/BP
       data in the state table for a emulation (dummy) Oregon module for
       processing by Heyu, just as if the data were received from an actual
       Oregon sensor.

          heyu ore_emu  Hu  <func>  <value>

       See section "OREGON SENSOR EMULATION" in man page x10oregon(5) for
       details.

       The following command allows an external program to emulate a signal
       from an X10 Security sensor or remote, as if the signal were received
       from an actual device.

          heyu sec_emu  Hu  <func>  <flags>

       where <funct> must be one which is transmitted by the physical security
       sensor or remote mapped to Hu. Like other Heyu function names it must
       be entered in all lower case.
       <func> may be:  alert, clear, sectamper, panic, arm, disarm, test,
       slightson, slightsoff, sdusk, sdawn, akeyon, akeyoff, bkeyon, or
       bkeyoff.

       The <flags> must be specified as they would appear in the
       monitor/logfile when an actual RF transmission is received, although
       they are not case sensitive and can appear in any order after the
       <func>.  There are no defaults, e.g., for a door/window sensor with a
       Min/Max switch, either swmin or swmax must be specified.
       <flags> may be: swmin, swmax, swhome, swaway, main, aux, and lobat as
       supported by the particular sensor.  Do not specify the tamper flag as
       it is handled differently from the other flags.


DIRECT COMMANDS
       Heyu version 2 greatly expands the number of commands which can be
       executed directly from the command line.  All commands which the CM11A
       is capable of sending are now available, although many of them will be
       of little use to the average user.

       Enter ´heyu help´ for a complete up-to-date listing of the commands and
       their syntax.  A number of commands have synonyms which some users may
       find easier to remember.  Enter ´heyu syn´ to see the synonyms for each
       command.
       Although a few commands are different, the command syntax in general is
       as follows:

          heyu  <command>  Housecode|Units  [<data>]

       The usual Housecode|Units address is comprised of a case-insensitive
       housecode letter A through P, followed with no intervening spaces by a
       list of the particular unit codes to be addressed, ranging from 1
       through 16.  Unit code 0 is acceptable (but not necessary) for commands
       which don´t require any unit codes.

       An ´alias´ defined in the configuration file can be used in place of a
       Housecode|Units string.

       For any command, using an underscore (´_´) in place of the housecode
       letter will direct Heyu to substitute the default housecode defined in
       the configuration file.

       The units list may consist of a single unit, multiple units delimited
       by commas, a range of units separated with a ´-´ sign, or a combination
       of the foregoing.

       The following are examples of valid Housecode|Unit addresses:
          A7
          B3,5
          g2,4,6-9,11,14-16

       For commands which apply to all units in a given housecode, the units
       list is omitted, e.g.,

          heyu lightson  B

       (@)  Ignored if the Heyu state engine daemon is not running.

       Additionally, if Heyu has been configured to recognize Extended Code
       Type 0 (Shutter and Shade) commands:

       shopen  HU <level>      Open shutter to level (0-25) and cancel limit
       shopenlim  HU <level>   Open shutter to level (0-25), enforce limit
       shsetlim  HU <level>    Set limit (0-25) and open shutter to limit
       shopenall  H            Open all shutters fully and cancel limit
       shcloseall  H           Close all shutters fully

       (The only module known to support these shutter commands is the 230
       Volt, 50 Hz, Marmitek SW10 Shutter Motor Controller sold in Europe, and
       Marmitek keeps this support a secret.)


       Internal engine precommands.  These work the same as the corresponding
       direct commands without the ´@´ prefix but are used ONLY in the command
       line of a SCRIPT directive.  See the SCRIPT COMMAND LINE section of man

       More details on a few of these commands:

       The ´heyu obdim HU <level>´ command is a compound command equivalent to
       running the scene ´on HU; bright -H 22; dim -H <level>´.  It is
       intended to replace the ´dimb HU <level>´ command when compatibility of
       the new X-10 WS467 Wall Switch (redesigned in 2007) with the original
       WS467 (and other dimmers) is required. (The redesigned WS467 cannot be
       turned on from the Off state by a dim or bright alone.)

       The _turn, _preset, and _status "legacy" commands in earlier versions
       of Heyu have been removed.

       The ´setflag´, ´clrflag´, and ´clrstatus´ commands are not strictly
       speaking direct commands because they send nothing to the CM11A and
       only control software flags in the state engine.  They are included
       with the direct command group so they can be used in scenes and
       usersyns.

       The ´setflag´ and ´clrflag´ parameter may be a single flag number
       between 1 and N, e.g., ´heyu setflag 4´, or a comma delimited list of
       numbers or ranges of numbers, e.g., ´heyu setflag 2,3,5-7´.  If the
       state engine daemon is not running, these commands will be silently
       ignored.

       The ´arm´ command controls the setting of Heyu global security flags
       which can be tested as part of the launch conditions for Heyu scripts.
       These flags are "disarmed", "armed", "notarmed", "armpending", "home"
       and "away".  (The "notarmed" flag is set when either the "disarmed" or
       "armpending" flag is set.)

       The MIN or MAX parameter determines the delay before the system enters
       the Armed state.  With MIN, the "armed" flag is set immediately.  With
       MAX, the "armpending" flag is set until the end of the delay time given
       by the ARM_MAX_DELAY configuration directive, at which time the flag
       will change from "armpending" to "armed".  If neither MIN nor MAX is
       entered the default is MIN.

       When the ´arm´ command is issued at the command line, Heyu will issue a
       warning if any of the configured security door/window or motion sensors
       are in the Alert state, since many of these sensors will retransmit the
       Alert signal at their heartbeat intervals.

       The HOME or AWAY parameter sets the "home" or "away" flag respectively.
       If neither HOME nor AWAY is entered, the default is AWAY.

       When the ´arm´ command is received from an RF Security remote (signal
       source RCVA), the automatic setting of the global security flags as
       described above may be disabled with the config directive "ARM_REMOTE
       MANUAL".  This allows using the command to launch a script to customize
       the arming process, e.g., if doors or windows are open, warn the user
       and don´t arm the system.

       The ´disarm´ command takes no parameters. It sets the "disarmed" flag
       and clears all the other global security flags.

       If the ´hail´ or ´hail_ack´ commands are entered without a housecode,
       Heyu will supply the default housecode from the Heyu configuration
       file, as if an underscore were entered for the housecode letter.

       The Heyu ´turn´ command requires using the underscore to initiate
       replacement with the default housecode.  It supports the functions on,
       off, lightson, lightsoff, allon, alloff, dim, dimb, bright, brightb, or
       any of the synonyms for these functions.
       The ´turn´ command also supports the CM17A commands fon, foff, fdim,
       fbright, flightson, flightsoff, falloff, and the applicable "fast"
       implementations of these commands.

       The Extended Code command ´xconfig´ configures the automatic status
       reporting mode of an X-10 2-way module like the LM14A or AM14A.
       The module can be directed to automatically report its status whenever
       it receives a command which changes its state.  The four modes are: 0 =
       Off; 1 = Report status when an Extended command is received; 2 = Report
       status when a Standard command is received; 3 = Report status when
       either a Standard or Extended command is received.  (Note that the mode
       is stored in volatile memory in the module and will be reset to the
       default mode 0 in the event of a power interruption.)

       The Extended Code module power-up signal ´xpowerup´ is sent by X-10
       2-way modules like the LM14A and AM14A when they are powered up
       following an AC power interruption of at least a few seconds duration.
       This signal is included as a direct and macro command primarily for
       testing purposes - its primary use is in launch conditions for a script
       or shell command to reconfigure the status reporting mode of the
       module.

       The general Extended Code commands ´xfunc´ and ´xfuncw´ require
       entering the extended Type/Function for the desired function between
       the command and the Housecode|Units list.  Both the T/F and Data bytes
       are entered as hexadecimal digits.  Example:

          heyu xfunc 31  M12  20

       (which is equivalent to ´heyu xpreset  M12  32´)

       The Extended Code Group command ´xgrpadd´ allows a module which
       supports extended code (Type 3) functions, like the LM14A, to be
       assigned to up to four groups (0-3), each with an individual preset
       level (0-63).  Then a single ´xgrpexec´ command executed for a group
       will set each member of that group on that housecode to the predefined
       preset level.  The ´xgrprem´ and ´xgrpremall´ command removes either
       individual units or the entire housecode from one or more groups.  The
       ´xgrpstatus´ command polls a (2-way) module for the extended preset
       level for a group stored in the module´s (volatile) memory.
       Examples:

          heyu xgrpadd A1,9 2
       adds modules A1 and A9 to group 2 at their current levels.

          heyu xgrpaddlvl A1,2,4  3  40
       adds modules A1, A2 and A4 to group 3 at extended preset level 40

          heyu xgrpexec A  2
       results in modules A1 and A9 simultaneously going to the levels defined
       for group 2.

          heyu xgrprem  A9  2
       removes A9 from group 2.

          heyu xgrprem  A1  2,3
       removes A1 from groups 2 and 3

          heyu xgrpremall  A  2,3
       removes all modules on housecode A from groups 2 and 3

          heyu xgrpstatus  A1  3
       for 2-way modules will be either acknowledged ("xGrpAck") by A1 with
       the preset level stored for group 3, or negative-acknowledged
       ("xGrpNack") if A1 is not a member of group 3.


       Details of Extended Codes defined by X-10 are found in their document
       xtdcodes.pdf which may be downloaded from their website.  (This
       document replaced their older XTC798.DOC.)

       The (old-style) ´preset´ command has a peculiar coding - the housecode
       is not part of the function byte as it is for all other native X10
       commands.  Since  Heyu´s ´preset_level´, i.e.  preset function-only,
       command does not take a housecode, it is programmed simply as:

          heyu preset_level  <level>

       The ´mpreset´ command implements the very limited CM11A support for
       (old style) ´preset´ commands in uploaded macros.  The allowed preset
       levels are linked with the housecode according to the following table.
          HC     Levels supported
          ---    ----------------
           A      7, 23
           B      8, 24
           C      5, 21
           D      6, 22
           E      9, 25
           F     10, 26
           G     11, 27
           H     12, 28
           I     15, 31
           J     16, 32
           K     13, 29
           L     14, 30
           M      1, 17
           N      2, 18
           O      3, 19
           P      4, 20

       If the ´mpreset´ command is executed from the Heyu command line, the
       levels are restricted to those shown, for consistancy with its support
       in an uploaded macro.

       The ´brightb´ command (brighten after brightening to 100%) is
       essentially useless.  It is implemented as a direct command only
       because it is a valid (although equally useless) command in an uploaded
       macro.  A design goal for Heyu is to have the ability to program any
       command supported by the CM11A, and to have a direct command
       corresponding to each macro command.  (The existance of the brightb
       macro command is probably just a side effect of firmware code shared
       with the dimb command.)

       The ´address´ command sends one or more module addresses to the power
       line with no function code.  It is useful for devices like the various
       SwitchLinc(TM) modules which require a sequence of addresses only, with
       no intervening functions, for programming them.  (There does not appear
       to be any way to have the CM11A send only addresses from an uploaded
       macro in its EEPROM.)  Send individual Housecode|Unit addresses to
       guarantee the order in which they are sent.  Example:

         heyu address F1 B3 B4

       The ´function´ command sends only the function code for its argument
       command, without any module unit addresses.  The housecode is part of
       the function code, so must be specified.
       Example:

         heyu function on A

       The ´kill_all_hc´ command sends an ´alloff´ command to each housecode
       A-P.  Its purpose is to put the user´s home system in a known state,
       with all modules turned off and unaddressed.

       The ´pause´ command is useful in scenes or usersyns when it´s
       desireable to insert a short delay between transmissions of commands
       defined in the scene/usersyn.  Its parameter is decimal seconds and
       fractions, with millisecond precision (although not necessarily
       millisecond accuracy).  It should not be used to insert long delays as
       the serial port write lock prevents other Heyu commands from being
       executed during the pause interval.

       The ´sleep´ command is similar to the ´pause´ command except that the
       serial port write lock is removed during the sleep interval, allowing
       other Heyu commands to be executed during the interval.  This Heyu
       command may be useful for operating systems under which the shell sleep
       command accepts only an integer parameter.

       The ´delay´ and ´rdelay´ commands are similar to ´sleep´ in that the
       port write lock is removed during the interval, but the time is
       expressed in integer minutes 0-240.  The ´delay´ command delays for a
       fixed time.  The ´rdelay´ commands accepts either one or two
       parameters, [MIN] and MAX.  The delay will be a random time no shorter
       than MIN (default 0) and no longer than MAX.

       The ´temp_req´ command requires as an argument the command used by the
       particular model of remote thermostat/thermometer to initiate an RCS-
       compatible temperature report.  It will then convert the encoded reply
       from the thermometer to a temperature and display it on the command
       line. For the TempLinc(TM) Model 1625 remote thermometer, the command
       to initiate the report is the ´status´ command.  For the RCS TX15-B (or
       newer RCS TXB16) Thermostat, the command to initiate the temperature
       report is the ´preset´ command to level 1 at unit 5.  Examples:

       For the TempLinc 1625:
          heyu temp_req status A1

       For the RCS TX15-B:
          heyu temp_req preset A5 1

       An RCS-compatible remote thermometer encodes the temperature in the
       unit code and preset Level of an old-style Preset command according to
       the following formula:
          temperature = -60 + (level - 1) + 32 * (unit - 11)
       (valid for units 11 through 16)

       Whether the temperature scale is Celsius or Fahrenheit is determined by
       how the thermometer is initially programmed.  The same formula is used
       in either case.

       Since the unit code of the thermometer module itself is lost, the only
       way to distinguish between the reports from multiple thermometers is to
       assign each to a different housecode.

       A (fictitious) unit 0 alias, e.g., ´ALIAS Basement B0´, can be defined
       to give a name to the location where the temperature is reported.  If
       the Heyu State Engine is running, the decoded temperature will be
       stored at this address, where it can later be recovered with either the
       ´heyu dimlevel B0´ or ´heyu rawlevel B0´ commands.  Or from within a
       script launched by Heyu, from the value of environment variable X10_B0
       or the environment variable for the alias for this address, e.g.,
       x10_Basement.

       The ´rcs_req´ command functions similarly to the ´temp_req´ command.
       (It is in fact the same command with a different name and either can be
       used interchangeably.)
       Heyu now has built-in support for interpreting the various status
       reports received from a RCS TX15-B or TXB16 thermostat.  The thermostat
       can be directed to transmit these reports with the following commands
       (for a thermostat configured for housecode A):
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 1  (temperature)
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 2  (setpoint temperature)
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 3  (system mode)
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 4  (fan mode)
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 5  (setback mode)
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 6  (setback delta temperature)
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 7  (outdoor temperature)
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 8  (heat setpoint temperature)
          heyu rcs_req preset A5 9  (cooling setpoint temperature)


       Note: the temperature value stored at the unit 0 address location will
       be the one most recently decoded, whether (room) temperature, setpoint
       temperature, setback delta, outdoor, heat setpoint or cooling setpoint.


       See the TX15-B or TXB16 protocol manual for complete details.


       The ´settimer´ command will accept the countdown time parameter as
       either seconds, minutes:seconds, or hours:minutes:seconds.  Minutes and
       seconds aren´t limited to the range 0-59.
       The specified countdown time is decremented at each one-second tick of
       the computer´s clock, so the accuracy of the countdown time is only
       +0/-1 second, depending on when between ticks the timer is set.
       When the timer counts down to zero, Heyu will launch a ´-timeout´
       script if one has been specified for that timer in the configuration
       file.  If the timer is reset to zero before timeout, then no script is
       launched.  In the current implementation, the countdown times are not
       reset to zero when a ´heyu restart´ is executed.


       The ´setrtimer´ command sets a countdown time similar to ´settimer´
       above, but a random countdown time.  It will accept either one or two
       time parameters, "[MIN] MAX".  The coundown time will be a random
       interval no shorter than MIN (default 1 second) amd no longer than MAX.
       Both time parameters may be expressed as hh:mm:ss, mm:ss, or just
       seconds.


       Advanced Addressing Options:

       Codes are transmitted by the CM11A over the power line in several
       chunks of code - one or more address bytes followed by a function code.

       Each address byte includes the housecode and a single unit code.  Each
       function code redundantly includes the housecode plus the particular
       command function.  (For extended codes, the function chunk of code also
       includes a unit code and the dim level, if any.)  So for commands which
       apply to all units in the housecode (like the foregoing "lightson"
       command) or for extended codes, the address bytes are normally omitted
       by Heyu.

       For some purposes it may be necessary to send only the function code
       for a command which normally requires a units address, or include a
       unit address for commands which don´t require one.  For these purposes
       the following syntax has been implemented:

       Prefixing the Housecode|Unit address with a ´-´ sign will suppress
       sending the address bytes (equivalent to using the ´heyu function ...´
       command).  While prefixing the Housecode|Unit with a plus ´+´ sign will
       force sending the address bytes.  Examples:

          heyu lightson  +B7,12
          heyu off  -G7  (or just -G will do)

       If a housecode is prefixed with a ´+´ sign but not followed by a units
       list, Heyu will use unit 13.  (This is for compatibility with X-10´s
       ActiveHome(TM) software, which always sends an address regardless of
       whether it´s needed  or not.)


CM17A COMMANDS
       Heyu version 2 supports commands to actuate a CM17A device connected to
       the serial port to transmit X10 RF signals.  (The CM17A is a transmit-
       only device; it does not receive RF.)  There is no way of detecting the
       presence or absence of a CM17A on the serial port other than by the
       power line signal from a transceiver (like an X-10 TM751 or RR501)
       which receives the RF transmission from the CM17A and converts it to a
       power line signal.  These commands will have no effect if the CM17A is
       absent other than a short delay.  All of them may be used in Heyu
       scenes and usersyns.

       The CM17A commands are merely listed here.  See man page x10cm17a(5)
       for a complete description.

       freset                   Reset the CM17A device.
       fon        HU            Transmit RF On
       foff       HU            Transmit RF Off
       fbright    H[U] <count>  Transmit RF Brights [after On]
       fdim       H[U] <count>  Transmit RF Dims [after On]
       fdimbo     HU <count>    Transmit RF Dims after Off
       flightson  H             Transmit RF All Lights On
       flightsoff H             Transmit RF All Lights Off
       falloff    H             Transmit RF All Units Off
       farb       xx xx <count> Transmit RF Abitrary two hex bytes
       farw       xxxx xxxx ... Transmit RF Arbitrary 16-bit words.
       flux       <count> <post-delay> xxxx xxxx ... (*)


       The following "fast" CM17A commands require special timing
       configuration.  See man x10cm17a(5).

       ffbright    H[U] <count>  Transmit RF Brights [after On]
       ffdim       H[U] <count>  Transmit RF Dims [after On]
       ffdimbo     HU <count>    Transmit RF Dims after Off
       ffarb       xx xx <count> Transmit RF Abitrary two hex bytes
       ffarw       xxxx xxxx ... Transmit RF Arbitrary 16-bit words.
       fflux       <count> <post-delay> xxxx xxxx ... (*)

       (*) Note: flux and fflux are similar to farw and ffarw except that the
       burst count and post-delay are specified on the command line.  They are
       customized for the LUX17/23 front ends to Heyu but are available for
       general use if convenient.


COMPOUND COMMANDS
       Individual Heyu _direct_ commands may be strung together into a command
       list and executed with a single invocation of Heyu.  To use this
       feature, delimit the individual commands with semicolons and enclose
       the entire command list within double quotes so it´s passed to Heyu in
       a single chunk.


EXAMPLES
       heyu turn a5 on
            Turns X10 module A5 on.

       heyu on a5
            Same as above

       heyu fon a1
            Transmits X10 RF On signal via a CM17A device.

       heyu turn b7 dim 8
            Dims X10 lamp module B7 by 8/22 of its total range.

       heyu "on a1; off b1; dim c7 3"
            A compound command.

       heyu info
            Displays CM11A clock time, base housecode and unit status. It also
            has a bitmap that shows what it thinks is the state of the X10
            modules on the same housecode.

       heyu status B1
            Returns the status of the 2-way X10 module B1 if the unit replies.

       heyu stop
            Stops the relay daemon that controls the tty port.  The monitor
            program and/or state engine daemon will also stop if they are
            running.  Heyu has to be stopped before running a new version to
            avoid ´text busy´ messages.

       heyu setclock
            Sets the CM11A clock to the current time of day per the MODE
            specified in the user´s config file and the record of an uploaded
            schedule, if any.

       heyu reset
            Sets the CM11A to the default housecode specified in the x10config
            file.

       heyu reset c
            Sets the CM11A to track events on housecode C

       heyu newbattery
            Resets the CM11A battery timer to zero. (There´s no way to set the
            CM11A battery timer to any specific time other than 0.)

       heyu date
            Displays date in date(1) input format.  The year is taken from
            your system clock.  Please don´t use this to set your computer´s
            clock.


CM10A SUPPORT
       Heyu provides CM10A support only for Direct commands and applicable
       Administrative commands - e.g., the CM10A does not have a clock, so
       commands to set or read the clock don´t work.  (The CM10A includes a
       very limited memory for uploaded macros but Heyu does not support this
       feature.)

       Heyu must be configured to recognize the CM10A - see the instructions
       for the TTY directive in man page x10config(5).  Once Heyu is thus
       configured, the CM10A will be properly initialized at startup or in the
       event of an AC power interruption.


WEB INTERFACE SUPPORT
       Heyu endeavors to support web interface development by providing in a
       customizable format simple information ("web hooks") about it´s
       configuration which might otherwise require extensive parsing of the
       Heyu configuration file.

       heyu webhook
            By itself, displays a summary of the available options.  Further
            details and usage examples are provided in the file
            "README.webhook" included with the Heyu source distribution.


HEYU CLEANUP
       On occasion, generally due to initial misconfiguration or system crash,
       there may exist stale files and/or processes which interfere with the
       operation of Heyu.  To clean up these files and/or processes, do the
       following:

              Run ´heyu stop´

              Check for any Heyu processes and kill them.  Under Linux,
              running the command ´ps aux | grep heyu´ will display any such
              processes.

              Run ´heyu list´ to display the LOCKDIR and SPOOLDIR directories
              compiled into Heyu.

              Go into the displayed LOCKDIR directory and, if they exist,
              delete files LCK..ttySxx (where ttySxx are serial ports to which
              either the CM11A or an RF receiver is connected) and delete any
              other files LCK..heyu.*

              Go into the displayed SPOOLDIR directory and delete all files
              with "heyu" in the filename.


       Heyu should now start and run properly.



EXPERIMENTAL STUFF
       The following commands don´t appear in the ´heyu help´ menu or regular
       list of commands higher up in this man page.  They may be of interest
       to some for testing and hacking the CM11A.  There is no guarantee they
       won't lock up the CM11A or cause it to go into a loop or go up in
       smoke.  There´s also no guarantee these commands won´t be eliminated in
       later versions of Heyu.  (Let us know if you find a good use for any of
       them.)  Those identified by "(Admin)" work only at the command line;
       the others ought to work in scenes and usersyns (but not necessarily in
       macros).  See also the similarly named section in man page
       x10config(5).


       heyu status_emu Hu
            Execute by a script to emulate the response to a received Status
            Request by a module which has no status reporting capability,
            e.g., any 1-way module.  If the state of module Hu as recorded by
            the Heyu engine is is ON, the command sends a StatusOn signal,
            otherwise a StatusOff signal.  (There are third-party X10
            transmitters, e.g., some ACT transmitters, which send a Status
            Request and always expect a response.)


       heyu rts_pulser  <msec_on>  <msec_off>  <repetitions>  (Admin)
            This command turns the RTS status line On (high, positive) for
            <msec_on> milliseconds, turns it Off (low, negative) for
            <msec_off> milliseconds, then repeats the On/Off cycle for a total
            of <repetitions> cycles.  It is useful for driving an N-channel
            MOSFET as an electronic switch.

            Unless you have a serial connector "Y" adapter, the CM11A will
            have to be disconnected.


       heyu xpresetramp HU <level> <ramp>
            The document "xtdcode.pdf" on X10´s website indicates that the
            upper two bits of the data byte for the extended preset dim
            command control the rate at which the lamp ramps up to its
            programmed brightness level.  A previous release of this document
            as "XTC798.DOC" showed these bits as "don´t care".

            This command allows setting the ramp value in the range 0-3.
            Tests of modules I own show that the ramp value has no effect for
            the X-10 LM14A and redesigned WS467 modules, whereas the
            redesigned LM465 module immediately goes to full brightness, the
            same as programming a preset level of 63, for any preset level and
            any ramp value other than zero.  Modules supporting extended codes
            from other labels or manufacturers may or may not support the
            ramp.


       heyu xgrpoff H G
            This Extended Group command is supposed to turn Off all units in
            housecode H which are members of group G.  It is included as an
            experimental command because most modules either don´t support it
            or get it wrong.

            The redesigned LM465 (module type LM465-1) supports it; the
            redesigned WS467 (module type WS467-1) doesn´t.  The LM14A and
            AM14A 2-way modules treat it the same as the 'xgrpexec' command,
            which is all wrong. (The Heyu module types for all the above
            attempt to model the actual physical device behavior, whether
            correct or incorrect.)


       heyu xgrpdim H G

       heyu xgrpbright H G
            These Extended Group commands are supposed to dim or brighten the
            modules in a group by one extended level out of 62 (starting at
            the resumed level if Off).  They are included as experimental
            commands because most modules don´t support them. The redesigned
            LM465 (module type LM465-1) does support them (approximately); the
            other extended code devices don´t.  In actuality, the number of
            these commands required to span the full range 1-62 is phase-
            dependent, observed to be about 78 if triggered on the rising zero
            crossing (heyu -tr ...) or about 53 if triggered on the falling
            zero crossing (heyu -tf ...).  These average in the long run to
            about 65 with random zero crossings


       Group "reference"
            X-10´s Extended Code protocol allows the total number of groups to
            expand beyond four (although any particular housecode|unit is
            limited to membership in four) through what they refer to as a
            "group reference".
            Heyu implements the group reference as a number from 1 through 16
            which may be dot-appended to the "absolute" group number for many
            of, but not all, the extended code group commands.  All groups for
            a particular housecode|unit must have the same group reference.

            Heyu extended group commands listed in this man page or in ´heyu
            help´ showing the group parameter as a capital ´G´ may be executed
            with a group reference.
            The following examples illustrate assigning the module A1 to an
            absolute group (2) or to a group with a reference (2.10), in both
            cases at their current brightness level.
               heyu xgrpadd A1 2
               heyu xgrpadd A1 2.10

            Then in the latter example, issuing the command ´heyu xgrpexec A
            2.10´ will set all members of group 2.10 to the levels stored for
            that group in the modules´ memory.

            The behavior of X-10 extended code devices when assigning relative
            groups varies from device type to device type, and it´s anyone´s
            guess whether X-10 will make unannounced changes.  The behavior
            listed for the following module types is supported by Heyu:

            LM14A, AM14A: Assigning a reference to one group automatically
            changes all group memberships for that housecode|unit to use the
            same reference.

            WS467-1: As above, but the housecode|unit is simultaneously a
            member of the absolute group.

            LM465-1: Assigning a group reference removes the housecode|unit
            from membership in all other groups which don´t already use the
            same reference.

            The command ´heyu show group H´ will display the group memberships
            for all units in Housecode H, absolute and, if assigned,
            referenced.

            Note: There is no provision in the Extended Code protocol for
            assigning a group reference and level with one command - the
            module must first be brought to the desired level with the xpreset
            or dim or bright command and then added to a group at its current
            level.  As a consequence, the ´heyu restore_groups´ command can
            result in a lot of blinking lights when groups with a reference
            are restored.


       heyu port_line_test (Admin)
            Test whether the serial port supports the Ring Indicator (RI)
            and/or other serial input status lines.  This test is run on the
            port itself - no CM11A - and requires hooking a jumper between the
            serial port´s DTR line (DB-9 pin 4) and one (or more) of the input
            status lines to be tested: RI (pin 9), CD (pin 1), DSR (pin 6),
            CTS (pin 8).

            Heyu toggles the DTR line and the input line(s) should replicate
            the "SET" or "clr" state of the DTR line, e.g., for pin 4 jumpered
            to pin 9 there should be displayed:

            $ heyu port_line_test
            Jumpered pin  4   to    9    1    6    8
            Status Line: DTR  =>   RI   CD   DSR  CTS
                         ---       ---  ---  ---  ---
                         clr  =>   clr  clr  clr  clr
                         SET  =>   SET  clr  clr  clr
                         clr  =>   clr  clr  clr  clr
                         SET  =>   SET  clr  clr  clr

            Failure of the serial port to support a given input line is
            indicated by the state of the line under test being displayed as
            constantly clr or constantly SET.  This is the case under Linux
            with a USB->Serial adapter containing an older Prolific chip.
            (Whether this is a hardware bug or a Linux bug is unknown.)


       heyu ri_disable and heyu ri_enable  (Admin)
            These commands disable and enable the CM11A feature of asserting
            the Ring Indicator (RI) serial line just prior to reporting an X10
            signal received over the powerline.

            Some PC motherboards have the capability to power up the system
            when the RI signal is asserted, yet lack the ability in the BIOS
            to turn off this feature.  To prevent the CM11A from inadvertantly
            powering up a PC like this, run the heyu ri_disable command as the
            last command (other than heyu stop) before shutting down the PC.
            Then run the heyu ri_enable command after starting up the PC and
            Heyu again.

            Note that in the event of an interruption of AC power, the CM11A
            powerup condition is with the RI assertion capability enabled.
            And Heyu uses the command for enabling the RI line in various
            places for unrelated reasons.


       heyu ping  (Admin)
            A quick check to see if the CM11A is responding.  It sends the
            command to enable the CM11A´s serial RI line and waits for the
            expected echo.


       heyu pausetick
            Pauses until the system clock rolls over to the next second.
            Sometimes useful in timing commands.


       heyu sendbytes xx xx xx ...
            Similar to the ´address´ command except that the addresses are
            entered as hexadecimal bytes housecode|unitcode (encoded value
            0x00 - 0xFF).  See the X10 protocol.txt document for the encoding.


       heyu sendtext H "quoted text string"
            Sends a string of quoted ASCII text as addresses on the specified
            housecode.  Each character in the string is represented by two
            address bytes with their unit codes being the high and low nybbles
            of the character.  The text is transmitted at the phenominal speed
            of about 0.9 characters/second and the PC´s resources are tied up
            while the transmission is taking place.  It works only from the
            command line - not in a macro and (currently) not in a scene or
            usersyn.  Perhaps someone will discover a use for this otherwise-
            useless experimental command. :-)
            Example:

               heyu sendtext A "Hello world."


       heyu upload imagefile <filename>  (Admin)
            Uploads any 1024 byte binary image file to the CM11A's EEPROM,
            whether created by Heyu or not, including binary image files
            created by X-10´s ActiveHome software under MS Windows.  Note:
            there won't be any x10record or x10macroxref files created, nor
            are those existing files deleted.

       heyu command2cm11a xx xx xx ...
            Sends any arbitrary string of hex bytes to the CM11A and attempts
            the normal software handshake for commands.

       heyu bytes2cm11a xx xx xx ...
            Sends any arbitrary string of hex bytes to the CM11A without
            making any attempt at the normal handshaking for commands.

       heyu reserved  (Admin)
            There´s a bit in the status update block identified as "reserved"
            in the X10 protocol.txt and which is normally reset to 0.  This
            command sets it to 1 to see if it has any effect on anything. (So
            far I haven´t noticed that it does anything at all, but who
            knows.)

       heyu powerfailtest boot|notboot (Admin)
            Emulate interruption of AC power to the CM11A.  This allows
            testing of -powerfail scripts without having to actually interrupt
            power.  The parameter ´boot´ or ´notboot´ specifies whether to
            emulate as if Heyu was just started or already running,
            respectively, when power to the CM11A is restored. This command
            requires that the Heyu state engine daemon be running.  Note that
            this command does not update the CM11A clock (or re-initialize a
            CM10A) as would be done by the heyu_relay daemon following an
            actual power interruption.

       options -tr, -tf
            Many X10 modules are found to respond differently to commands,
            specifically dims and brights, depending on whether the power line
            signal begins on the rising or falling zero crossing.  Which one
            the signal starts at is random with the CM11A and most other
            transmitters.  With additional hardware, these experimental
            options will allow transmission of (direct) commands to
            synchronize with only the rising (-tr) or only the falling (-tf)
            zero crossing.  Fast timing is required so a timing loop will have
            to be calibrated by running ´heyu utility calibrate´.
            Example:
              heyu -tr dim A1 10

            The additional hardware required is to connect the secondary of a
            4 to 8 VAC (RMS) transformer between the Signal Ground (DB9 pin 5)
            and Carrier Detect (DB9 pin 1) pins of the serial port to which
            the CM11A is connected.  (Neither the CM11A nor the CM17A normally
            use the Carrier Detect pin.)  The polarity of the AC voltage on
            the CD pin must be in-phase with the AC power line for the -tr and
            -tf options to match the rising and falling zero-crossings
            respectively, otherwise they'll work backwards.

            An adapter between the CM11A cable and serial port will be
            required to make this connection - I use a male/female pair of DB9
            solder-type connectors with corresponding pins joined with 3/4"
            lengths of bus bar, and connect to the SG and CD pin bus bars with
            Radio Shack hook clips.

            Note: prudence dictates using an inexpensive serial port add-on
            card for experiments like this to reduce the risk to motherboard
            components.  The output voltage of a transformer may be
            substantially higher than its rating (at rated current) when
            supplying only the very low current to the serial port pin.
            Although the RS232 specification allows for a voltage as high as
            25 Volts, PC serial ports are normally operated between +/- 12
            Volts and it would be unwise to exceed that level, and certainly
            no higher than 15 Volts peak.  (12 Volts peak -> 8.49 Volts RMS.)

       heyu tdim HU <level>, heyu tbright HU <level>
            These commands operate as if the dim or bright commands were
            issued with the -tr option.  They are now deprecated.


ENVIRONMENT
       X10CONFIG - Points to a fully qualified file name of your configuration
       file, if located elsewhere than in one of the standard places. See
       x10config(5) for more information on its makeup.
       HEYUSUB - Optionally specifies an additional subdirectory level under
       the standard places where the configuration file will be found, i.e.,
          $HOME/.heyu/$HEYUSUB/
          /etc/heyu/$HEYUSUB/
       X10SCHED - Points to a fully qualified file name of your schedule file
       (timers and macros), if located elsewhere than in one of the standard
       places.  See x10sched(5) for more information on its layout.
       ASIF_DATE - Instruct Heyu to process the data in your schedule file as
       of the specified date ( format yyyymmdd ) instead of the current system
       date.  (Its primary use is with ´heyu upload check´ - to examine the
       details when something suspicious is brought to light with the ´heyu
       upload croncheck´ command.)


FILES
        $HOME/.heyu/x10config - Heyu configuration file when in user´s home
       directory.
        SYSBASEDIR/x10.conf - Heyu configuration file when in system-wide
       directory.
        Included in the same directory as the configuration file are:
          x10state - module on/off/dim state file (binary).
          x10.sched - default filename for schedule of uploaded timers and
       macros.
          x10record - record of the uploaded schedule parameters.
          x10macroxref - addresses of uploaded macros.
          x10image - binary image of the uploaded schedule.
        LOCKDIR/LCK..<tty> - lock file for serial port.
        LOCKDIR/LCK..heyu.relay.<tty> - lock file for relay process.
        LOCKDIR/LCK..heyu.engine.<tty> - lock file for state engine process.
        LOCKDIR/LCK..heyu.write.<tty> - lock file for processes that write to
       the CM11A
        SPOOLDIR/heyu.out.<tty> - fifo file for relay process.

       Where in the above <tty> is a suffix representing the serial port to
       which the CM11A is connected, e.g.,
        /dev/ttyS0 -> ttyS0
        /dev/usb/ttyUSB0 -> ttyUSB0  (implies a USB-Serial adapter)

       (´heyu list´ will display the LOCKDIR, SPOOLDIR, and SYSBASEDIR
       compiled into Heyu for your operating system.)


BUGS
       Occasionally the interface will not accept the first command after a
       reboot of the CM11A or the computer.

       Heyu does not always handle well an X10 command received over the power
       line when it´s in the middle of sending out a command.
