NAME
     efidp – UEFI Device Path manipulation

SYNOPSIS
     efidp [-fp] [--parse] [--format]

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts “Unified Extensible Firmware Interface” (UEFI)
     Device Paths, as defined in the UEFI standard, to and from binary form.
     Binary and textual forms are defined in Chapter 9 of the UEFI
     Specification.

     -f --format           Formats a binary UEFI Device Path into its
                           canonical UTF-8 textual form.  A binary Device Path
                           can be no longer than 65536 bytes.  The textual
                           form must fit into 65536 bytes.  Multiple binary
                           device paths may be specified.

     -p --parse            Parses a UEFI Device Path UTF-8 specification and
                           outputs the binary Device Path form.  Only one
                           device path is parsed, even if there are multiple
                           present in the input.  Leading white space is
                           ignored.  The resulting binary Device Path can be
                           no longer than 65536 bytes.  Multiple lines may be
                           specified.  Each one will be translated.

     -e ---to-efi          Translate a Unix file path to an EFI Device Path.
                           The output is the textual representation of the EFI
                           Device Path.

     -u ---to-unix         Translate an EFI device path to a Unix file path.
                           The input is the textual representation of the EFI
                           Device Path.

SEE ALSO
     Appendix A of the UEFI specification has the format for GUIDs.  All GUIDs
     “Globally Unique Identifiers” have the format described in RFC 4122.

     The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Specification is available from
     www.uefi.org.
