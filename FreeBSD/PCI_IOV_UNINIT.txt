PCI_IOV_UNINIT(9)      FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual     PCI_IOV_UNINIT(9)

NAME
     PCI_IOV_UNINIT – disable SR-IOV on a PF device

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/bus.h>
     #include <dev/pci/pci_iov.h>

     void
     PCI_IOV_UNINIT(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     The PCI_IOV_UNINIT() method is called by the PCI Single-Root I/O
     Virtualization (SR-IOV) infrastructure when the user requests that SR-IOV
     be disabled on a Physical Function (PF).  When this method is called, the
     PF driver must release any SR-IOV-related resources that it has allocated
     and disable any device-specific SR-IOV configuration in the device.

     This method will only be called following a successful call to
     PCI_IOV_INIT(9).  It is not guaranteed that PCI_IOV_ADD_VF(9) will have
     been called for any Virtual Function (VF) after the call to
     PCI_IOV_INIT(9) and before the call to PCI_IOV_UNINIT.
