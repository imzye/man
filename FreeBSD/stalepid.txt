STALEPID(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            STALEPID(1)

NAME
     stalepid – check for and remove stale process ID files

SYNOPSIS
     stalepid [-bdhV] pidfile processname

DESCRIPTION
     The stalepid utility was developed to facilitate the startup of servers
     that write their process ID to a file and refuse to start if that file
     exists (e.g. when the process was last terminated by an unclean shutdown,
     or simply killed, not given the chance to clean up the process ID file).
     The stalepid utility is used to check for and possibly remove those stale
     process ID files.  Upon its invocation, stalepid checks for the following
     conditions:

     -   the file specified by the pidfile argument exists;

     -   it contains a single line, and the line contains a single number;

     -   there is no process with the process ID specified in the file, or if
         there is one, it is not named processname.

     If all those conditions are met, the stalepid utility will remove the
     file specified by the pidfile argument, thus allowing the next invocation
     of the server to proceed normally.

     The following options are available:

     -b      Invoke the ps(1) utility using BSD syntax (the default behavior).

     -d      Display diagnostic information during the course of operation.

     -h      Display a short help message and exit.

     -V      Display program version information and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
