NAME
       SpringGraph - Directed Graph alternative to GraphViz

SYNOPSIS
       use SpringGraph qw(calculate_graph draw_graph);

       ## object oriented interface ##

       my $graph = new SpringGraph;

       # add a node to the graph  (with optional label)

       $graph->add_node('Paris', label =>'City of Love');

       # add an edge to the graph (with optional label, and directed)

       $graph->add_edge('London' => 'New York', label => 'Far', dir=>1);

       # output the graph to a file

       $graph->as_png($filename);

       # get the graph as GD image object

       $graph->as_gd;

       ## procedural interface ##

       my %node = (       london => { label => 'London (Waterloo)'},
                paris => { label => 'Paris' },          brussels => { label =>
       'Brussels'},      );

       my %link = (       london => { paris => {style => 'dotted'}, 'new york'
       => {} }, # non-directed, dotted and plain lines       paris => {
       brussels => { dir => 1}  }, # directed from paris to brussels       );

       my $graph = calculate_graph(\%node,\%link);

       draw_graph($filename,\%node,\%link);

DESCRIPTION
       SpringGraph.pm is a rewrite of the springgraph.pl script, which
       provides similar functionality to Neato and can read some/most dot
       files.

       The goal of this module is to provide a compatible interface to VCG
       and/or GraphViz perl modules on CPAN. This module will also provide
       some extra features to provide more flexibility and power.

METHODS
Class Methods
   new
       Constructor for the class, returns a new SpringGraph object

       my $graph = SpringGraph->new;

   calculate_graph
       returns a hashref of the nodes in the graph, populated with coordinates

       my $graph = calculate_graph(\%node,\%link);

   draw_graph
       outputs the graph as a png file either to the file specified by the
       filename or to STDOUT

       takes filename, hashref of nodes and list of edges

       draw_graph($filename,\%node,\%link);

Object Methods
   add_node
       adds a node to a graph

       takes the name of the node and any attributes such as label

       # just like GraphViz.pm :) $graph->add_node('Paris', label =>'City of
       Love');

   add_edge
       adds an edge to a graph

       takes the source and destination of the edge and attributes such as
       style (dotted or dashed), or if the line is directed or not

       $graph->add_edge('London' => 'New York', dir  => 1, style=>'dashed');

   as_png
       prints the image of the graph in PNG format

       takes an optional filename or outputs directly to STDOUT

       $graph->as_png($filename);

   as_gd
       returns the GD image object of the graph

       my $gd_im = $graph->as_gd;

   as_gd
       returns the image of the graph in a string in the format specified or
       PNG

       my $graph_png = $graph->as_image('png');
