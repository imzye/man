NAME
       xtriangles - Triangles X widget

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/games/xtriangles [-geometry
       [{width}][x{height}][{+-}{xoff}[{+-}{yoff}]]] [-display
       [{host}]:[{vs}]] [-[no]mono] [-[no]{reverse|rv}] [-{foreground|fg}
       {color}] [-{background|bg} {color}] [-{border|bd} {color}] [-tile
       {color}] [-size {int}] [-base {int}] [-username {string}]

DESCRIPTION
       This is basically no harder than the 15 puzzle.   The 15 puzzle was
       originally made around 1879 (the 14-15 puzzle of Sam Loyd was made soon
       after).   T. R. Dawson in Original Puzzles has a similar puzzle with 4
       diamond- and 6 triangular-shaped pieces.

FEATURES
       Click "mouse-left" button to move a tile.  Clicks on spaces or clicks
       tiles that are not in line with the two spaces will not move the tiles.
       Notice one can move more than one tile at a time by clicking on the
       tile farthest from the spaces but in line with the spaces.

       Click "mouse-right" button, or press "R" or "r" keys, to randomize the
       puzzle.  One must double click on "mouse-right" if the puzzle is being
       worked on.

       Press "I" or "i" keys to increase the number of tiles.

       Press "D" or "d" keys to decrease the number of tiles.

       "S" or "s" keys reserved for the auto-solver (unimplemented).

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad, "R" keys, or arrow keys to move without the mouse.
       Key pad is defined for Triangles as:
       7   9  Upper Left, Upper Right
         ^
       4< >6  Left, Right
         v
       1   3  Bottom Left, Bottom Right

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xtriangles: <size> @ (<Number of moves>/{<Record number of
              moves> <username>|"NEVER noaccess"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the triangles window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the triangles window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the triangles window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the tiles in the
               triangles window (resource name "borderColor").

       -tile color
               This option specifies the tile color of the triangles window
               (resource name "tileColor").

       -size <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of triangles in a
               row (resource name "sizeA").

       -base int
               This option specifies the base used (default is base 10)
               (resource name "base").

       -username string
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or
               else it will get your login name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason for this is that this is simple
       and I do not know what the standard is.

              size: 1-16 <number of tiles in a row of the same orientation as
              the puzzle>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <array of tile positions where 0 is the empty
              space for the UP triangle and -1 is the empty space for the DOWN
              triangle>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <direction>
       Direction is represented as 0 upper right, 1 right, 2 lower right, 3
       lower left, 4 left, and 5 upper left.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.
