NAME
       spdy-client - Example Net::SPDY client

ALPHA WARNING
       Please read carefully: This is an ALPHA stage software.  In particular
       this means that even though it probably won't kill your cat, re-elect
       George W. Bush nor install Solaris 11 Express edition to your hard
       drive, it is in active development, functionality is missing and no
       APIs are stable.

       See TODO file in the distribution to learn about missing and planned
       functionality. You are more than welcome to join the development and
       submit patches with fixes or enhancements.  Bug reports are probably
       not very useful at this point.

SYNOPSIS
       spdy-client <session-uri> [<path> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       spdy-client is a toy SPDY client, showcasing Net::SPDY capabilities.

       It's hardly of any useful use.

EXAMPLES
       spdy-client https://localhost:8443/ /hello /world
           Do something.

       spdy-client https://clients1.google.com/ /generate_204
           So useful.
