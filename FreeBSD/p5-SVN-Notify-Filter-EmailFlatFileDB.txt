SVN::Notify::Filter::EmailFlatFileDB(3)    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       SVN::Notify::Filter::EmailFlatFileDB - Converts account names to email
       address based on a flat-file database

VERSION
       Version 1.01

SYNOPSIS
       This is intended to work with SVN::Notify, as part of a subversion
       post-commit hook.

           svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" ..etc..  \
                     --filter EmailFlatFileDB                   \
                           --account_file /x/x/x/users.db         \
                           --account_field 3

           with a text file like other UNIX/Apache password files:

              user1:xxx:xxx:user1@example.com
              user2:xxx:xxx:user2@example.com

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a filter for SVN::Notify, which will translate user
       account names (e.g. "user1") into email address.  It does this based on
       a colon-separated file, like a UNIX passwd file (or more usefully) the
       AuthUserFile used by Apache.  The file path is specified via the
       --account_file option to the svnnotify script, and the index (zero-
       based) of the email field is specified via the --account_field option.

       You can use the module in conjunction with
       SVN::Notify::Filter::AuthZEmail to completely remove the necessity of
       passing in --from and --to options to the script.  (AuthZEmail will
       determine the account names for the email recipients, and this module
       will translate the account names into email addresses.)

       (This module will remove --to entries that are empty.)

FUNCTIONS
   from
       SVN::Notify filter callback function for the "from" email address.  By
       default, SVN::Notify uses the account name of the commit author.  This
       will translate that into the email address, based upon the value in the
       database file.  Note that the svnnotify --from option can also be used
       to override the default SVN::Notify behavior, and this filter will not
       modify an email address if it is passed in.

   recipients
       SVN::Notify filter callback function to determine the email addresses
       for the email recipients, based upon account names passed to
       SVN::Notify.

       Account names will be looked up via the flat-file database, but any
       email addresses passed in will not be modified.  This allows one to
       enter either account names or email address via the svnnotify --to
       options.  Email addresses are distinguished from account names if there
       is an '@' in the string.  Empty string account names will be discarded.
       (The SVN::Notify object requires a --to argument, and an empty string
       account name is a workaround for that, for filters that completely
       provide the recipient list.)
