DESCRIPTION
       The pload program displays network throughput statistics in an X window
       Athena stripchart graph.  On FreeBSD, pload can handle any network
       interface.


OPTIONS
       Pload accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see
       X(1)).  The order of the options in unimportant. Additionally, pload
       accepts the following options:

       -minscale n
               The minscale option sets the minimum integer number of scale
               lines to display.  The number of divisions will not go below
               the number specified.  The default is 1.


       -indiv n
               Show  dividing lines for a rate of n bytes per second for
               received data.  The default is to show a line every 1024 bytes
               per second (1 k/s).


       -outdiv n
               Show  dividing lines for a rate of n bytes per second for sent
               data.  The default is to show a line every 1024 bytes per
               second (1 k/s).


       -logscale
               The logscale option enables graphing the base 10 logarithm of
               the rates. This is most useful for high bandwith devices like
               ethernet. The -indiv and -outdiv options interact with this
               option: a scale line will be drawn for 10*div, 100*div,
               1000*div, ... bytes. The default is to graph linearly.


       -jumpscroll n
               This option sets number of pixels to shift to the left when the
               graph reaches the right edge of the window.  Smooth scrolling
               is achieved by the default setting of 1.


       -update n
               The displayed charts are updated every integer n seconds.  The
               default is to update every 1 seconds.


       -in     Only show the chart for received data.


       -out    Only show the chart for sent data.  Default action is to show
               both charts.


       -horiz  Display side by side.  Default is to display vertically.


       -nolabel
               This option suppresses the normal display of the total bytes
               and current rate label.


       -nochart
               Don't show the charts.  If -nolabel is not set, pload will only
               show the text labels.  If -nolabel and -nochart are set, pload
               won't do anything.


       -average n
               Average or smooth over n number of samples in the calculations
               of the current rates for the displayed graphs.  The default is
               to average over 10 points.  For a more instantaneous response
               this can be set to 1.


       -device X
               Monitor this device.  The default is ppp0.


       -hl color
               This option specifies the color of the scale lines.


       -incolor color
               Set the foreground color for the inbound chart to color.  The
               default is red.


       -outcolor color
               Set the foreground color for the outbound chart to color.  The
               default is darkgreen.


       -fg color
               Set the form foreground color to color.


       -bg color
               Set the background color to color.


       -fn fontspec
               Set the label font to fontspec.


       -noproc This option is only valid for Linux >=2.2.  It disables the
               default usage of the proc filesystem for gathering device
               statistics.  The more portable ioctl() method is used instead.
               When -noproc is specified only ppp stats can be read.


       -ncmsg message
               Display message in the labels when offline. The default is "No
               Connection".


       -iformat fmt
               Use string fmt for the inbound label. The fmt string will be
               displayed literally with the special tags %d %t %r and %M
               expanding to the interface name, interface total, current rate,
               and maximum rate respectively. The default is "%t %r in".


       -oformat fmt
               Same as -iformat but for out bound data. The default is "%t %r
               out".




RESOURCES
       All of the options available above and more can be set using the
       resources of the widgets in pload.  The following can be added to a
       user .Xdefaults or system wide Pload.ad file.  Additional customisation
       can be accomplished by examining the running executable with
       editres(1).

BUGS
       Resizing doesn't work right under icewm and kwm with opaque resize
       turned on.  The labels flash. Totals seem to wrap at ULONG_MAX.
