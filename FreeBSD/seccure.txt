DESCRIPTION
       The seccure toolset implements a selection of asymmetric algorithms
       based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). In particular it offers
       public key encryption / decryption, signature generation / verification
       and basic key establishment.

       ECC schemes offer a much better key size to security ratio than
       classical cryptosystems (RSA, DSA). Keys are short enough to make
       direct specification of keys on the command line possible (sometimes
       this is more convenient than the management of PGP-like key rings).
       seccure builds on this feature and therefore is the tool of choice
       whenever lightweight but nevertheless strong asymmetric cryptography --
       independent of key servers, revocation certificates, the Web of Trust
       or even configuration files -- is required.

COMMANDS
       seccure-key: Prompt for a passphrase and calculate the corresponding
       public key.

       seccure-encrypt: Encrypt a message with public key key.

       seccure-decrypt: Prompt for a passphrase and decrypt a seccure-
       encrypted message.

       seccure-sign: Prompt for a passphrase and digitally sign a message.

       seccure-verify: Verify signature sig with public key key.

       seccure-signcrypt: Sign a message first, encrypt it subsequently (in -b
       -a and -m 0 mode, respectively). This is basically a shortcut for two
       separate seccure invocations.

       seccure-veridec: Counterpart to signcryption.

       seccure-dh: Perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

OPTIONS
       -c curve
              Use elliptic curve curve. Available are: secp112r1, secp128r1,
              secp160r1, secp192r1/nistp192, secp224r1/nistp224,
              secp256r1/nistp256, secp384r1/nistp384, secp521r1/nistp521,
              brainpoolp160r1, brainpoolp192r1, brainpoolp224r1,
              brainpoolp256r1, brainpoolp320r1, brainpoolp384r1, and
              brainpoolp512r1. The curve name may be abbreviated by any non-
              ambiguous substring (for instance it is suggested to specify
              p224 for the secp224r1/nistp224 curve). The default curve is
              p160, which provides reasonable security for everyday use. (See
              also HOW TO CHOOSE THE CURVE.)

              Note: If a public key is given on the command line, for all SECP
              and NIST curves seccure can determine the corresponding curve on
              its own. It is then unnecessary to specify the curve explicitly.
              Brainpool curves cannot be recognized automatically.

       -F pwfile
              Don't prompt for a passphrase; instead, take the first text line
              of pwfile.

       -m maclen
              Set the MAC length to maclen bits. Only multiples of 8 in the
              range from 0 to 256 are allowed. The default MAC length is 80
              bits, which provides a reasonable level of integrity protection
              for everyday use.

       -i infile
              Read from infile instead of STDIN.

       -o outfile
              Write to outfile instead of STDOUT.

       -s sigfile
              For seccure-sign: Write signature to sigfile instead of STDERR.

              For seccure-verify: Read signature from sigfile instead of using
              sig.

       -f     Filter mode: Copy all data read from STDIN verbatim to STDOUT
              (eventually attaching or detaching a signature in -a mode).

       -b     Binary mode: Read/write signatures as binary strings. This leads
              to very compact signatures.

       -a     Append mode:

              For seccure-sign: Append signature to the end of the document.
              This enforces -f mode.

              For seccure-verify: Detach signature from the end of the
              document.

       -d     Double prompt mode: When reading a passphrase from the console:
              prompt twice and assure the phrases are the same.

       -v     Verbose mode: Print some extra information.

       -q     Quiet mode: Disable all unnecessary output.

EXIT STATUS
       All commands in the seccure software suite exit with a status of zero
       if the desired operation could be completed successfully. Any error
       leads to a nonzero exit code.

EXAMPLE
       Given the passphrase 'seccure is secure', run

       seccure-key

       to determine the corresponding public key (which is '2@DupCaCKykHBe-
       QHpAP%d%B[' on curve p160).

       To encrypt the file 'document.msg' with that key run

       seccure-encrypt -i document.msg -o document.enc '2@DupCaCKykHBe-
       QHpAP%d%B['

       The message can be recovered with

       seccure-decrypt -i document.enc

       To sign the file run

       seccure-sign -i document.msg -s document.sig

       and enter the passphrase. The signature is stored in 'document.sig' and
       can be verified with

       seccure-verify -i document.msg -s document.sig '2@DupCaCKykHBe-
       QHpAP%d%B['

KEY ESTABLISHMENT
       seccure-dh performs an interactive Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Two
       instances have to be run in parallel; the token generated by the first
       instance is the input for the second one and vice versa. The output
       consists of two shared keys: it is guaranteed that no attacker can ever
       find out (more precisely, distinguished from random) the established
       key as soon as the two parties can confirm that both have the same
       verification key. The authentic comparision of the verification keys
       can, for example, be realized via signed messages or via telephone
       (using 'voice authentication').

HOW TO CHOOSE THE CURVE
       The number in the name of a curve measures its security level. Rule of
       thumb: the workload to 'break' a k-bit curve is 2^(k/2) approximately
       (example: it takes about 2^112 steps to break secp224r1). If the 80 bit
       security of the default curve doesn't seem sufficient, choosing a
       stronger curve (p192 and upwards) may, of course, be considered. But
       the suggestion remains: p160 offers reasonable security for everyday
       use. Warning: the curves p112 and p128 do not satisfy demands for long-
       time security.

ALGORITHMS
       seccure uses derivated versions of ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated
       Encryption Scheme), ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
       and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) as encryption, signature and
       key establishment scheme, respectively. For the symmetric parts (bulk
       encryption, hashing, key derivation, HMAC calculation) seccure builds
       on AES256 (in CTR mode), SHA256 and SHA512. To my best knowledge no
       part of seccure is covered by patents. See the file PATENTS for an
       explicit patent statement.
