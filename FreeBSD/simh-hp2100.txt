NAME
     hp2100 – Simulator for HP 21xx/1000 series computers

SYNOPSIS
     hp2100 [-e] [-q] [-v] [startup-file [arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
     hp2100 is a simulator for the HP 2116/15/14, 2100, and 1000 M/E/F-Series
     machines (hereafter referred collectively as the HP 2100 simulator). A
     large variety of CPU options, device interface cards, and peripherals are
     provided.

     The following options are available:

     -e      Processing of startup-file (including nested command invocations)
             is aborted if a command error is encountered.

     -q      Certain informational messages are suppressed.

     -v      The commands in startup-file are echoed before they are executed.

     If startup-file is specified, it is used as an initial source of
     simulator commands.  If startup-file is not specified, default locations
     are searched. See the SIMH User's Supplement for more details.

     If a startup file is specified, either on the command line or otherwise,
     it should contain a series of non-interactive simulator commands, one per
     line.  These commands can be used to set up standard parameters.

     After initializing its internal structures and processing the startup
     file (if any), the simulator types out its name and version and then
     prompts for input with:

           sim>

EXIT STATUS
     hp2100 exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
