SDHCI(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               SDHCI(4)

NAME
     sdhci – PCI SD Host Controller bridge driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device mmc
           device mmcsd
           device sdhci

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           mmc_load="YES"
           mmcsd_load="YES"
           sdhci_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The sdhci driver supports PCI devices with class 8 and subclass 5
     according to SD Host Controller Specification.  Driver supports up to six
     high speed 4bit MMC/SD slots per controller.  Driver attaches mmc bus to
     the respective slot on card insertion and detaches it on card removing.

HARDWARE
     The sdhci driver supports different specification compatible chips.  The
     following chips have been verified to work:

     •   ENE CB712
     •   ENE CB714
     •   RICOH R5C822
     •   RICOH R5CE823
     •   TI PCIXX21/XX11/XX12

BUGS
     Many of existing SD controller chips have some nonstandard requirements,
     proprietary registers and hardware bugs, requiring additional handling.
     ENE chips are handled to work fine, while some revisions of RICOH and TI
     controllers still do not see cards without some additional
     initialization.
