DEVICE_ENABLE(9)       FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual      DEVICE_ENABLE(9)

NAME
     device_enable, device_disable, device_is_enabled – manipulate device
     enabled flag

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void
     device_enable(device_t dev);

     void
     device_disable(device_t dev);

     int
     device_is_enabled(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     Each device has an enabled flag associated with it.  A device is enabled
     by default when it is created but may be disabled (for instance to
     prevent a destructive or time consuming probe attempt).  To disable a
     device, call device_disable(), to re-enable it, call device_enable() and
     to test to see if a device is enabled, call device_is_enabled().
