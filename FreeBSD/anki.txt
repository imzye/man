NAME
       anki - flexible, intelligent flashcard program

DESCRIPTION
       Anki is a program designed to help you remember facts (such as words
       and phrases in a foreign language) as easily, quickly and efficiently
       as possible.  To do this, it tracks how well you remember each fact,
       and uses that information to optimally schedule review times. With a
       minimal amount of effort, you can greatly increase the amount of
       material you remember, making study more productive, and more fun.

       Anki is based on a theory called spaced repetition. In simple terms, it
       means that each time you review some material, you should wait longer
       than last time before reviewing it again. This maximizes the time spent
       studying difficult material and minimizes the time spent reviewing
       things you already know. The concept is simple, but the vast majority
       of memory trainers and flashcard programs out there either avoid the
       concept all together, or implement inflexible and suboptimal methods
       that were originally designed for pen and paper.
