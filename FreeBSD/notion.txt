NAME
       Notion - an X11 window manager

SYNOPSIS
       notion [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Notion is a tiling tabbed window manager designed with keyboard users
       in mind.


OPTIONS
       -display host:display.screen
              X display to manage

       -conffile configfile
              Configuration file to use instead of default

       -searchdir dir
              Directory to search for configuration files and other scripts

       -oneroot
              On X servers with multiple (traditional non-Xinerama) screens,
              manage only default screen (root window), not all, as given by
              the -display option or in the DISPLAY environment variable.

       -session session_name
              Set session name. This option affects where workspace and other
              save files are put (~/.notion/session_name if option set).

       -help  Show help on command line options

       -version
              Show version

       -about Show about text (version, author, license)


BASIC CONCEPTS
       This section is an overview of the types objects that appear on an X
       display managed by Notion and their relationships in a standard setup.
       This information is necessary to understand the operations and
       availability of the different key bindings explained below. For a more
       detailed explanation, needed for writing custom bindings configuration
       files, see the additional documentation available from the Notion Web
       page.

       The top-level objects that matter in the case at hand are screens.
       They correspond to physical screens. Screens contain workspaces (which
       are a kind of group), and client windows put into full screen mode.
       These objects are multiplexed in the sense that only one can be
       displayed at a time.

       Workspaces themselves may contain tilings and detached/floating frames.
       A workspace containing no tilings and only detached/floating windows is
       also called a floating workspace. Tilings themselves contain frames
       tiled to fill the screen, and possibly a statusbar or dock. Akin to
       screens, frames multiplex other objects, but in this case mostly client
       window groups. Most of the time, frames are the only trace of Notion
       you see on the screen. Frames may have border decorations, and they
       have a tab for each multiplexed object.

       Queries are boxes that appear at the bottoms of frames or screens to
       ask you for textual input to execute an action that depends on it.
       Most queries support tab-completion.



BINDINGS
       These are the default key and pointer bindings. Below, Mod4 refers to
       the modifier used by Notion. Mod4 is the default, but this can be
       configured by setting META in the configuration. The particular key
       that is interpreted as Mod4 depends on your system. On Xorg-based
       systems it is usually bound to the windows key. The xmodmap(1x) tool
       can be used to get/set which key codes correspond to which modifiers,
       and the xev(1x) tool can be used to see what codes are generated by
       particular keys.

       The string in square brackets after a binding group heading below
       indicates the module that whose configuration file defines these
       bindings.
