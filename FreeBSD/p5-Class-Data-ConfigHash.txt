NAME
       Class::Data::ConfigHash - Add Catalyst-Style Config To Your Class

NAME
         package MyClass;
         use base qw(Class::Data::ConfigHash);

         __PACKAGE__->config(
           foo => 'bar'
         );

DESCRIPTION
       I often times find myself wanting a per-class config that can be used
       to provide sane class-level defaults, but with the ability to easily
       customize the values at run time.

         package MyClass;
         __PACKAGE__->config({
           foo => 1,
           bar => 2
         });

         # Later, in perhaps an initialize hook somewhere
         my %config = read_config_from_file() ; # say, %config = ( foo => 3 )
         MyClass->config(\%config);

         MyClass->config->{foo}; # yields 3
         MyClass->config->{bar}; # yields 2

       The idea is that you can hardcode the defaults in your class, but you
       can also easily override them by merging the original hash with a newly
       given hash.  This feature is handled beautifully in Catalyst.

       So there, this module is basically that feature from Catalyst ripped
       out to a separate module so it can be used elsewhere.

       To use, simply subclass it in your module:

         package MyClass;
         use base qw(Class::Data::ConfigHash);

       Done! Now you can use ->config in MyClass.

METHODS
   config([\%hash])
       Accessor for the underlying config.

         # set
         $class->config(\%hash);
         $class->config->{whatever} = 'foo';

         # get
         $class->config->{whatever};

       If given a hashref argument, the values in the hashref are merged with
       whatever values that existed prior to that. This merge is performed
       recursively to the entire hash.

   merge_config_hashes(\%lefthash, \%righthash)
       Merges the two config hashes.
