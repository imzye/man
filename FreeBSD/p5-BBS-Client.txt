               use BBS::Client;
               my $o = BBS::Client->new( {
                               host => 'bs2.to',
                               sys =>  'bs2' ,  # system type ( ptt or maple )
                               });

DESCRIPTION
       To connect with BBS systems to backup articles , I wrote this module ,
       which is implemented with Net::Telnet.  You can fetch articles from BBS
       Systems , such like ptt.cc , ptt2.cc and bs2.to

       This module works on different BBS Systems by given specific scheme to
       emit corresponding behaviors. You can also add your scheme to this
       module. ( BBS::Client::Scheme )
