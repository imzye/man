NAME
       mailsync - Synchronize IMAP mailboxes

SYNOPSIS
       mailsync [options] channel
       or
       mailsync [options] store
       or
       mailsync [options] channel store

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mailsync command.

       mailsync is a way of keeping a collection of mailboxes synchronized.
       The mailboxes may be on the local filesystem or on an IMAP server.

       There are three invocations of mailsync:

       The first will synchronize two sets of mailboxes - in mailsync referred
       to as "stores".

       The second form will list the contents of a store. It's usage is
       recommended before synchronizing two stores to check whether mailsync
       is seeing what you are expecting it to see.

       The third form will show you what has changed in a store since the last
       sync.


OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -f file
              Use alternate config file.

       -n     Don't delete messages when synchronizing.

       -D     Delete any empty mailboxes after synchronizing..

       -m     Show from, subject, etc. of messages that are killed or moved
              when synchronzing.

       -M     Also show message-ids (turns on -m).

       -s     Says would would be done without doing it (turns on -n).
              Attention: this will change the "Seen" flag of emails and will
              create new, empty mailboxes in order to be able to compare them.

       -v     Show IMAP chatter.

       -vb    Show warning about braindammaged message ids

       -vw    Show warnings

       -vp    Show RFC 822 mail parsing errors

       -h     Show help.

       -d     Show debug info.  -di Debug/log IMAP protocol telemetry.  -dc
              Debug config.

       -t mid Use mailsync with specified message-id algorithm. Currently you
              have the choice between md5 and msgid (default). msgid uses the
              Message-ID in the mail header to identify a message. md5
              calculates a MD5 hash from the "From", "To", "Subject", "Date"
              and "Message-ID" headers and uses that as message identifier.

              If you use mailclients and servers that allow empty Message-IDs
              (f.ex. in mail drafts) then you should use the md5 algorithm.
