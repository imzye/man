METHODS
       new Creates a new Finance::Currency::Convert::XE object. Can be
           supplied with default values for source and target currency, and
           the format required of the output. These can be overridden in the
           convert() method.

       currencies
           Returns a plain array of the currencies available for conversion.

       add_currencies
           Allows the user to add currencies to the internal hash. Currencies
           can be added as per the code below:

               $self->add_currencies(
                           ZZZ => {text => 'An Example', symbol => '$'},
                           ZZY => {text => 'Testing'}
               );

           Note that unless otherwise stated, the symbol will be set to
           '&#164;'. The code used must be 3 characters in length, and a text
           part must be included.

       convert
           Converts some currency value into another using XE.com's UCC.

           An anonymous hash is used to pass parameters. Legal hash keys and
           values are as follows:

             convert(
               source => $currency_from,
               target => $currency_to,
               value  => $currency_from_value,
               format => $print_format
             );

           The format key is optional, and takes one of the following strings:

             'number' (returns '12.34')
             'symbol' (returns '&#163;12.34')
             'text'   (returns '12.34 Great Britain, Pound')
             'abbv'   (returns '12.34 GBP')

           If format key is omitted, 'number' is assumed and the converted
           value is returned.

           If only a value is passed, it is assumed that this is the value to
           be converted and the remaining parameters will be defined by the
           defaults set in the constructor. Note that no internal defaults are
           assumed.

           Note that not all countries have symbols in the standard character
           set.  Where known the appropriate currency symbol is used,
           otherwise the generic currency symbol is used.

           It should also be noted that there is a recommendation to use only
           the standardised three letter abbreviation ('abbv' above). However,
           for further reading please see:

       error
           Returns a (hopefully) meaningful error string.
