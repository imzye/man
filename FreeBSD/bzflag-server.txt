NAME
       bzw - BZFlag world file format

DESCRIPTION
       The BZFlag world file format describes a world environment that is used
       by the BZFlag game server, bzfs.  X BZW file format

       The BZFlag world file format describes and environment that includes
       the game map, physical world attributes, and automatic world weapons.
       The map may contain a variety of "obstacles" like buildings, pyramids,
       and meshes.  These obstacles make up the world that the BZFlag tanks
       will drive around in.  Map attributes may be set to create worlds of
       various sizes, the default size is 800x800.

       Here is small example world:

       # simple world containing a box, pyramid, and mesh
       world
         name Simple World
         size 100.0
       end
       box
         position -20 -20 0
         size 10 20 10
       end
       pyramid
         position 20 20 0
         size 10 10 20
       end
       mesh
         vertex -10 0 0
         vertex 10 0 0
         vertex 0 10 0
         face
           vertices 0 1 2
         endface
       end

       The .bzw file is a plain text file with a relatively simple file
       format.  The format of this text file consists of any number of objects
       listed in any order (except that physics, textureMatrix, dynamicColor,
       and material must come before they are referenced) separated by
       newlines and grouped into blocks of types. The list of world types
       consists of:
       world
       options
       waterLevel
       dynamicColor
       textureMatrix
       transform
       material
       physics
       define
       group
       mesh
       meshbox
       meshpyr
       arc
       cone
       sphere
       tetra
       box
       pyramid
       link
       teleporter
       base
       weapon
       zone

       Each object is described by placing the type on one line, the word end
       on a following line, and a list of attributes for that object, one per
       line, in between. The exceptions to the rule are define and face, which
       are concluded with enddef and endface.  Attributes may be listed in any
       order. Attributes have default values, and if that is good enough, the
       attribute need not be listed.

       Words are always specified in lowercase. Line comments can be specified
       by placing a # sign at the start of the line.

       For documentation purposes, you can tag each object by adding a name
       attribute. There is no set limit to the number of times you may use any
       of the objects except for the world, options, and waterLevel objects,
       they can only be specified once. The options object contains command
       line arguments that are used to configure the server's game mode, but
       can not contain server specific options such as -p, -passwd, and -conf.

       In the following examples, the values are the defaults.

       The World object
       Header for the world.

       world
         name example_world
         size 400.0
         flagHeight 10.0
       end

       The Options object
       A world file interface for setting command line options for BZFS.

       options
         -set _tankSpeed 36
         -j +r -ms 3
         +f GM{5} +f SW{5}
       end


       The Water Level object
       Sets how high the water is, in a matter of units.

       waterLevel
         name example_waterlevel
         height -1.0 # anything below 0 turns it off
       end


       The Group Definition object
       Defines a group, which may include other group instances
       This does not place any objects into the world, a group instance must
       be used to generate world objects from a group definition.

       define <example_groupdef>
         # You can add any object to a group definition,
         # except for the following types:
         #   textureMatrix
         #   dynamicColor
         #   material
         #   physics
         #   links
         #   weapon
         #   zone
       enddef


       The Group Instantiation object
       Instantiates a group, and possibly modifies subobjects

       group <example_groupdef>  # a valid group definition reference
         shift 0 0 0          # (repeatable)
         scale 1 1 1          # (repeatable)
         shear 0 0 0          # (repeatable)
         spin angle nx ny nz  # (repeatable)
                              # angle degrees about vector n
         team 0        # change all base colors within group
         tint 1 1 1 1  # hierarchically tints objects within this group
         drivethrough  # make all subobjects drivethrough
         shootthrough  # make all subobjects shootthrough
         ricochet      # make all subobjects ricochet   phydrv example_phydrv
       # reassign any valid physics drivers
         matref example_material # set material properties

                                   # (except for the color)
        matswap oldMat newMat #replace a given material in the instance
       end


       The Dynamic Color object

       dynamicColor
         name example_dyncol
         # there are 4 channels that can be modified:
         #   red, green, blue, alpha
         # there are 5 types of commands per channel:
         #   limits, sinusoid, clampUp, clampDown, sequence
         # except for "limits" and "sequence", the commands are repeatable
         # if a sequence is used, then clampUps and clampDowns have no effect
         # sequences can use three states (0, 1, 2).
         #   0 - equivalent to an active clampDown
         #   1 - equivalent to no clamps
         #   2 - equivalent to an active clampUp
         # if both clampUp and clampDown are active, the value is (min+max)/2
         # the sinusoid function starts at the max value
         # the sum of a channel's sinusoids is clamped between 0 and 1
         red limits 0 1               # min/max limits
         green sinusoid 0.1 0 0.25    # period, offset, weight
         blue clampUp 0.1 0 0.75      # period, offset, width
         alpha clampDown 0.2 0.5 0.5  # period, offset, width
         red sequence 0.0 0.0 2 0 1 1 2 0 ... # period, offset, list of states
       end


       The Texture Matrix object

       textureMatrix
         name example_texmat
         scale 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0  # u/v freqs, u/v scales
         spin 0.0               # rotation freq
         shift 0.0 0.0          # u/v freqs
         center 0.5 0.5         # dynamic u/v center (for spin and scale)
         fixedscale 0.0 0.0     # time invariant u/v scale
         fixedspin 0.0          # time invariant rotation
         fixedshift 0.0 0.0     # time invariant u/v shift
       end

       The Base object
       Creates a team base where the corresponding team's flag is stored.  The
       oncap option will fire a world weapon of the specified type when the
       team flag for this base is captured.

       base
         name example_base
         position 0.0 0.0 0.0
         size 60.0 60.0 0.0
         rotation 0.0
         color 0
         oncap V
       end


       The Weapon object
       Creates a world weapon, or a weapon fired automatically by the world.
       The weapon can either be timed or be event driven.  Timed weapons
       should use the initdelay and delay fields.  Event driven weapons need
       to use the trigger option to define what the trigger event is.  Valid
       trigger events are; OnCap, for flag capture events.  OnSpawn, for
       player spawn events.  OnDie, for player death events.  If the weapon is
       to be triggered only for a specific team then the eventteam option
       should be used with a team number (1 to 4).  An eventteam value of -1
       will trigger this weapon for any team. -1 is the default eventteam
       value.

       weapon
         name example_weapon
         position 0.0 0.0 0.0
         rotation 0.0
         tilt 0.0
         initdelay 10.0
         delay 10.0 3.0 5.0 3.0
         type V
         trigger flagcap
         eventteam V
       end


       The Zone object
       Specifies a certain range in the world, and what attributes that range
       has.

       zone
         name example_zone
         position 0.0 0.0 0.0
         size 1.0 1.0 1.0
         rotation 0.0
       # where players may spawn
         team 0 1 2 3 4
       # where flag may spawn
         flag GM SW good bad
       # dropped team flags will fly to the closest safety zone
         safety 1 2 3 4
       # attach a flag to this zone (always spawn in this zone)
         zoneflag GM 3  # type, count (type can be a team flag, ex: R*)
       end
