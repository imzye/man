NAME
       Object::AUTHORITY - adds an AUTHORITY method to your class

SYNOPSIS
        {
          package MyClass;
          use Object::AUTHORITY;
          BEGIN {
            $MyClass::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:TOBYINK';
            $MyClass::VERSION   = '0.001';
          }
        }

        print MyClass->AUTHORITY . "\n";   # prints "cpan:TOBYINK\n";
        MyClass->AUTHORITY('cpan:FOO');    # assertion fails, croaks.

DESCRIPTION
       This module adds an "AUTHORITY" function to your package, which works
       along the same lines as the "VERSION" function.

       The authority of a package can be defined like this:

        package MyApp;
        BEGIN { $MyApp::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:JOEBLOGGS'; }

       The authority should be a URI identifying the person, team,
       organisation or trained chimp responsible for the release of the
       package. The pseudo-URI scheme "cpan:" is the most commonly used
       identifier.

   "AUTHORITY"
       Called with no parameters returns the authority of the module.

   AUTHORITY($test)
       If passed a test, will croak if the test fails. The authority is tested
       against the test using something approximating Perl 5.10's smart match
       operator. (Briefly, you can pass a string for "eq" comparison, a
       regular expression, a code reference to use as a callback, or an array
       reference that will be grepped.)

   Utility Function
       "Object::AUTHORITY::reasonably_smart_match($a, $b)"
           Object::AUTHORITY exposes its smart match implementation in case
           classes wish to reuse it for their own custom "AUTHORITY" methods.
           (There are various interesting use cases for custom "AUTHORITY"
           methods, just as there are for custom "can" and "isa" methods.)

           The $a parameter is always assumed to be a simple scalar.
