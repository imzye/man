BLACKLIST
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lgogdownloader/blacklist.txt
       Allows user to specify individual files that should not be downloaded
       or mentioned as orphans. See also IGNORELIST for ignoring files during
       orphan check.

       Each line in the file specifies one blacklist expression, except for
       empty lines and lines starting with #.
       First few characters specify blacklist item type and flags.  So far,
       only regular expression (perl variant) are supported, so each line must
       start with "Rp" characters.  After a space comes the expression itself.
       Expressions are matched against file path relative to what was
       specified as --directory.

       Example black list
       # used to store manually downloaded mods/patches/maps/, don't mention
       it as orphans
       Rp ^[^/]*/manual/.*
       # included with every *divinity game, once is enough
       Rp beyond_divinity/extras/bd_ladymageknight.zip
       Rp divinity_2_developers_cut/extras/divinity_2_ladymageknight.zip

       # extra 6GB is A LOT of space if you don't actually plan to mod your
       game
       Rp the_witcher_2/extras/the_witcher_2_redkit.zip
       Rp the_witcher_2/extras/extras_pack_3_hu_pl_ru_tr_zh_.zip
       Rp the_witcher_2/extras/extras_pack_2_fr_it_jp_.zip

IGNORELIST
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lgogdownloader/ignorelist.txt
       Allows user to specify individual files that should not be mentioned as
       orphans.
       Basically the same as blacklist but is used only when checking for
       orphaned files.
       See BLACKLIST for details about formatting.



PRIORITIES
       Separating values with "," when using language and platform switches
       enables a priority-based mode: only the first matching one will be
       downloaded.

       For example, setting language to fr+en means both French and English
       will be downloaded (if available) for all games. Setting language to
       fr,en means that the French version (and only that one) will be
       downloaded if available, and if not, the English version will be
       downloaded.

       You're allowed to "stack" codes in the priority string if needed. If
       you set language to es+fr,en it means it'll download both Spanish (es)
       and French (fr) versions if they are available, and the English (en)
       one only if none of French and Spanish are available.

FILES

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lgogdownloader/
              Storage for configuration files and cookies

              $HOME/.config/lgogdownloader/.


       $XDG_CACHE_HOME/lgogdownloader/xml/
              Storage for XML files
              If $XDG_CACHE_HOME is not set, it will use
              $HOME/.cache/lgogdownloader/xml/.


       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lgogdownloader/blacklist.txt
              Allows user to specify individual files that should not be
              downloaded.
              It doesn't have to exist, but if it does exist, it must be
              readable to lgogdownloader.


       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lgogdownloader/ignorelist.txt
              Allows user to specify individual files that should not be
              mentioned as orphans.  The file has the same format and
              interpretation as a blacklist.
              It doesn't have to exist, but if it does exist, it must be
              readable to lgogdownloader.


       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lgogdownloader/gamespecific/gamename.conf
              JSON formatted file. Sets game specific settings for gamename.
              Allowed settings are language, platform, include, ignore-dlc-
              count, subdirectories, directory, subdir-game, subdir-
              installers, subdir-extras, subdir-patches, subdir-language-packs
              and subdir-dlc.
              Must be in the following format:
              {
                  "language" : <string>,
                  "platform" : <string>,
                  "include" : <string>,
                  "ignore-dlc-count" : <bool>,
                  "subdirectories" : <bool>,
                  "directory" : <string>,
                  "subdir-game" : <string>,
                  "subdir-installers" : <string>,
                  "subdir-extras" : <string>,
                  "subdir-patches" : <string>,
                  "subdir-language-packs" : <string>,
                  "subdir-dlc" : <string>
              }


       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lgogdownloader/transformations.json
              JSON formatted file. Used to transform gamenames.
              Must be in the following format:
              {
                  <string> :
                  {
                      "regex" : <string>,
                      "replacement" : <string>,
                      "exceptions" : [
                          <string>,
                          <string>,
                      ],
                  },
                  <string> :
                  {
                      "regex" : <string>,
                      "replacement" : <string>,
                  },
              }
              Member names are used to match the gamename (regex).  Member
              names must be unique.
              For example if the file contains 2 rules with "^x" then only the
              last one is applied.  However if user really wants multiple
              different rules for everything starting with "x" then adding
              wild wildcard matches makes them unique ("^x", "^x.*", "^x.*.*")
              If it matches then regex is used for the actual replacement
              using the value in replacement.
              "exceptions" is an optional array of gamenames excluded from the
              rule.  These are matched exactly, no regex.
              Example:
              match all games beginning with "b" and if they end with "_the"
              then remove "_the" at the end and prefix it with "the_" with
              exception of "blackwell_epiphany_the"
              {
                  "^b" :
                  {
                      "regex" : "(.*)_the$",
                      "replacement" : "the_\\1",
                      "exceptions" : [
                          "blackwell_epiphany_the",
                      ],
                  },
              }
