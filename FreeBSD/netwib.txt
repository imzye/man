NETWIB(3)              FreeBSD Library Functions Manual              NETWIB(3)

NAME
       netwib - network library


VERSION
       The version installed on this system is 5.38.0.


IMPORTANT
       Manpages do not contain a lot of information. Rather read
       netwib-5.38.0-doc_html.tgz.


PRESENTATION
       Netwib is a network library providing :
        - network features :
           + address conversion
           + udp/tcp clients/servers
           + packet encoding/decoding/displaying
           + spoofing
           + sniffing
           + etc.
        - and general features :
           + data conversion
           + chained list, hash
           + portable threads
           + etc.  Using all these functions, a network program can be quickly
       created.

       Netwib is available under the GNU GPL license. It was successfully
       installed under Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS,
       Solaris and HP-UX.

       This library has two main drawbacks:
        - In order to provide new features, functions prototypes may vary
          between versions. So, a program created with version 5.1.0 might not
          compile with version 5.5.0. To move around this problem, several
          versions of netwib can be simultaneously installed on the same
          system.
        - Netwib's features correspond to least common denominator of
       functions
          available on systems. This ensures a program compiled under one
          system will also compile on another. However, this design choice
       does
          not permit advanced features.  So, netwib is not suitable for long
       term projects. It is for small projects or quick hacks.

COMPILATION
       To compile a program with netwib :
        - add "#include <netwib.h>" at the top of your C file
        - compile with :
            gcc -o file file.c `netwib-config --cflags --libs`
            gcc -o file file.c `netwib-config -cl`
