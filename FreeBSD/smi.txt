NAME
       smi - Simple Markup Interpreter / Filter for simple markup

SYNTAX
       smi [ -h -n -v ] Input  Output
       smi [ -h -n -v ] InFile > OutFile

DESCRIPTION
       The smi interpreter, assumes the first argument (Input, or InFile)
       contains simple markup -- Markdown, for example.
       smi will return that Input, or InFile in HTML format.  Output, if not
       specified, will be to STDOUT. Which can be piped to something, or
       redirected, as desired. If Input is formatted in HTML markup, smi will
       return the meta-characters as their entities -- nice, if you'd like to
       display Markup in HTML <code> blocks. Given this fact, one might also
       consider smi a Filter, as well. Possible use cases, are quite broad,
       and can't possibly be fully deacribed here.


OPTIONS
       -h Help;
              Displays usage options.

       -n Strict Mode;
              escape HTML strictly (input).

       --v Version;
              Output version information, and exit.

FILES
       If no Outfile is given, Output is sent to standard output.  The Input,
       and Output are processed strictly serially; consequently smi may be
       used in pipe-lines.

EXAMPLES
       Create a web page, from one written in Markdown:

       smi Markdown.txt > Markdown.html

       Take the HTML file generated above, and make the output suitable for
       displaying within a <code> block on your web pages:

       smi -n Maekdown.html > Markdown.code


BUGS
       Strictly speaking, Markdown syntax still needs better interpretation.
       The only thing missing in this area, is handling of <cite>.
       Other than that; I am aware of no bugs. <cite>, and better
       documentation will be addressed in the next version.
