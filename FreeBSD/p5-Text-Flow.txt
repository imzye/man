NAME
       Text::Flow - Flexible text flowing and word wrapping for not just ASCII
       output.

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Flow;

         # use it on ASCII text ...
         my $flow = Text::Flow->new(
             check_height => sub {
                 my $paras = shift;
                 sum(map { scalar @$_ } @$paras) <= 10;
             },
             wrapper => Text::Flow::Wrap->new(
                 check_width  => sub { length($_[0]) < 70 }
             ),
         );

         my @sections = $flow->flow($text);

         # @sections will now be an array of strings, each string
         # will contain no more than 10 lines of text each of which
         # will be no longer then 70 characters long

         # or use it on text in a PDF file ...
         my $flow = Text::Flow->new(
             check_height => sub {
                 my $paras = shift;
                 (sum(map { scalar @$_ } @$paras) * $pdf->get_font_height) < 200;
             },
             wrapper => Text::Flow::Wrap->new(
                 check_width => sub {
                     my $string = shift;
                     $pdf->get_string_width($string) < 100
                 },
             )
         );

         my @sections = $flow->flow($text);

         # @sections will now be an array of strings, each string
         # will contain text which will fit within 200 pts and
         # each line will be no longer then 100 pts wide

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a flexible way to wrap and flow text for both
       ASCII and non-ASCII outputs.

   Another Text Wrap module!!?!?!
       The main purpose of this module is to provide text wrapping and flowing
       features without being tied down to ASCII based output and fixed-width
       fonts. My needs were for a more sophisticated text control in PDF and
       GIF output formats in particular.

METHODS
       new (%params)
           This constructs the new Text::Flow instance, and accepts parameters
           for the "wrapper" and "check_height" variables.

       wrapper (?$wrapper)
           This is the accessor for the internally help Text::Flow::Wrapper
           instance which is used by Text::Flow to wrap the individual lines.

       check_height
           This is the accessor for the CODE ref which is used to check the
           height of the current paragraph. It gets as an argument, an array-
           ref of paragraphs, each of which is also an array-ref of text
           lines. The most common usage is shown in the SYNOPSIS above, but
           you can really do anything you want with them. It is expected to
           return a Boolean value, true if the height is still okay, and false
           if the max height has been reached.

       flow ($text)
           This method preforms the text flowing. It returns an array of
           strings which can be treated as complete blocks of text. It will
           handle paragraph breaks and line breaks for you.

   Introspection
       meta
           Returns the Moose meta object associated with this class.

TODO
       I wanted to write some tests for using this with GD modules as well. I
       suppose we will have to wait until 0.02 for that.

SIMILAR MODULES
       There are a bunch of other text wrapping and flowing modules out there,
       but they are all meant for use in ASCII outout only. This just didn't
       work for my needs, so I wrote this one. If you need to wrap ASCII text
       and want to do it in a much simpler manner then this module provides,
       then I suggest checking out those modules. This module is specifically
       made for when those other modules are no longer powerful and flexible
       enough.

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
       exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to
       cpan-RT.
