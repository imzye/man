MLX5EN(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              MLX5EN(4)

NAME
     mlx5en – NVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX-4/5/6 [Dx/Ex/Lx] based 200Gb, 100Gb,
     50Gb, 40Gb, 25Gb and 10Gb ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           options COMPAT_LINUXKPI
           options RATELIMIT
           options KERN_TLS
           device xz
           device mlxfw
           device firmware
           device mlx5
           device mlx5en

     To load the driver as a module at run-time, run the following command as
     root:

           kldload mlx5en

     To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following lines in
     loader.conf(5):

           mlx5en_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The mlx5en driver provides support for PCI Express Ethernet adapters
     based on ConnectX-4/5/6 [Dx, Ex and Lx variants].  The driver supports
     Jumbo Frames, Transmit and Receive checksum offload, TCP segmentation
     offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO), HW Large Receive Offload (HW
     LRO), VLAN tag insertion and extraction, VLAN checksum offload, VLAN TSO,
     hardware rate limiting (TXRTLMT), stateless VxLAN hardware offload for
     receive and transmit, HW TLS offload for transmit, Receive Side Steering
     (RSS) and NUMA(4) awareness.

     The network interface name is mce<N> which corresponds to a PCI function,
     mlx_core<N>, where <N> is a number starting at zero.  There is at most
     one network interface per PCI function.

HARDWARE
     The mlx5en driver supports 200Gb, 100Gb, 50Gb, 40Gb, 25Gb and 10Gb
     ethernet adapters.

     •   ConnectX-6 supports 10/20/25/40/50/56/100Gb/200Gb/s speeds.
     •   ConnectX-5 supports 10/20/25/40/50/56/100Gb/s speeds.
     •   ConnectX-4 supports 10/20/25/40/50/56/100Gb/s speeds.
     •   ConnectX-4 LX supports 10/25/40/50Gb/s speeds and reduced power
         consumption.

CONFIGURATION
     The mlx5en network interface is configured using ifconfig(8) and the
     sysctl(8) tree at dev.mce.<N>.  All configurable entries are also
     tunables, and can be put directly into the loader.conf(5) for persistent
     configuration.
