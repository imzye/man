NAME
       Object::Role - base class for non-Moose roles

SYNOPSIS
        {
          package Object::Dumpable;
          use base qw/Object::Role/;
          use Data::Dumper;
          sub import
          {
            my ($class, @args) = @_;
            my ($caller, %args) = __PACKAGE__->parse_arguments(undef, @args);
            my $coderef = sub
              {
                my ($self) = @_;
                return Dumper($self);
              };
            __PACKAGE__->install_method(dump => $coderef, $caller);
          }
        }

        {
          package Foo;
          use Object::Dumpable;
          sub new { ... }
        }

        {
          package main;
          my $foo = Foo->new;
          warn $foo->dump;
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This will be better documented once I fully understand it myself!

       The idea of this is to be a base class for roles like Object::DOES,
       Object::Stash and Object::ID. It handles parsing of import arguments,
       installing methods into the caller's namespace (like Exporter, but
       using a technique that is immune to namespace::autoclean) and tracking
       which packages have consumed your role.

       While "Object::Role" is a base class for roles, it is not itself a
       role, so does not export anything. Instead, your role must inherit from
       it.

   Methods
       "parse_arguments($default_arg_name, @arguments)"
           Will parse:

             package My::Class;
             use My::Role -foo => 1, -bar => [2,3], 4, 5;

           as:

             (
               'My::Class',   # caller,
               (
                 '-foo'             => [1],
                 '-bar'             => [2, 3],
                 $default_arg_name  => [4, 5],
               )
             )

       "install_method($subname => $coderef, $package)"
           Installs $coderef as "$package\::$subname".

           Automatically calls register_consumer($package).

       register_consumer($package)
           Records that $package has consumed (used) your role.

       has_consumer($package)
           Check if $package has consumed (used) your role.
