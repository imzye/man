NAME
     password.lua – FreeBSD password module

DESCRIPTION
     password.lua contains functionality for prompting for and checking
     passwords.

     Before using the functionality provided by password.lua, it must be
     included with a statement such as the following:

           local password = require("password")

     The following functions are exported from password.lua:

           password.read(prompt_length)    Read a password following a prompt.
                                           prompt_length is required so that
                                           the twiddle may be properly drawn
                                           as the user is typing.

           password.check()                Drives the primary password checks
                                           done by the loader.  The
                                           password.check() function will
                                           check bootlock_password,
                                           geom_eli_passphrase_prompt, and
                                           password and prompt the user for
                                           passwords as-needed.  If password
                                           is set, the autoboot sequence will
                                           begin as the user is prompted for a
                                           password.
