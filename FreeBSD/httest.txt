       -f --flags
              Space separated NTLM flags neg-unicode:

       Indicates that Unicode strings are
              supported for use in security buffer data.

       neg-oem:
              Indicates that OEM strings are supported for use in security
              buffer data.

       req-target:
              Requests that the server's authentication realm be included in
              the Type 2 message.

       neg-sign:
              Specifies that authenticated communication between the client
              and server should carry a digital signature (message integrity).

       neg-seal:
              Specifies that authenticated communication between the client
              and server should be encrypted (message confidentiality).

       neg-datagram-style:
              Indicates that datagram authentication is being used.

       neg-lm-key:
              Indicates that the Lan Manager Session Key should be used for
              signing and sealing authenticated communications.

       neg-netware:
              This flag's usage has not been identified.

       neg-ntlm-key:
              Indicates that NTLM authentication is being used.

       neg-anonymous:
              Sent by the client in the Type 3 message to indicate that an
              anonymous context has been established. This also affects the
              response fields.

       neg-domain-supp:
              Sent by the client in the Type 1 message to indicate that the
              name of the domain in which the client workstation has
              membership is included in the message.  This is used by the
              server to determine whether the client is eligible for local
              authentication.

       neg-workstation-supp:
              Sent by the client in the Type 1 message to indicate that the
              client workstation's name is included in the message. This is
              used by the server to determine whether the client is eligible
              for local authentication.

       neg-local-call:
              Sent by the server to indicate that the server and client are on
              the same machine.  Implies that the client may use the
              established local credentials for authentication instead of
              calculating a response to the challenge.

       neg-always_sign:
              Indicates that authenticated communication between the client
              and server should be signed with a "dummy" signature.

       target-type-domain:
              Sent by the server in the Type 2 message to indicate that the
              target authentication realm is a domain.

       target-type-server:
              Sent by the server in the Type 2 message to indicate that the
              target authentication realm is a server.

       target-type-share:
              Sent by the server in the Type 2 message to indicate that the
              target authentication realm is a share.  Presumably, this is for
              share-level authentication. Usage is unclear.

       neg-ntlm2-key:
              Indicates that the NTLM2 signing and sealing scheme should be
              used for protecting authenticated communications.  Note that
              this refers to a particular session security scheme, and is not
              related to the use of NTLMv2 authentication. This flag can,
              however, have an effect on the response calculations

       req-init-res:
              This flag's usage has not been identified

       req-accept-res:
              This flag's usage has not been identified

       req-nonnt-session-key:
              This flag's usage has not been identified

       neg-target-info:
              Sent by the server in the Type 2 message to indicate that it is
              including a Target Information block in the message. The Target
              Information block is used in the calculation of the NTLMv2
              response.

       neg-128:
              Indicates that 128-bit encryption is supported.

       neg-key-exchange:
              Indicates that the client will provide an encrypted master key
              in the "Session Key" field of the Type 3 message.

       neg-56:
              Indicates that 56-bit encryption is supported.
