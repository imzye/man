NAME
       fusepod - iPod virtual filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       fusepod [ options ] mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       FUSEPod is a userspace virtual filesystem which mounts your iPod into a
       directory for easy browsing of your songs on your iPod.

USAGE
       To mount your ipod type at the console:
              fusepod mount_to

       If FUSEPod fails to find your iPod you can specify the iPod's
       mountpoint through the environment variable IPOD_DIR.  Note that the
       iPod must already be mounted so that you can read it.

       For example, say my iPod is mounted at /media/IPOD and I want to mount
       the FUSEPod layer at /home/keegan/ipod

       You would enter at the console:
              IPOD_DIR="/media/IPOD" fusepod /home/keegan/ipod

       You can also create the necessary files and directories for your iPod
       to work.  FUSEPod will prompt you if you specify IPOD_DIR which does
       not have the necessary structure.

       To unmount FUSEPod type at the console:
              fusermount -u mounted_to

       To add songs copy them too
              [mounted_to]/Transfer

       Or add the absolute path of the song to the file
              [mounted_to]/add_songs

       You can also add files and recusrively add directories through
              [mounted_to]/add_files.sh [ files/directories ] ...

       And then to sync the database and copy the files run
              [mounted_to]/sync_ipod.sh [ -watch ]

       You can the view all the songs that will be added to the iPod by
       viewing the files in the Transfer directory and the songs in the file
       add_songs.

       If you are happy with the contents of add_songs and the Transfer
       directory you can run the command:
              ./sync_ipod.sh
