NAME
       catalog_convert - convert astronomical catalogs between different
       formats

SYNOPSIS
           catalog_convert [--infmt FORMAT] [--outfmt FORMAT] [--clobber] INFILE OUTFILE

DESCRIPTION
       This program converts catalogs between the various formats which the
       Astro::Catalog library can read and write.  It will attempt to infer
       the format of the input and output files by the pattern of their names.
       If this is not successful or the wrong format is inferred, the
       "--infmt" and / or "--outfmt" options should be specified.

       The input and / or output files can be given as -, in which case the
       program will read from standard input / write to standard output.  In
       this case the corresponding formats must be specified.

OPTIONS
       --infmt
           The format of the input catalog.

       --inopt
           Input reading options.  This is a comma-separated list of key=value
           pairs.  E.g.:

               telecope=ARECIBO,tag=SCIENCE

       --outfmt
           The format in which to write the catalog.

       --outopt
           Output writing options, formatted as for input options.

       --clobber
           This option can be specified to allow OUTFILE to overwrite an
           existing file.

       --epoch
           Apply the given epoch (in ISO8601 format) to items with coordinates
           of type "RADEC" in the input catalog, replacing such coordinates
           with the apparent position of the item at this time in J2000.  This
           can be used to convert a catalog with proper motion and parallax
           values to one without.  The current time can be used by specifying
           the epoch as "now".

FORMATS
       The following formats may be supported.  Note that not all formats
       support both reading and writing catalogs.
