DESCRIPTION
       Converts the specified file(s) containing C/C++ code to Postscript
       output conforming to the Adobe Structuring Conventions.

       If no input file is specified then input is accepted from stdin.
       Postscript output is directed to stdout unless you specify an output
       file.  The actual output page may be out with one, two or four columns.

       Supported paper types are A4 and Letter.

       Tabs in the input stream are expanded (by default) by blank characters
       to the closest modulo 8 position. You can specify your own constant
       number of blanks different from 8 for a tab to expand.

       A formfeed (^L) character makes the converter move to the next column.

       By default, C/C++ constructs are highlighted with following standard
       fonts presented on every Postscript printer:

            Preprocessor directivesCourier-BoldOblique

            Comments               Helvetica-Oblique

            Strings                Courier-Oblique

            Keywords               Courier-Bold

            Line numbers           Times-Roman

            Types                  Courier-Bold

            Function identificatorsBookman-LightItalic

       The rest is printed with Courier (default font). If highlighting is
       disabled only the default font is used to print the read code (but not
       line numbers).

       Comments may be printed dimmed to a configurable degree in a way that
       allows reader to concentrate mainly on the source itself referring to
       comments only when needed.

       c2ps has basic preprocessor capabilities. You may define/undefine
       preprocessor variables in the command line.  c2ps will neglect those
       pieces of code that are cut out by the preprocessor given a set of
       mentioned variables.

       By default, on each column c2ps draws an alphabetic index of all
       function id definitions with locations, scanned from the beginning of
       the file being printed.  As the number of these id's grows the font
       used to print the index may get smaller in order to accommodate all the
       entries.

       Occasionally, function index is drawn upon already printed source code.
       To cope with this you can either cancel the index option or use smaller
       fonts.

       All the read symbols with codes 128..255 (0x80..0xff) are printed
       escaped so that c2ps output is all clean 7-bit ascii and can be sent
       over the Internet without uuencoding.

       You can easily print source including fragments in Cyrillic, Hebrew,
       Arabic etc.  which may be found in string and/or comments if you're
       printing C/C++ code and anywhere otherwise. You just need a postscript
       font with encoding corresponding to the one that is used in the above
       fragments. If there's no suitable built-in font in your PS printer you
       will have to prepend one to c2ps output.

       If the symbols from the both halves of the code table are implemented
       in your PS font, you may simply use it to print any constructs that
       include 8-bit text (don't forget to disable ISO Latin 1 font
       reencoding).  Otherwise, with only upper half symbols (with codes >
       127(0x7f)) implemented, there is an option to set a font to print
       specifically these symbols leaving the rest to be printed by either
       default or newly set fonts.

       Also, as much as we know there exists a version of c2ps modified to
       support Chinese (Hanja) and Korean (Hangul). An address of the
       implementor is on the c2ps web page.

       This is a manual page for c2ps ver4.0


OPTIONS
       -? -h  Print usage message.


       -1     Specify single column per page output - default (portrait).


       -2     Specify two columns per page output (1/2 size, landscape).


       -4     Specifiy four columns per page output (1/4 size, portrait).


       -a     Disable adjusted multiple lines comments printing.


       -b     Disable drawing a box containing alphabetic index of functions
              scanned from the beginning of the file.


       -c     Disable C/C++ construct highlighting.


       -e     Disable printing entry/exit function name in the column's
              header.


       -i     Disable ISO 8859-1 (ISO Latin 1) character encoding.


       -k     Use standard set of keywords rather than extended one.


       -m     When printing a file use the date of printing instead of file's
              last modification date.


       -n     Disable line numbering.


       -r     Draw a frame round each column.


       -u     Disable drawing header at the top of each column.


       -v     Print current version.


       -w     Disable wrapping too wide lines onto following lines.  Note,
              that when wrapping is enabled the maximum number of characters
              in line printed with any font is the number of the same point
              size Courier characters that may appear in single line without
              crossing column's border.


       -x     Automatically toggle C/C++ highlight flag for each file
              according to its extension.  ( Applicable extensions include  .c
              .h .cc .hh .cpp .hpp )


       -F defaultfont
              Use defaultfont as default font.


       -C commentfont
               Use commentfont to print comments.


       -K keywordfont
              Use keywordfont to print keywords.


       -N lnumberfont
              Use lnumberfont to print line numbers.


       -P preprocfont
              Use preprocfont to print preprocessor directives.


       -S stringfont
              Use stringfont to print strings.


       -T typefont
              Use typefont to print types.


       -U functionfont
              Use functionfont to print function identificators being defined.


       -X nonlatinfont
              Use nonlatinfont to print all symbols with codes > 127(0x7f).
              ISO Latin 1 encoding is automatically cancelled.


       -d dim Print comments dimmed with the coefficient dim.
               ( black: 0.0 <= dim <= 1.0 :white ). Default is 0.75.  So you
              can actually get rid of the comments in your printout by setting
              dim coef. to 1.0


       -f pointsize
              Use pointsize -scaled fonts ( 10 - default ).


       -l lines
              Make converter start a new column after each set of lines
              printed lines. You may want to use the resulted at the bottom of
              the column white space for notes if the space on the right is
              not sufficient.


       -p paper
              Paper type specification ( A4 - default, Letter ).


       -s points
              Leave points * 1/72 inch space between lines ( 0.0 - default ).


       -t tabsize
              Expand each read tab with blanks to a next modulo tabsize
              position ( 8 - default ).


       -_  fun_highlight
              Specify function id highlighting type ( none, box, underline -
              default ).


       -DPREPROC_VAR

       -UPREPROC_VAR
              You may define or undefine preprocessor variables in a standard
              compiler option fashion.

              Below:
               +/-: printed/not printed by c2ps
               column 1: for variable X not mentioned in command line
               column 2: for variable X defined
               column 3: for variable X undefined

                 1  2  3
                 +  -  -  #ifdef X
                 +  +  -    C/C++ code (+ preprocessor directives)
                 +  -  -  #else
                 +  -  +    C/C++ code (+ preprocessor directives)
                 +  -  -  #endif

              Similarly for #ifndef, just switch columns 2 and 3.



EXAMPLES
       Multiple files
          c2ps *.c *.h | lpr

       Ordinary text
          c2ps note.txt -c -n -u > note.ps

       ISO Latin 1 font reencoding by default
          c2ps -2 -c -n -F Times-Roman german.txt > german.ps

       A different look
          c2ps -F Times-Roman -C Palatino-BoldItalic -K Times-Bold
               -N Helvetica -P Helvetica-Bold -S Times-Italic
               -T Times-BoldItalic -_ box -w sample.c > sample.ps

       An option set looking better on low resolution printers
          c2ps -d 0 -C Palatino-Italic main.cc > main.ps

       Partial preprocessing, selective printing
          c2ps -DDEBUG -DSUN_SPECIFIC -UPRINT *.cc | lpr

       Temporarily commented out code (still looks like a part of the code but
       a little bit dimmed)
          c2ps -C Courier -d 0.5 temp.c -o temp.ps

       Getting rid of comments
          c2ps -_ box -d 1 main.cc | lpr

       Printing 8-bit text (e.g. Cyrillic, koi-8 encoding)
          c2ps -i -C Antique-Italic -S Antique koi8.cc > tmp
          cat Antique-Italic.pfa Antique.pfa tmp | lpr

          c2ps -i -c -n -F Antique koi8.cc > tmp
          cat Antique.pfa tmp | lpr

          c2ps -X Cyrillic-Italic-koi8 koi8.cc > tmp
          cat Cyrillic-Italic-koi8.ps tmp | lpr
