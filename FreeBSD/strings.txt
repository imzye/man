STRINGS(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             STRINGS(1)

NAME
     strings – print the strings of printable characters in files

SYNOPSIS
     strings [-a | --all] [-e encoding | --encoding=encoding]
             [-f | --print-file-name] [-h | --help]
             [-n number | --bytes=number | -number] [-o]
             [-t radix | --radix=radix] [-v | --version] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each file specified, the strings utility prints contiguous sequences
     of printable characters that are at least n characters long and are
     followed by an unprintable character.  The default value of n is 4.  By
     default, the strings utility only scans the initialized and loaded
     sections of ELF objects; for other file types, the entire file is
     scanned.  The strings utility is mainly used for determining the contents
     of non-text files.

     If no file name is specified as an argument, standard input is read.

     The following options are available:

     -a | --all
             For ELF objects, scan the entire file for printable strings.

     -e encoding | --encoding=encoding
             Select the character encoding to be used while searching for
             strings.  Valid values for argument encoding are:
             s       for single 7-bit-byte characters (ASCII, ISO 8859).
             S       for single 8-bit-byte characters.
             l       for 16-bit little-endian.
             b       for 16-bit big-endian.
             L       for 32-bit little-endian.
             B       for 32-bit big-endian.
             The default is to assume that characters are encoded using a
             single 7-bit byte.

     -f | --print-file-name
             Print the name of the file before each string.

     -h | --help
             Print a usage summary and exit.

     -n number | --bytes=number | -number
             Print the contiguous character sequence of at least number
             characters long, instead of the default of 4 characters.
             Argument number should specify a positive decimal integer.

     -o      Equivalent to specifying -t o.

     -t radix | --radix=radix
             Print the offset from the start of the file before each string
             using the specified radix.  Valid values for argument radix are:
             d       for decimal
             o       for octal
             x       for hexadecimal

     -v | --version
             Display a version identifier and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     The strings utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To display strings in /bin/ls use:
           $ strings /bin/ls

     To display strings in all sections of /bin/ln use:
           $ strings -a /bin/ln

     To display strings in all sections of /bin/cat prefixed with the filename
     and the offset within the file use:
           $ strings -a -f -t x /bin/cat

HISTORY
     The first FreeBSD strings utility appeared in FreeBSD v3. It was later
     discontinued in FreeBSD v5, when i386-only a.out format was dropped in
     favor of ELF.
