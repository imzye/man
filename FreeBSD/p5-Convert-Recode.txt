NAME
       Convert::Recode - make mapping functions between character sets

SYNOPSIS
         use Convert::Recode qw(ebcdic_to_ascii);

         while (<>) {
            print ebcdic_to_ascii($_);
         }

DESCRIPTION
       The Convert::Recode module can provide mapping functions between
       character sets on demand.  It depends on GNU recode to provide the raw
       mapping data, i.e. GNU recode must be installed first.  The name of the
       mapping function is constructed by taking the names of the two charsets
       and joining them with the string "_to_".  For example, if you want to
       convert between the "mac" and the "latin1" charsets, just import the
       mac_to_latin1() function.

       If you prefix the function name with "strict_", any characters that
       cannot be mapped are removed during transformation.  For instance, the
       strict_mac_to_latin1() function converts a string to latin1 and removes
       all mac characters that do not have a corresponding latin1 character.

       Running the command "recode -l" should give you the list of available
       character sets.
