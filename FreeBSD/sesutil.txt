NAME
     sesutil – Utility for managing SCSI Enclosure Services (SES) device

SYNOPSIS
     sesutil fault [-u /dev/sesN] ⟨disk | sesid | all⟩ [on | off]
     sesutil locate [-u /dev/sesN] ⟨disk | sesid | all⟩ [on | off]
     sesutil map [--libxo options] [-u /dev/sesN]
     sesutil show [--libxo options] [-u /dev/sesN]
     sesutil status [--libxo options] [-u /dev/sesN]

DESCRIPTION
     The sesutil utility can be used to query and modify various parameter of
     SCSI Enclosure Services (SES) devices.

     List of supported commands:

     --libxo
             Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human
             and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3)

     fault [-u /dev/sesN] ⟨disk | all⟩ [on | off]
             Change the state of the external fault LED associated with disk.
             disk can be the device name of the disk, like da12, or ‘all’.  to
             indicate all disks attached to SES controllers.

     fault -u /dev/sesN sesid [on | off]
             Change the state of the external fault LED associated with an
             element connected to the SES controller.  sesid must be the
             element ID of a valid item attached to the controller.  Use the
             map command to list the elements attached to a controller.

     locate [-u /dev/sesN] ⟨disk | all⟩ [on | off]
             Change the state of the external locate LED associated with disk.
             disk can be the device name of the disk, like da12, or ‘all’.  to
             indicate all disks attached to SES controllers.

     locate -u /dev/sesN sesid [on | off]
             Change the state of the external locate LED associated with an
             element connected to the SES controller.  sesid must be the
             element ID of a valid item attached to the controller.  Use the
             map command to list the elements attached to a controller.

     show [-u /dev/sesN]
             Display user-friendly summary of specified ses(4) controller.  If
             no controller is specified, all controllers are mapped.

     map [-u /dev/sesN]
             Display a map of all elements connected to the specified ses(4)
             controller.  If no controller is specified, all controllers are
             mapped.

     status [-u /dev/sesN]
             Display the status of the specified ses(4) controller.  If no
             controller is specified, the status of each controller is
             returned.

EXAMPLES
     Turn off all locate LEDs:

           sesutil locate all off

     Turn on the locate LED for the drive bay corresponding to da15:

           sesutil locate da15 on

     Turn on the fault LED for a drive bay not associated with a device:

           sesutil fault -u /dev/ses2 7 on
