MDIO(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                MDIO(4)

NAME
     mdio – IEEE 802.3 Management Data Input/Output interface

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device mdio

DESCRIPTION
     The mdio driver provides an interconnection between the Media Access
     Control (MAC) sublayer and Physical Layer (PHY) entities' control and
     status registers, as defined by the IEEE 802.3 Standard.

     The mdio layer allows device drivers to share common support code for
     various external PHY devices.

     MDIO is one of two signal interfaces that comprise the Media Independent
     Interface (MII) defined by the IEEE 802.3 Standard.  The miibus(4) driver
     provides support for devices that require full MII support.

SEE ALSO
     miibus(4)

STANDARDS
     More information on MDIO can be found in the IEEE 802.3 Standard.

HISTORY
     The mdio driver first appeared in FreeBSD 10.0.

AUTHORS
     The driver was written by Stefan Bethke <stb@lassitu.de>.
