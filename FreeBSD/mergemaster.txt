MERGEMASTER(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         MERGEMASTER(8)

NAME
     mergemaster – merge configuration files, et al during an upgrade

SYNOPSIS
     mergemaster [-scrvhpCP] [-a|iFU] [--run-updates=[always|never]]
                 [-m /path/to/sources] [-t /path/to/temp/root] [-d] [-u N]
                 [-w N] [-A Target architecture] [-D /destdir/path]

DESCRIPTION
     The mergemaster utility is a Bourne shell script which is designed to aid
     you in updating the various configuration and other files associated with
     FreeBSD.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you back up your /etc directory
     before beginning this process.

     The script uses /usr/src/Makefile to build a temporary root environment
     from / down, populating that environment with the various files.  You can
     specify a different source directory with the -m command line option, or
     specify the destination directory with the -D option.  It then compares
     each file in that environment to its installed counterpart.  When the
     script finds a change in the new file, or there is no installed version
     of the new file it gives you four options to deal with it.  You can
     install the new file as is, delete the new file, merge the old and new
     files (as appropriate) using sdiff(1) or leave the file in the temporary
     root environment to merge by hand later.

     By default it creates the temporary root in /var/tmp/temproot and
     compares the Version Control System (VCS) Id strings ($FreeBSD) for files
     that have them, deleting the temporary file if the strings match.  If
     there is no Id string, or if the strings are different it compares the
     files themselves.  You can also specify that the script ignore the Id
     strings and compare every file with the -s option.  Using the -F option
     mergemaster will install the new file for you if they differ only by VCS
     strings.

     The merge menu option is designed to let you easily combine your
     customizations from the old version of a file into the new one.  While
     you can use the merge function to incorporate changes from files that you
     have not customized, it is not recommended.

     The mergemaster utility checks your umask and issues a warning for
     anything other than 022.  While it is not mandatory to grant world read
     permissions for most configuration files, you may run into problems
     without them.  If you choose a umask other than 022 and experience
     trouble later this could be the cause.  /etc/master.passwd is treated as
     a special case.  If you choose to install this file or a merged version
     of it the file permissions are always 600 (rw-------) for security
     reasons.  After installing an updated version of this file you should
     probably run pwd_mkdb(8) with the -p option to rebuild your password
     databases and recreate /etc/passwd.

     The script uses the owner and group ids that the files are created with
     by /usr/src/etc/Makefile, and file permissions as specified by the umask.
     Unified diffs are used by default to display any differences unless you
     choose context diffs.

     The mergemaster utility will source scripts that you specify right before
     it starts the comparison, and after it is done running.  The easiest way
     to handle this is to place the path to the script(s) in the appropriate
     variables in your .mergemasterrc file.  The script sourced before
     comparison is named in MM_PRE_COMPARE_SCRIPT, and the one sourced after
     the script is done is MM_EXIT_SCRIPT.  This is the recommended way to
     specify local modifications, or files that you want to give special
     handling to.  This includes files that you want to be deleted without
     being compared.  Because the named scripts are sourced from within
     mergemaster, all of the script's variables are available for use in your
     custom script.  You can also use /etc/mergemaster.rc which will be read
     before .mergemasterrc.  Options specified on the command line are updated
     last, and therefore can override both files.

     When the comparison is done if there are any files remaining in the
     temproot directory they will be listed, and if the -a option is not in
     use the user will be given the option of deleting the temproot directory.
     If there are no files remaining in the temproot directory it will be
     deleted.

     The options are as follows:

     -s          Perform a strict comparison, diffing every pair of files.
                 This comparison is performed line by line, without regard to
                 VCS Ids.

     -c          Use context diffs instead of unified diffs.

     -r          Re-run mergemaster on a previously cleaned directory,
                 skipping the creation of the temporary root environment.
                 This option is compatible with all other options.

     -v          Be more verbose about the process.  You should probably use
                 this option the first time you run mergemaster.  This option
                 also gives you a list of files that exist only in the
                 installed version of /etc.

     -a          Run automatically.  This option will leave all the files that
                 differ from the installed versions in the temporary directory
                 to be dealt with by hand.  If the temproot directory exists,
                 it creates a new one in a previously non-existent directory.
                 This option unsets the verbose flag, and is not compatible
                 with -i, -F, or -U.  Setting -a makes -w superfluous.

     -h          Display usage and help information.

     -i          Automatically install any files that do not exist in the
                 destination directory.

     -p          Pre-buildworld mode.  Compares only files known to be
                 essential to the success of {build|install}world, i.e.,
                 /etc/group and /etc/master.passwd.

     -F          If the files differ only by VCS Id ($FreeBSD) install the new
                 file.

     -C          After a standard mergemaster run, compares your
                 rc.conf[.local] options to the defaults.

     -P          Preserve files that you replace in
                 /var/tmp/mergemaster/preserved-files-<date>, or another
                 directory you specify in your mergemaster rc file.

     -U          Attempt to auto upgrade files that have not been user
                 modified.  This option can be dangerous when there are
                 critical changes in the new versions that affect your running
                 system.

     --run-updates=[always|never]
                 Specify always or never to run newaliases, pwd_mkdb, etc.  at
                 the end of the comparison run.  If this option is omitted the
                 default is to prompt the user for each update as necessary.

     -m /path/to/sources
                 Specify the path to the directory where you want to do the
                 make(1).  (In other words, where your sources are, but -s was
                 already taken.)  In older versions of mergemaster the path to
                 src/etc was required.  mergemaster will convert the path if
                 this older method is used.

     -t /path/to/temp/root
                 Create the temporary root environment in /path/to/temp/root
                 instead of the default /var/tmp/temproot.

     -d          Add the date and time to the name of the temporary root
                 directory.  If -t is specified, this option must follow it if
                 you want the date added too.

     -u N        Specify a numeric umask.  The default is 022.

     -w N        Supply an alternate screen width to the sdiff(1) command in
                 numbers of columns.  The default is 80.

     -A Target architecture
                 Specify an alternative TARGET_ARCH architecture name.

     -D /path    Specify the destination directory for the installed files.

ENVIRONMENT
     The mergemaster utility uses the PAGER environment variable if set.
     Otherwise it uses less(1).  If PAGER specifies a program outside its
     limited PATH without specifying the full path, mergemaster prompts you
     with options on how to proceed.  The MM_PRE_COMPARE_SCRIPT and
     MM_EXIT_SCRIPT variables are used as described above.  Other variables
     that are used by the script internally can be specified in .mergemasterrc
     as described in more detail below.

FILES
     /etc/mergemaster.rc
     $HOME/.mergemasterrc

     The mergemaster utility will . (source) these files if they exist.
     Command line options will override rc file options.  $HOME/.mergemasterrc
     overrides /etc/mergemaster.rc.  Here is an example with all values
     commented out:

     # These are options for mergemaster, with their default values listed
     # The following options have command line overrides
     #
     # The target architecture (-A, unset by default)
     #ARCHSTRING='TARGET_ARCH=<foo>'
     #
     # Sourcedir is the directory to do the 'make' in (-m)
     #SOURCEDIR='/usr/src'
     #

     # ***DANGEROUS***
     #AUTO_UPGRADE=
     #
     # Either always or never run newaliases, pwd_mkdb at the end (--run-updates)
     #RUN_UPDATES=
     #
     # Compare /etc/rc.conf[.local] to /etc/defaults/rc.conf (-C)
     #COMP_CONFS=
     #
     # Preserve files that you replace (-P)
     #PRESERVE_FILES=
     #PRESERVE_FILES_DIR=/var/tmp/mergemaster/preserved-files-`date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S`
     #
     # The umask for mergemaster to compare the default file's modes to (-u)
     #NEW_UMASK=022
     #
     # The following options have no command line overrides
     #
     # Files to always avoid comparing
     #IGNORE_FILES='/etc/motd /etc/printcap foo bar'
     #
     # Additional options for diff.  This will get unset when using -s.
     #DIFF_OPTIONS='-Bb'     # Ignore changes in whitespace
     #

     #MTREEDB='/var/db'
     #
     # For those who just cannot stand including the full path to PAGER
     #DONT_CHECK_PAGER=
     #
     # If you set 'yes' above, make sure to include the PATH to your pager
     #PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
     #
     # Delete stale files in /etc/rc.d without prompting
     #DELETE_STALE_RC_FILES=
     #
     # Specify the path to scripts to run before the comparison starts,
     # and/or after the script has finished its work
     #MM_PRE_COMPARE_SCRIPT=
     #MM_EXIT_SCRIPT=

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on successful completion, or if the user bails out
     manually at some point during execution.

     Exit status is 1 if it fails for one of the following reasons:

     Invalid command line option

     Failure to create the temporary root environment

     Failure to populate the temporary root

     Presence of the 'nodev' option in <DESTDIR>/etc/fstab

     Failure to install a file

EXAMPLES
     Typically all you will need to do is type mergemaster at the prompt and
     the script will do all the work for you.

     To use context diffs and have mergemaster explain more things as it goes
     along, use:

           # mergemaster -cv

     To specify that mergemaster put the temporary root environment in
     /usr/tmp/root, use:

           # mergemaster -t /usr/tmp/root

     To specify a 110 column screen with a strict comparison, use:

           # mergemaster -sw 110

HISTORY
     The mergemaster utility was first publicly available on one of my web
     pages in a much simpler form under the name comproot on 13 March 1998.
     The idea for creating the temporary root environment comes from Nik
     Clayton's make world tutorial which is referenced above.
