NAME
       Pod::Eventual - read a POD document as a series of trivial events

VERSION
       version 0.094003

SYNOPSIS
         package Your::Pod::Parser;
         use base 'Pod::Eventual';

         sub handle_event {
           my ($self, $event) = @_;

           print Dumper($event);
         }

DESCRIPTION
       POD is a pretty simple format to write, but it can be a big pain to
       deal with reading it and doing anything useful with it.  Most existing
       POD parsers care about semantics, like whether a "=item" occurred after
       an "=over" but before a "back", figuring out how to link a "L<>", and
       other things like that.

       Pod::Eventual is much less ambitious and much more stupid.
       Fortunately, stupid is often better.  (That's what I keep telling
       myself, anyway.)

       Pod::Eventual reads line-based input and produces events describing
       each POD paragraph or directive it finds.  Once complete events are
       immediately passed to the "handle_event" method.  This method should be
       implemented by Pod::Eventual subclasses.  If it isn't, Pod::Eventual's
       own "handle_event" will be called, and will raise an exception.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

METHODS
   read_handle
         Pod::Eventual->read_handle($io_handle, \%arg);

       This method iterates through the lines of a handle, producing events
       and calling the "handle_event" method.

       The only valid argument in %arg (for now) is "in_pod", which indicates
       whether we should assume that we are parsing pod when we start parsing
       the file.  By default, this is false.

       This is useful to behave differently when reading a .pm or .pod file.

       Important: the handle is expected to have an encoding layer so that it
       will return text, not bytes, on reads.

   read_file
       This behaves just like "read_handle", but expects a filename rather
       than a handle.  The file will be assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.

   read_string
       This behaves just like "read_handle", but expects a string containing
       POD text rather than a handle.

   handle_event
       This method is called each time Pod::Eventual finishes scanning for a
       new POD event.  It must be implemented by a subclass or it will raise
       an exception.

   handle_nonpod
       This method is called each time a non-POD segment is seen -- that is,
       lines after "=cut" and before another command.

       If unimplemented by a subclass, it does nothing by default.

   handle_blank
       This method is called at the end of a sequence of one or more blank
       lines.

       If unimplemented by a subclass, it does nothing by default.

EVENTS
       There are four kinds of events that Pod::Eventual will produce.  All
       are represented as hash references.

   Command Events
       These events represent commands -- those things that start with an
       equals sign in the first column.  Here are some examples of POD and the
       event that would be produced.

       A simple header:

         =head1 NAME

         { type => 'command', command => 'head1', content => "NAME\n", start_line => 4 }

       Notice that the content includes the trailing newline.  That's to
       maintain similarity with this possibly-surprising case:

         =for HTML
         We're actually still in the command event, here.

         {
           type    => 'command',
           command => 'for',
           content => "HTML\nWe're actually still in the command event, here.\n",
           start_line => 8,
         }

       Pod::Eventual does not care what the command is.  It doesn't keep track
       of what it's seen or whether you've used a command that isn't defined.
       The only special case is "=cut", which is never more than one line.

         =cut
         We are no longer parsing POD when this line is read.

         {
           type    => 'command',
           command => 'cut',
           content => "\n",
           start_line => 15,
         }

       Waiving this special case may be an option in the future.

   Text Events
       A text event is just a paragraph of text, beginning after one or more
       empty lines and running until the next empty line (or =cut).  In Perl
       5's standard usage of Pod, text content that begins with whitespace is
       a "verbatim" paragraph, and text content that begins with non-
       whitespace is an "ordinary" paragraph.

       Pod::Eventual doesn't care.

       Text events look like this:

         {
           type    => 'text',
           content => "a string of text ending with a\n",
           start_line =>  16,
         }

   Blank events
       These events represent blank lines (or many blank lines) within a Pod
       section.

       Blank events look like this:

         {
           type    => 'blank',
           content => "\n\n\n\n",
           start_line => 21,
         }

   Non-Pod events
       These events represent non-Pod segments of the input.

       Non-Pod events look like this:

         {
           type    => 'nonpod',
           content => "#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;\n\nuse Acme::ProgressBar\n\n",
           start_line => 1,
         }
