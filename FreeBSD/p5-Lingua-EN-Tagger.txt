NAME
       Lingua::EN::Tagger - Part-of-speech tagger for English natural language
       processing.

SYNOPSIS
           # Create a parser object
           my $p = new Lingua::EN::Tagger;

           # Add part of speech tags to a text
           my $tagged_text = $p->add_tags($text);

           ...

           # Get a list of all nouns and noun phrases with occurrence counts
           my %word_list = $p->get_words($text);

           ...

           # Get a readable version of the tagged text
           my $readable_text = $p->get_readable($text);

DESCRIPTION
       The module is a probability based, corpus-trained tagger that assigns
       POS tags to English text based on a lookup dictionary and a set of
       probability values.  The tagger assigns appropriate tags based on
       conditional probabilities - it examines the preceding tag to determine
       the appropriate tag for the current word.  Unknown words are classified
       according to word morphology or can be set to be treated as nouns or
       other parts of speech.

       The tagger also extracts as many nouns and noun phrases as it can,
       using a set of regular expressions.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new %PARAMS
           Class constructor.  Takes a hash with the following parameters
           (shown with default values):

           unknown_word_tag => ''
               Tag to assign to unknown words

           stem => 0
               Stem single words using Lingua::Stem::EN

           weight_noun_phrases => 0
               When returning occurrence counts for a noun phrase, multiply
               the value by the number of words in the NP.

           longest_noun_phrase => 5
               Will ignore noun phrases longer than this threshold. This
               affects only the get_words() and get_nouns() methods.

           relax => 0
               Relax the Hidden Markov Model: this may improve accuracy for
               uncommon words, particularly words used polysemously

METHODS
       add_tags TEXT
           Examine the string provided and return it fully tagged (XML style)

       add_tags_incrementally TEXT
           Examine the string provided and return it fully tagged (XML style)
           but do not reset the internal part-of-speech state between
           invocations.

       get_words TEXT
           Given a text string, return as many nouns and noun phrases as
           possible.  Applies add_tags and involves three stages:

               * Tag the text
               * Extract all the maximal noun phrases
               * Recursively extract all noun phrases from the MNPs

       get_readable TEXT
           Return an easy-on-the-eyes tagged version of a text string.
           Applies add_tags and reformats to be easier to read.

       get_sentences TEXT
           Returns an anonymous array of sentences (without POS tags) from a
           text.

       get_proper_nouns TAGGED_TEXT
           Given a POS-tagged text, this method returns a hash of all proper
           nouns and their occurrence frequencies. The method is greedy and
           will return multi-word phrases, if possible, so it would find
           ``Linguistic Data Consortium'' as a single unit, rather than as
           three individual proper nouns. This method does not stem the found
           words.

       get_nouns TAGGED_TEXT
           Given a POS-tagged text, this method returns all nouns and their
           occurrence frequencies.

       get_max_noun_phrases TAGGED_TEXT
           Given a POS-tagged text, this method returns only the maximal noun
           phrases.  May be called directly, but is also used by
           get_noun_phrases

       get_noun_phrases TAGGED_TEXT
           Similar to get_words, but requires a POS-tagged text as an
           argument.

       install
           Reads some included corpus data and saves it in a stored hash on
           the local file system. This is called automatically if the tagger
           can't find the stored lexicon.
