       ccze-cssdump - Dump CCZE color setup into CSS format

SYNOPSIS
       ccze-cssdump [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ccze-cssdump utility, which is a
       simple tool to dump the color setup of CCZE into Cascading Style Sheet
       format, to be used later by ccze -h -o cssfile.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is
       included below.

              Read rcfile as a configuration file upon startup.

       -l, --load

       --help Show summary of options and exit.

       -V, --version

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/colorizerc, $HOME/.colorizerc
              These files are the default configuration files for colorize,
              and are parsed by ccze for the sake of full compatibility.
       /usr/local/etc/cczerc, $HOME/.cczerc
              This two are the main configuration files, in which one can
              change the colors used by the program to his liking. See the
              comments in the beginning of /usr/local/etc/cczerc for a
              description on the files' structure.
