curs_legacy(3X)                                                curs_legacy(3X)



NAME
       curs_legacy - get curses cursor and window coordinates, attributes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int getattrs(const WINDOW *win);
       int getbegx(const WINDOW *win);
       int getbegy(const WINDOW *win);
       int getcurx(const WINDOW *win);
       int getcury(const WINDOW *win);
       int getmaxx(const WINDOW *win);
       int getmaxy(const WINDOW *win);
       int getparx(const WINDOW *win);
       int getpary(const WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION
       These legacy functions are simpler to use than the X/Open Curses
       functions:

       •   The getattrs function returns the same attribute data as wattr_get.

           However, getattrs returns an integer (actually a chtype), while
           wattr_get returns the current color pair in a separate parameter.
           In the wide-character library configuration, color pairs may not
           fit into a chtype, so wattr_get is the only way to obtain the color
           information.

           Because getattrs returns the attributes in a single parameter, it
           would not be possible for an application to distinguish that from
           ERR (a -1).  If the window parameter is null, getattrs returns
           A_NORMAL (zero).

       •   The getbegy and getbegx functions return the same data as getbegyx.

       •   The getcury and getcurx functions return the same data as getyx.

       •   The getmaxy and getmaxx functions return the same data as getmaxyx.

       •   The getpary and getparx functions return the same data as getparyx.

RETURN VALUE
       Except as noted, these functions return an integer, or ERR if the
       window parameter is null.

NOTES
       All of these interfaces are provided as macros and functions.  The
       macros are suppressed (and only the functions provided) when
       NCURSES_OPAQUE is defined.  The standard forms such as getyx must be
       implemented as macros, and (in this implementation) are defined in
       terms of the functions described here, to avoid reliance on internal
       details of the WINDOW structure.

PORTABILITY
       These functions were supported on Version 7, BSD or System V
       implementations.  None of those implementations checked the window
       parameter.

       The getattrs function and macro are defined to return a (signed)
       integer for compatibility with those implementations although an
       unsigned type would have been more appropriate.
