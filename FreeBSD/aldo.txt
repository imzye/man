NAME
       aldo -  A fully console morse code trainer written in ISO C++.


SYNOPSIS
       aldo

DESCRIPTION
       Aldo is developed from scratch in ISO C++ using GNU C++ Standard
       Library and libao (www.xiph.org/ao).
       It is a morse code learning tool which provides four type of training
       methods:

       Blocks
               Identify blocks of random characters played in morse code.

       Koch
               Two morse characters will be played at full speed (20wpm)
               until you'll be able to identify at least 90 percent of them.
               After that, one more character will be added, and so on.

       File
               Identify played characters generated from a file.

       Callsign
               Identify random callsigns played in morse code.

NOTES
       The "Device" option under the keyer depends on the particular driver.
       The "default" setting picks the default sound device.  This option may
       be used to pick a different soundcard than the default one.

       For alsa, it is "hw:<card>,<device>", where the card and device number
       are the particular hardware devices.  The default is generally
       "hw:0.0".  Generally 0 is the first card, 1 is the second, etc.  Some
       sound cards may have multiple output devices, the device picks the
       particular one.

       For oss, sun, and aixs, it is the device name, like /dev/dsp.

       For esd, it is the host name, like "whizbang.com:555".

       It is not used on any other drivers.
