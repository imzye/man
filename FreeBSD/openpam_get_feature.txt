OPENPAM_GET_FEATURE(3)                        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     openpam_get_feature – query the state of an optional feature

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <security/pam_appl.h>
     #include <security/openpam.h>

     int
     openpam_get_feature(int feature, int *onoff);

DESCRIPTION
     This function is experimental and may be modified or removed in a future
     release without prior warning.

     The openpam_get_feature() function stores the current state of the
     specified feature in the variable pointed to by its onoff argument.

     The following features are recognized:

     OPENPAM_RESTRICT_SERVICE_NAME
                         Disallow path separators in service names.  This
                         feature is enabled by default.  Disabling it allows
                         the application to specify the path to the desired
                         policy file directly.

     OPENPAM_VERIFY_POLICY_FILE
                         Verify the ownership and permissions of the policy
                         file and the path leading up to it.  This feature is
                         enabled by default.

     OPENPAM_RESTRICT_MODULE_NAME
                         Disallow path separators in module names.  This
                         feature is disabled by default.  Enabling it prevents
                         the use of modules in non-standard locations.

     OPENPAM_VERIFY_MODULE_FILE
                         Verify the ownership and permissions of each loadable
                         module and the path leading up to it.  This feature
                         is enabled by default.

RETURN VALUES
     The openpam_get_feature() function returns one of the following values:

     [PAM_SUCCESS]       Success.

     [PAM_BAD_FEATURE]   Unrecognized or restricted feature.
