NAME
       doublecmd - Twin-panel (commander-style) file manager.


SYNOPSIS
       doublecmd [-C] [-T] [-P L|R] [ path1 ] [ path2 ]
       doublecmd [-C] [-T] [-P L|R] [-L path1 ] [-R path2 ]


DESCRIPTION
       Double Commander is a free cross platform open source file manager with
       two panels side by side.  It is inspired by Total Commander and
       features some new ideas.


OPTIONS
       The switches are NOT case sensitive.

       <path1> [<path2>]
              If one path passed then load it into the active panel. If two
              paths are passed then load first path into left panel and second
              in the right panel.
              Directory names containing spaces must be put in double quotes.
              Always specify the full path name.

       -C, --client
              If Double Commander is already running, activate it and pass the
              path(s) in the command line to that instance.

       -L <path>
              Set directory to show in the left panel.

       -R <path>
              Set directory to show in the right panel.

       -P L|R Sets the active panel when program starts: -P L for left and -P
              R for right.

       -T     Opens the passed directory(ies) in new tab(s)

       --config-dir=<path>
              Set custom directory path with Double Commander configurations
              files.
              Default is $HOME/.config/doublecmd.

       --servername=x
              Sets the name of the instance (server) Double Commander, which
              can then be used to pass parameters.
              If there is no already existing instance, then create it.
              If there is already existing instance, and the current one is a
              client, then send params to the server (i.e. to the existing
              instance).
              If there is already existing instance, and the current one is
              not a client, (i.e. "Allow only one copy of DC at a time" is
              false and no --client / -c options were given), then user-
              provided servername is altered: firstly, just add a trailing
              number "2".
              If there is already some trailing number, then increase it by 1,
              until we found a servername that isn't busy yet, and then create
              instance with this servername.

       --no-splash
              Disables the splash screen at startup DC.
