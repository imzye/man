MIME::Base64::URLSafe(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       MIME::Base64::URLSafe - Perl version of Python's URL-safe base64 codec

SYNOPSIS
         use MIME::Base64::URLSafe;

         $encoded = urlsafe_b64encode('Alladdin: open sesame');
         $decoded = urlsafe_b64decode($encoded);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a perl version of python's URL-safe base64 encoder /
       decoder.

       When embedding binary data in URL, it is preferable to use base64
       encoding.  However, two characters ('+' and '/') used in the standard
       base64 encoding have special meanings in URLs, often leading to re-
       encoding with URL-encoding, or worse, interoperability problems.

       To overcome the problem, the module provides a variation of base64
       codec compatible with python's urlsafe_b64encode / urlsafe_b64decode.

       Modification rules from base64:

           use '-' and '_' instead of '+' and '/'
           no line feeds
           no trailing equals (=)

       The following functions are provided:

           urlsafe_b64encode($str)
           urlsafe_b64decode($str)

       If you prefer not to import these routines to your namespace, you can
       call them as:

           use MIME::Base64::URLSafe ();
           $encoded = MIME::Base64::URLSafe::encode($decoded);
           $decoded = MIME::Base64::URLSafe::decode($encoded);
