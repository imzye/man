ARGUS.CONF(5)             FreeBSD File Formats Manual            ARGUS.CONF(5)

NAME
       argus.conf - argus resource file.

SYNOPSIS
       argus.conf

COPYRIGHT
       Copyright (c) 2000-2015 QoSient, LLC   All rights reserved.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the canonical argus configuration file.  All options that argus
       supports can be turned on or modified using this configuration format.
       Argus will search for a system /etc/argus.conf file and will open it
       and use it to seed all configuration options.conf.  Previous versions
       of Argus supported searching for argus.conf in $ARGUSPATH, $ARGUSHOME,
       $ARGUSHOME/lib, $HOME, and $HOME/lib, but this support is deprecated.
       All values in this file can be overriden by command line options, or
       other configuration files of this format when specified in using the -F
       option.

       Argus will read any number of configuration files using the -F option,
       and command-line order is very important.


Variable Syntax
       Variable assignments must be of the form:
         VARIABLE=
       with no white space between the VARIABLE and the '=' sign.  Quotes are
       optional for string arguments, but if you want to embed comments, then
       quotes are required.


ARGUS_FLOW_TYPE / ARGUS_FLOW_KEY
       The Argus can be configured to support a large number of flow types.
       The Argus can provide either type, i.e.  uni-directional or bi-
       directional flow tracking and the flow can be further defined by
       specifying the key.  The argus supports a set of well known key
       strategies, such as 'CLASSIC_5_TUPLE', 'LAYER_3_MATRIX',
       'LAYER_2_MATRIX', formulate key strategies from a list of the specific
       objects that the Argus understands.  See the man page for a complete
       description.

       The default is the classic 5-tuple IP flow, CLASSIC_5_TUPLE.

       There is no commandline equivalent.

       ARGUS_FLOW_TYPE="Bidirectional"
       ARGUS_FLOW_KEY="CLASSIC_5_TUPLE"



ARGUS_DAEMON
       Argus is capable of running as a daemon, doing all the right things
       that daemons do.  When this configuration is used for the system daemon
       process, say for /etc/argus.conf, this variable should be set to "yes".

       In the examples seen in the ./support/Startup/argus scripts, this value
       is set to "yes", as the system startup strategy requires the program to
       daemonize themselves, returning a value to the system, hopefully
       quickly.  Some systems, however, want to daemonize the tasks
       themselves, and those cases, the value must be set to "no".

       which requires that this variable be set to "yes".


       The default value is to not run as a daemon.

       Commandline equivalent  -d

       ARGUS_DAEMON=no



ARGUS_MONITOR_ID
       Argus Monitor Data is uniquely identifiable based on the source
       identifier that is included in each output record.  This is to allow
       you to work with Argus Data from multiple monitors at the same time.
       The ID is 32 bits long, and argus suppors a number of formats as
       legitimate values. Argus support unsigned ints, IPv4 addresses and 4
       bytes strings, as values.

       The formats are discerned from the values provided.  Double-quoted
       values are treated as strings, and are truncated to 4 characters.  Non-
       quoted values are tested for whether they are hostnames, and if not,
       then they are tested wheter they are numbers.

       The configuration allows for you to use host names, however, do have
       some understanding how `hostname` will be resolved by the nameserver
       before commiting to this strategy completely.

       For convenience, argus supports the notion of "`hostname`" for
       assigning the probe's id.  This is to support management of large
       deployments, so you can have one argus.conf file that works for a lot
       of probes.

       For security, argus does not rely on system programs, like hostname.1.
       It implements the logic of hostname itself, so don't try to run
       arbitrary programs using this method, because it won't work.

       Commandline equivalent   -e

       ARGUS_MONITOR_ID=`hostname`    // IPv4 address returned
       ARGUS_MONITOR_ID=10.2.45.3     // IPv4 address
       ARGUS_MONITOR_ID=2435          // Number
       ARGUS_MONITOR_ID="en0"         // String



ARGUS_ACCESS_PORT
       Argus monitors can provide a real-time remote access port for
       collecting Argus data.  This is a TCP based port service and the
       default port number is tcp/561, the "experimental monitor" service.
       This feature is disabled by default, and can be forced off by setting
       it to zero (0).

       When you do want to enable this service, 561 is a good choice, as all
       ra* clients are configured to try this port by default.

       Commandline equivalent  -P

       ARGUS_ACCESS_PORT=561



ARGUS_BIND_IP
       When remote access is enabled (see above), you can specify that Argus
       should bind only to a specific IP address. This is useful, for example,
       in restricting access to the local host, or binding to a private
       interface while capturing from another.

       You can provide multiple addresses, separated by commas, or on multiple
       lines.

       The default is to bind to any IP address.

       Commandline equivalent  -B

       ARGUS_BIND_IP="::1,127.0.0.1"
       ARGUS_BIND_IP="127.0.0.1"
       ARGUS_BIND_IP="192.168.0.68"



ARGUS_INTERFACE
       By default, Argus will open the first appropriate interface on a system
       that it encounters.  For systems that have only one network interface,
       this is a reasonable thing to do.  But, when there are more than one
       suitable interface, you should specify the interface(s) Argus should
       use either on the command line or in this file.

       Argus can track packets from any or all interfaces, concurrently.  The
       interfaces can be tracked as:
         1.  independant - this is where argus tracks flows from each
                interface independant from the packets seen on any other
                interface.  This is useful for hosts/routers that
                have full-duplex interfaces, and you want to distinguish
                flows based on their interface. There is an option to specify
                a distinct srcid to each independant modeler.

         2.  duplex - where argus tracks packets from 2 interfaces
                as if they were two half duplex streams of the same link.
                Because there is a single modeler tracking the 2
                interfaces, there is a single srcid that can be passed as
                an option.

         3.  bonded - where argus tracks packets from multiple interfaces
                as if they were from the same stream.  Because there is a
                single modeler tracking the 2 interfaces, there is a single
                srcid that can be passed as an option.

        Interfaces can be specified as groups using '[',']' notation, to build
        flexible definitions of packet sources.  However, each interface
        should be referenced only once (this is due to performance and OS
        limitations, so if your OS has no problem with this, go ahead).

        The lo (loopback) interface will be included only if it is
       specifically
        indicated in the option.

        The syntax for specifying this either on the command line or in this
       file:
           -i ind:all
           -i dup:en0,en1/srcid
           -i bond:en0,en1/srcid
           -i dup:[bond:en0,en1],en2/srcid
           -i en0/srcid -i en1/srcid  (equivalent '-i
       ind:en0/srcid,en1/srcid')
           -i en0 en1     (equivalent '-i bond:en0,en1')

        In all cases, if there is a "-e srcid" provided, this is used as the
        default.  If a srcid is specified using this option, it overrides
        the default.

        Srcid's are specified using the notion used for ARGUS_MONITOR_ID, as
       above.

       Commandline equivalent   -i

       ARGUS_INTERFACE=any
       ARGUS_INTERFACE=ind:all
       ARGUS_INTERFACE=ind:en0/192.168.0.68,en2/192.168.2.1
       ARGUS_INTERFACE=ind:en0/"en0",en2/19234
       ARGUS_INTERFACE=en0



ARGUS_GO_PROMISCUOUS
       By default, Argus will put its interface in promiscuous mode in order
       to monitor all the traffic that can be collected.  This can put an undo
       load on systems.

       If the intent is to monitor only the network activity of the specific
       system, say to measure the performance of an HTTP service or DNS
       service, you'll want to turn promiscuous mode off.

       The default value goes into prmiscuous mode.

       Commandline equivalent  -p

       ARGUS_GO_PROMISCUOUS=yes



ARGUS_CHROOT_DIR
       Argus supports chroot(2) in order to control the file system that argus
       exists in and can access.  Generally used when argus is running with
       privileges, this limits the negative impacts that argus could inflict
       on its host machine.

       This option will cause the output file names to be relative to this
       directory, and so consider this when trying to find your output files.

       Commandline equivalent   -c dir

       ARGUS_CHROOT_DIR=/chroot_dir



ARGUS_SETUSER_ID
       Argus can be directed to change its user id using the setuid() system
       call.  This is can used when argus is started as root, in order to
       access privileged resources, but then after the resources are opened,
       this directive will cause argus to change its user id value to a
       'lesser' capable account.  Recommended when argus is running as daemon.

       Commandline equivalent   -u user

       ARGUS_SETUSER_ID=user



ARGUS_SETGROUP_ID
       Argus can be directed to change its group id using the setgid() system
       call.  This is can used when argus is started as root, in order to
       access privileged resources, but then after the resources are opened,
       this directive can be used to change argu's group id value to a
       'lesser' capable account.  Recommended when argus is running as daemon.

       Commandline equivalent   -g group

       ARGUS_SETGROUP_ID=group



ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE
       Argus can write its output to one or a number of files, default limit
       is 5 concurrent files, each with their own independant filters.

       The format is:
            ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/full/path/file/name
            ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/full/path/file/name "filter"

       Most sites will have argus write to a file, for reliablity and
       performance.  The example file name is used here as supporting
       programs, such as ./support/Archive/argusarchive are configured to use
       this file.

       Commandline equivalent  -w

       ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/var/log/argus/argus.out



ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAM
       Argus can write its output to one or a number of remote hosts.  The
       default limit is 5 concurrent output streams, each with their own
       independant filters.

       The format is:
            ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAM="URI [filter]"
            ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAN="argus-udp://host:port 'tcp and not udp'"

       Most sites will have argus listen() for remote sites to request argus
       data, but for some sites and applications sending records without
       registration is desired.  This option will cause argus to transmit
       records that match the optional filter, to the configured targets using
       UDP as the transport mechanism.

       Commandline equivalent   -w argus-udp://host:port

       ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAM=argus-udp://224.0.20.21:561



ARGUS_SET_PID
       When Argus is configured to run as a daemon, with the -d option, Argus
       can store its pid in a file, to aid in managing the running daemon.
       However, creating a system pid file requires privileges that may not be
       appropriate for all cases.

       When configured to generate a pid file, if Argus cannot create the pid
       file, it will fail to run.  This variable, and the directory the pid is
       written to, is available to override the default, in case this gets in
       your way.

       The default value is to generate a pid.  The default path for the pid
       file, is '/var/run'.

       No Commandline equivalent

       ARGUS_SET_PID=yes
       ARGUS_PID_PATH=/var/run



ARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL
       Argus will periodically report on a flow's activity every
       ARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL seconds, as long as there is new activity on
       the flow.  This is so that you can get a view into the activity of very
       long lived flows.  The default is 60 seconds, but this number may be
       too low or too high depending on your uses.

       The default value is 60 seconds, but argus does support a minimum value
       of 1.  This is very useful for doing measurements in a controlled
       experimental environment where the number of flows is < 1000.

       Commandline equivalent  -S

       ARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL=60



ARGUS_MAR_STATUS_INTERVAL
       Argus will periodically report on a its own health, providing interface
       status, total packet and bytes counts, packet drop rates, and flow
       oriented statistics.

       These records can be used as "keep alives" for periods when there is no
       network traffic to be monitored.

       The default value is 300 seconds, but a value of 60 seconds is very
       common.

       Commandline equivalent  -M


       ARGUS_MAR_STATUS_INTERVAL=300



ARGUS_DEBUG_LEVEL
       If compiled to support this option, Argus is capable of generating a
       lot of debug information.

       The default value is zero (0).

       Commandline equivalent  -D

       ARGUS_DEBUG_LEVEL=0




ARGUS_GENERATE_PACKET_SIZE
       Argus can be configured to generate packet size information on a per
       flow basis, which provides the max and min packet size seen .  The
       default value is to not generate this data.

       Commandline equivalent   -Z

       ARGUS_GENERATE_PACKET_SIZE=yes



ARGUS_GENERATE_JITTER_DATA
       Argus can be configured to generate packet jitter information on a per
       flow basis.  The default value is to not generate this data.

       Commandline equivalent  -J


       ARGUS_GENERATE_JITTER_DATA=no



ARGUS_GENERATE_MAC_DATA
       Argus can be configured to not provide MAC addresses in it audit data.
       This is available if MAC address tracking and audit is not a
       requirement.

       The default value is to not generate this data.

       Commandline equivalent  -m

       ARGUS_GENERATE_MAC_DATA=no



ARGUS_GENERATE_APPBYTE_METRIC
       Argus can be configured to generate metrics that include the
       application byte counts as well as the packet count and byte counters.

       Commandline equivalent  -A

       ARGUS_GENERATE_APPBYTE_METRIC=no



ARGUS_GENERATE_TCP_PERF_METRIC
       Argus by default, generates extended metrics for TCP that include the
       connection setup time, window sizes, base sequence numbers, and
       retransmission counters.  You can suppress this detailed information
       using this variable.

       No commandline equivalent

       ARGUS_GENERATE_TCP_PERF_METRIC=yes


ARGUS_GENERATE_BIDIRECTIONAL_TIMESTAMPS
       Argus by default, generates a single pair of timestamps, for the first
       and last packet seen on a given flow, during the obseration period.
       For bi-directional flows, this results in loss of some information.  By
       setting this variable to 'yes', argus will store start and ending
       timestamps for both directions of the flow.

       No commandline equivalent

       ARGUS_GENERATE_BIDIRECTIONAL_TIMESTAMPS=no


ARGUS_CAPTURE_DATA_LEN
       Argus can be configured to capture a number of user data bytes from the
       packet stream.

       The default value is to not generate this data.

       Commandline equivalent  -U


       ARGUS_CAPTURE_DATA_LEN=0



ARGUS_FILTER_OPTIMIZER
       Argus uses the packet filter capabilities of libpcap.  If there is a
       need to not use the libpcap filter optimizer, you can turn it off here.
       The default is to leave it on.

       Commandline equivalent  -O


       ARGUS_FILTER_OPTIMIZER=yes



ARGUS_FILTER
       You can provide a filter expression here, if you like.  It should be
       limited to 2K in length.  The default is to not filter.

       No Commandline equivalent


       ARGUS_FILTER=""



ARGUS_PACKET_CAPTURE_FILE
       Argus allows you to capture packets in tcpdump() format if the source
       of the packets is a tcpdump() formatted file or live packet source.

       Specify the path to the packet capture file here.

       ARGUS_PACKET_CAPTURE_FILE="/var/log/argus/packet.out"



ARGUS_SSF
       Argus supports the use of SASL to provide strong authentication and
       confidentiality protection.

       The policy that argus uses is controlled through the use of a minimum
       and maximum allowable protection strength, which is standard for SASL
       based appliations.  Set these variable to control this policy.  The
       default is no security policy.

       ARGUS_MIN_SSF=0
       ARGUS_MAX_SSF=0



ARGUS_PCAP_BUF_SIZE
       Argus supports setting the pcap buffer size.  You can use the
       abbreviations K, M, G to specify thousands, millions or billions of
       bytes.

       ARGUS_PCAP_BUF_SIZE=1G



ARGUS_ENV
       Argus supports setting environment variables to enable functions
       required by the kernel or shared libraries.  This feature is intended
       to support libraries such as the net pf_ring support for libpcap as
       supported by code at http://public.lanl.gov/cpw/

       Setting environment variables in this way does not affect internal
       argus variable in any way. As a result, you can't set ARGUS_PATH using
       this feature.

       Care should must be taken to assure that the value given the variable
       conform's to your systems putenv.3 system call.  You can have as many
       of these directives as you like.

       The example below is intended to set a libpcap ring buffer length to
       300MB, if your system supports this feature.

       ARGUS_ENV="PCAP_MEMORY=300000"



ARGUS_TUNNEL_DISCOVERY
       Argus can be configured to discover tunneling protocols above the UDP
       transport header, specifically Teredo (IPv6 over UDP).  The algorithm
       is simple and so, having this on by default may generate false tunnel
       matching.

       The default is to not turn this feature on.


       ARGUS_TUNNEL_DISCOVERY=no



ARGUS_EVENT_DATA
       Argus supports the generation of host originated processes to gather
       additional data and statistics.  These include periodic processes to
       poll for SNMP data, as an example, or to collect host statistics
       through reading procfs().  Or single run programs that run at a
       specified time.

       These argus events, are generated from the complete list of
       ARGUS_EVENT_DATA directives that are specified here.

       The syntax is:
            Syntax is: "method:path|prog:interval[:postproc]"
                Where:  method = [ "file" | "prog" ]
                      pathname | program = "%s"
                      interval = %d[smhd] [ zero means run once ]
                      postproc = [ "compress" | "compress2" ]


       ARGUS_EVENT_DATA="file:/proc/vmstat:30s:compress"
       ARGUS_EVENT_DATA="prog:/usr/local/bin/ralsof:30s:compress"



ARGUS_KEYSTROKE
       This version of Argus supports keystroke detection and counting for TCP
       connections, with specific algorithmic support for SSH connections.

       The ARGUS_KEYSTROKE variable turns the feature on. Values for this
       variable are:
             ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="yes" - turn on TCP flow tracking
             ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="tcp" - turn on TCP flow tracking
             ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="ssh" - turn on SSH specific flow tracking
             ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="no"    [default]

       The algorithm uses a number of variables, all of which can be modifed
       using the ARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF descriptor, which is a semicolon (';')
       separated set of variable assignments.  Here is the list of supported
       variables:
         DC_MIN  -   (int) Minimum client datagram payload size in bytes
         DC_MAX  -   (int) Maximum client datagram payload size in bytes
         GS_MAX  -   (int) Maximum server packet gap
         DS_MIN  -   (int) Minimum server datagram payload size in bytes
         DS_MAX  -   (int) Maximum server datagram payload size in bytes
         IC_MIN  -   (int) Minimum client interpacket arrival time (microseconds)
         LCS_MAX -   (int) Maximum something - Not sure what this is
         GPC_MAX -   (int) Maximum client packet gap
         ICR_MIN - (float) Minimum client/server interpacket arrival ratio
         ICR_MAX - (float) Maximum client/server interpacket arrival ratio

       All variables have default values, this variable is used to override
       those values.  The syntax for the variable is:
            ARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF="DC_MIN=20;DS_MIN=20"

       ARGUS_KEYSTROKE="no"
       ARGUS_KEYSTROKE_CONF=""
