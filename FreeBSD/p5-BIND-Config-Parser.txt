BIND::Config::Parser(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       BIND::Config::Parser - Parse BIND Config file.

SYNOPSIS
        use BIND::Config::Parser;

        # Create the parser
        my $parser = new BIND::Config::Parser;

        my $indent = 0;

        # Set up callback handlers
        $parser->set_open_block_handler( sub {
                print "\t" x $indent, join( " ", @_ ), " {\n";
                $indent++;
        } );
        $parser->set_close_block_handler( sub {
                $indent--;
                print "\t" x $indent, "};\n";
        } );
        $parser->set_statement_handler( sub {
                print "\t" x $indent, join( " ", @_ ), ";\n";
        } );

        # Parse the file
        $parser->parse_file( "named.conf" );

DESCRIPTION
       BIND::Config::Parser provides a lightweight parser to the configuration
       file syntax of BIND v8 and v9 using a "Parse::RecDescent" grammar.

       It is in a similar vein to "BIND::Conf_Parser". However, as it has no
       knowledge of the directives, it doesn't need to be kept updated as new
       directives are added, it simply knows how to carve up a BIND
       configuration file into logical chunks.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new( );
           Create a new "BIND::Config::Parser" object.

METHODS
       set_open_block_handler( CODE_REF );
           Set the code to be called when a configuration block is opened. At
           least one argument will be passed; the name of that block, for
           example "options" or "zone", etc. as well as any additional items
           up to but not including the opening curly brace.

       set_close_block_handler( CODE_REF );
           Set the code to be called when a configuration block is closed. No
           arguments are passed.

       set_statement_handler( CODE_REF );
           Set the code to be called on a single line configuration element.
           At least one argument will be passed; the name of that element, as
           well as any additional items up to but not including the ending
           semi-colon.

       parse_file( FILENAME );
           Parse FILENAME, triggering the above defined handlers on the
           relevant sections.

TODO
       Probably the odd one or two things. I'm fairly sure the grammar is
       correct.
