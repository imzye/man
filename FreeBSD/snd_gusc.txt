SND_GUSC(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            SND_GUSC(4)

NAME
     snd_gusc – Gravis UltraSound ISA bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_gusc

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           snd_gusc_load="YES"

     Non-PnP cards require the following lines in device.hints(5):

           hint.gusc.0.at="isa"
           hint.gusc.0.port="0x220"
           hint.gusc.0.irq="5"
           hint.gusc.0.drq="1"
           hint.gusc.0.flags="0x13"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_gusc bridge driver allows the generic audio driver sound(4) to
     attach to Gravis UltraSound sound cards.

     The value of flags specifies the secondary DMA channel.  If the secondary
     DMA channel is C, set the flags to (C | 0x10).  For a sound card without
     the secondary DMA channel, the flags should be set to zero.

HARDWARE
     The snd_gusc driver supports the following sound cards:

     •   Gravis UltraSound MAX
     •   Gravis UltraSound PnP

DIAGNOSTICS
     xxx: gus pcm not attached, out of memory  There are not enough memory to
     drive the device.
