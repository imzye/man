Dancer::Plugin::ExtDirect(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Dancer::Plugin::ExtDirect - ExtDirect plugin for Dancer

VERSION
       version 1.03

SYNOPSIS
           use Dancer::Plugin::ExtDirect;

           # basic example:
           extdirect {
               api         => '/api',
               actions     => {
                   'Calculator' => {
                       sum => { len => 2, handler => \&sum },
                   },
               },
           };
           sub sum {
               my ($a, $b) = @_;
               return $a + $b;
           }

           # a bit more complex example:
           any qr{ /projects/.* }x => sub {
               # chain route handlers to check permissions
               # for ExtDirect calls too
               pass;
           };
           extdirect {
               api         => '/projects/*/api',  # the wildcard values are passed to handlers
               namespace   => 'MyApp',
               actions     => {
                   'Project' => {
                       addUser => { len => 1, handler => \&addUser },
                   },
               },
           };
           sub addUser {
               my ($project_id, $user) = @_;
               ...
           }

           # in HTML:
           <script type="text/javascript" src="/api"></script>
           <script type="text/javascript" src="/projects/2/api"></script>
           <script type="text/javascript">
               alert("3 + 2 = " + Calculator.sum(3,2));
               MyApp.Project.addUser({ name => 'Harry' });
           </script>

METHODS
   extdirect
       This method sets up a Dancer route handler to expose some functions to
       your JavaScript client-side application. It accepts a hashref
       containing the following options.

       api This accepts a route handler URI path, such as "/api". You can also
           use Dancer wildcards such as "/projects/*/api", so that the values
           caught are passed to your method handlers.

       namespace
           This option is injected to the addProvider method call.

       provider_config
           This accepts a hashref with additional config options that will be
           injected to the addProvider method call.

       actions
           This accepts a hashref whose keys are ExtDirect class names and
           their values are hashrefs with the method definitions (see the
           synopsis above for an example).  Each method is defined by a
           hashref having the following keys:

           len     The number of arguments that the exported function accepts.

           handler A coderef (or reference to a subroutine) that will handle
                   the request. Note that this module doesn't force you to map
                   the exposed ExtDirect class to any particular Perl class
                   layout.  The handler subroutine will be called with the
                   arguments coming from the client-side. If you used any
                   wildcards in the "api" path, the values caught (with
                   Dancer's "splat" method) will be prepended to the
                   arguments.

           formHandler
                   Optional. Mark this as true to handle ExtJs form (see ExtJs
                   docs about the formHandler API).

       namespace
           Optional. The JavaScript namespace under which the API will be
           exported.

       debug
           Optional. Mark this as true to send ExtDirect exceptions when the
           handler dies. Default is false, meaning that Dancer will just throw
           a 500 Internal Server Error with no details exposed.
