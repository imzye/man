PANIC(9)               FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual              PANIC(9)

NAME
     panic – bring down system on fatal error

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/systm.h>

     void
     panic(const char *fmt, ...);

     void
     vpanic(const char *fmt, va_list ap);

DESCRIPTION
     The panic() and vpanic() functions terminate the running system.  The
     message fmt is a printf(3) style format string.  The message is printed
     to the console and the location panicstr is set to the address of the
     message text for retrieval from the OS core dump.

     If the kernel debugger is installed control is passed to it, otherwise an
     attempt to save a core dump of the OS to a configured dump device is
     made.

     If panic() is called twice (from the disk sync routines, for example) the
     system is rebooted without syncing the disks.

RETURN VALUES
     The panic() function does not return.
