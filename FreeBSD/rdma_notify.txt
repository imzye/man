RDMA_NOTIFY(3)           Librdmacm Programmer's Manual          RDMA_NOTIFY(3)



NAME
       rdma_notify - Notifies the librdmacm of an asynchronous event.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>

       int rdma_notify (struct rdma_cm_id *id, enum ibv_event_type event);

ARGUMENTS
       id          RDMA identifier.

       event       Asynchronous event.

DESCRIPTION
       Used to notify the librdmacm of asynchronous events that have occurred
       on a QP associated with the rdma_cm_id.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.  If errno is set to EISCONN
       (transport endpoint is already connected), this indicates that the the
       underlying communication manager established the connection before the
       call to rdma_notify could be processed.  In this case, the error may
       safely be ignored.

NOTES
       Asynchronous events that occur on a QP are reported through the user's
       device event handler.  This routine is used to notify the librdmacm of
       communication events.  In most cases, use of this routine is not
       necessary, however if connection establishment is done out of band
       (such as done through Infiniband), it's possible to receive data on a
       QP that is not yet considered connected.  This routine forces the
       connection into an established state in this case in order to handle
       the rare situation where the connection never forms on its own.
       Calling this routine ensures the delivery of the
       RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED event to the application.  Events that should
       be reported to the CM are: IB_EVENT_COMM_EST.
