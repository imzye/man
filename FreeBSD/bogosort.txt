BOGOSORT(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            BOGOSORT(1)

NAME
       bogosort - sorts or doesn't sort files or standard input

SYNOPSIS
       bogosort [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       bogosort sorts files or its standard input using the bogo-sort
       algorithm.  (I won't even bother to dream up some bogus advantages
       here.)

       If any files are given input is taken from files in stead of standard
       input.

       It can also just randomise the lines in its input, allowing you to
       perform your own check in a loop.

OPTIONS
       bogosort accepts the following options:

       -n, --nosort
              Don't check if the output is sorted, just exit after permuting
              the lines once.

       -r, --norandom
              If configured with support for /dev/(u)random don't try to read
              /dev/(u)random for seeding rand, ignored otherwise.

       -s, --seed number
              Use number to seed rand.

       -o, --output name
              Write output to name instead of standard output.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --verbose
              Output a `.' (dot) to standard error for each permutation of the
              lines, and send some non critical error messages to standard
              error.

       -V, --version
              Show version of program.

JARGON FILE ENTRY
       The following section is taken from the Jargon File.

       ...The archetypical perversely awful algorithm (as opposed to bubble
       sort, which is merely the generic bad algorithm).  Bogo-sort is
       equivalent to repeatedly throwing a deck of cards in the air, picking
       them up at random, and then testing whether they are in order.  It
       serves as a sort of canonical example of awfulness.  Looking at a
       program and seeing a dumb algorithm, one might say “Oh, I see, this
       program uses bogo-sort.” Esp. appropriate for algorithms with factorial
       or super-exponential running time in the average case and
       probabilistically infinite worst-case running time.  Compare bogus,
       brute force, lasherism...

BUGS
       This program is intentionally bogus.
