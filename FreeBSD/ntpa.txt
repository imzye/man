NAME
       ntpa - NTP Analyzer daemon program

SYNOPSIS
       ntpa --config file [--temp path] [--writepid file] [--daemon name]

DESCRIPTION
       The ntpa daemon is the core process in the NTP Analyzer system.
       ntpa(1) is responsible for collecting data from NTP daemons. Data are
       collected using ntpq(8) and ntpctl(8).  The ntpa daemon also generates
       graphs and web pages and perform other tasks like sending status mails.

       The graphs and HTML files generated by ntpa are placed in the ntpa www
       directory and can be presented by any web server. Additional JavaScript
       and CSS files are also located in the ntpa www directory.

       Pages can be made responsive by configuring them with Bootstrap and
       jQuery.  This way they are viewable on mobile devices and not only on
       traditional PC screens.

       ntpa can be started with the following options:

       --config file
              Mandatory configuration file.

       --temp path
