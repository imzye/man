Dir::Self(3)          User Contributed Perl Documentation         Dir::Self(3)


NAME
       Dir::Self - a __DIR__ constant for the directory your source file is in

SYNOPSIS
         use Dir::Self;

         use lib __DIR__ . "/lib";

         my $conffile = __DIR__ . "/config";

DESCRIPTION
       Perl has two pseudo-constants describing the current location in your
       source code, "__FILE__" and "__LINE__". This module adds "__DIR__",
       which expands to the directory your source file is in, as an absolute
       pathname.

       This is useful if your code wants to access files in the same
       directory, like helper modules or configuration data. This is a bit
       like FindBin except it's not limited to the main program, i.e. you can
       also use it in modules. And it actually works.

       As of version 0.10 each use of "__DIR__" recomputes the directory name;
       this ensures that files in different directories that share the same
       package name get correct results. If you don't want this, "use
       Dir::Self qw(:static)" will create a true "__DIR__" constant in your
       package that contains the directory name at the point of "use".
