NAME
       abook - text-based address book program

SYNOPSIS
       abook [ OPTION ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the abook program.  This manual page
       was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original
       program does not have a manual page.

       abook is a text-based address book program. It contains Name, Email,
       Address and various Phone fields. It is designed for use with mutt, but
       can be equally useful on its own.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Show usage.

       -C --config <filename>
              Use an alternative configuration file (default is
              $HOME/.abook/abookrc).

       --datafile <filename>
              Use an alternative addressbook file (default is
              $HOME/.abook/addressbook).

       --mutt-query <string> [ --outformat <outputformat> ]
              Make a query for mutt (search the addressbook for <string>).
              The --datafile option, as documented above, may be used BEFORE
              this option to search a different addressbook file.
              Only a subset of the below <outputformat> are allowed: mutt
              (default), vcard and custom

       --convert [ --informat <inputformat> ] [ --infile <inputfile> ] [
       --outformat <outputformat> ] [ --outfile <outputfile> ]
              Converts <inputfile> in <inputformat> to <outputfile> in
              <outputformat> (defaults are abook, stdin, text and stdout).

              The following inputformats are supported:
              - abook abook native format
              - ldif ldif / Netscape addressbook

              - bsdcal BSD calendar
              - custom Custom output format, see below

       --outformatstr <string>
              Only used if --mutt-query or --convert is specified and
              --outformat=custom. <string> is a format string allowing
              placeholders.
              A placeholder can be any of the standard fields names (see
              abookrc(5)) and must be encapsulated by curly brackets.
              The default value is "{nick} ({name}): {mobile}"
              If <string> starts with ! only entries whose all fields from
              <string> are non-NULL are included.

       --add-email
              Read an e-mail message from stdin and add the sender to the
              addressbook.

       --add-email-quiet
              Same as --add-email but doesn't confirm adding.

       --formats
              List available formats.
