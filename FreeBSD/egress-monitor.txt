EGRESS_MONITOR(1)       FreeBSD General Commands Manual      EGRESS_MONITOR(1)

NAME
     egress-monitor – Watching for default routes changes and sets the
     interface group

SYNOPSIS
     egress-monitor [-p 4/6]

DESCRIPTION
     When the default route is added, egress-monitor sets the group of that
     interface to appropriate egress. That means for IPv4 and FIB 0 (default
     one) the group will be v4fib0egress. In general, the group name is
     v<4|6>fib<number>egress. If there is only one fib, the group name will be
     v<4|6>egress.

     The following options are available:

     -p protocol
             Use protocol with the value of 4 for IPv4 and 6 for IPv6. Without
             this option egress-monitor will listen to both protocols. If only
             one protocol is selected, then the group the interface will be
             added to will be fib<number>egress. If there is only one fib,
             group name will be egress.

EXAMPLES
     Listen on all fibs and protocols:

           egress-monitor

     Listen on all fibs but only IPv4 protocol:

           egress-monitor -p 4

     Listen on all fibs but only IPv6 protocol:

           egress-monitor -p 6
