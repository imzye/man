HYPER-V(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             HYPER-V(4)

NAME
     hv_storvsc – Hyper-V Storage Virtual Service Consumer

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in the
     system kernel configuration file:

           device hyperv

DESCRIPTION
     The hv_storvsc driver implements the virtual store device for FreeBSD
     guest partitions running on Hyper-V.  FreeBSD guest partitions running on
     Hyper-V do not have direct access to storage devices attached to the
     Hyper-V server.  Although a FreeBSD guest can access storage devices
     using Hyper-V's full emulation mode, the performance in this mode tends
     to be unsatisfactory.

     To counter the above issues, the hv_storvsc driver implements a storage
     Virtual Service Consumer (VSC) that relays storage requests from the
     guest partition to the storage Virtual Service Provider (VSP) hosted in
     the root partition using the high performance data exchange
     infrastructure provided by hv_vmbus(4) driver.  The VSP in the root
     partition then forwards the storage related requests to the physical
     storage device.

     This driver functions by presenting a SCSI HBA interface to the Comman
     Access Method (CAM) layer.  CAM control blocks (CCBs) are converted into
     VSCSI protocol messages which are delivered to the root partition VSP
     over the Hyper-V VMBus.

HISTORY
     Support for hv_storvsc first appeared in FreeBSD 10.0.  The driver was
     developed through a joint effort between Citrix Incorporated, Microsoft
     Corporation, and Network Appliance Incorporated.

     FreeBSD support for hv_storvsc was first added by Microsoft BSD
