MOUNT_MSDOSFS(8)        FreeBSD System Manager's Manual       MOUNT_MSDOSFS(8)

NAME
     mount_msdosfs – mount an MS-DOS file system

SYNOPSIS
     mount_msdosfs [-9ls] [-D DOS_codepage] [-g gid] [-L locale] [-M mask]
                   [-m mask] [-o options] [-u uid] [-W table] special node

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_msdosfs utility attaches the MS-DOS file system residing on the
     device special to the global file system namespace at the location
     indicated by node.  This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot
     time, but can be used by any user to mount an MS-DOS file system on any
     directory that they own (provided, of course, that they have appropriate
     access to the device that contains the file system).

     The options are as follows:

     -o options
             Use the specified mount options, as described in mount(8).  The
             following MSDOS file system-specific options are available:

             longnames
                     Force Windows 95 long filenames to be visible.

             shortnames
                     Force only the old MS-DOS 8.3 style filenames to be
                     visible.

             nowin95
                     Completely ignore Windows 95 extended file information.

     -u uid  Set the owner of the files in the file system to uid.  The
             default owner is the owner of the directory on which the file
             system is being mounted.

     -g gid  Set the group of the files in the file system to gid.  The
             default group is the group of the directory on which the file
             system is being mounted.

     -m mask
             Specify the maximum file permissions for files in the file
             system.  (For example, a mask of 755 specifies that, by default,
             the owner should have read, write, and execute permissions for
             files, but others should only have read and execute permissions.
             See chmod(1) for more information about octal file modes.  Only
             the nine low-order bits of mask are used.  The value of -M is
             used if it is supplied and -m is omitted.  The default mask is
             taken from the directory on which the file system is being
             mounted.

     -M mask
             Specify the maximum file permissions for directories in the file
             system.  The value of -m is used if it is supplied and -M is
             omitted.  See the previous option's description for details.

     -s      Force behaviour to ignore and not generate Win'95 long filenames.

     -l      Force listing and generation of Win'95 long filenames and
             separate creation/modification/access dates.

             If neither -s nor -l are given, -l is the default.

     -9      Ignore the special Win'95 directory entries even if deleting or
             renaming a file.  This forces -s.

     -L locale
             Specify locale name used for file name conversions for DOS and
             Win'95 names.  By default ISO 8859-1 assumed as local character
             set.

     -D DOS_codepage
             Specify the MS-DOS code page (aka IBM/OEM code page) name used
             for file name conversions for DOS names.

     -W table
             This option is preserved for backward compatibility purpose only,
             and will be removed in the future.  Please avoid using this
             option.

             Specify text file name with conversion table: iso22dos, iso72dos,
             koi2dos, koi8u2dos.

EXAMPLES
     To mount a Russian MS-DOS file system located in /dev/ada1s1:

           mount_msdosfs -L ru_RU.KOI8-R -D CP866 /dev/ada1s1 /mnt

     To mount a Japanese MS-DOS file system located in /dev/ada1s1:

           mount_msdosfs -L ja_JP.eucJP -D CP932 /dev/ada1s1 /mnt

HISTORY
     The predecessor to mount_msdos utility named mount_pcfs appeared in
     NetBSD 0.8.  It was rewritten in NetBSD 1.0 and first appeared in
     FreeBSD 2.0.  mount_msdos was renamed to the more aptly-named
     mount_msdosfs in FreeBSD 5.0. The character code conversion routine was
     added in 2003.

AUTHORS
     Initial implementation as mount_pcfs was written by Paul Popelka
     <paulp@uts.amdahl.com>.  It was rewritten by Christopher G. Demetriou
     <cgd@NetBSD.org>.  The character code conversion routine was added by
     Ryuichiro Imura <imura@ryu16.org>.

CAVEATS
     The use of the -9 flag could result in damaged file systems, albeit the
     damage is in part taken care of by procedures similar to the ones used in
     Win'95.
