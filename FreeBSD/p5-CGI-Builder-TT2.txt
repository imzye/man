SYNOPSIS
           # just include it in your build

           qw| CGI::Builder::TT2
             |;

DESCRIPTION
       This module transparently integrates "CGI::Builder" and "Template" in a
       very handy, powerful and flexible framework that can save you a lot of
       coding, time and resources.

       With this module, you don't need to produce the "page_content" within
       your page handlers anymore (unless you want to); you don't even need to
       manage a template system yourself (unless you want to).

       If you use a template system on your own (i.e. not integrated in a CBF
       extension), you will have to write all this code explicitly:

       •   create a page handler for each page as usual

       •   create a new template object and assign a new template file

       •   find the runtime values and assign them to the template object

       •   run the template process and set the "page_content" to the produced
           output

       You can save all that by just including this module in your build,
       because it implements an internal transparent and automatic template
       system that even without your explicit intervention is capable of
       finding the correct template and the correct runtime values to fill it,
       and generates the page_content automagically. With this module you can
       even eliminate the page handlers that are just setting the
       page_content, because the page is automatically sent by the template
       system.

   Example
       There's an extended example in the directory "example/" of the module
       distribution. Anyway, here a snippet to get the general idea:

           package WebApp;
           use CGI::Builder qw/ CGI::Builder::TT2 /;

           sub PH_index
           {
               my $self = shift;

               $self->tt_vars( environment => \%ENV );
           }

       Here's the template:

           <html>
           <head>
               <meta http-equiv=content-type content="text/html;charset=iso-8859-1">
               <title>A random example :)</title>
           </head>
           <body>
               <table>
               [% FOREACH k IN environment.keys %]
               <tr>
                   <td>[% k %]</td>
                   <td>[% environment.$k %]</td>
               </tr>
               [% END %]
               </table>
           </body>
           </html>

       This is just one of the styles you can adopt with CGI::Builder::TT2.
       Read further.

   How it works
       This module implements a default value for the "page_content" property:
       a CODE reference that produces and print the page content by using an
       internal "Template" object.

       Since the "page_content" property is set to its own default value
       before the page handler is called, the page handler can completely (and
       usually should) avoid to produce any output.

           sub PH_myPage
           {
             ... do_something_useful ...
             ... no_need_to_set_page_content ...
             ... returned_value_will_be_ignored ...
           }

       This module just calls the page handler related with the "page_name",
       but it does not expect any returned value from it.

       The output will be generated internally by the merger of the template
       file and the runtime values that are looked up from the
       "FooBar::Lookup" package ('FooBar' is not literal, but stands for your
       application namespace plus the '::Lookups' string).

       In simplest cases you can also avoid to create the page handler for
       certain pages: by default the template with the same page name will be
       used to produce the output.

       This does not mean that you cannot do things otherwise when you need
       to.  Just create a page handler and add there all the properties you
       want, or set those you want to override:

          sub PH_mySpecialPage
          {
            my $s = shift ;
            $s->tt_vars(
               special_key          => 'that' ,
               another_special_keys => 'this'
            ) ;
            $s->tt_template = '/that/special/template.tt2' ;
          }

       Since the page handler adds values to the "tt_vars" properties group,
       and sets the "tt_template" property, the application will add those
       values to the (possibly empty) template variables set, and the template
       system will print with a specific template and not with the default
       'mySpecialPage.tt2'.

       If some page handler needs to produce the output on its own (completely
       bypassing the template system) it can do so by setting the
       "page_content" property as usual (i.e. with the page content or with a
       reference to it)

          sub PH_mySpecialPage
          {
            my $s = shift ;
             ... do_something_useful ...
            # will bypass the template system
            $s->page_content  = 'something';
            $s->page_content .= 'something more';
          }

       For the 'mySpecialPage' page, the application will not use the template
       system at all, because the "page_content" property was set to the
       output.

       Note: For former CGI::Application users: the returned value of any page
       handler will be ALWAYS ignored, so set explicitly the "page_content"
       property when needed.

   Lookups
       These features mimics the mechanisms implemented in
       CGI::Builder::Magic, to provide another way to pass variables to the
       templates. A way that CGI::Builder users could be familiar with.

       *::Lookups package

       This is a special package that your application should define to allow
       the object to auto-magically look up the run time values.

       The name of this package is contained in the "tt_lookups_package"
       property.  The default value for this property is 'FooBar::Lookup'
       where 'FooBar' is not literal, but stands for your CBB namespace plus
       the '::Lookups' string, so if you define a CBB package as 'WebApp' you
       should define a 'WebApp::Lookups' package too (or set the
       "tt_lookup_package" property with the name of the package you will use
       as the lookup).

       In this package you should define all the variables and subs needed to
       supply any runtime value that will be substituted in place of the
       matching label or block in any template.

       The lookup is confined to the *::Lookups package on purpose. It would
       be simpler to use the same CBB package, but this would extend the
       lookup to all the properties, methods and handlers of your CBB and this
       might cause conflict and security holes. So, by just adding one line to
       your CBB, (e.g. 'package FooBar::Lookups;') you can separate your CBB
       from the lookup-allowed part of it.

       Note: Obviously you can also put the *::Lookup package in its own '.pm'
       file, thus making it simply loadable from different CBBs.

   The Template syntax
       This module implements a "Template" object, so the used "tags" are the
       default Template tags e.g.:

           [% FOREACH item IN array %]
             [% item %]
           [% END %]

       Please, read Template::Manual.

   How to organize your CBB
       1.  Set all the actions common to all pages in the OH_init() handler
           (as usual)

       2.  Prepare a template for each page addressed by your application

       3.  Set the variables or the subs in the *::Lookups package that will
           be available to the internal "Template" object (that could be
           picked up by one or more templates processing)

       4.  Define just the page handlers that needs to do something special

       5.  Use the properties default values, that can save you a lot of time
           ;-)

PROPERTY and GROUP ACCESSORS
       This module adds some template properties (all those prefixed with
       'tt_') to the standard CBF properties. The default of these properties
       are usually smart enough to do the right job for you, but you can fine-
       tune the behavior of your CBB by setting them to the value you need.

   tt_vars
       This property group accessor allows you to set the variables that will
       be available in the template. If one of these variables has the same
       name of a variable that's in the lookups package, it will be
       overridden.  You can pass any type of scalar value to the templates:
       numbers, strings and any type of references. Subroutines passed to the
       template in this way, when called, will receive a reference to the
       application object as their first argument. E.g.:

           package WebApp;
           use CGI::Builder qw/ CGI::Builder::TT2 /;

           sub foo
           {
               my $app   = shift;
               my $param = shift;

               # $app IS A 'Webapp'
               # $param's value is 'bar'
           }

           sub PH_index
           {
               my $self = shift;

               $self->tt_vars( my_sub => \&foo );
           }

       And this is the corresponding template:

           [% my_sub( 'bar' ) %]

       Moreover, every template will receive a reference to the CBF object in
       the variable "CBF", with no action required to the programmer.  It
       should be noted that it's a good software practice to separate
       application logic from visualization logic: calling application methods
       from the template could drive to situations of coupling between these
       two aspects. But we will apply Perl's philosophy, giving rope to the
       programmer even if he could hang himself with it

   tt_lookups_package
       This property allows you to access and set the name of the package
       where the Template object. The default value for this property is
       'FooBar::Lookup' where 'FooBar' is not literal, but stands for your
       application namespace plus the '::Lookups' string. (i.e.
       'WebApp::Lookup').

   tt_template
       This property allows you to access and set the 'template' argument
       passed to the Template process() method. Set This property to an
       absolute path if you want bypass the "page_path" property.

   CBF changed property defaults
       CBF page_suffix

       This module sets the default of the "page_suffix" to '.tt2'. You can
       override it by just setting another suffix of your choice.

       CBF page_content

       This module sets the default of the "page_content" to a CODE reference
       that produces the page content by using an internal Template object
       (see also "How it works"). If you want to bypass the template system in
       any Page Handler, just explicitly set the "page_content" to the content
       you want to send.

ADVANCED FEATURES
       In this section you can find all the most advanced or less used
       features that document all the details of this module. In most cases
       you don't need to use them, anyway, knowing them will not hurt.

   tt
       This property returns the internal "Template" object.

       This is not intended to be used to generate the page output - that is
       generated automatically - but it could be useful to generate other
       outputs (e.g. messages for sendmail) by using the same template object,
       thus preserving the same arguments.

       Note: You can change the default arguments of the object by using the
       "tt_new_args" property, or you can completely override the creation of
       the internal object by overriding the tt_new() method.

   tt_new()
       This method is not intended to be used directly in your CBB. It is used
       internally to initialize and return the "Template" object. You can
       override it if you know what you are doing, or you can simply ignore it
       ;-).

   tt_new_args( arguments )
       This property group accessor handles the Template constructor arguments
       that are used in the creation of the internal Template object. Use it
       to finetune the behavior if you know what are doing.  By default, only
       one option is set: "INCLUDE_PATH =" [ $_[0]->page_path ]>.

       Note: You can completely override the creation of the internal object
       by overriding the tt_new() method.

SUPPORT
       Even if this module has not been written by Domizio Demichelis, you can
       find support via the mailing list, which I read daily: I'll try to
       respond as soon as possible. Moreover, if the question involve
       CGI::Builder issues, you could receive a reply from CGI::Builder's
       author himself.  The list is used for general support on the use of the
       CBF, announcements, bug reports, patches, suggestions for improvements
       or new features. The API to the CBF is stable, but if you use the CBF
       in a production environment, it's probably a good idea to keep a watch
       on the list.
