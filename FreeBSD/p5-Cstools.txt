NAME
       cssort -- Czech sort

FORMAT
       cssort [ "-c"list | "-f"list ["-d"regexp]] [files ...]

SYNOPSIS
               cssort -c10-15,50-,25-45 < file
               cssort -f3,5-6 < file
               cssort -f3,5-6 -s: < file

DESCRIPTION
       Cssort is a utility that sorts input lines according to rules used in
       the Czech language. You can run it without any options, then it just
       uses whole lines for sorting. With the options, it's possible to
       specify parts of the lines to be used for comparison.

       list
           A comma-separated list of integer field numbers or field ranges.
           The are indexed from 1 and if a range is open (eg. "5-"), it means
           all remaining fields from the starting number.

       -c  Stands for columns and the list that follows specifies byte ranges
           on the line. You will probably use this option to sort data with
           fixed width fields.

       -f  Fields that will be used for sort.

       -d  Delimiter that separates fields in the -f option. It is a Perl
           regular expression, the default is "[ \t]+", which means any number
           of spaces or tabs in a row.

       The program assumes ISO-8859-2 encoding. Some way to specify another
       input encoding will come in the next versions. If you need to sort
       files with different encodings, you might want to check the cstocs
       conversion utility.
