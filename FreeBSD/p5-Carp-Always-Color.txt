Carp::Always::Color(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Carp::Always::Color - Carp::Always, but with color

VERSION
       version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
         use Carp::Always::Color;

       or

         perl -MCarp::Always::Color -e'sub foo { die "foo" } foo()'

DESCRIPTION
       Stack traces are hard to read when the messages wrap, because it's hard
       to tell when one message ends and the next message starts. This just
       colors the first line of each stacktrace, based on whether it's a
       warning or an error. If messages are being sent to a terminal, it
       colors them with terminal escape codes. If you want to force this
       behavior, you can use Carp::Always::Color::Term instead, which will
       always add terminal escape codes, even when the messages are being sent
       to something that doesn't look like a terminal.
       Carp::Always::Color::HTML also exists, to add HTML color markup to the
       messages instead of terminal color codes.
