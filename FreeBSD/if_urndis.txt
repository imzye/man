NAME
     urndis – USB Remote NDIS Ethernet device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device xhci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device urndis

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_urndis_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The urndis driver provides Ethernet access over Remote NDIS (RNDIS),
     allowing mobile devices such as phones and tablets to provide network
     access.  It is often referred to as USB tethering, and in most cases must
     be explicitly enabled on the device.

     urndis should work with any USB RNDIS devices, such as those commonly
     found on Android devices.  It does not support different media types or
     options.  For more information on configuring this device, see
     ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The urndis driver supports the "tethering" functionality of many Android
     devices.
