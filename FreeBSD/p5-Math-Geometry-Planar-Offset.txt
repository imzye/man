NAME
       Math::Geometry::Planar::Offset - Calculate offset polygons

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Geometry::Planar::Offset;

         my (@results) = OffsetPolygon(\@points, $distance);
         foreach my $polygon (@results) {
           # do something with @$polygon
         }

BUGS
       There are currently some problems with concurrent edge events on
       outward (and maybe inward) offsets.  Some significant changes need to
       be made.

METHODS
       These methods are actually defined in Math::Geometry::Planar, which
       uses this module.

   offset_polygon
       Returns reference to an array of polygons representing the original
       polygon offsetted by $distance

         $polygon->offset_polygon($distance);

Functions
       Only OffsetPolygon is exported.

   pi
       Returns the constant pi

   OffsetPolygon
       Make offset polygon subroutine.

       Call with offset distance and ref to array of points for original
       polygon polygon input must be pre-wrapped so point[n]=point[0]

       Will return a list of polygons (as refs.)  The number of polygons in
       the output depends on the shape of your input polygon.  It may split
       into several pieces during the offset.

         my (@results) = OffsetPolygon(\@points, $distance);
         foreach my $polygon (@results) {
           # do something with @$polygon
         }
