NAME
       Net::LibLO - Perl interface for liblo Lightweight OSC library

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::LibLO;

         my $lo = new Net::LibLO( );
         $lo->add_method( "/reply", 's', \&my_handler );
         $lo->send( 'osc://localhost:5600/', '/foo/bar', 's', 'Hello World' );

DESCRIPTION
       Net::LibLO class is used to send and recieve OSC messages using LibLO
       (the Lightweight OSC library). The coding style is slightly different
       to the C interface to LibLO, because it makes use of perl's Object
       Oriented functionality.

       new( [port], [protocol] )
           Create a new LibLO object for sending a recieving messages.  If the
           "port" is missing, then a random port number is chosen.  If the
           "protocol" is missing, than UDP is used.

       send( dest, bundle )
           Send a bundle to the sepecified destination.

           "dest" can either be a Net::LibLO::Address object, a URL or a port.

           "bundle" should be a Net::LibLO::Bundle object.

       send( dest, path, message )
           Send a message to the sepecified destination.

           "dest" can either be a Net::LibLO::Address object, a URL or a port.

           "message" should be a Net::LibLO::Message object.

       send( dest, path, typespec, params... )
           Construct and send a message to the sepecified destination.

           "dest" can either be a Net::LibLO::Address object, a URL or a port.

           "path" is the path to send the message to.

           "typespec" and "params" are passed through to create the new
           message.

       recv()
           Block and wait to receive a single message. Returns the length of
           the message in bytes  or number less than 1 on failure. Length of
           message is returned, whether the message has been handled by a
           method or not.

       recv_noblock( [timeout] )
           Look for an OSC message waiting to be received.  Waits for
           "timeout" milliseconds for a message and then returns the length of
           the message, or 0 if there was no message.  Use a value of 0 to
           return immediatly.

       add_method( path, typespec, handler, userdata )
           Add an OSC method to the specifed server.

           "path" is the OSC path to register the method to.  If "undef" is
           passed the method will match all paths.

           "typespec" is OSC typespec that the method accepts. Incoming
           messages with similar typespecs (e.g. ones with numerical types in
           the same position) will be coerced to the typespec given here.

           "handler" is a reference to the method handler callback subroutine
           that will be called if a matching message is received.

           "user_data" is a value that will be passed to the callback
           subroutine, when its invoked matching from this method.

       my_handler( serv, mesg, path, typespec, userdata, @params )
           This is order of parameters that will be passed to your method
           handler subroutines.

           "serv" is the Net::LibLO object that the method is registered with.

           "mesg" is a Net::LibLO::Message object for the incoming message.

           "path" is the path the incoming message was sent to.

           "typespec" If you specided types in your method creation call then
           this will match those and the incoming types will have been coerced
           to match, otherwise it will be the types of the arguments of the
           incoming message.

           "userdata" This contains the userdata value passed in the call to
           "add_method"

           "params" is an array of values associated with the message

       get_port()
           Returns the port the socket is bound to.

       get_url()
           Returns the full URL for talking to this server.
