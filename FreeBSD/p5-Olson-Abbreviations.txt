Olson::Abbreviations(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Olson::Abbreviations -globally unique timezones abbreviation handling

DESCRIPTION
       This module should help you with converting commonly used and often
       ambigious olson abbreviations into TZ offset notation.

   NOT COMPLETE
       This module is released as 0.01 because it is useful. It is not
       complete. In order to be complete in the author's eyes this module must
       accept a locale and disambiguate based on that.

       EST is not ambigious if your standing in the US or in Austrailia. This
       module should handle this properly in the future.

SYNOPSIS
       Quick summary of what the module does.

       Perhaps a little code snippet.

           use Olson::Abbreviations;

           my $oa = Olson::Abbreviations->new({ tz_abbreviation => 'EST' });
                       $oa->is_unambigious; # returns 0
                       $oa->is_known;       # returns 1
                       $oa->get_offset      # dies
           ...

METHODS
       get_offset  Returns the offset to UTC

       is_unambigious
                   Returns 0|1 based on if the abbreviation is globally
                   unambigious to the whole planet

       is_known    Returns 0|1 based on if the abbreviation is known despite
                   if it is ambigious or not
