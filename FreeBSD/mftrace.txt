NAME
       mftrace - convert METAFONT format fonts into Type1 outline fonts

SYNOPSIS
       mftrace [options] fontname

DESCRIPTION
       mftrace is a program that can convert a METAFONT font into a Type1
       font.  It is simply called with the name of the font (without a `.mf'
       suffix) and produces a Type1 font file called either fontname.pfa or
       fontname.pfb depending on the command line options.  With the help of
       fontforge(1) it can produce other font formats too.

       For tracing the bitmap, mftrace either uses potrace(1) or autotrace(1)
       (the former preferred) if available; this can be overridden with the
       --autotrace and --potrace command line options.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-').

       -k, --keep
              Keep all output in directory `mftrace.dir'.

       --magnification=MAG
              The magnification to use for the PFA file.  The default is 1000.
              The larger the magnification, the more precise the PFA file will
              be.  However, if the magnification is too large METAFONT can
              crash with overflow errors.

              Sadly, many MF fonts contain resolution checks

                     if dots_per_inch * design_size > 1500:

              This check is susceptible to overflow errors.  Such code should
              be reported as a bug, and changed to

                     if dots_per_inch > (1500 / design_size):

       --formats=FMT1,FMT2,...
              Specify which formats to generate (default is pfa).  Choices
              are: `afm', `pfa', `pfb', `ttf', `svg'.  Note that fontforge
              (formerly called pfaedit) must be installed to generate any
              format except `pfa' or `pfb'.  For generating `afm' you need
              either fontforge or ghostscript.

       --simplify
              This passes the created Type1 font to fontforge (formerly called
              pfaedit) to simplify and autohint it.

       --gffile=FILE
              Use generic font file FILE instead of running Metafont.  (GF is
              the default output format of Metafont.)

       -I DIR, --include=DIR
              Add DIR to the current path for searching files.

       --glyphs=LIST
              Process only these glyphs.  LIST is a comma separated list of
              decimal numbers or ranges, for example `1-10,50,55,90-100'.

       --tfmfile=FILE
              Use FILE for the TFM file.  (The default is to use
              fontname.tfm).

       -e ENC, --encoding=ENC
              Use encoding file ENC.  Encoding files used by mftrace are
              basically in the GhostScript/dvips format, but you may use a
              special .notavail glyph name in order to tell mftrace not to
              process a specific glyph.  If this option is not specified,
              mftrace tries to determine the encoding file automatically, from
              the encoding specified in the TFM file, the default being
              `tex256.enc'.

       --keep-trying
              Try to continue if external programs called by mftrace fail.  If
              METAFONT crashes with overflow errors, but nevertheless outputs
              a GF file, try to process its output as is (useful for some
              buggy fonts, see above).  If potrace or autotrace fail to trace
              a specific character, first try it with a less smoothed curve,
              and if that fails, skip the character.  By default, mftrace
              leaves a file `trace-bug-font-char.pbm' and stops the process
              with a request to file a bugreport.

       --dos-kpath
              Try to use MikTeX's version of kpsewhich.

       --potrace
              Use potrace for tracing bitmaps.  The default is to use potrace
              if it is found, otherwise to use autotrace.

       --autotrace
              Use autotrace for tracing bitmaps.

       --no-afm
              Don't read the AFM file to find font information.

       --noround
              Do not round coordinates of control points to integer values
              (use with --grid).  Disabled by default.

       --grid=GRID
              Set reciprocal grid size in em units multiplied by ratio
              magnification/1000.  For example, `--grid 10
              --magnification 1000' rounds coordinates of control points to
              1/10th of the em unit.  Useful simultaneously with the --noround
              option.  Default GRID value is 1, i.e., round to integer.  This
              option is only used with potrace.

       -D,--define=SYMBOL=VALUE
              Set the font info SYMBOL to the given VALUE.  For example,
              -DFamilyName=Foo sets the font family name to Foo.  mftrace
              tries to fill in sensible default values for the `FontName',
              `FamilyName', `FullName' and `Weight' fields.

       -V, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       -w, --warranty
              Show warranty and copyright.
