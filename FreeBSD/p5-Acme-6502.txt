NAME
       Acme::6502 - Pure Perl 65C02 simulator.

VERSION
       This document describes Acme::6502 version 0.76

SYNOPSIS
           use Acme::6502;

           my $cpu = Acme::6502->new();

           # Set start address
           $cpu->set_pc(0x8000);

           # Load ROM image
           $cpu->load_rom('myrom.rom', 0x8000);

           # Run for 1,000,000 instructions then return
           $cpu->run(1_000_000);

DESCRIPTION
       Imagine the nightmare scenario: your boss tells you about a legacy
       system you have to support. How bad could it be? COBOL? Fortran? Worse:
       it's an embedded 6502 system run by a family of squirrels (see Dilberts
       passim). Fortunately there's a pure Perl 6502 emulator that works so
       well the squirrels will never know the difference.

INTERFACE
       "new"
           Create a new 6502 CPU.

       call_os( $vec_number )
           Subclass to provide OS entry points. OS vectors are installed by
           calling "make_vector". When the vector is called call_os() will be
           called with the vector number.

       get_a()
           Read the current value of the processor A register (accumulator).

       get_p()
           Read the current value of the processor status register.

       get_pc()
           Read the current value of the program counter.

       get_s()
           Read the current value of the stack pointer.

       get_x()
           Read the current value of the processor X index register.

       get_y()
           Read the current value of the processor X index register.

       get_xy()
           Read the value of X and Y as a sixteen bit number. X forms the
           lower 8 bits of the value and Y forms the upper 8 bits.

       get_state()
           Returns an array containing the values of the A, X, Y, S, P and SP.

       set_a( $value )
           Set the value of the processor A register (accumulator).

       set_p( $value )
           Set the value of the processor status register.

       set_pc( $value )
           Set the value of the program counter.

       set_s( $value )
           Set the value of the stack pointer.

       set_x( $value )
           Set the value of the X index register.

       set_y( $value )
           Set the value of the Y index register.

       set_xy( $value )
           Set the value of the X and Y registers to the specified sixteen bit
           number. X gets the lower 8 bits, Y gets the upper 8 bits.

       set_jumptab( $addr )
           Set the address of the block of memory that will be used to hold
           the thunk blocks that correspond with vectored OS entry points.
           Each thunk takes four bytes.

       "load_rom( $filename, $addr )"
           Load a ROM image at the specified address.

       "make_vector( $jmp_addr, $vec_addr, $vec_number )"
           Make a vectored entry point for an emulated OS. $jmp_addr is the
           address where an indirect JMP instruction (6C) will be placed,
           $vec_addr is the address of the vector and $vec_number will be
           passed to "call_os" when the OS call is made.

       "poke_code( $addr, @bytes )"
           Poke code directly at the specified address.

       read_8( $addr )
           Read a byte at the specified address.

       read_16( $addr )
           Read a sixteen bit (low, high) word at the specified address.

       read_32( $addr )
           Read a 32 bit word at the specified address.

       "read_chunk( $start, $end )"
           Read a chunk of data from $start to $end - 1 into a string.

       read_str( $addr )
           Read a carriage return terminated (0x0D) string from the specified
           address.

       "run( $count [, $callback ] )"
           Execute the specified number of instructions and return. Optionally
           a callback may be provided in which case it will be called before
           each instruction is executed:

               my $cb = sub {
                   my ($pc, $inst, $a, $x, $y, $s, $p) = @_;
                   # Maybe output trace info
               }

               $cpu->run(100, $cb);

       "write_8( $addr, $value )"
           Write the byte at the specified address.

       "write_16( $addr, $value )"
           Write a sixteen bit (low, high) value at the specified address.

       "write_32( $addr, $value )"
           Write a 32 bit value at the specified address.

       "write_chunk( $addr, $string )"
           Write a chunk of data to memory.

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Bad instruction at %s (%s)"
           The emulator hit an illegal 6502 instruction.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       Acme::6502 requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES
       None.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Doesn't have support for hardware emulation hooks - so memory mapped
       I/O is out of the question until someone fixes it.
