DESCRIPTION
       This module offers easy access to formulas for a few often-used
       distributions. For that, it uses the Math::Symbolic module which gives
       the user an opportunity to manufacture distributions to his liking.

       The module can be used in two styles: It has a procedural interface
       which is demonstrated in the first half of the synopsis. But it also
       features a wholly different interface: It can modify the Math::Symbolic
       parser so that you can use the distributions right inside strings that
       will be parsed as Math::Symbolic trees. This is demonstrated for very
       simple cases in the second half of the synopsis.

       All arguments in both interface styles are optional.  Whichever
       expression is used instead of, for examle 'mean', is plugged into the
       formula for the distribution as a Math::Symbolic tree.  Details on
       argument handling are explained below.

       Please see the section on Export for details on how to choose the
       interface style you want to use.

       The arguments for the grammar-interface version of the module follow
       the same concept as for the function interface which is described in
       Distributions in detail. The only significant difference is that the
       arguments must all be strings to be parsed as Math::Symbolic trees.
       There is one exception: If the string 'undef' is passed as one argument
       to the function, that string is converted to a real undef, but
       nevermind and see below.

   Export
       By default, the module does not export any functions and does not
       modify the Math::Symbolic parser. You have to explicitly request that
       does so using the usual Exporter semantics.

       If using the module without parameters ("use
       Math:SymbolicX::Statistics::Distributions;"), you can access the
       distributions via the fully qualified subroutine names such as
       Math::SymbolicX::Statistics::Distributions::normal_distribution(). But
       that would be annoying, no?

       You can choose to export any of the distribution functions (see below)
       by specifying one or more function names:

         use Math::SymbolicX::Statistics::Distributions qw/gauss_distribution/;
         # then:
         $dist = gauss_distribution(...);

       You can also import all of them by using the ':functions' tag:

         use Math::SymbolicX::Statistics::Distributions qw/:functions/;
         ...

       Alternatively, you can choose to modify the Math::Symbolic parser by
       using any of the following keywords in the same way we used the
       function names above.

         normal_grammar
         gauss_grammar
         bivariate_normal_grammar
         cauchy_grammar
         boltzmann_grammar
         bose_grammar
         fermi_grammar

       To add all the keywords (normal(), gauss(), bivariate_normal(),
       cauchy(), boltzmann(), bose(), and fermi() to the grammar, you can
       specify ":grammar" instead.

       Finally, the module supports the exporter tag ":all" to both export all
       functions and add all keywords to the parser.

   Distributions
       The following is a list of distributions that can be generated using
       this module.

       Normal (Gauss) Distribution
         Normal (or Gauss) distributions are availlable through the functions
         "normal_distribution" or "gauss_distribution" which are equivalent.
         The functions return the Math::Symbolic representation of a gauss
         distribution.

         The gauss distribution has three parameters: The mean "mu", the root
         mean square deviation "sigma" and the variable "x".

         The functions take two optional arguments: The Math::Symbolic trees
         (or strings) to be plugged into the formula for 1) "mu" and 2)
         "sigma".

         If any argument is undefined or omitted, the corresponding variable
         will remain unchanged.

         The variable "x" always remains in the formula.

         Please refer to the literature referenced in the SEE ALSO section for
         details.

       Bivariate Normal Distribution
         Bivariate normal distributions are availlable through the function
         "bivariate_normal_distribution".  The function returns the
         Math::Symbolic representation of a bivariate normal distribution.

         The bivariate normal distribution has seven parameters: The mean
         "mu1" of the first variable, the root mean square deviation "sigma1"
         of the first variable, the mean "mu2" of the second variable, the
         root mean square deviation "sigma2" of the second variable, the first
         variable "x1", the second variable "x2", and the correlation of the
         first and second variables, "sigma12".

         The function takes five optional arguments: The Math::Symbolic trees
         (or strings) to be plugged into the formula for 1) "mu1", 2)
         "sigma1", 3) "mu1", 4) "sigma1", and 5) "sigma12".

         If any argument is undefined or omitted, the corresponding variable
         will remain unchanged.

         The variables "x1" and "x2" always remain in the formula.

         Please refer to the literature referenced in the SEE ALSO section for
         details.

       Cauchy Distribution
         Cauchy distributions are availlable through the function
         "cauchy_distribution".  The function returns the Math::Symbolic
         representation of a cauchy distribution.

         The cauchy distribution has three parameters: The median "m", the
         full width at half maximum "lambda" of the curve, and the variable
         "x".

         The function takes two optional arguments: The Math::Symbolic trees
         (or strings) to be plugged into the formula for 1) "m" and 2)
         "lambda".

         If any argument is undefined or omitted, the corresponding variable
         will remain unchanged.

         The variable "x" always remains in the formula.

         Please refer to the literature referenced in the SEE ALSO section for
         details.

       Boltzmann Distribution
         Boltzmann distributions are availlable through the function
         "boltzmann_distribution".  The function returns the Math::Symbolic
         representation of a Boltzmann distribution.

         The Boltzmann distribution has four parameters: The energy "E", the
         weighting factor "gs" that describes the number of states at energy
         "E", the temperature "T", and the chemical potential "mu".

         The function takes fouroptional arguments: The Math::Symbolic trees
         (or strings) to be plugged into the formula for 1) "E", 2) "gs", 3)
         "T", and 4) "mu"

         If any argument is undefined or omitted, the corresponding variable
         will remain unchanged.

         The formula used is: "N = gs * e^(-(E-mu)/(k_B*T))".

         Please refer to the literature referenced in the SEE ALSO section for
         details. Boltzmann's constant "k_B" is used as "1.3807 * 10^-23 J/K".

       Fermi Distribution
         Fermi distributions are availlable through the function
         "fermi_distribution".  The function returns the Math::Symbolic
         representation of a Fermi distribution.

         The Fermi distribution has four parameters: The energy "E", the
         weighting factor "gs" that describes the number of states at energy
         "E", the temperature "T", and the chemical potential "mu".

         The function takes fouroptional arguments: The Math::Symbolic trees
         (or strings) to be plugged into the formula for 1) "E", 2) "gs", 3)
         "T", and 4) "mu"

         If any argument is undefined or omitted, the corresponding variable
         will remain unchanged.

         The formula used is: "N = gs / ( e^((E-mu)/(k_B*T)) + 1)".

         Please refer to the literature referenced in the SEE ALSO section for
         details. Boltzmann's constant "k_B" is used as "1.3807 * 10^-23 J/K".
