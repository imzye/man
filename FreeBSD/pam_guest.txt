PAM_GUEST(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           PAM_GUEST(8)

NAME
     pam_guest – Guest PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_guest [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     The guest service module for PAM allows guest logins.  If successful, the
     pam_guest module sets the PAM environment variable GUEST to the login
     name.  The application can check this variable using pam_getenv(3) to
     differentiate guest logins from normal logins.

     The following options may be passed to the pam_guest module:

     guests=list        Comma-separated list of guest account names.  The
                        default is “guest”.  A typical value for ftpd(8) would
                        be “anonymous,ftp”.

     nopass             Omits the password prompt if the target account is on
                        the list of guest accounts.

     pass_as_ruser      The password typed in by the user is exported as the
                        PAM_RUSER item.  This is useful for applications like
                        ftpd(8) where guest users are encouraged to use their
                        email address as password.

     pass_is_user       Requires the guest user to type in the guest account
                        name as password.
