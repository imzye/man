GNGB
       gngb - emulate various Nintendo Game Boy handheld systems

SYNOPSIS
       gngb [-h] | [options] <romname>

DESCRIPTION
       gngb is an emulator program that attempts to be various forms of
       Nintendo Game Boy hardware.  It can run the various homebrew games and
       demos for the system as well as images of commercially-released games.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
       because the original program does not have a manual page.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options are
       included below.

       -h, --help
              print help and exit

       -a, --autoframeskip
              turn on autoframeskip.  This is useful if the emulator is
              running too slow.  It will cause the emulator to drop frames
              every now and then to maintain a realtime emulation.

       --sleep_idle
              sleep when idle.  This will cause the program to sleep when it
              has idle cycles instead of busy looping.  However, this can
              degrade emulation performance under some circumstances.

       --color_filter
              turn on the color filter.

       -r, --rumble
              turn on the rumble simulation.  This will cause the emulated
              screen to shake when a rumble effect is caused by the running
              program.

       --filter=X
              Set the filter to apply.  These only work when using standard
              (not YUV or GL) video output.  0 = none 1 = scanline 2 =
              scanline 50% 3 = smooth 4 = pseudo cell shading

       -R, --res=WxH
              set the screen resolution to WxH (for YUV and GL mode only).

       -Y, --yuv
              turn YUV mode on.  This utilizes the hardware YUV colorspace
              conversion and scaling features if your video card supports it.
              Most video cards with Xv support can use this feature for
              excellent performance.

       --yuv_type
              set the type of the YUV overlay: 0 = YV12  1 = YUY2

       -o, --opengl
              turn OpenGL mode on.  This will render the gameboy screen as an
              OpenGL 3D texture, which on some cards may perform much better
              than the YUV or X11 output.  This requires a 3D card with GLX
              support.

       -f, --fullscreen
              run gngb in fullscreen.  Fullscreen can be toggled during use
              with F9.

       --fps  Show frames per second counter in the upper left corner of
              screen.  May be toggled through the emulator's menu.

       -s, --sound
              Enable sound.

       --sample_rate=RATE
              Set the sound output sample rate to RATE. (typically a multiple
              of 11025 Hz)

       --auto_gb
              Automatically detect the system to emulate based on the
              cartridge image that is selected.  This should work in most
              cases.  If it fails, you can use one of the [ -C, --color_gb |
              -G, --normal_gb | -S, --super_gb ] options to force emulation of
              a Color, Normal, or Super Game Boy.

       -j, --joy_dev=N
              The default joystick is /dev/js0.  By setting N here, /dev/jsN
              will be used in its place.

       -g, --gdma_cycle
              This experimental option will halt the CPU during certain DMA
              operations.  Leave it off unless you are working around problems
              in a certain program.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       Most options can be disabled whith --no-OPTION (Ex: --no-sound turn
       sound off)

DEFAULT BINDINGS
       These are the default keys in the emulator.  These, along with the
       joystick buttons, may be changed through a custom gngbrc(5) file.

       Enter          : Start
       Right Shift    : Select
       W              : B
       X              : A
       TAB            : Open menu

       F9             : fullscreen on/off
       F10            : show fps
       F11            : reset
       F12            : show keysym code

       KeyPad 1-5: Change palette
              Palette must be define in your gngbrc file (see sample_gngbrc)

       KeyPad 6  : Toggle color filter


SEE ALSO
       There is some good info in the README included in the doc directory.
       The gngbrc file is documented in manual section 5.
