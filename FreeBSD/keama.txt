NAME
       keama - Kea Migration Assistant

SYNOPSIS
       keama [ -4 | -6] [ -D ] [ -N ] [ -r {perform|fatal|pass} ] [ -l
       hook-library-path ] [ -i input-file ] [ -o output-file ]

DESCRIPTION
       The Kea Migration Assistant converts an ISC DHCP configuration file
       into the corresponding Kea configuration file.

COMMAND LINE
       Protocol selection options:

       -4     The input configuration is for DHCPv4.  Incompatible with the -6
              option.

       -6     The input configuration is for DHCPv6.  Incompatible with the -4
              option.

       -D     Define ISC DHCP minimum, default and maximum builtin lifetimes.

       -N     Instead of using global host reservations, put them in the
              matching subnet.

       -r action
              Specify what to do with hostnames: resolve them into their first
              address, raise a fatal error or pass them silently.

       -p hook-library-path
              Specify the path where hook libraries (e.g. flex-id) can be
              found

       -i input-file
              Specify the ISC DHCP configuration file to read. When it is not
              given the standard input is used.

       -o output-file
              Specify the Kea configuration file to write. When it is not
              given the standard output is used.

       The number of conversion failures is returned. Note that any parsing
       warning or error is fatal so please check and fix the ISC DHCP
       configuration file before using this tool.
