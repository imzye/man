NAME
     kyua about – Shows detailed authors, license, and version information

SYNOPSIS
     kyua about [authors | license | version]

DESCRIPTION
     The ‘about’ command provides generic information about the kyua(1) tool.
     In the default synopsis form (no arguments), the information printed
     includes:

     1.   The name of the package, which is ‘kyua’.

     2.   The version number, which is ‘0.14.1’.

     3.   License information.

     4.   Authors information.

     5.   A link to the project web site.

     You can customize the information printed by this command by specifying
     the desired topic as the single argument to the command.  This can be one
     of:

     authors    Displays the list of authors and contributors only.

     license    Displays the license information and the list of copyrights.

     version    Displays the package name and the version number in a format
                that is compatible with the output of GNU tools that support a
                --version flag.  Use this whenever you have to query the
                version number of the package.
