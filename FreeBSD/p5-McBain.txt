NAME
       mcbain2pod - Generate a POD file for a McBain API

SYNOPSIS
               # in the command line
               $ mcbain2pod -o myapi.pod MyAPI

DESCRIPTION
       "mcbain2pod" is a simple command line utility to automatically generate
       documentation in POD format for a McBain API.

       This is pretty simply at the moment, it will describe basic usage of
       your API, and will list all routes and methods defined by the API (in
       all its topics, not just the root one), using the description given to
       them during definition (if any), and list the parameters they except to
       receive.

       Usage is simply, just give the script the package name of your API. The
       script will try to find it in @INC, which you can manipulate using the
       "-I" switch (see "OPTIONS").

OPTIONS
   -I, --include
       Specify a directory for @INC where to search for the API

   -o, -output
       Print the generated POD into the specified file instead of to standard
       output

   -h, --help
       Display usage information

NAME
       $api

USAGE
       You can use the $api API in several ways, the easiest being directly
       from Perl code. See McBain::Directly for more information.

       A simple example:

               use $api;

               my \$result = $api->call('GET:/some_route', \%params);

       You can also load $api as a RESTful web service (with
       McBain::WithPSGI), as a Gearman worker (with McBain::WithGearmanXS),
       and possibly other "McBain::With*" modules available from CPAN.

ROUTES
       The following routes are provided by this API:

       ";

       my $routes = $McBain::INFO{$api};

       foreach my $route (sort keys %$routes) {     foreach my $method (sort
       keys %{$routes->{$route}}) {       my $opts =
       $routes->{$route}->{$method};           print "=head2 $method
       $route\n\n";        if ($opts->{description}) {             print
       "$opts->{description}\n\n";        } else {            print "No
       description provided\n\n";         }         if ($opts->{params}) {
                      print "Expects the following parameters:\n\n=over\n\n";
                      foreach my $param (sort keys %{$opts->{params}}) {
                           print "=item * $param: ", join(', ', keys
       %{$opts->{params}->{$param}}), "\n\n";            }              print
       "=back\n\n";        }    } }

       print "=cut\n";
