BEASTIE.4TH(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         BEASTIE.4TH(8)

NAME
     beastie.4th – FreeBSD ASCII art boot module

DESCRIPTION
     The file that goes by the name of beastie.4th is a set of commands
     designed to draw the ASCII art FreeBSD mascot – known simply as beastie –
     to the right of the boot loader menu.  The commands of beastie.4th by
     themselves are not enough for most uses.  Please refer to the examples
     below for the most common situations, and to loader(8) for additional
     commands.

     Before using any of the commands provided in beastie.4th, it must be
     included through the command:

           include beastie.4th

     This line is present in the default /boot/loader.rc file, so it is not
     needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.

     The commands provided by it are:

           draw-beastie           Draws the FreeBSD logo.

                                  The logo that is drawn is configured by
                                  setting the loader_logo variable in
                                  loader.conf(5) to one of “beastie”,
                                  “beastiebw”, “fbsdbw”, “orb”, and “orbbw”
                                  (the default).

                                  The position of the logo can be configured
                                  by setting the loader_logo_x and
                                  loader_logo_y variables in loader.conf(5).
                                  The default values are 46 (x) and 4 (y).

           clear-beastie          Clears the screen of beastie.

           beastie-start          Initializes the interactive boot loader
                                  menu.

                                  The loader_delay variable can be configured
                                  in loader.conf(5) to the number of seconds
                                  you would like to delay loading the boot
                                  menu.  During the delay the user can press
                                  Ctrl-C to fall back to autoboot or ENTER to
                                  proceed.  The default behavior is to not
                                  delay.

     The environment variables that effect its behavior are:

           loader_logo
                     Selects the desired logo in the beastie boot menu.
                     Possible values are: “fbsdbw”, “beastie”, “beastiebw”,
                     “orb”, “orbbw” (default), and “none”.

           loader_logo_x
                     Sets the desired column position of the logo.  Default is
                     46.

           loader_logo_y
                     Sets the desired row position of the logo.  Default is 4.

           beastie_disable
                     If set to “YES”, the beastie boot menu will be skipped.
                     The beastie boot menu is always skipped if running non-
                     x86 hardware.

           loader_delay
                     If set to a number higher than zero, introduces a delay
                     before starting the beastie boot menu.  During the delay
                     the user can press either Ctrl-C to skip the menu or
                     ENTER to proceed to the menu.  The default is to not
                     delay when loading the menu.
