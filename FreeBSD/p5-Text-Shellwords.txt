Shellwords(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation        Shellwords(3)


NAME
       Text::Shellwords

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Shellwords;
         @words = shellwords($line);
         @words = shellwords(@lines);

DESCRIPTION
       This used to be a wrapper around shellwords.pl, but has now been
       superseded by Text::ParseWords.  Use that module insteade.  If you use
       this module, it will simply report the shellwords() function from
       Text::ParseWords.

       The old description follows:

       This is a thin wrapper around the shellwords.pl package, which comes
       preinstalled with Perl.  This module imports a single subroutine,
       shellwords().  The shellwords() routine parses lines of text and
       returns a set of tokens using the same rules that the Unix shell does
       for its command-line arguments.  Tokens are separated by whitespace,
       and can be delimited by single or double quotes.  The module also
       respects backslash escapes.

       If called with one or more arguments, shellwords() will treat each
       argument as a line of text, parse it, and return the tokens.

       Note that the old behavior of parsing $_ if no arguments are provided
       is no longer supported. Sorry.

BUGS
       Please report them.
