NAME
       Text::DoubleMetaphone - Phonetic encoding of words.

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::DoubleMetaphone qw( double_metaphone );
         my($code1, $code2) = double_metaphone("Aubrey");

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a "sounds like" algorithm developed by Lawrence
       Philips which he published in the June, 2000 issue of C/C++ Users
       Journal.  Double Metaphone is an improved version of Philips' original
       Metaphone algorithm.

       In contrast to the Soundex and Metaphone algorithms, Double Metaphone
       will sometimes return two encodings for words that can be plausibly
       pronounced multiple ways.

       For additional details, see Philips' discussion of the algorithm at:

FUNCTIONS
       double_metaphone( STRING )
           Takes a word and returns a phonetic encoding.  In an array context,
           it returns one or two phonetic encodings for the word.  In a scalar
           context, it returns the first encoding.  The first encoding is
           usually based on the most commonly heard U.S. pronounciation of the
           word.
