UVISOR(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              UVISOR(4)

NAME
     uvisor – USB support for the PalmOS based PDAs

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device uvisor

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           uvisor_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The uvisor driver provides support for USB based PalmOS PDAs, like
     Handspring Visor, Palm Mxxx series, and Sony Clie.

     The device is accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
     like a tty(4).  The device has several ports for different purposes, each
     of them gets its own ucom(4) device.  The attach message describes the
     purpose of each port.

     The usual Pilot tools can be used to access the attached device on the
     HotSync port.

HISTORY
     The uvisor driver was adopted from NetBSD 1.5 in August 2002.  This
     manual page was adopted from NetBSD by Tom Rhodes <trhodes@FreeBSD.org>
     at that time.

BUGS
     The code to provide multiple ucom(4) instances has not yet been ported
     from NetBSD.  It is unclear whether this driver works in its current
     state.
