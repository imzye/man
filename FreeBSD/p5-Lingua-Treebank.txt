NAME
       Lingua::Treebank - Perl extension for manipulating the Penn Treebank
       format

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::Treebank;

         my @utterances = Lingua::Treebank->from_penn_file($filename);

         foreach (@utterances) {
           # $_ is a Lingua::Treebank::Const now

           foreach ($_->get_all_terminals) {
             # $_ is a Lingua::Treebank::Const that is a terminal (word)

             print $_->word(), ' ' $_->tag(), "\n";
           }

           print "\n\n";

         }

ABSTRACT
         Modules for abstracting out the "natural" objects in the Penn
         Treebank format.

DESCRIPTION
       This class knows how to read two treebank formats, the Penn format and
       the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) format.  These formats differ in how they
       handle terminal nodes.  The Penn format places pre-terminal part of
       speech tags in the left-hand position of a parenthesis-delimited pair,
       just like it does non-terminal nodes.  The CNF format attaches pre-
       terminal tags to the word with an underscore.  For example, the
       sentence "I spoke" would be rendered in each format as follows:

           (S
               (NP
                   (N I))
               (VP
                   (V spoke)))
                   Penn

           (S
               (NP
                   I_N)
               (VP
                   spoke_V))
            Chomsky Normal Form

       Almost all the interesting tree-functionality is in the constituent-
       forming package (included in this distribution, see
       Lingua::Treebank::Const).

       PLEASE NOTE: The format expected here is the ".mrg" format, not the
       ".psd" format.  In other words, one POS-tag per word is required. (In
       response to CPAN bug 15079.)

Variables
       CONST_CLASS
           The value "Lingua::Treebank::CONST_CLASS" indicates what class
           should be used as the class for constituents.  The default is
           "Lingua::Treebank::Const"; it will generate an error to use a value
           for $Lingua::Treebank::CONST_CLASS that is not a subclass of
           "Lingua::Treebank::Const".

Methods
   Class methods
       from_penn_file
           given a Penn treebank file, open it, extract the constituents, and
           return the roots.

       from_penn_fh
           given a Penn treebank filehandle, extract the constituents and
           return the roots.

       from_cnf_file
           given a Chomsky normal form file, open it, extract the
           constituents, and return the roots.

       from_cnf_fh
           given a Chomsky normal form filehandle, extract the constituents
           and return the roots.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

HISTORY
       0.01    Original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options

                 -CAX
                       Lingua::Treebank

       0.02    Improved documentation.

       0.03    added a VERBOSE variable that can be set.

       0.09    A variety of additional features

       0.10    more features still, also some bugfixes.

       0.11    Removed references to Text::Balanced, which is slow and not
               uniformly available.

       0.12    Corrected bug in Makefile.PL pointed out by Vassilii
               Khachaturov.

               Added some documentation distinguishing that .mrg (and not .psd
               files) are supported.

       0.13    text() method now suppresses anything with a "-NONE-" tag.

               $VERSION for Lingua::Treebank and Lingua::Treebank::Const now
               tied.

       0.14    Actually include patch intended for 0.13. *sheesh*.

       0.15    Include Lingua::Treebank::HeadFinder class in distro.  Modify
               L::TB::Const to support head-child annotation.

               also support 64-bit systems much better.

       0.16    Including data for Lingua::Treebank::HeadFinder.  Updating
               version numbers in Const.pm code Revised test code so that it
               doesn't require Devel::Cycle (but uses it if needed).
