NAME
       Chemistry::OpenSMILES - OpenSMILES format reader and writer

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser;

           my $parser = Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser->new;
           my @moieties = $parser->parse( 'C#C.c1ccccc1' );

           $\ = "\n";
           for my $moiety (@moieties) {
               #  $moiety is a Graph::Undirected object
               print scalar $moiety->vertices;
               print scalar $moiety->edges;
           }

           use Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Writer qw(write_SMILES);

           print write_SMILES( \@moieties );

DESCRIPTION
       Chemistry::OpenSMILES provides support for SMILES chemical identifiers
       conforming to OpenSMILES v1.0 specification
       (<http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html>).

       Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser reads in SMILES strings and returns them
       parsed to arrays of Graph::Undirected objects.  Each atom is
       represented by a hash.

       Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Writer performs the inverse operation.  For
       SMILES writing conventions and options refer to its description.

   Molecular graph
       Disconnected parts of a compound are represented as separate
       Graph::Undirected objects. Atoms are represented as vertices, and bonds
       are represented as edges.

       Atoms

       Atoms, or vertices of a molecular graph, are represented as hash
       references:

           {
               "symbol"    => "C",
               "isotope"   => 13,
               "chirality" => "@@",
               "hcount"    => 3,
               "charge"    => 1,
               "class"     => 0,
               "number"    => 0,
           }

       Except for "symbol", "class" and "number", all keys of hash are
       optional. Per OpenSMILES specification, default values for "hcount" and
       "class" are 0.

       For chiral atoms, the order of their neighbours in input is preserved
       in an array added as value for "chirality_neighbours" key of the atom
       hash.  The order of atoms there follow OpenSMILES convention.

       Bonds

       Bonds, or edges of a molecular graph, rely completely on
       Graph::Undirected internal representation. Bond orders other than
       single ("-", which is also a default) are represented as values of edge
       attribute "bond". They correspond to the symbols used in OpenSMILES
       specification.
