NAME
       Memcached::libmemcached - Thin fast full interface to the libmemcached
       client API

VERSION
       Version 1.001801 (with libmemcached-1.0.18 embedded)

SYNOPSIS
         use Memcached::libmemcached;

         $memc = memcached_create();

         memcached_server_add($memc, "localhost");

         memcached_set($memc, $key, $value);

         $value = memcached_get($memc, $key);

DESCRIPTION
       Memcached::libmemcached is a very thin, highly efficient, wrapper
       around the libmemcached library. It's implemented almost entirely in C.

       It gives full access to the rich functionality offered by libmemcached.
       libmemcached is fast, light on memory usage, thread safe, and provide
       full access to server side methods.

        - Synchronous and Asynchronous support.
        - TCP and Unix Socket protocols.
        - A half dozen or so different hash algorithms.
        - Implementations of the new cas, replace, and append operators.
        - Man pages written up on entire API.
        - Implements both modulo and consistent hashing solutions.

       (Memcached::libmemcached is fairly new and not all the functions in
       libmemcached have perl interfaces yet.  It's usually trivial to add
       functions - just a few lines in libmemcached.xs, a few lines of
       documentation, and a few lines of testing.  Volunteers welcome!)

       The libmemcached library documentation (which is bundled with this
       module) serves as the primary reference for the functionality.

       This documentation provides summary of the functions, along with any
       issues specific to this perl interface, and references to the
       documentation for the corresponding functions in the underlying
       library.

       For more information on libmemcached, see
       <http://docs.libmemcached.org>

CONVENTIONS
   Terminology
       The term "memcache" is used to refer to the "memcached_st" structure at
       the heart of the libmemcached library. We'll use $memc to represent
       this structure in perl code. (The libmemcached library documentation
       uses "ptr".)

   Traditional and Object-Oriented
       There are two ways to use the functionality offered by this module:

       * You can import the functions you want to use and call them
       explicitly.

       * Or, you can use $memc as an object and call most of the functions as
       methods.  You can do that for any function that takes a $memc (ptr) as
       its first argument, which is almost all of them.

       Since the primary focus of this module is to be a thin wrapper around
       libmemcached, the bulk of this documentation describes the traditional
       functional interface.

       The object-oriented interface is mainly targeted at modules wishing to
       subclass Memcached::libmemcached, such as
       Cache::Memcached::libmemcached.  For more information see "OBJECT-
       ORIENTED INTERFACE".

   Function Names and Arguments
       The function names in the libmemcached library have exactly the same
       names in Memcached::libmemcached.

       The function arguments are also the same as the libmemcached library
       and documentation, with two exceptions:

       * There are no length arguments. Wherever the libmemcached
       documentation shows a length argument (input or output) the
       corresponding argument doesn't exist in the Perl API because it's not
       needed.

       * Some arguments are optional.

       Many libmemcached function arguments are output values: the argument is
       the address of the value that the function will modify. For these the
       perl function will modify the argument directly if it can. For example,
       in this call:

           $value = memcached_get($memc, $key, $flags, $rc);

       The $flags and $rc arguments are output values that are modified by the
       memcached_get() function.

       See the "Type Mapping" section for the fine detail of how each argument
       type is handled.

   Return Status
       Most of the functions return an integer status value. This is shown as
       "memcached_return" in the libmemcached documentation.

       In the perl interface this value is not returned directly. Instead a
       simple boolean is returned: true for 'success', defined but false for
       some 'unsuccessful' conditions like 'not found', and undef for all
       other cases (i.e., errors).

       All the functions documented below return this simple boolean value
       unless otherwise indicated.

       The actual "memcached_return" integer value, and corresponding error
       message, for the last libmemcached function call can be accessed via
       the "errstr" method.

   Unimplemented Functions
       Functions relating to managing lists of servers (memcached_server_push,
       and memcached_server_list) have not been implemented because they're
       not needed and likely to be deprecated by libmemcached.

       Functions relating to iterating through results (memcached_result_*)
       have not been implemented yet. They're not a priority because similar
       functionality is available via the callbacks. See
       "set_callback_coderefs".

EXPORTS
       All the public functions in libmemcached are available for import.

       All the public constants and enums in libmemcached are also available
       for import.

       Exporter tags are defined for each enum. This allows you to import
       groups of constants easily. For example, to enable consistent hashing
       you could use:

         use Memcached::libmemcached qw(:memcached_behavior :memcached_server_distribution);

         memcached_behavior_set($memc, MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_DISTRIBUTION(), MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT());

       The Exporter module allows patterns in the import list, so to import
       all the functions, for example, you can use:

         use Memcached::libmemcached qw(/^memcached/);

       Refer to Memcached::libmemcached::constants for a full list of the
       available constants and the tags they are grouped by. To see a list of
       all available functions and constants you can execute:

         perl -MMemcached::libmemcached -le 'print $_ for @Memcached::libmemcached::EXPORT_OK'

FUNCTIONS
   Functions For Managing Memcaches
       memcached_create

         my $memc = memcached_create();

       Creates and returns a 'memcache' that represents the state of
       communication with a set of memcached servers.  See
       Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_create.

       memcached_clone

         my $memc = memcached_clone(undef, undef);

       XXX Not currently recommended for use.  See
       Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_create.

       memcached_free

         memcached_free($memc);

       Frees the memory associated with $memc.  After calling it $memc can't
       be used.  See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_create.

       memcached_server_count

         $server_count= memcached_server_count($memc);

       Returns a count of the number of servers associated with $memc.  See
       Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_servers.

       memcached_server_add

       memcached_server_add_with_weight

         memcached_server_add($memc, $hostname, $port);
         memcached_server_add_with_weight($memc, $hostname, $port, $weight);

       Adds details of a single memcached server (accessed via TCP/IP) to
       $memc.  See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_servers. The default
       weight is 0.

       memcached_server_add_unix_socket

       memcached_server_add_unix_socket_with_weight

         memcached_server_add_unix_socket($memc, $socket_path);
         memcached_server_add_unix_socket_with_weight($memc, $socket_path);

       Adds details of a single memcached server (accessed via a UNIX domain
       socket) to $memc.  See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_servers. The
       default weight is 0.

       memcached_behavior_set

         memcached_behavior_set($memc, $option_key, $option_value);

       Changes the value of a particular option.  See
       Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_behavior.

       memcached_behavior_get

         memcached_behavior_get($memc, $option_key);

       Get the value of a particular option.  See
       Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_behavior.

       memcached_callback_set

         memcached_callback_set($memc, $flag, $value);

       Set callback flag value.

       The only flag currently supported is "MEMCACHED_CALLBACK_PREFIX_KEY".
       The $value must be less than MEMCACHED_PREFIX_KEY_MAX_SIZE  (eg 128)
       bytes.  It also can't be empty
       <https://bugs.launchpad.net/libmemcached/+bug/667878>

       memcached_callback_get

         $value = memcached_callback_set($memc, $flag, $return_status);

       Get callback flag value. Sets return status in $return_status.  The
       only flag currently supported is "MEMCACHED_CALLBACK_PREFIX_KEY".
       Returns undef on error.

   Functions for Setting Values
       See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_set.

       memcached_set

         memcached_set($memc, $key, $value);
         memcached_set($memc, $key, $value, $expiration, $flags);

       Set $value as the value of $key.  $expiration and $flags are both
       optional and default to 0.

       memcached_add

         memcached_add($memc, $key, $value);
         memcached_add($memc, $key, $value, $expiration, $flags);

       Like "memcached_set" except that an error is returned if $key is
       already stored in the server.

       memcached_replace

         memcached_replace($memc, $key, $value);
         memcached_replace($memc, $key, $value, $expiration, $flags);

       Like "memcached_set" except that an error is returned if $key is not
       already error is returned.

       memcached_prepend

         memcached_prepend($memc, $key, $value);
         memcached_prepend($memc, $key, $value, $expiration, $flags);

       Prepend $value to the value of $key. $key must already exist.
       $expiration and $flags are both optional and default to 0.

       memcached_append

         memcached_append($memc, $key, $value);
         memcached_append($memc, $key, $value, $expiration, $flags);

       Append $value to the value of $key. $key must already exist.
       $expiration and $flags are both optional and default to 0.

       memcached_cas

         memcached_cas($memc, $key, $value, $expiration, $flags, $cas)

       Overwrites data in the server stored as $key as long as $cas still has
       the same value in the server.

       Cas is still buggy in memached.  Turning on support for it in
       libmemcached is optional.  Please see memcached_behavior_set() for
       information on how to do this.

       XXX and the memcached_result_cas() function isn't implemented yet so
       you can't get the $cas to use.

   Functions for Fetching Values
       See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_get.

       The memcached_fetch_result() and

       memcached_get

         $value = memcached_get($memc, $key);
         $value = memcached_get($memc, $key, $flags, $rc);

       Get and return the value of $key.  Returns undef on error.

       Also updates $flags to the value of the flags stored with $value, and
       updates $rc with the return code.

       memcached_mget

         memcached_mget($memc, \@keys);
         memcached_mget($memc, \%keys);

       Triggers the asynchronous fetching of multiple keys at once. For
       multiple key operations it is always faster to use this function. You
       must then use memcached_fetch() or memcached_fetch_result() to retrieve
       any keys found.  No error is given on keys that are not found.

       Instead of this function, you'd normally use the "mget_into_hashref"
       method.

       memcached_fetch

         $value = memcached_fetch($memc, $key);
         $value = memcached_fetch($memc, $key, $flag, $rc);

       Fetch the next $key and $value pair returned in response to a
       memcached_mget() call.  Returns undef if there are no more values.

       If $flag is given then it will be updated to whatever flags were stored
       with the value.  If $rc is given then it will be updated to the return
       code.

       This is similar to "memcached_get" except its fetching the results from
       the previous call to "memcached_mget" and $key is an output parameter
       instead of an input.  Usually you'd just use the "mget_into_hashref"
       method instead.

   Functions for Incrementing and Decrementing Values
       memcached servers have the ability to increment and decrement unsigned
       integer keys (overflow and underflow are not detected). This gives you
       the ability to use memcached to generate shared sequences of values.

       See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_auto.

       memcached_increment

         memcached_increment( $key, $offset, $new_value_out );

       Increments the integer value associated with $key by $offset and
       returns the new value in $new_value_out.

       memcached_decrement

         memcached_decrement( $key, $offset, $new_value_out );

       Decrements the integer value associated with $key by $offset and
       returns the new value in $new_value_out.

       memcached_increment_with_initial

         memcached_increment_with_initial( $key, $offset, $initial, $expiration, $new_value_out );

       Increments the integer value associated with $key by $offset and
       returns the new value in $new_value_out.

       If the object specified by key does not exist, one of two things may
       happen: If the expiration value is MEMCACHED_EXPIRATION_NOT_ADD, the
       operation will fail.  For all other expiration values, the operation
       will succeed by seeding the value for that key with a initial value to
       expire with the provided expiration time.  The flags will be set to
       zero.

       memcached_decrement_with_initial

         memcached_decrement_with_initial( $key, $offset, $initial, $expiration, $new_value_out );

       Decrements the integer value associated with $key by $offset and
       returns the new value in $new_value_out.

       If the object specified by key does not exist, one of two things may
       happen: If the expiration value is MEMCACHED_EXPIRATION_NOT_ADD, the
       operation will fail.  For all other expiration values, the operation
       will succeed by seeding the value for that key with a initial value to
       expire with the provided expiration time.  The flags will be set to
       zero.

       memcached_increment_by_key

       memcached_decrement_by_key

       memcached_increment_with_initial_by_key

       memcached_decrement_with_initial_by_key

       These are the master key equivalents of the above. They all take an
       extra initial $master_key parameter.

   Functions for Deleting Values from memcached
       See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_delete.

       memcached_delete

         memcached_delete($memc, $key);
         memcached_delete($memc, $key, $expiration);

       Delete $key. If $expiration is greater than zero then the key is
       deleted by memcached after that many seconds.

   Functions for Accessing Statistics from memcached
       Not yet implemented. See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_stats.

       See walk_stats.

   Miscellaneous Functions
   memcached_lib_version
         $version = memcached_lib_version()

       Returns a simple version string, like "1.0.17", representing the
       libmemcached version (version of the client library, not server).

   memcached_version
         $version = memcached_version($memc)
         ($version1, $version2, $version3) = memcached_version($memc)

       Returns the lowest version of all the memcached servers.

       In scalar context returns a simple version string, like "1.2.3".  In
       list context returns the individual version component numbers.  Returns
       an empty list if there was an error.

       Note that the return value differs from that of the underlying
       libmemcached library memcached_version() function.

   memcached_verbosity
         memcached_verbosity($memc, $verbosity)

       Modifies the "verbosity" of the memcached servers associated with
       $memc.  See Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_verbosity.

       memcached_flush

         memcached_flush($memc, $expiration);

       Wipe clean the contents of associated memcached servers.  See
       Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_flush.

   memcached_quit
         memcached_quit($memc)

       Disconnect from all currently connected servers and reset libmemcached
       state associated with $memc.  Not normally called explicitly.  See
       Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_quit.

       memcached_strerror

         $string = memcached_strerror($memc, $return_code)

       memcached_strerror() takes a "memcached_return" value and returns a
       string describing the error.  The string should be treated as read-only
       (it may be so in future versions).  See also
       Memcached::libmemcached::memcached_strerror.

       This function is rarely needed in the Perl interface because the return
       code is a dualvar that already contains the error string.

   Grouping Keys On Servers
       Normally libmemcached hashes the $key value to select which memcached
       server to communicate with. If you have several keys relating to a
       single object then it's very likely that the corresponding values will
       be stored in different memcached servers.

       It would be more efficient, in general, when setting and getting
       multiple related values, if it was possible to specify a different
       value to be hashed to select which memcached server to communicate
       with. With libmemcached, you can.

       Most of the functions for setting and getting values have *_by_key
       variants for exactly this reason.  These all have an extra $master_key
       parameter immediately after the $memc parameter. For example:

           memcached_mget($memc, \%keys, \%dest);

           memcached_mget_by_key($memc, $maskey_key, \%keys, \%dest);

       The *_by_key variants all work in exactly the same way as the
       corresponding plain function, except that libmemcached hashes
       $master_key instead of $key to which memcached server to communicate
       with.

       If $master_key is undef then the functions behave the same as their
       non-by-key variants, i.e., $key is used for hashing.

       By-key variants of "Functions for Fetching Values":

       memcached_get_by_key

       memcached_mget_by_key

       By-key variants of "Functions for Setting Values":

       memcached_set_by_key

       memcached_replace_by_key

       memcached_add_by_key

       memcached_append_by_key

       memcached_cas_by_key

       memcached_prepend_by_key

       memcached_delete_by_key

OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
   Methods
       new

         $memc = $class->new; # same as memcached_create()

       errstr

         $errstr = $memc->errstr;

       Returns the error message and code from the most recent call to any
       libmemcached function that returns a "memcached_return", which most do.

       The return value is a dualvar, like $!, which means it has separate
       numeric and string values. The numeric value is the memcached_return
       integer value, and the string value is the corresponding error message
       what memcached_strerror() would return.

       As a special case, if the memcached_return is MEMCACHED_ERRNO,
       indicating a system call error, then the string returned by strerror()
       is appended.

       This method is also currently callable as memcached_errstr() for
       compatibility with an earlier version, but that deprecated alias will
       start warning and then cease to exist in future versions.

       mget_into_hashref

         $memc->mget_into_hashref( \@keys, \%dest_hash); # keys from array
         $memc->mget_into_hashref( \%keys, \%dest_hash); # keys from hash

       Combines memcached_mget() and a memcached_fetch() loop into a single
       highly efficient call.

       Fetched values are stored in \%dest_hash, updating existing values or
       adding new ones as appropriate.

       This method is also currently callable as memcached_mget_into_hashref()
       for compatibility with an earlier version, but that deprecated alias
       will start warning and then cease to exist in future versions.

       get_multi

         $hash_ref = $memc->get_multi( @keys );

       Effectively the same as:

         $memc->mget_into_hashref( \@keys, $hash_ref = { } )

       So it's very similar to "mget_into_hashref" but less efficient for
       large numbers of keys (because the keys have to be pushed onto the
       argument stack) and less flexible (because you can't add/update
       elements into an existing hash).

       This method is provided to optimize subclasses that want to provide a
       Cache::Memcached compatible API with maximum efficiency.  Note,
       however, that "get_multi" does not support the Cache::Memcached feature
       where a key can be a reference to an array [ $master_key, $key ].  Use
       "memcached_mget_by_key" directly if you need that feature.

       get

         $value = $memc->get( $key );

       Effectively the same as:

         $value = memcached_get( $memc, $key );

       The "get" method also supports the Cache::Memcached feature where $key
       can be a reference to an array [ $master_key, $key ]. In which case the
       call is effectively the same as:

         $value = memcached_get_by_key( $memc, $key->[0], $key->[1] )

       set_callback_coderefs

         $memc->set_callback_coderefs(\&set_callback, \&get_callback);

       This interface is experimental and likely to change. (It's also
       currently used by Cache::Memcached::libmemcached, so don't use it if
       you're using that module.)

       Specify functions which will be executed when values are set and/or get
       using $memc.

       When the callbacks are executed $_ is the value and the arguments are
       the key and flags value. Both $_ and the flags may be modified.

       Currently the functions must return an empty list.

       This method is also currently callable as
       memcached_set_callback_coderefs() for compatibility with an earlier
       version, but that deprecated alias will start warning and then cease to
       exist in future versions.

       walk_stats

         $memc->walk_stats( $stats_args, \&my_stats_callback );

       This interface is experimental and likely to change.

       Calls the memcached_stat_execute() function to issue a "STAT
       $stats_args" command to the connected memcached servers. The
       $stats_args argument is usually an empty string.

       The callback function is called for each return value from each server.
       The callback will be passed at least these parameters:

         sub my_stats_callback {
           my ($key, $value, $hostport) = @_;
           # Do what you like with the above!
           return;
         }

       Currently the callback must return an empty list.

       Prior to version 0.4402 the callback was passed a fourth argument which
       was a copy of the $stats_args value. That is no longer the case. As a
       temporary aid to migration, the "walk_stats" method does "local $_ =
       $stats_args" and passes $_ as the forth argument. That will work so
       long as the code in the callback doesn't alter $_. If your callback
       code requires $stats_args you should change it to be a closure instead.

   trace_level
           $memc->trace_level($trace_level);
           $trace_level = $memc->trace_level;

       Sets the trace level (see "Tracing Execution"). Returns the previous
       trace level.

       get_server_for_key

         $memc->get_server_for_key( $key )

       This method uses memcached_server_by_key to get information about which
       server should contain the specified $key.

       It returns a string containing the hostname:port of the appropriate
       server, or undef on failure.

EXTRA INFORMATION
   Tracing Execution
           $memc->trace_level($trace_level);

       If set >= 1 then any non-success memcached_return value will be logged
       via warn().

       If set >= 2 or more then some data types will list conversions of input
       and output values for function calls.

       The "PERL_LIBMEMCACHED_TRACE" environment variable provides a default.
       The value is read when memcached_create is called.

   Type Mapping
       For pointer arguments, undef is mapped to null on input and null is
       mapped to undef on output.
