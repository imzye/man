DWARF_FORMSTRING(3)    FreeBSD Library Functions Manual    DWARF_FORMSTRING(3)

NAME
     dwarf_formstring – return the value of a STRING class attribute

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_formstring(Dwarf_Attribute attr, char **ret, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_formstring() sets the location pointed to by argument ret
     to a pointer to a NUL-terminated string containing the value of the
     attribute referenced by argument attr.  The form of argument attr must be
     one of DW_FORM_string or DW_FORM_strp.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to return an error
     descriptor in case of an error.

   Memory Management
     The memory area referenced by the returned pointer is managed by the
     DWARF(3) library.  The application should not attempt to directly free
     this memory area.

RETURN VALUES
     Function dwarf_formstring() returns DW_DLV_OK on success.  In case of an
     error, it returns DW_DLV_ERROR and sets argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_formstring() may fail with the following errors:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]            Either of arguments attr or ret was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_ATTR_FORM_BAD]       The attribute referenced by argument attr
                                  was not of a permitted kind.
