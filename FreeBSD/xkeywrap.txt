       application (ex.emacs).  XKeyWrap can record and play key sequence in
       real time.  And XKeyWrap can send key sequence to an application on
       other X server over the network.

MENU
       Select

               Select the window to output key sequence.  Move the mouse
               pointer to the window and click left button on the window.


       Parent

               Change the window to output key sequence to the parent of the
               window.


       Child

               Change the window to output key sequence to one of the children
               of the window.


       Next

               Change the window to output key sequence to other child.  This
               menu is selected next to selecting Child menu.


       Clear

               Clear the recorded key sequence data.


       Record

               Start recording key sequence from the keyboard.  If key
               sequence data exists, XKeyWrap add key sequence to the start of
               the old key sequence data.  If you select this menu while
               recording, XKeyWrap adds key sequence to the end of the old key
               sequence data.  If you select this menu while playing, you can
               insert key sequence into the old key sequence data.


       Stop

EXAMPLES
       % xkeywrap

               - XKeyWrap starts.
               - Click Select menu of XKeyWrap and click on the window to send
               key sequence.
               - Key inputs to XKeyWrap are sent to the window.


       % xkeywrap -x emacs

               - Emacs and XKeyWrap start.
               - You put the mouse pointer on XKeyWrap and input some words.
               - The words are sent to emacs.
               - You can record and play the key sequence by XKeyWrap.


       % xkeywrap -f example.dat -x emacs -geometry 80x20 text.txt

               - Emacs opens file "text.txt" and starts with 80x20 window.
               - XKeyWrap starts. If example.dat exists, XKeyWrap reads it.
               - If you select Play menu, XKeyWrap plays it.
               - If you select Save menu, XKeyWrap saves key sequence to file
               "example.dat".


       % xkeywrap -display wrongdisp:0 -output-display gooddisp:0

               - XKeyWrap starts on "wrongdisp".
               - Click Select menu of XKeyWrap and click on the window on
               "gooddisp".
               - Key inputs to XKeyWrap are sent to the window on "gooddisp".
               (XKeyWrap can send key sequence to an application running on
               other X server over the network)


       % xkeywrap -f example.dat -display wrongdisp:0 -output-display
       gooddisp:0 -x emacs -display gooddisp:0 -geometry 80x20 text.txt

               - Emacs starts on "gooddisp".
               - XKeyWrap starts on "wrongdisp".
               - XKeyWrap search a new window on "gooddisp", and find emacs on
               it.
               - Key inputs to XKeyWrap are sent to emacs.  (XKeyWrap can send
               key sequence to an application running on other X server over
               the network)


Q AND A
       Q. I cannot connect XKeyWrap to XTerm (or other application).

               XTerm do not permit to receive event from outside as default.
               If you want to use XTerm with XKeyWrap, you have to set
               allowSendEvents resource. add this line to .Xdefaults.
               XTerm*allowSendEvents: true
               or
               xterm*allowSendEvents: true
               But, if allowSendEvent is true, XTerm receives all events from
               outside, and everyone can operate XTerm on your machine from
               the machine which is permitted to connect to the X server of
               your machine by xhost(1).  If you do it, be very careful of
               setting xhost(1).
               If you want to permit to connect XKeyWrap to all applications,
               add this line to .Xdefaults.
               *allowSendEvents: true
               But, when you do it, all X applications receives all events
               from outside, and everyone can operate them on your machine
               from the machine which is permitted to connect to the X server
               of your machine by xhost(1).  If you do it, be very careful of
               setting xhost(1).


       Q. I read term of Demonstration in README and try it, but it does not
       run correctly.

               This demonstration was recorded with Japanese 106 keyboard.  If
               your keyboard is different from it, you can see this
               demonstration, but, this demonstration runs more or less
               curiously.


       Q. Though allowSendEvents resource is set correctly, I cannot connect
       XKeyWrap to an application.

               Try Parent menu as below,
               first, click Select menu and select the application window.
               Second, put the mouse pointer on XKeyWrap and try to hit some
               keys.
               Third, if you cannot operate the application from XKeyWrap,
               click Parent menu some times and try to hit some keys again.

       If you want to read more informations and examples about using
       XKeyWrap, run XKeyWrap with -readme option.


BUGS
       XKeyWrap runs more or less curiously between systems with different
       keyboards.  (Ex. If the keyboard of your system is 101 keyboard,
       XKeyWrap can play the data recorded with Japanese 106 keyboard, but,
       more or less curiously)
