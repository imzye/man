NAME
       XJDIC - an  electronic  Japanese-English  dictionary  program (V2.3)

       NB: this man page contains a summary of the information in the
       xjdic23.inf file.


SYNOPSIS
       xjdic [ options ]

        - The XJDIC stand-alone program, or client which allows a user to
       connect to the xjdserver via a network.

       xjdserver [ options ]

        - The XJDIC server, which carries out dictionary searches on behalf of
       clients.

       xjdxgen [ options ] dictionary_file

        - creates the .xjdx index file for dictionary files.


DESCRIPTION
       XJDIC is an  electronic  Japanese-English  dictionary  program
       designed  to operate  in  the  X11 window environment.  In particular,
       it must run in an "xterm" environment which has Japanese language
       support such as provided by "kterm" or internationalized xterm,
       aixterm, etc.

       It  is based on JDIC and JREADER which were developed to run under MS-
       DOS on IBM PCs or clones.

       XJDIC functions as:

       (a) an English to  Japanese  dictionary  (eiwa  jiten),  searching  for
       and displaying entries for key-words entered in English;

       (b)  a  Japanese  to  English  dictionary  (waei  jiten),  searching
       for and displaying entries for keywords  or  phrases  entered  in
       Japanese  (kanji, hiragana or katakana);

       (c)  a  Japanese-English  Character  dictionary  (kanei  jiten),
       capable of selecting kanji characters by JIS code, radical, stroke
       count,  Nelson Index number or reading, and displaying compounds
       containing that kanji.

       XJDIC is typically run in a window of its own.  The user can then use
       it as a free-standing on-line dictionary.  It can also be  used  as  an
       accessory when  reading  or  writing  text  in  another window (e.g.
       reading the "fj" Japanese news groups.) Strings of text,  either
       English or Japanese,  can be moved to and from XJDIC using X11's mouse
       "cut-and-paste" operations.

       All the Japanese displayed by XJDIC is in kana and kanji,  so if you
       cannot read  at least hiragana and katakana,  this is not the program
       for you.  The author has no intention whatsoever of producing a
       version  using  romanized Japanese.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       Each option begins with a separate "-" identifier. Options are tagged:
       CL, SA or SV according to whether they are applicable to the Client,

              s=Shift-JIS)


       -P port_no [CL,SV]
              instruct the client/server version to use UDP port nnnnn,
              instead of the default  port  (47512).


       -S server_address [CL]
              instruct the client that the server is  to  be  found  at  the
              specified network  address.


       -C clipboard_file [CL,SA]
              the name of the file to use as the clipboard.


       -K [SV]
              prevent  the  server  from  establishing  itself  as  a  daemon.



KEYBOARD COMMANDS
       XJDIC operates by entering text strings of English or Japanese, upon
       which the matching dictionary entries are displayed. As well, a range

       -
              toggle long kanji display mode.

Kanji Search Mode
       Kanji Search Mode is entered using the `´ command. In this mode, keys
       are entered which match against fields in the Kanji database.

       The keys are:

       kana
              (use the @ or # prefixes to key hiragana or katakana.)

       jxxxx
              a hex JIS code for a kanji

       jhxxxx
              a hex JIS code for a kanji from the JIS X 212-1990 supplementary
              kanji.

       jknnnn
              a numeric kuten code for a kanji.

       jknnnn

Multi-Radical Mode
       This is a sub-mode with the kanji selection mode. Radical elements are
       entered, and the kanji which match that combination of elements are
       either displayed, or their number reported.

       The commands in the mode are:

       r
              display the table of radical elements

       radical
              add this element to the table.

       dn
              remove the nth element from the table.

       sn
              restrict the selection to kanji with n strokes

       s-n
              restrict the selection to kanji with <= n strokes

       s+n
              restrict the selection to kanji with >= n strokes

       s0
              remove the kanji stroke restriction.

       c
              clear the elements in the table

       l
              force the display of currently matching kanji

       v kanji
              display the elements of the specified kanji

       x
              exit this mode.

CONTROL FILE
       Configuration of the XJDIC system is accomplished via the use of the
       .xjdicrc(1) file, or the file specified in the -c option.

       The control-file contains a number of directives which establish the
       working dictionaries and files, and also set some of the operating
       modes.

       The control file directives are:

       filt [SA,CL]
              set up filter details (see the FILTERS section in the
              xjdic23.inf file.)

       omode e/j/s [SA,CL]
              set the screen output codes to EUC, JIS or Shift-JIS

       kanamode [SA,CL]
              set the initial default input mode to hiragana

       dicdir path_name [SA,SV,CL]
              set the location of the dictionary and data files. The program
              will try this directory first, followed by the local operating
              directory. Affects all files except the clipboard and the
              control file itself.  Note that this line should occur *before*
              any dicfile, etc. lines.

       dicfile path_name [SA,SV]
              dictionary name (default: edict)

       kdicfile path_name [SA,SV]
              kanji dictionary name (default: kanjidic)

       romfile path_name [SA,CL]
              romaji conversion file (default: romkana.cnv)

       verbfile path_name [SA,CL]
              conjugation file (default: vconj)

       radfile path_name [SA,CL]
              radical/bushu no. file (default: radicals.tm)

       radkfile path_name [SA,CL]
              radical/kanji file for the multi-radical search (default:
              radkfile)

       jverb on|off [SA,CL]
              enable or disable the verb de-inflection function

       kdnoshow ABCDE...  [SA,CL]
              declaration of the KANJIDIC fields to be suppressed from the
              display. For example, "kdnoshow YMQ" will prevent the display of
              the Pin-Yin information and the Four-Corner and Morohashi
              indices.

       exlist and from but .... ....
              declaration of common words of 3 or more letters to be excluded
              from the XJDXGEN generation of an .xjdx file.  There can be more
              than one "exlist" line in the file.

       clipfile [SA,CL]
              specify the name of a clipboard file to use.

       gnufile [SA,CL]
              specify the name of GNU Public Licence file (default is
              "gnu_licence".)

       rvdisplay on | off [SA,CL]
              specify the initial setting of the reverse video display of
              matches. (Default is ON)

       Note that some of these are also command-line options. If both are
       used, the control-file request takes precedence.


FILES
       Apart from the .xjdicrc control file, XJDIC requires five other files:

       radicals.tm
              the list of bushu numbers and descriptive kanji

       romkana.cnv
              the list  of  romaji  to  kana  mappings  used  in  the  input
              conversion routines.

       vconj
              the verb/adjective inflections used to identify the dictionary
              forms of words prior to lookup.

       radkfile
              the  file  of  radicals  used in the multi-radical kanji search
              function, and the kanji matching each radical.

       kanjstroke
              file of kanji  and  their  stroke-counts,  extracted  from  the
              kanjidic file.



ENVIRONMENT
       The file .xjdicrc(1) defines the locations of the files above.  The
       programs all seek this file in the current working directory, the HOME
       directory, or in the directory specified by the XJDIC environment
       variable.


INPUT METHOD
       As well as having its own romaji conversion facility, XJDIC can receive
       Japanese input from IM systems such as kinput2.


BUGS
       Any spotted should be sent to the author.
