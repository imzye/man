NAME
       File::Locate - Search the (s)locate-database from Perl

SYNOPSIS
           use File::Locate;

           print join "\n", locate "mp3", "/usr/var/locatedb";

           # or only test of something is in the database

           if (locate("mp3", "/usr/var/locatedb")) {
               print "yep...sort of mp3 there";
           }

           # do regex search
           print join "\n", locate "^/usr", -rex => 1, "/usr/var/locatedb";

ABSTRACT
           Search the (s)locate-database from Perl

DESCRIPTION
       File::Locate provides the locate() function that scans the locate
       database for a given substring or POSIX regular expression. The module
       can handle both plain old locate databases as well as the more hip
       slocate format.

FUNCTIONS
       The module exports exactly one function.

       •   locate ($pattern, [ $database ], [ -rex = 1> ], [ -rexopt =>
           'e'|'i'|'ie' ], [ $coderef ])

           Scans a slocate/locate-db file for a given $pattern. $pattern may
           contain globbing-characters or it can be a POSIX regular expression
           if -rex is true. It figures out the type of $database and does the
           right thing. If $database is neither a locate- nor a slocate-db, it
           will croak.

           locate() can take three additional parameters. A string is taken to
           be the $database that should be searched:

               print locate "*.mp3", "/usr/var/locatedb";

           If no database is given, locate() looks up the value of the
           LOCATE_PATH environment variable and uses its value as the
           database. If this string is empty, it gives up.

           Passing a code-reference makes locate() call the code for each
           match it finds in the database. The current match will be in $_:

               locate "*.mp3", sub { print "MP3 found: $_\n" };

           This means that no huge return list has to be built and it is
           therefore more suitable for scans that return a lot of matches.

           Eventually, you can specify two options -rex and -rexopt. When -rex
           is true, the pattern will be treated as a POSIX regular expression.
           Note that those are not Perl regular expressions but the rather
           limited regular expressions that you might know from programs such
           as grep(1) and the lot. Per default, a match is tried case-
           sensitively.

           With -rexopt you have slightly finer control over the regex
           matching. Setting it to "i" will make the pattern case-insensitive.
           Setting it to "e" allows you to use the Extended regular
           expressions as defined by POSIX. Those two values can be bundled to
           "-rexopt => 'ie'" should you so desire.

           All arguments except the first ($pattern) can be given in arbitrary
           order. Therefore, the following lines are all equivalent:

               locate $pat, -rex => 1, "locatedb", sub { print $_ };
               locate $pat, sub { print $_ }, -rex => 1, "locatedb";
               locate $pat, "locatedb", sub { print $_ }, -rex => 1;
               # etc.

           In list context it returns all entries found. In scalar context, it
           returns a true or a false value depending on whether any matching
           entry has been found. It is a short-cut performance-wise in that it
           immediately returns after anything has been found.

           If $coderef is provided, the function never returns anything
           regardless of context.

   EXPORT
       locate() is exported by default. If you don't want that, then pull in
       the module like that:

           use File::Locate ();

       You have to call the function fully qualified in this case:
       File::Locate::locate().
