NAME
       beansdb - high-available distributed key-value storage system

SYNOPSIS
       beansdb [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the beansdb key-value storage
       daemon.

       beansdb is a key-value storage system base on memcached and Tokyo
       Cabinet. Hash tree was built inside for fast syncing after failing or
       any other unexpected errors.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax. A summary of
       options is included below.

       -p <num>
              Listen on TCP port <num>, the default is port 7900.

       -l <ip_addr>
              Listen on <ip_addr>; default to INADDR_ANY. This is an important
              option to consider as there is no other way to secure the
              installation. Binding to an internal or firewalled network
              interface is suggested.

       -d     Run beansdb as a daemon.

       -u <username>
              Assume the identity of <username> (only when run as root).

       -c <num>
              Use <num> max simultaneous connections; the default is 1024.

       -H <datadir>
              home <datadir> of database, default is 'testdb'

       -T <num>
              log of the number of db files(base 16), default is 2 (means 256
              db files).

       -P <filename>
              Print pidfile to <filename>, only used under -d option.

       -t <threads>
              Number of threads to use to process incoming requests(default is
              16).

       -r     Raise the core file size limit to the maximum allowable.

       -h     Show the version of beansdb and a summary of options.

       -v     Be verbose during the event loop; print out errors and warnings.

       -vv    Be even more verbose; same as -v but also print client commands
              and responses.
