SCHED_ULE(4)           FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual           SCHED_ULE(4)

NAME
     sched_ule – ULE scheduler

SYNOPSIS
     options SCHED_ULE

DESCRIPTION
     The sched_ule scheduler provides a number of advanced scheduler features
     not present in sched_4bsd(4), the traditional system scheduler.  These
     features address SMP and interactivity and include:

           •   Thread CPU affinity.
           •   CPU topology awareness, including for hyper-threading.
           •   Per-CPU run queues.
           •   Interactivity heuristics that detect interactive applications
               and schedules them preferentially under high load.

     The following sysctls are relevant to the operation of sched_ule:

     kern.sched.name
             This read-only sysctl reports the name of the active scheduler.

     kern.sched.quantum
             This read-write sysctl reports or sets the length of the quantum
             (in micro-seconds) granted to a thread.

HISTORY
     The sched_ule scheduler first appeared in FreeBSD 5.1.
