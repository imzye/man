DESCRIPTION
       Template::Plugin::StripScripts is a Template::Toolkit plugin to filter
       HTML and strip scripting snipets which can cause XSS. Additionally, due
       to some nice features from HTML::StripScripts, this module can work
       really flexibly on treating HTML.

       For more details about filter options, consult the documentaion of
       HTML::StripScripts.
