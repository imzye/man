NAME
       DynaLoader::Functions - deconstructed dynamic C library loading

SYNOPSIS
           use DynaLoader::Functions qw(
               loadable_for_module
               linkable_for_loadable linkable_for_module);

           $loadable = loadable_for_module("Acme::Widget");
           @linkable = linkable_for_loadable($loadable);
           @linkable = linkable_for_module("Acme::Widget");

           use DynaLoader::Functions qw(dyna_load dyna_resolve dyna_unload);

           $libh = dyna_load($loadable, {
                       require_symbols => ["boot_Acme__Widget"],
                   });
           my $bootfunc = dyna_resolve($libh, "boot_Acme__Widget");
           dyna_unload($libh);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a function-based interface to dynamic loading as
       used by Perl.  Some details of dynamic loading are very platform-
       dependent, so correct use of these functions requires the programmer to
       be mindful of the space of platform variations.

FUNCTIONS
   File finding
       loadable_for_module(MODULE_NAME)
           MODULE_NAME must be the name of a Perl module, in bareword syntax
           with "::" separators.  The named module is presumed to be an XS
           extension following standard conventions, and its runtime-loadable
           C library file is searched for.  If found, the name of the library
           file is returned.  If it cannot be found, the function "die"s with
           an informative error message.

           If the named module is actually not an XS extension, or is not
           installed, or stores its C library in a non-standard place, there
           is a non-trivial danger that this function will find some other
           library file and believe it to be the right one.  This function
           should therefore only be used when there is an expectation that the
           module is installed and would in normal operation load its
           corresponding C library.

       linkable_for_loadable(LOADABLE_FILENAME)
           If symbols in one runtime-loadable C library are to be made
           available to another runtime-loadable C library, depending on the
           platform it may be necessary to refer to the exporting library when
           linking the importing library.  Generally this is not required on
           Unix, but it is required on Windows.  Where it is required to refer
           to the exporting library at link time, the file used may be the
           loadable library file itself, or may be a separate file used only
           for this purpose.  Given the loadable form of an exporting library,
           this function determines what is required at link time for an
           importing library.

           LOADABLE_FILENAME must be the name of a runtime-loadable C library
           file.  The function checks what is required to link a library that
           will at runtime import symbols from this library.  It returns a
           list (which will be empty on many platforms) of names of files that
           must be used as additional objects when linking the importing
           library.

       linkable_for_module(MODULE_NAME)
           Performs the job of "linkable_for_loadable" (which see for
           explanation), but based on a module name instead of a loadable
           library filename.

           MODULE_NAME must be the name of a Perl module, in bareword syntax
           with "::" separators.  The function checks what is required to link
           a library that will at runtime import symbols from the loadable C
           library associated with the module.  It returns a list (which will
           be empty on many platforms) of names of files that must be used as
           additional objects when linking the importing library.

   Low-level dynamic loading
       dyna_load(LOADABLE_FILENAME[, OPTIONS])
           Dynamically load the runtime-loadable C library in the file named
           LOADABLE_FILENAME.  The process is influenced by optional
           information supplied in the hash referenced by OPTIONS.  On the
           platforms that make dynamic loading easiest it is not necessary to
           supply any options (in which case the parameter may be omitted),
           but if wide portability is required then some options are required.
           The permitted keys in the OPTIONS hash are:

           resolve_using
               Reference to an array, default empty, of names of additional
               library files required to supply symbols used by the library
               being loaded.  On most platforms this is not used.  On those
               platforms where it is required, the need for this will be known
               by whatever generated the library to be loaded, and it will
               normally be set by a bootstrap file (see use_bootstrap_options
               below).

           require_symbols
               Reference to an array, default empty, of names of symbols
               expected to be found in the library being loaded.  On most
               platforms this is not used, but on some a library cannot be
               loaded without naming at least one symbol for which a need can
               be satisfied by the library.

           use_bootstrap_options
               Truth value, default false, controlling whether a "bootstrap"
               file will be consulted as an additional source of options to
               control loading.  The "bootstrap" file, if it exists, is
               located in the same directory as the loadable library file, and
               has a similar name differing only in its ".bs" ending.

           symbols_global
               Truth value, default false, indicating whether symbols found in
               the library being loaded must be made available to
               subsequently-loaded libraries.  Depending on platform, symbols
               may be so available even if it is not requested.  Some
               platforms, on the other hand, can't provide this facility.

               On platforms incapable of making loaded symbols globally
               available, currently loading is liable to claim success while
               leaving the symbols de facto unavailable.  It is intended that
               in the future such platforms will instead generate an exception
               when this facility is requested.

           unresolved_action
               String keyword indicating what should be done if unresolved
               symbols are detected while loading the library.  It may be
               "ERROR" (default) to treat it as an error, "WARN" to emit a
               warning, or "IGNORE" to ignore the situation.  Some platforms
               can't detect this problem, so passing this check doesn't
               guarantee that there won't be any runtime problems due to
               unresolved symbols.

           On success, returns a handle that can be used to refer to the
           loaded library for subsequent calls to "dyna_resolve" and
           "dyna_unload".  On failure, "die"s.

       dyna_resolve(LIBRARY_HANDLE, SYMBOL_NAME[, OPTIONS])
           Resolve the symbol SYMBOL in the previously-loaded library
           identified by the LIBRARY_HANDLE.  The process is influenced by
           optional information supplied in the hash referenced by OPTIONS.
           The permitted keys in the OPTIONS hash are:

           unresolved_action
               String keyword indicating what should be done if the symbol
               cannot be resolved.  It may be "ERROR" (default) to treat it as
               an error, "WARN" to emit a warning and return "undef", or
               "IGNORE" to return "undef" without a warning.

           On success, returns the value of the specified symbol, in a
           platform-dependent format.  Returns "undef" if the symbol could not
           be resolved and this is not being treated as an error.

       dyna_unload(LIBRARY_HANDLE[, OPTIONS])
           Unload the previously-loaded library identified by the
           LIBRARY_HANDLE.  The process is influenced by optional information
           supplied in the hash referenced by OPTIONS.  The permitted keys in
           the OPTIONS hash are:

           fail_action
               String keyword indicating what should be done if unloading
               detectably fails.  It may be "ERROR" (default) to treat it as
               an error, "WARN" to emit a warning, or "IGNORE" to ignore the
               situation.

           On some platforms unloading is not possible.  On any platform,
           unloading can be expected to cause mayhem if any code from the
           library is currently executing, if there are any live references to
           data in the library, or if any symbols provided by the library are
           referenced by any subsequently-loaded library.
