GSS_IMPORT_NAME(3)  FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)  GSS_IMPORT_NAME(3)

NAME
     gss_import_name – Convert a contiguous string name to internal-form

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_import_name(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         const gss_buffer_t input_name_buffer, const gss_OID input_name_type,
         gss_name_t *output_name);

DESCRIPTION
     Convert a contiguous string name to internal form.  In general, the
     internal name returned (via the output_name parameter) will not be an MN;
     the exception to this is if the input_name_type indicates that the
     contiguous string provided via the input_name_buffer parameter is of type
     GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, in which case the returned internal name will be an
     MN for the mechanism that exported the name.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status           Mechanism specific status code.

     input_name_buffer      Buffer containing contiguous string name to
                            convert.

     input_name_type        Object ID specifying type of printable name.
                            Applications may specify either GSS_C_NO_OID to
                            use a mechanism-specific default printable syntax,
                            or an OID recognized by the GSS-API implementation
                            to name a specific namespace.

     output_name            Returned name in internal form.  Storage
                            associated with this name must be freed by the
                            application after use with a call to
                            gss_release_name().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE         Successful completion

     GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE     The input_name_type was unrecognized

     GSS_S_BAD_NAME         The input_name parameter could not be interpreted
                            as a name of the specified type

     GSS_S_BAD_MECH         The input name-type was GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, but
                            the mechanism contained within the input-name is
                            not supported
