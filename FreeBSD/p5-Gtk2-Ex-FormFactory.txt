ABSTRACT
       With Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory you can build a GUI which consistently
       represents the data of your application.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a framework which tries to make building complex GUI's easy, by
       offering these two main features:

         * Consistent looking GUI without the need to code resp. tune
           each widget by hand. Instead you declare the structure of your
           GUI, connect it to the data of your program (which should be
           a well defined set of objects) and control how this structure
           is transformed into a specific layout in a very generic way.

         * Automatically keep widget and object states in sync (in both
           directions), even with complex data structures with a lot of
           internal dependencies, object nesting etc.

       This manpage describes the facilities of Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory objects
       which are only a small part of the whole framework. To get a full
       introduction and overview of how this framework works refer to
       Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Intro.

OBJECT HIERARCHY
         Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Widget
         +--- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Container
              +--- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory

ATTRIBUTES
       Attributes are handled through the common get_ATTR(), set_ATTR() style
       accessors, but they are mostly passed once to the object constructor
       and must not be altered after the associated FormFactory was built.

       context = Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Context [optional]
           This is the Context of this FormFactory. The Context connects your
           application objects and their attributes with the GUI build through
           the FormFactory. Refer to Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Context for
           details.

           If you omit this option in the new() object constructor an empty
           Context is created which can be accessed with get_context.

       layouter = Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Layout [optional]
           This is the Layout module of this FormFactory. The Layout module
           actually builds the GUI and thus controls all details of
           appearance.  Refer to Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Layout for details, if
           you're interested in writing your own Layout module.

           If you omit this option in the new() object constructor a default
           Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Layout object is created which can be
           accessed with get_layouter.

       rule_checker = Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Rules [optional]
           This is the rule checker module of this FormFactory. It's
           responsible to check user input against a set of rules which may be
           associated with a widget.

           Refer to Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Rules for details, if you're
           interested in writing your own rule checker module.

           If you omit this option in the new() object constructor a default
           Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Rules object is created which can be
           accessed with get_rule_checker.

       sync = BOOL [optional]
           By default all changes on the GUI trigger corresopndent updates on
           your application objects immediately. If you want to build dialogs
           with local changes on the GUI only, e.g. to be able to implement a
           Cancel button in a simple fashion (refer to
           Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::DialogButtons), you may switch this
           synchronisation off by setting sync to FALSE.

           But note that asynchronous dialogs are static. Dependencies between
           objects and attributes, which are defined in the associated
           Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Context, don't work on widget/GUI level.
           That's why automatic dependency resolution / widget updating only
           works for FormFactory's with sync set to TRUE.

       parent_ff = Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory object [optional]
           You may specify a parent Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory object. The Gtk
           Window of this FormFactory will be set transient to the Gtk Window
           of the parent FormFactory.

METHODS
       $form_factory->open ( [ hide => BOOL ])
           This actually builds and displays the GUI, if you set the hide
           parameter to a true value. Until this method is called you can add
           new or modify existent Widgets of this FormFactory.

           If you set hide you need to call $form_factory->show later,
           otherwise all widgets will keep invisible.

           No object data will be transfered to the GUI, so it will be more or
           less empty. Call update to put data into the GUI.

       $form_factory->update ()
           After building the GUI you should call update to transfer your
           application data to the GUI.

       $form_factory->ok ()
           This method applies all changes of a asynchronous FormFactory and
           closes it afterwards.

       $form_factory->apply ()
           All changes to Widgets inside this FormFactory are applied to the
           associated application object attributes.

           Useful only in a FormFactory with sync=FALSE.

       $form_factory->close ()
           When you exit the program you must call close on all FormFactories
           which are actually open. Otherwise you will get error messages like
           this from Perl's garbage collector:

             Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x85d7374
               during global destruction.

           That's because circular references are necessary between Gtk2 and
           Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory widgets. These references need first to be
           deleted until Perl can exit the program cleanly.

       $form_factory->cancel
           Currently this simply calls $form_factory->close.

       $form_factory->open_confirm_window ( parameters )
           This is a convenience method to open a confirmation window which is
           set modal and transient to the window of this FormFactory.  The
           following parameters are known:

             message       The message resp. question, HTML markup allowed
             position      Position of the dialog. Defaults to 'center-on-parent'.
                           Other known values are: 'none', 'center', 'mouse'
                           and 'center-always'
             yes_callback  Code reference to be called if the user
                           answered your question with "Yes"
             no_callback   Code reference to be called if the user
                           answered your question with "No"
             yes_label     (Stock-)Label for the yes button. Default 'gtk-yes'
             no_label      (Stock-)Label for the no button. Default 'gtk-no'

       $form_factory->open_message_window ( parameters )
           This is a convenience method to open a message window which is set
           modal and transient to the window of this FormFactory.  The
           following parameters are known:

             type          Type of the dialog. Defaults to 'info'.
                           Other known values are: 'warning', 'question' and 'error'
             message       The message, HTML markup allowed
             position      Position of the dialog. Defaults to 'center-on-parent'.
                           Other known values are: 'none', 'center', 'mouse'
                           and 'center-always'

       $filename = $form_factory->get_image_path
           This is a convenience method to find a filename inside Perl's @INC
           path. You will need this if you ship images or icons inside your
           module namespace and want to retreive the actual filenames of them.

       $form_factory->change_mouse_cursor ( $type [, $gtk_widget] )
           This convenience method changes the mouse cursor of the window of
           this FormFactory, or of an arbitrary widget passed as $gtk_widget.
           $type is the cursor type, e.g. "watch" for a typical busy /
           sandglass cursor. Refer to the Gtk documentation for a complete
           list of possible mouse cursors.
