DBOW(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                DBOW(1)

NAME
       dbow - a database compiler-compiler or front-end.

SYNOPSIS
       dbow [ -x ] [ -N ] [ -m ] [ -v ] [ -t type ]
            [ -h include-file ] [ -o file ] input-file ...

DESCRIPTION
       DBOW is a database compiler-compiler, or database front-end.  It takes
       table definitions in a relatively high-level language and prepares C,
       C++, PHP, Perl (etc) functions for managing and manipulating the
       database records.  It will also produce SQL table data for MySQL or
       other SQL-based databases.

       DBOW allows a user to define a database table using a meta-language
       (quite similar to the SQL CREATE TABLE syntax).  This source file can
       then be processed by DBOW to produce SQL for actually creating the
       table, a C include file with a structure definition, C functions for
       inserting, deleting, searching and updating the database, and
       housekeeping functions for maintaining the structure.

       DBOW allows the user to manage the table definition in one source file,
       and automatically produces the code for directly manipulating the
       database.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -h include-file
              Specify the prototype file to generate.  Normally this would be
              of the form foo.h which would specify that the C struct
              definition and function prototypes should be placed in a file
              called foo.h

       -m     Output an intermediate M4 file rather than a final source file.
              DBOW uses M4 to produce the actual C, Perl and PHP source.  DBOW
              will produce an M4 source file with the appropriate table
              definitions and will then invoke M4 along with the associated M4
              template file (such as perl.m4) to produce the source.  For
              debugging purposes, it is useful to see the M4 produced and
              manually execute it against the template.

       -N     Do not emit line number synchronization marks.

       -o output-file
              Specify the output filename.  The default is to strip the
              default DBOW file extension (.d) from the end of the input file
              and append the code-specific extension such as .sql, .c, .php
              etc.

       -t type
              Specifies the output filetype to produce.  This can be one of
              mysql, c, c++, php, perl, etc.

       -x     Turn on debugging.  Only useful for debugging DBOW.

       -v     Print the DBOW version and exit.

DBOW LANGUAGE DEFINITION
       In a DBOW source file, lines beginning with # are comments.

       All DBOW commands are prefixed by a percent (%) character.  The most
       important is the %table command.  This is used to define a database
       table.  It takes the form

              %table foo {
                   column-name class optional-qualifiers
                   ...
              %}

       This will create an SQL table called foo.  Columns are specified in a
       comma-separated list starting with the name of the column and its class
       (see below) and any optional qualifiers.

       The following is a list of the types of columns which can be used in
       DBOW:

              tinyint
              tinyint(size)
              smallint
              smallint(size)
              mediumint
              mediumint(size)
              integer
              integer(size)
              bigint
              bigint(size)
              float
              float(size,prec)
              double
              double(size,prec)
              double precision
              double precision(size,prec)
              real
              real(size,prec)
              decimal
              decimal(size)
              decimal(size,prec)
              numeric
              numeric(size,prec)
              date
              time
              datetime
              timestamp
              timestamp(size)
              year
              year(size)
              char(size)
              national char(size)
              varchar(size)
              national varchar(size)
              tinyblob
              tinytext
              blob
              text
              mediumblob
              mediumtext
              longblob
              longtext

       Each of these can be followed by one or more of the following
       qualifiers:

              unsigned
              not null
              primary key
              unique
              auto_increment

       For more information on column definitions, refer to the SQL standard
       or to the documentation for MySQL.  Note that unlike SQL, column names
       cannot use any of the above reserved words or any of the DBOW reserved
       words.

       The %type statement allows the user to qualify certain statements based
       on the output type.  For example,

       %type C emit

       means if we are producing C code, then execute the emit statement.

       The %code statement allows us to insert code into the output file.
       This is handy for including copyright blocks, CVS tags or hand-crafted
       code.

       For example, the following DBOW statements add an include statement
       into the output code if it is we are producing C source.

              %type C code {
              /*
               * Make sure we include the right .h files.
               */
              #include <stdlib.h>
              %}

       The %proto statement allows us to insert code into the include file or
       into the output file during the prototype phase.

       The %emit statement allows us to append code to the end of the output
       file.  This is useful for including functions such as main() and the
       like so that the C output produced is completely self-contained.

       The %insert <table> [name] statement tells DBOW to create an insert
       function in the output file.  The table argument specifies the table
       name for the insert function and the optional name field specifies the
       name of the function.

       The %delete <table> [name] statement tells DBOW to create a delete
       function in the output file.  The arguments are similar to those for
       the insert statement.

       The %search <table> <column> [name] statement tells DBOW to create a
       search function in the output file.  The table argument specifies the
       table name for the search function, the column name specifies the name
       of the column to search against and the optional name field specifies
       the name of the function.

       The %update <table> <column> [name] statement tells DBOW to create an
       update function in the output file.  The remaining arguments are
       similar to those for the search statement.

       The %dump <table> statement tells DBOW to produce a function in the
       output file which will display the contents of a given record.

       The %function statement is used to create complex functions which could
       involve joins, sorted output, multiple search criteria, etc.  It is
       still in development.

EXAMPLES
       To produce C code from a sample DBOW source file, run the command:

            dbow -t c sample.d

       This will produce the file sample.c with code to insert, delete, update
       and search the MySQL database table (or tables) specified in the source
       file.

       To also produce an include file with the C struct and function
       prototypes, use the -h option.  For example;

            dbow -t c -h sample.h sample.d

       will produce an include file as well as a source file.

       To produce SQL for creating the actual table, use the command;

            dbow -t mysql sample.d

       which will produce a file called sample.sql.

       The following is a sample DBOW source file:

              #
              # Put out a C-style comment block for all file types.
              #
              %proto {
              /*
               * $Id: dbow.1,v 1.1 2004/06/25 14:57:23 dtynan Exp $
               */
              %}

              #
              # Define the table.
              #
              %table user {
                   user_id mediumint(7) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
                   name varchar(254),
                   handle varchar(254) NOT NULL,
                   password varchar(254) NOT NULL
              %}

              #
              # Define non-standard functions...
              #
              %search user user_id
              %search user handle
              %type C dump user

FILES AND DIRECTORIES
       These are subject to difference depending on local installation
       conventions; ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent
       and should be interpreted as for GNU software; they may be the same.
       The default for both is /usr/local.

       ${exec_prefix}/bin/dbow
              Recommended location of the interpreter.

       ${prefix}/share/dbow
              Recommended location of the directory containing the standard
              template modules.

       ${prefix}/lib
              Recommended location of DBOW library module.

BUGS
       Currently the support for languages other than plain C is limited.
       While the C template is being worked and reworked to add features, it's
       unlikely that the other languages will also be kept up to date.
