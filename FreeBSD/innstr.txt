NAME
       instr, innstr, winstr, winnstr, mvinstr, mvinnstr, mvwinstr, mvwinnstr
       - get a string of characters from a curses window

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int instr(char *str);
       int innstr(char *str, int n);
       int winstr(WINDOW *win, char *str);
       int winnstr(WINDOW *win, char *str, int n);
       int mvinstr(int y, int x, char *str);
       int mvinnstr(int y, int x, char *str, int n);
       int mvwinstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *str);
       int mvwinnstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *str, int n);

DESCRIPTION
       These routines return a string of characters in str, extracted starting
       at the current cursor position in the named window.  Attributes are
       stripped from the characters.  The four functions with n as the last
       argument return a leading substring at most n characters long
       (exclusive of the trailing NUL).

RETURN VALUE
       All of the functions return ERR upon failure, or the number of
       characters actually read into the string.

       X/Open Curses defines no error conditions.  In this implementation:

       •   If the win parameter is null, an error is returned,

       •   If the chstr parameter is null, an error is returned,

       Functions with a “mv” prefix first perform a cursor movement using
       wmove, and return an error if the position is outside the window, or if
       the window pointer is null.

NOTES
       Note that all routines except winnstr may be macros.

PORTABILITY
       SVr4 does not document whether a length limit includes or excludes the
       trailing NUL.

       The ncurses library extends the XSI description by allowing a negative
       value for n.  In this case, the functions return the string ending at
       the right margin.
