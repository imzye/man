NAME
       WWW::Tumblr - Perl bindings for the Tumblr API

VERSION
       5.00

SYNOPSIS
         my $t = WWW::Tumblr->new(
            consumer_key    => $consumer_key,
            secret_key      => $secret_key,
            token           => $token,
            token_secret    => $token_secret,
         );

         my $blog = $t->blog('perlapi.tumblr.com');

         print Dumper $blog->info;

DESCRIPTION
       This module makes use of some sort of the same models as the upstream
       API, meaning that you will have User, Blog and Tagged methods:

         my $t = WWW::Tumblr->new(
           consumer_key    => $consumer_key,
           secret_key      => $secret_key,
           token           => $token,
           token_secret    => $token_secret,
         );

         # Once you have a WWW::Tumblr object, you can get a WWW::Tumblr::Blog object
         # by calling the blog() method from the former object:

         my $blog = $t->blog('perlapi.tumblr.com');

         # And then just use WWW::Tumblr::Blog methods from it:
         if ( my $post = $blog->post( type => 'text', body => 'Hell yeah, son!' ) ) {
            say "I have published post id: " . $post->{id};
         } else {
            print STDERR Dumper $blog->error;
            die "I couldn't post it :(";
         }

       You can also work directly with a WWW::Tumblr::Blog class for example:

         # You will need to set base_hostname:
         my $blog = WWW::Tumblr::Blog->new(
            %four_tokens,
            base_hostname => 'myblogontumblr.com'
         );

       All operation methods on the entire API will return false in case of an
       upstream error and you can check the status with error():

         die Dumper $blog->error unless $blog->info();

       On success, methods will return a hash reference with the JSON
       representation of the upstream response. This behavior has not changed
       from previous versions of this module.

METHOD PARAMETERS
       All methods require the same parameters as the upstream API, passed as
       hash where the keys are the request parameters and the values the
       corresponding data.

DOCUMENTATION
       Please refer to each module for further tips, tricks and slightly more
       detailed documentation:

       •   WWW::Tumblr::Blog

       •   WWW::Tumblr::User

       •   WWW::Tumblr::Tagged

       •   WWW::Tumblr::ResponseError

       Take also a look at the "t/" directory inside the distribution. There
       you can see how you can do a bunch of things: get posts, submissions,
       post quotes, text, etc, etc.

AUTHORIZATION
       It is possible to generate authorization URLs and do the whole OAuth
       dance. Please refer to the "examples/" directory within the
       distribution to learn more.

CAVEATS
       This is considered an experimental version of the module. The request
       engine needs a complete rewrite, as well as proper documentation. The
       main author of the module wanted to release it like this to have people
       interested on Tumblr and Perl give it a spin.

BUGS
       Please report as many as you want/can. File them up at GitHub:

       CPAN RT.

MODULE AND TUMBLR API VERSION NOTE
       This module supports Tumblr API v2, starting from module version 5.
       Since the previous API was deprecated upstream anyway, there's no
       backwards compatibility with < 5 versions.
