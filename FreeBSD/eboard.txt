EBOARD-ADDTHEME(1)      FreeBSD General Commands Manual     EBOARD-ADDTHEME(1)

NAME
       eboard-addtheme - a program to easily install new eboard board and
       sound themes.

SYNOPSIS
       eboard-addtheme P graphics-file description

       eboard-addtheme S sound-file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the eboard-addtheme command.  This
       manual page was contributed by the developers of the Debian GNU/Linux
       distribution.

       eboard-addtheme installs the given theme for eboard.  If it has
       sufficient permissions, it will install the theme in the system themes
       directory; otherwise, it will install it in ~/.eboard.

       eboard-addtheme's behavior depends on its first argument.  If this
       argument is P, a graphics file in the proper format should be provided
       as the second argument, and the third argument should be a description
       of the theme.  The graphics file will be installed as a new piece/board
       set.  If, on the other hand, this argument is S, a sound file should be
       provided as the second argument; it will be installed as a new sound
       theme.

       eboard must be restarted after a new theme has been added to notice the
       addition. Graphics become available in the Settings | Bitmapped Piece
       Sets submenus, sound files become available in the Sound Event
       configuration dialog boxes.
