DEVICE_GET_IVARS(9)    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual   DEVICE_GET_IVARS(9)

NAME
     device_get_ivars, device_set_ivars – access bus private variables

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void *
     device_get_ivars(device_t dev);

     void
     device_set_ivars(device_t dev, void *ivar);

DESCRIPTION
     The device_get_ivars() function returns the bus-specific instance
     variables of a device.

     The device_set_ivars() function sets the bus-specific instance variables
     of a device.

     Typically, only bus drivers will use these functions.  The kernel assumes
     that the bus driver will manage this memory, and no automatic memory
     allocation or deallocation happens.  Client drivers should access ivars
     through the BUS_READ_IVAR(9) interface instead.
