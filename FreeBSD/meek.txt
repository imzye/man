MEEK-CLIENT(1)                                                  MEEK-CLIENT(1)

NAME
       meek-client - The meek client transport plugin

SYNOPSIS
       meek-client [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       meek-client is a transport plugin for Tor that encodes a stream as a
       sequence of HTTP requests and responses. It has a url option to control
       what destination server requests are directed to, and a front option
       for domain name camouflage: The domain name in the URL is replaced by
       the front domain before the request is made, but the Host header inside
       the HTTP request still points to the original domain. The idea is to
       front through a domain that is not blocked to a domain that is blocked.

CONFIGURATION
       Configuration for meek-client usually happens in a torrc file.

       Per-bridge options are configured with SOCKS args (key=value pairs in a
       Bridge line). The possible SOCKS args are:

       url=URL (required)
           The URL of a meek-server instance. The domain name component will
           typically be hidden by the value in the front arg.

       front=DOMAIN
           Front domain name. If provided, this domain name will replace the
           domain name of url in the DNS request and TLS SNI field. The URL’s
           true domain name will still appear in the Host header of HTTP
           requests.

       utls=CLIENTHELLOID
           Use the uTLS library with the named TLS fingerprint for TLS
           camouflage. This arg is incompatible with the --helper command line
           option. The possible values of CLIENTHELLOID are:

           •   HelloRandomizedALPN

           •   HelloRandomizedNoALPN

           •   HelloFirefox_55

           •   HelloFirefox_56

           •   HelloFirefox_63

           •   HelloFirefox_65

           •   HelloFirefox_Auto = HelloFirefox_65

           •   HelloChrome_58

           •   HelloChrome_62

           •   HelloChrome_70

           •   HelloChrome_72

           •   HelloChrome_83

           •   HelloChrome_Auto = HelloChrome_83

           •   HelloIOS_11_1

           •   HelloIOS_12_1

           •   HelloIOS_Auto = HelloIOS_12_1

           As a special case, the values "none" and "HelloGolang" are
           recognized as aliases for omitting the utls SOCKS arg; i.e., use
           native Go TLS.

       For backward compatibility, each SOCKS arg also has an equivalent
       command line option. For example, this configuration using SOCKS args:

           Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1 url=https://forbidden.example/ front=allowed.example
           ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client

       is the same as this one using command line options:

           Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1
           ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client --url=https://forbidden.example/ --front=allowed.example

       SOCKS args are preferred over command line options because they allow
       you to have multiple Bridge lines with different settings. If a SOCKS
       arg and a command line option are both given for the same setting, the
       SOCKS arg takes precedence.

       The global --helper option prevents meek-client from doing any network
       operations itself. Rather, it will send all requests through a browser
       extension, which must be set up separately.

       A global proxy (applies to all Bridge lines) can be configured using
       special torrc options:

           Socks4Proxy localhost:1080
           Socks5Proxy localhost:1080
           Socks5ProxyUsername username
           Socks5ProxyPassword password
           HTTPSProxy localhost:8080
           HTTPSProxyAuthenticator username:password

       or, equivalently, using the --proxy command line option. The command
       line option takes precedence.

       When the --helper option is used, you can use proxies of type http,
       socks4a, or socks5, but you cannot use a username or password with the
       proxy. Without --helper, you can use proxies of type http, https, or
       socks5, and you can optionally use a username and password.

OPTIONS
       --front=DOMAIN
           Front domain name. Prefer using the front SOCKS arg on a bridge
           line over using this command line option.

       --helper=ADDRESS
           Address of HTTP helper browser extension. For example,
           --helper=127.0.0.1:7000.

       --proxy=URL
           URL of upstream proxy. For example, --proxy=http://localhost:8080/,
           --proxy=socks4a://localhost:1080, or
           --proxy=socks5://localhost:1080. Can also be configured using the
           HTTPSProxy, Socks4Proxy, or Socks5Proxy options in a torrc file.

       --log=FILENAME
           Name of a file to write log messages to (default stderr).

       --url=URL
           URL to correspond with. Prefer using the url SOCKS arg on a bridge
           line over using this command line option.

       --utls=CLIENTHELLOID
           Use uTLS with the given TLS fingerprint for TLS camouflage. This
           option is incompatible with --helper. Prefer using the utls SOCKS
           arg over using this command line option.

       -h, --help
           Display a help message and exit.
