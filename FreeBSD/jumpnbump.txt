SECRET CODES
       You can type these while in the game
       jetpack - you can fly
       pogostick - the bunnies keep jumping
       bunniesinspace - gravity is lower, you can jump higher
       lordoftheflies - the flies are attracted
       bloodisthickerthanwater - water turns to blood

LEVELS
       There are two programs to help you make your own levels: jnbpack and
       jnbunpack.

       jnbpack -o /tmp/newlevel.dat <file1> <file2> <file3> etc

       or you can just put all the files in a dir, cd to that dir and do

       jnbpack -o /tmp/newlevel.dat *

       and it will put all the files in the current dir inside the packfile.
       Don't try things like jnbpack -o stuff.dat ../file.c because it will
       add "../file.c" as the filename in the packfile, which won't work.

       jnbunpack level.dat
       will unpack it in the current directory.

       With gobpack you can convert .gob files (which are sprites, described
       in gob.txt) into .pcx files which you can edit with gimp for example,
       then convert back to a .gob and use it in your own level.

       gobpack -u font menu.pcx

       will unpack font.gob using the color palette from menu.pcx and write
       the files font.pcx font.txt. The other gob files should use level.pcx
       for the correct palette.

       gobpack font

       will generate font.gob from font.pcx and the specifications in
       font.txt.  The .pcx files should be resaved with another program, as
       they are not packed and are thus very large.
