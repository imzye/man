NAME
       Role::HasMessage - a thing with a message method

VERSION
       version 0.006

DESCRIPTION
       This is another extremely simple role.  A class that includes
       Role::HasMessage is promising to provide a "message" method that
       returns a string summarizing the message or event represented by the
       object.  It does not provide any actual behavior.
