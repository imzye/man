NAME
       webbench - simple forking web benchmark

SYNOPSIS
       webbench [options] URL

AUTHOR
       This program and manual page was written by Radim Kolar, for the
       Supreme Personality of Godhead (but may be used by others).

DESCRIPTION
       webbench is simple program for benchmarking HTTP servers or any other
       servers, which can be accessed via HTTP proxy. Unlike others
       benchmarks, webbench uses multiple processes for simulating traffic
       generated by multiple users. This allows better operating on SMP
       systems and on systems with slow or buggy implementation of select().

OPTIONS
       The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options are
       included below.

       -?, -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       -f, --force
              Do not wait for any response from server. Close connection after
              request is send. This option produce quite a good denial of
              service attack.

       -9, --http09
              Use HTTP/0.9 protocol, if possible.

       -1, --http10
              Use HTTP/1.0 protocol, if possible.

       -2, --http11
              Use HTTP/1.1 protocol (without Keep-Alive ), if possible.

       -r, --reload
              Forces proxy to reload document. If proxy is not set, option has
              no effect.

       -t, --time <n>
              Run benchmark for <n> seconds. Default value is 30.

       -p, --proxy <server:port>
              Send request via proxy server. Needed for supporting others
              protocols than HTTP.

       --get  Use GET request method.

       --head Use HEAD request method.

       --options
              Use OPTIONS request method.

       --trace
              Use TRACE request method.

       -c, --clients <n>
              Use <n> multiple clients for benchmark. Default value is 1.

EXIT STATUS
       0 - sucess

       1 - benchmark failed, can not connect to server

       2 - bad command line argument(s)

       3 - internal error, i.e. fork failed

TODO
       Include support for using Keep-Alive HTTP/1.1 connections.
