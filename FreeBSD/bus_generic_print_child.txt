BUS_GENERIC_PRINT_CHILD(9)                   FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

NAME
     bus_generic_print_child – generic implementation of DEVICE_PRINT_CHILD
     for buses

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     int
     bus_generic_print_child(device_t dev, device_t child);

DESCRIPTION
     This implementation prints out the default device announcement message.
     Given device 'foo0' on bus 'bar0' where foo0 has the name "FooCard 1234"
     the following would be printed:

     foo0: <FooCard 1234> on bar0

     bus_generic_print_child itself calls two functions
     bus_print_child_header() and bus_print_child_footer().  The former prints
     "foo0: <FooCard 1234>" and the latter "on bar0".  These routines should
     be used if possible in your own code if bus_generic_print_child() does
     not completely suit your needs.

RETURN VALUES
     The number of characters output.
