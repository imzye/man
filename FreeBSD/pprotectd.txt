PPROTECTD(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           PPROTECTD(8)

NAME
     pprotectd – daemon which protect processes from killing by the kernel
     when memory is exhausted

SYNOPSIS
     pprotectd [-n] [-d debug level] [-l logfile] [-t timeout]
               -F pidfile1, pidfile2, ...

DESCRIPTION
     The pprotectd utility sets the P_PROTECTED flag for each PID from
     pidfiles that list as an argument.  If all given pidfiles exist and the
     P_PROTECTED flag is set successfully for each PID, daemon blocks on
     kevent(2) and will wait untill some process becomes terminated.  When
     some process has terminated, the pprotectd wakes up and gets a new PID
     from pidfile, then pprotectd sets the P_PROTECTED flag for it.  If any
     given pidfile does not exist, the pprotectd will retry to read it after
     timeout.

     The options are as follows:

     -d debug level
             Set debug level (0 - off, 1 - errors, 2 - warnings, 3 - debug).
             The default is 1.

     -F pidfile1, pidfile2, ...
             List of pidfiles that contain PIDs for protection.

     -l logfile
             Set filename for log messages.  If argument equals syslog, daemon
             log messages will be logged via syslog(3).  The default is
             syslog.

     -n      Do not daemonize.

     -t timeout
             Set timeout in seconds.  The default is 10.
