TERMKEY_ADVISEREADABLE(3)                     FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
       termkey_advisereadable - read more bytes from the underlying terminal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <termkey.h>

       TermKeyResult termkey_advisereadable(TermKey *tk);

       Link with -ltermkey.

DESCRIPTION
       termkey_advisereadable() informs the termkey(7) instance that new input
       may be available on the underlying file descriptor and so it should
       call read(2) to obtain it. If at least one more byte was read it will
       return TERMKEY_RES_AGAIN to indicate it may be useful to call
       termkey_getkey(3) again. If no more input was read then
       TERMKEY_RES_NONE is returned. If there was no buffer space remaining,
       then TERMKEY_RES_ERROR is returned with errno set to ENOMEM. If no
       filehandle is associated with this instance, TERMKEY_RES_ERROR is
       returned with errno set to EBADF.

       This function, along with termkey_getkey(3) make it possible to use the
       termkey instance in an asynchronous program. To provide bytes without
       using a readable file handle, use termkey_push_bytes(3).

       For synchronous usage, termkey_waitkey(3) performs the input blocking
       task.

RETURN VALUE
       termkey_advisereadable() returns one of the following constants:

       TERMKEY_RES_AGAIN
              At least one byte was read.

       TERMKEY_RES_NONE
              No nore bytes were read.

       TERMKEY_RES_ERROR
              An IO error occurred. errno will be preserved. If the error is
              EINTR then this will only be returned if TERMKEY_FLAG_EINTR flag
              is not set; if it is then the IO operation will be retried
              instead.
