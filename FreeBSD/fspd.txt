NAME
       fspd, in.fspd - File Service Protocol (FSP) server

SYNOPSIS
       fspd [-f configfile] [-p port] [-i] [-v|-V] [-t timeout] [-X] [-d
       directory] [-F ] [-T temporary directory] [-l logfile] [-P pidlogname]
       [-b bandwidth] [-s packetsize]

DESCRIPTION
       fspd is the server for an anonymous-ftp style archive called FSP. The
       main features of this service are: connection-less model, communication
       robustness, server resource protection, inter-client protection, and
       user friendly interface. Please read the INFO file bundled with the FSP
       source for more information.

OPTIONS
       -f                  May be used to specify an alternate configuration
                           file.

       -i                  Use when fspd is running from inetd.

       -p port             May be used to specify an alternative port.

       -d directory        May be used to specify an alternative home
                           directory.

       -v | -V             Show server version.

       -X                  Turn on debuging.

       -t timeout          Set server inactivity shutdown timeout for running
                           in inetd mode. Default is 120 seconds. When -d is
                           used, this timeout works in normal mode also
                           (usefull for debuging of memory leaks).

       -F                  Run fspd in foreground, do not daemonize.

       -T directory        Set server temporary directory used for uploading.
                           This directory can be outside FSP home directory
                           since it is not directly accessible by clients.
                           Using directory inside FSP home is not a security
                           risk.

       -l logfile          Write log output to file.

       -P pidlogname       Write pid to the given file name.

       -b bandwidth        Enable bandwidth limiting. Limit output to
                           bandwidth bytes per second.

       -s packetsize       Sets maximum allowed or prefered packet's payload
                           size. Server must support packets up to 1024, but
                           may prefer to send smaller packets.  It may accept
                           packets over 1024 bytes. Default value is 1460
                           bytes.  All networks must be able to transfer 500
                           bytes (RFC requirement).

FILES
       .FSP_OWNER          Used to indicate the ownership of a directory.
                           This file contains lines with the same syntax as
                           host lines in fspd.cnf but without keyword host on
                           start of line. Host types D, I, N can be used to
                           restrict access to specific directory. Owners are
                           marked with host type O.

       .README             A text file that is sent to the client when the
                           directory is entered giving information about the
                           directory.  It can only be hand created by the site
                           administrator at this time. This text file should
                           be no more than 1022 bytes in size. Any data above
                           this limit will be silently ignored. Name of this
                           file can be changed in server configuration file.

       .FSP_OK_DEL         Existence of this file in a directory grants non-
                           owner machines the permission to delete items from
                           this directory.

       .FSP_OK_ADD         Existence of this file in a directory grants non-
                           owner machines the permission to add items to this
                           directory.

       .FSP_NO_LIST        Existence of this file removes right to list a
                           directory from non-owner.

       .FSP_NO_GET         Existence of this file in a directory means that
                           files in that directory cannot be read by public,
                           i.e. they are private.

       .FSP_OK_MKDIR       Existence of this file in a directory grants non-
                           owner machines the permission to create
                           subdirectories under the current directory.

       .FSP_OK_RENAME      Existence of this file in a directory grants non-
                           owner machines the permission to rename files in
                           directory.

       .FSP_OK_PASSWORD    Password required for non privileged access.

       .FSP_OWNER_PASSWORD Password required for privileged access. You must
                           have also your IP listed in .FSP_OWNER file.

       .TXXXXXXXXXXXX      Transient temporary file in the FSP temporary
                           directory used for file uploading.

       .GXXXXXXXXXXXX      Transient temporary file in the FSP temporary
                           directory used for file downloading through the
                           fgrab command.

       fspd.conf           A file containing control information about how
                           specific features of the server are to be used. See
                           the example.conf file for explicit details.

       .FSP_CONTENT        File used to cache directory listing.  Such files
                           are normally created on demand in each directory
                           that fspd exports.

SIGNALS
       SIGUSR1
              Server dumps stats to file specified as dumpfile in
              configuration.  This file must be writeable by server or server
              must have rights to create it.

       SIGINT | SIGTERM
              Server performs cleaup and exits. All connected clients will be
              disconnected. Because FSP is stateless protocol, if you start
              server later, clients can continue without breakage.

EXIT CODES
       1 configuration or command line invocation error.

       2 can not open/bind server socket

       3 can not change uid to runuid

       4 can not change gid to rungid

       5 out of memory

       6 can not change directory to homedir

       7 select() error

       8 can not write pidfile

       99 Internal terror

CLIENTS
       You need FSP version 2 compatible client to be able to talk to the
       server. Most popular is fspclient(1) which can be downloaded from
       http://fspclient.sourceforge.net. Other possibility is to use commands
       from fsp distribution listed in SEE ALSO section.
