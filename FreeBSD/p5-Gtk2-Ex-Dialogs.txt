Gtk2::Ex::Dialogs::Question(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation



NAME
       Gtk2::Ex::Dialogs::Question - Provides a simple question dialog.

SYNOPSIS
        use Gtk2::Ex::Dialogs::Question ( destroy_with_parent => TRUE,
                                          modal => TRUE,
                                          no_separator => FALSE );

        # do some stuff like creating your app's main $window then,
        # to ensure that all messages use the right parent, set it:
        $Gtk2::Ex::Dialogs::Question::parent_window = $window;

        # now popup a new dialog
        my $r = ask Gtk2::Ex::Dialogs::Question ( "Is Perl only hacker's glue?" );
        if ( $r ) {
          # end-user thinks so
        } else {
          # end-user does not think so
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple dialog api that wraps Gtk2::Dialog
       objectively.  The objective is a clean and simple question dialog (just
       "NO" and "YES" buttons).

OPTIONS
       All public methods (and the entire class) support the following
       options:

       title => STRING
           The title of the dialog window. Defaults to an empty string.

       text => STRING
           The text to be displayed. This is the core purpose of the module
           and is the only mandatory argument.

       icon => /path/to/image || stock-id || Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf || Gtk2::Image
           The dialog-sized image to place to the left of the text. Note:
           there are five aliased stock-ids which correspond to the five
           gtk-dialog-* ids, "warning", "question", "info", "error" and
           "authentication". Defaults to the stock-id "gtk-dialog-question".

       parent_window => Gtk2::Window
           Reference to the main application window.

       destroy_with_parent => BOOL
           When the parent_window is destroyed, what do we do? Defaults to
           FALSE.

       modal => BOOL
           Does this message make the parent_window freeze while the message
           exists.  Defaults to FALSE.

       no_separator => BOOL
           Draw the horizontal separator between the content area and the
           button area below. Defaults to FALSE.

       default_yes => BOOL
           Autofocus on the "YES" button. Defaults to FALSE.

PUBLIC METHODS
       OBJECT = new ( OPTIONS | STRING )
           Create a new Gtk2::Dialog with stock "NO" and "YES" buttons, some
           text and an optional icon to the left of the text. The icon can be
           any of the following: a stock-id string, a Gtk2::Image,
           Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf or the full path to an image.  Returns a
           Gtk2::Ex::Dialogs::Question object. In the special case of being
           passed only one argument, all options are set to defaults and the
           one argument is used as the text argument. Use of new() is
           discouraged in favour of ask() or new_and_run().

       RESPONSE = ask ( OPTIONS | STRING ) | new_and_run ( OPTIONS | STRING )
           Supports all the same arguments as new(). This will create a new
           Gtk2::Ex::Dialogs::Question, show_all(), run() and return the
           response of TRUE/'yes' or FALSE/''. Note that ask() is the alias
           for new_and_run().
