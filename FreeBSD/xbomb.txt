DESCRIPTION
       A game of logical deduction against the clock. The purpose of the game
       is to find the location of the hidden bombs in a grid.  Each of the
       locations in the grid is initially covered, by uncovering a locations,
       a number or a bomb will be revealed underneath.  If a bomb is revealed
       then the game is finished.  A number indicates the number of adjacent
       locations that contain bombs.  Locations that have not been uncovered
       but are thought to contain bombs can be marked as such so that they can
       be identified.

       There is a choice of hexagonal, square or triangular units that make up
       the grid, the level of difficulty increasing as the number of sides
       decreases.  In all cases the grids are of the same size and contain the
       same number of bombs for the same levels.

       There are three levels to the game:

       Easy   8 by 8 grid with 10 bombs.

       Medium 16 by 16 grid with 40 bombs.

       Difficult
              30 by 16 grid with 99 bombs.

       A high score table is maintained for each of the levels for each of the
       grid types, storing the username, the time to complete the puzzle and
       the date that it was finished.

MOUSE OPERATION
       The game is played with the mouse, with all three buttons having
       different actions.

       Left Button
              Uncover the current location if it is hidden or uncover all
              surrounding locations marked as not containing bombs if the
              square is already uncovered. The first selection made in a game
              is always a 'safe' square.

       Middle Button
              Uncover all surrounding locations that are not marked as
              containing a bomb.
