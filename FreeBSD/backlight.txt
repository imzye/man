DESCRIPTION

     Drivers for backlight system register themselves globally using the
     backlight_register() function.  They must define two methods,
     BACKLIGHT_GET_STATUS() which is used to query the current brightness
     level and BACKLIGHT_SET_STATUS() which is used to update it.

INTERFACE
     BACKLIGHT_GET_STATUS(device_t bus, struct backlight_props *props)
             Driver fills the current brightless level and the optional
             supported levels.

     BACKLIGHT_SET_STATUS(device_t bus, struct backlight_props *props)
             Driver update the backlight level based on the brightness member
             of the props struct.
