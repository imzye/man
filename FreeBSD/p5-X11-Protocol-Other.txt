NAME
       Encode::X11 -- character encodings for X11

SYNOPSIS
        use Encode;
        use Encode::X11;
        my $chars = Encode::decode ('x11-compound-text', $bytes);

DESCRIPTION
       This module encodes and decodes X11 ICCCM "compound text" strings.

           x11-compound-text

       Compound text is found in window properties of type "COMPOUND_TEXT".
       It's not usual to use it outside that context.  Compound text consists
       of ISO-2022 style escape sequences switching among various basic
       charsets, including the ISO-8859 series, JIS, KSC, and GB.

       The plain name "x11-compound-text" tries to encode in a sensible and
       compatible way.  Perhaps in the future there'll be some options or
       variations for which charsets to use.  For now encoding prefers the
       original ICCCM charsets latin-N, JIS, KSC and GB for the benefit of
       older X clients, then the newer utf-8 encoding when necessary.

       The decode is meant to recognise anything, but may be a bit limited
       yet.  Perhaps it could be just a full ISO-2022 decode, if/when that
       might exist, but for now it's done explicitly and might potentially
       cope with X11 specifics.

       Decoding cns11643 segments requires the "Encode::HanExtra" module.
       Such segments are not normally generated by the Xlib conversions (as of
       X.org libX11 1.4.0).  Have HanExtra available if you think you might
       encounter them.

       Emacs has some "private encoding" sequences for big5.  They're not
       supported currently.

       When working with compound text you might in fact not want to convert
       it to Perl wide chars.  If drawing with the core X requests then split
       it into segments of the various charsets and find a font for each
       encoding.  Some oopery could no doubt represent such a breakdown and
       have things like concatenate or compare.  That would work almost
       directly with the bytes without converting.
