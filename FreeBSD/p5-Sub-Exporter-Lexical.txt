Sub::Exporter::Lexical(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Sub::Exporter::Lexical - to export lexically-available subs with
       Sub::Exporter

VERSION
       version 1.000

SYNOPSIS
       In an exporting library:

         package Some::Toolkit;

         use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
           exports   => [ qw(foo bar baz) ],
         };

         sub foo { ... }
         sub bar { ... }
         sub baz { ... }

       In an importing library:

         package Vehicle::Autobot;

         use Sub::Exporter::Lexical lexical_installer => { -as => 'lex' };

         ...;

         {
           use Some:::Toolkit { installer => lex }, qw(foo bar);

           foo(1,2,3);
           my $x = bar;

           ...
         };

         # ... and here, foo and bar are no longer available ...

DESCRIPTION
       Sub::Exporter::Lexical provides an alternate installer for
       Sub::Exporter.  Installers are documented in Sub::Exporter's
       documentation; all you need to know is that by using
       Sub::Exporter::Lexical's installer, you can import routines into a
       lexical scope that will be cleaned up when that scope ends.

       There are two places it makes sense to use the lexical installer: when
       configuring Sub::Exporter in your exporting package or when importing
       from a package that uses Sub::Exporter.  For the first case, do
       something like this:

         package Some::Toolkit;
         use Sub::Exporter::Lexical ();
         use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
           exports   => [ ... ],
           installer => Sub::Exporter::Lexical::lexical_installer,
         };

       For the second:

         package My::Library;

         use Sub::Exporter::Lexical ();
         use Some::Toolkit
           { installer => Sub::Exporter::Lexical::lexical_installer },
           qw(foo bar baz);

PERL VERSION
       This module is shipped with no promise about what version of perl it
       will require in the future.  In practice, this tends to mean "you need
       a perl from the last three years," but you can't rely on that.  If a
       new version of perl ship, this software may begin to require it for any
       reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower
       the minimum required perl.

EXPORTS
       Sub::Exporter::Lexical offers only one routine for export, and it may
       also be called by its full package name:

   lexical_installer
       This routine returns an installer suitable for use as the "installer"
       argument to Sub::Exporter.  It installs all requested routines as
       usual, but marks them to be removed from the target package as soon as
       the block in which it was called is complete.

       It does not affect the behavior of routines exported into scalar
       references.

       More importantly, it does not affect scopes in which it is invoked at
       runtime, rather than compile time.  This is important!  It means that
       this works:

         {
           use Some::Toolkit { installer => lexical_installer }, qw(foo);
           foo(1,2,3);
         }

         foo(); # this dies

       ...but this does not...

         {
           require Some::Toolkit;
           Some::Toolkit->import({ installer => lexical_installer }, qw(foo));
           foo(1,2,3);
         }

         foo(); # this does not die, even though you might expect it to

       Finally, you can't supply a "-as => \$var" install destination yet.
