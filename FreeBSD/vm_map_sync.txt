VM_MAP_SYNC(9)         FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual        VM_MAP_SYNC(9)

NAME
     vm_map_sync – push dirty pages to their pager

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/vm_map.h>

     int
     vm_map_sync(vm_map_t map, vm_offset_t start, vm_offset_t end,
         boolean_t syncio, boolean_t invalidate);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_map_sync() function forces any dirty cached pages in the range
     start to end within the map to be pushed to their underlying pager.

     If syncio is TRUE, dirty pages are written synchronously.

     If invalidate is TRUE, any cached pages are also freed.

     The range provided must be contiguous, it MUST NOT contain holes.  The
     range provided MUST NOT contain any sub-map entries.

RETURN VALUES
     The vm_map_sync() function returns KERN_SUCCESS if successful.

     Otherwise, KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS will be returned if the function
     encountered a sub-map entry; KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT will be returned if
     the function encountered a hole in the region provided, or if an entry
     could not be found for the given start address.
