Gnumeric::Base
       Base object class for representing Gnumeric objects.

   Accessors and methods
       define_instance_accessors

       Class method, given a list of accessor names, defines a method for each
       that accesses the instance slot if called without arguments and sets
       the slot if called with a single argument.  This should be invoked in a
       BEGIN block near the top of the subclass definition, so that Perl knows
       that these methods are defined.

       new

       Constructs a new object instance by blessing an empty hashref with the
       initial class arg, then treating the remaining arguments as
       keyword/value slot initializers, sending the first value of each pair
       as the method with the second value as its argument if the new object
       handles the method.
