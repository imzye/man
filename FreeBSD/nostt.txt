BUGS
     Teletext's 6-cell (2x3) block characters are displayed as % characters as
     they cannot be accurately reproduced in a terinal without special fonts.
     (The NOS viewer and API uses a custom font with these characters in the
     "private use" 0xF000 Unicode range.)

     Color ouptut is disabled by default in MinTTY on Windows.  This is
     because MinTTY redirects standard output.  Set CLICOLOR_FORCE to 1 to
     force color output.
