NAME
       Markdown::Render - Render markdown as HTML

SYNOPSIS
        use Markdown::Render;

        my $md = Markdown::Render->new( infile => 'README.md');

        $md->render_markdown->print_html;

       ...or from the command line to create HTML

        md-utils.pl -r README.md > README.html

       ...or from the command line to replace render custom tags

        md-utils.pl README.md.in > README.md

DESCRIPTION
       Renders markdown as HTML using either GitHub's API or
       Text::Markdown::Discount. Optionally adds additional metadata to
       markdown document using custom tags.

       See README.md <https://github.com/rlauer6/markdown-
       utils/blob/master/README.md> for more details.

       Note: This module originally used Text::Markdown as an alternative to
       using the GitHub API however, there are too many bugs and
       idiosyncracies in that module. This module will now use
       Text::Markdown::Discount which is not only faster, but seems to be more
       compliant with GFM.

       Note: Text::Markdown::Discount relies on the text-markdown library
       which did not actually support all of the markdown features (including
       code fencing).  You can find an updated version of
       Text::Markdown::Discount here:
