NAME
       Hash::Slice - Make a hash from a deep slice of another hash

VERSION
       Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
           use Hash::Slice qw/slice cslice/;

           # A trivial example
           my %hash = (a => 1, b => 2, c => 3);

           my $slice = slice \%hash, qw/a b/;

           # $slice is now { a => 1, b => 2 }


           # A hairy example
           my %hash = (a => 1, b => 2, c => { d => 3, e => 4 });

           my $slice = slice \%hash, qw/a/, [ c => qw/e/ ];

           # $slice is now { a => 1, c => { e => 4 } }


           # An even hairier example
           my %hash = (a => 1, b => 2, c => { d => 3, e => 4, f => { g => 5, h => 6, k => [ 0 .. 4 ] } }, z => 7);

           my $slice = slice \%hash, qw/a z/, [ c => qw/e/, [ f => qw/g k/ ] ];

           # $slice is now { a => 1, z => 7, c => { e => 4, f => { g => 5, k => [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] } } }


           # Make a cloned-slice of %hash
           my %hash = (a => 1, b => 2, c => { d => 3, e => 4, f => { g => 5, h => 6, k => [ 0 .. 4 ] } }, z => 7);

           my $slice = cslice \%hash, qw/a z/, [ c => qw/e/, [ f => qw/g k/ ] ];
           $slice->{c}->{e} = "red"; # $hash{c}->{e} is still 4

DESCRIPTION
       Hash::Slice lets you easily make a deep slice of a hash, specifically a
       hash containing one or more nested hashes. Instead of just taking a
       slice of the first level of a hash in an all-or-nothing manner, you can
       use slice to take a slice of the first level, then take a particular
       slice of the second level, and so on.

FUNCTIONS
   $slice = slice $hash, @cut
   %slice = slice $hash, @cut
       Make a copy of $hash according to @cut.

       For each key in @cut, slice will copy the value of the key over to
       $slice->{$key}. If $slice encounters an ARRAY instead of a key, it will
       make a deep slice using the first element of ARRAY as the key and the
       rest of the array as the cut.

       Note, this method will not make an entry in $slice unless the key
       exists in $hash

       Note, unless you are making a deep cut, slice will simply copy the
       reference of the data being copied, and not make a clone. If you need
       to make a completely independent copy, use cslice or dcslice.

   $slice = cslice $hash, @cut
   $slice = clone_slice $hash, @cut
       Make a copy of $hash according to @cut. $slice is an independent clone
       of $hash made using Clone::clone

   $slice = dcslice $hash, @cut
   $slice = dclone_slice $hash, @cut
       Make a copy of $hash according to @cut. $slice is an independent clone
       of $hash made using Storable::dclone
