NAME
       BIEW - console hex viewer/editor and disassembler.


SYNOPSIS
       biew [OPTIONS] file...


DESCRIPTION
       BIEW (Binary vIEW) is a free, portable, advanced file viewer with
       built-in editor for binary, hexadecimal and disassembler modes.

       It contains a highlight PentiumIV/K7-Athlon/Cyrix-M2 disassembler, full
       preview of MZ, NE, PE, LE, LX, DOS.SYS, NLM, ELF, a.out, arch, coff32,
       PharLap, rdoff executable formats, a code guider, and lot of other
       features, making it invaluable for examining binary code.

       Refer to biew_en.txt and unix.txt files which should come along with
       the program package for detailed description of what BIEW can do for
       you -- this manual page describes only several UNIX-specific features,
       and is quite useless without the above mentioned documents.


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -a     autodetect mode (default)

       -b     view file in binary mode

       -d     view file in disassembler mode

       -h     view file in hexadecimal mode

       -t     view file in text mode

       -s     change size of file to NNN bytes (create, if file does not
              exist)

       -i     ignore .ini file (create new)

       -?     display help screen


UNIX-specific features of BIEW
       1)  Key modifiers in terminal mode are re-mapped as:

       CTRL+A = ALT

       CTRL+C = CTRL

       CTRL+S = SHIFT

       i.e. pressing CTRL+A acts as holding down ALT , and so on.  CTRL+Z
       resets modifiers to defaults. Modifiers are also reseted after any
       function key is pressed.

       [except for BIEW/LINUX in console mode]

       2)  There are several limitations on output in terminal mode, i.e. you
       can't see all characters as they are (output is filtered to avoid
       unexpected behavior).

       [except for BIEW/LINUX in console mode]

       3)  It is possible to use 7bit output.

       4)  Configuration file is ~/.biewrc, not biew.ini.



Linux-specific features
       Current Linux version of BIEW supports two work modes: console and
       VT100 compatible terminal. Console version can act EXACTLY as
       dos/os2/win32 version, this means that you can't switch virtual
       consoles by pressing ALT+Fx, because these keys are used by BIEW -- use
       CTRL+ALT+Fx combination for that purpose.

       Terminal mode should work on any VT100 compatible terminal.

       Linux console version uses:
              - scan codes (not keystrokes)
              - direct video output via /dev/vcsa

       IMPORTANT! Console mode is invoked only:
              1) if "Direct console access" flag is enabled (F9)
              2) on pure virtual terminal

       In any other case VT100 mode is used.


BUGS
       There could be few.  You can fix them on your own, or ask authors to do
       it.
