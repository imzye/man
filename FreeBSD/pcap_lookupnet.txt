NAME
       pcap_lookupnet - find the IPv4 network number and netmask for a device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       int pcap_lookupnet(const char *device, bpf_u_int32 *netp,
               bpf_u_int32 *maskp, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_lookupnet() is used to determine the IPv4 network number and mask
       associated with the network device device.  Both netp and maskp are
       bpf_u_int32 pointers.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_lookupnet() returns 0 on success and PCAP_ERROR on failure. If
       PCAP_ERROR is returned, errbuf is filled in with an appropriate error
       message.  errbuf is assumed to be able to hold at least
       PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.
