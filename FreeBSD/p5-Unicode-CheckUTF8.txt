NAME
       Unicode::CheckUTF8 - checks if scalar is valid UTF-8

SYNOPSIS
          use Unicode::CheckUTF8 qw(is_utf8);
          my $is_ok = is_utf8($scalar);

DESCRIPTION
       This is an XS wrapper around some Unicode Consortium code to check if a
       string is valid UTF-8, revised to conform to what expat/Mozilla think
       is valid UTF-8, especially with regard to low-ASCII characters.

       Note that this module has NOTHING to do with Perl's internal UTF8 flag
       on scalars.

       This module is for use when you're getting input from users and want to
       make sure it's valid UTF-8 before continuing.

HISTORY
       This is some old code, dating back to before Perl 5.8 and before
       Unicode support in Perl.  I wish I didn't have to keep using this code,
       but I can't find any other code on CPAN for UTF-8 checking that's both
       sufficiently fast and more importantly, correct.  So now there's yet
       another way to do it.

BUGS
       Hopefully not, but mail me if so!
