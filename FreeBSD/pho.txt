PHO(l)                                                                  PHO(l)

NAME
       pho - View and annotate multiple images

SYNTAX
       pho [options] [filename[filename...]]

DESCRIPTION
       pho displays images, in the formats handled by the gdk-pixbuf package,
       to an X display.  It is intended as a lightweight and fast viewer,
       optimized for rapidly going through large numbers of uploaded images.

       pho is entirely keyboard driven, and allows for interactive rotation
       and taking of notes on each image.  It resizes after rotations and will
       always attempt to show the image as large as possible.  The final
       rotation reached for each image will be remembered and printed when the
       program exits (for use with a batch image rotation script).

       pho can also remember up to ten lists of images (numbered 0-9) which
       can correspond to anything the user wishes. The image lists will be
       printed to standard output when pho exits. Use this to keep notes on
       which images you want to save to the web, which images contain images
       of your dog, etc.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -p     "Presentation mode": display in full screen mode with a black
              background (if the window manager allows it). In presentation
              mode, if you zoom in and need to move (pan) in the image, drag
              with the middle mouse button.

       -P     Force non-presentation mode (e.g. if you set PHO_ARGS=-p).

       -n     Replace each image with a new window (slower, but helpful for
              some broken window managers).

       -k     Keywords mode: display images scaled down, and show a Keywords
              dialog for classifying images. (Keywords mode will cancel
              Presentation mode.)

       -sN    Automatic Slideshow mode, where N is the delay in seconds.  For
              example, -s5 will show pause 5 seconds between images.  -s0
              means no delay.

       -d     Debug mode: may print a few debugging messages to standard
              output.

       -h     Help: print a usage statement.  -v Verbose help: print a summary
              of key bindings.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PHO_ARGS: default flag settings
              (e.g. set it to -p to use presentation mode by default).  Any
              flags given on the command line will override these settings.

       PHO_CMD: the command to call when you press the 'g' key.
              Include a %s to represent the filename of the current image.
              (Defaults to gimp %s).

KEY BINDINGS
       When pho is running, it obeys the following keys:

       [space], [Page Down]
              Go to next image. Or cancel slideshow mode, if active.

       [backspace], [Page Up]
              Go to previous image

       r, t, [right-arrow]
              Rotate right (clockwise)

       R, T, l, L, [left-arrow]
              Rotate left (counter-clockwise)

       [up-arrow], [down-arrow]
              Rotate 180 degrees.

       Home   Go back to the first image.

       d      Delete (will bring up a confirmation dialog; clicking OK or
              typing another d deletes the file).

       i      Show a dialog with information about the image, including EXIF
              tags.

       0 through 9
              Add the image to the appropriate notes list

       f      Toggle in/out of "full size mode".  Images will be shown at
              their native size, even if it's bigger than the screen size.
              (Hint: Many window managers let you move oversized windows with
              alt-drag.)

       F      Toggle in/out of "full screen mode" (or "fit to window").
              Images will be scaled up or down to fill the screen in at least
              one dimension.

       p      Toggle in/out of "presentation mode".  If the window manager
              permits, pho will take up the full screen with the image (if
              smaller) centered.

       +, = Magnify: show the image at twice the current size.

       /, - Unmagnify: show the image at half the current size.

       q      Quit

ENVIRONMENT
       Pho checks for the environment variable PHO_ARGS, which can contain
       flags to use as default arguments.  For example, PHO_ARGS=p will always
       run pho in presentation mode (unless you pass -P to turn off that
       mode).
