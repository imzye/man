RDMA_POST_SENDV(3)       Librdmacm Programmer's Manual      RDMA_POST_SENDV(3)



NAME
       rdma_post_sendv - post a work request to send a message.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       int rdma_post_sendv (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void *context, struct
       ibv_sge *slg, int nsge, int flags);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier where the message
                   buffer will be posted.

       context     User-defined context associated with the request.

       slg         A scatter-gather list of memory buffers posted as a single
                   request.

       nsge        The number of scatter-gather entries in the slg array.

       flags       Optional flags used to control the send operation.

DESCRIPTION
       Posts a work request to the send queue of the queue pair associated
       with the rdma_cm_id.  The contents of the posted buffers will be sent
       to the remote peer of a connection.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       The user is responsible for ensuring that the remote peer has queued a
       receive request before issuing the send operations.  For a list of
       supported flags, see ibv_post_send.  Unless the send request is using
       inline data, the message buffers must have been registered before being
       posted, and the buffers must remain registered until the send
       completes.

       Send operations may not be posted to an rdma_cm_id or the corresponding
       queue pair until it has been connected.

       The user-defined context associated with the send request will be
       returned to the user through the work completion wr_id, work request
       identifier, field.
