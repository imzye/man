NAME
       MUFFIN - Clutter based compositing GTK2 Window Manager

SYNOPSIS
       MUFFIN [--display=DISPLAY] [--replace] [--sm-client-id=ID]
       [--sm-disable] [--sm-save-file=FILENAME] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly MUFFIN.

       MUFFIN is a minimal X window manager aimed at nontechnical users and is
       designed to integrate well with the Cinnamon desktop.  MUFFIN lacks
       some features that may be expected by traditional UNIX or other
       technical users; these users may want to investigate other available
       window managers for use with Cinnamon or standalone.

OPTIONS
       --display=DISPLAY
              Connect to X display DISPLAY.

       --replace
              a window manager which is running is replaced by MUFFIN.  Users
              are encouraged to change the Cinnamon window manager by running
              the new WM with the --replace or -replace option, and
              subsequently saving the session.

       --sm-client-id=ID
              Specify a session management ID.

       --sm-disable
              Disable the session management.

       --sm-save-file=FILENAME
              Load a session from FILENAME.

       --version
              Print the version number.

       -?, --help
              Show summary of options.

CONFIGURATION
       MUFFIN configuration can be found under Preferences->Windows and
       Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts on the menu-panel. Advanced
       configuration can be achieved directly through gsettings.
