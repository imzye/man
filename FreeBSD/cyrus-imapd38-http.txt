NAME
       httptest - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Interactive HTTP test program.

       This is actually installed as a hard linked copy of imtest(1).

       It allows you to authenticate and send HTTP commands to the server.

SYNOPSIS

          imtest [ -t keyfile ] [ -p port ] [ -m mechanism ]
              [ -a userid ] [ -u userid ] [ -k num ] [ -l num ]
              [ -r realm ] [ -f file ] [ -n num ] [ -s ] [ -q ]
              [ -c ] [ -i ] [ -z ] [ -v ] [ -I file ] [ -x file ]
              [ -X file ] [ -w passwd ] [ -o option=value ] hostname

DESCRIPTION
       imtest is a utility that allows you to authenticate to an IMAP server
       and interactively issue commands to it. Once authenticated you may
       issue any IMAP command by simply typing it in. It is capable of
       multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and handles encryption layers
       transparently.  This utility is often used for testing the operation of
       an IMAP server.  Also those developing IMAP clients find it useful.

OPTIONS

       -t keyfile, --keyfile=keyfile
              Enable TLS.  keyfile contains the TLS public and private keys.
              Specify "" to negotiate a TLS encryption layer but not use TLS
              authentication.

       -p port, --port=port
              Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to imap as defined
              in /etc/services.

       -m mechanism, --mechanism=mechanism
              Force imtest to use mechanism for authentication. If not
              specified the strongest authentication mechanism supported by
              the server is chosen.  Specify login to use the LOGIN command
              instead of AUTHENTICATE.

       -a userid, --authname=userid
              Userid to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
              This is the userid whose password or credentials will be
              presented to the server for verification.

       -u userid, --username=userid
              Userid to use for authorization; defaults to the current user.
              This is the userid whose identity will be assumed after
              authentication.

              NOTE:
                 This is only used with SASL mechanisms that allow proxying
                 (e.g. PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5).

       -k num, --minssf=num
              Minimum protection layer required.

       -l num, --maxssf=num
              Maximum protection layer to use (0=none; 1=integrity; etc).  For
              example if you are using the KERBEROS_V4 authentication
              mechanism specifying 0 will force imtest to not use any layer
              and specifying 1 will force it to use the integrity layer.  By
              default the maximum supported protection layer will be used.

       -r realm, --realm=realm
              Specify the realm to use. Certain authentication mechanisms
              (e.g. DIGEST-MD5) may require one to specify the realm.

       -f file, --input-filename=file
              Pipe file into connection after authentication.

       -n num, --reauth-attempts=num
              Number of authentication attempts; default = 1.  The client will
              attempt to do SSL/TLS session reuse and/or fast reauth (e.g.
              DIGEST-MD5), if possible.

       -s, --require-tls
              Enable SSL over chosen protocol.

       -q, --require-compression
              Enable IMAP COMPRESSion (after authentication).

       -c, --do-challenge
              Enable challenge prompt callbacks.  This will cause the OTP
              mechanism to ask for the one-time password instead of the secret
              pass-phrase (library generates the correct response).

       -i, --no-initial-response
              Don't send an initial client response for SASL mechanisms, even
              if the protocol supports it.

       -I file, --pidfile=file
              Echo the PID of the running process into file (This can be
              useful with -X).

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose. Print out more information than usual.

       -z, --run-stress-test
              Timing test.

       -x file, --output-socket=file
              Open the named socket for the interactive portion.

       -X file
              Like -x, only close all file descriptors & daemonize the
              process.

       -w password, --password=password
              Password to use (if not supplied, we will prompt).

       -o option=value, --sasl-option=option=value
              Set the SASL option to value.
