Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::URI(3)   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::URI - Use URIs to pass the session id
       between requests

SYNOPSIS
           use Catalyst qw/Session Session::State::URI Session::Store::Foo/;

           # If you want the param style rewriting, set the parameter
           MyApp->config('Plugin::Session' => {
               param   => 'sessionid', # or whatever you like
           });

DESCRIPTION
       In order for Catalyst::Plugin::Session to work the session ID needs to
       be available on each request, and the session data needs to be stored
       on the server.

       This plugin puts the session id into URIs instead of something like a
       cookie.

       By default, it rewrites all outgoing URIs, both redirects and in
       outgoing HTML, but you can exercise control over exactly which URIs are
       rewritten.

METHODS
       session_should_rewrite
           This method is consulted by "finalize", and URIs will be rewritten
           only if it returns a true value.

           Rewriting is controlled by the "$c->config('Plugin::Session' => {
           rewrite_body => $val })" and "$c->config('Plugin::Session' => {
           rewrite_redirect => $val })" config settings, both of which default
           to true.

           To globally disable rewriting simply set these parameters to false.

           If "$c->config('Plugin::Session' => { no_rewrite_if_cookie => 1
           })", Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie is also in use, and
           the user agent sent a cookie for the sesion then this method will
           return false. This parameter also defaults to true.

       session_should_rewrite_body
           This method checks "$c->config('Plugin::Session' => {rewrite_body
           => $val})" first. If this is true, it then calls
           "session_should_rewrite_type".

       session_should_rewrite_type
           This method determines whether or not the body should be rewritten,
           based on its content type.

           For compatibility this method will not test the response's content
           type without configuration. If you want to do that you must provide
           a list of valid content types in
           "$c->config->{'Plugin::Session'}{rewrite_types}", or subclass this
           method.

       session_should_rewrite_redirect
           This method determines whether or not to rewrite the "Location"
           header of the response.

           This method checks "$c->config->{session}{rewrite_redirect}" first.
           If this is true, it then checks if the status code is a number in
           the 3xx range.

       session_should_rewrite_uri $uri_text
           This method is to determine whether a URI should be rewritten.

           It will return true for URIs under "$c->req->base", and it will
           also use MIME::Types to filter the links which point to png, pdf
           and etc with the file extension.

           You are encouraged to override this method if it's logic doesn't
           suit your setup.

       session_should_rewrite_uri_mime_type $uri_obj
           A sub test of session_should_rewrite_uri, that checks if the file
           name's guessed mime type is of a kind we should rewrite URIs to.

           Files which are typically static (images, etc) will thus not be
           rewritten in order to not get 404s or pass bogus parameters to the
           server.

           If $uri_obj's path causes MIME::Types to return true for the
           "isBinary" test then then the URI will not be rewritten.

       uri_with_sessionid $uri_text, [ $sid ]
           When using path style rewriting (the default), it will append
           "/-/$sessionid" to the uri path.

           http://myapp/link -> http://myapp/link/-/$sessionid

           When using param style rewriting, it will add a parameter key/value
           pair after the uri path.

           http://myapp/link -> http://myapp/link?$param=$sessionid

           If $sid is not provided it will default to "$c->sessionid".

       session_rewrite_if_needed
           Rewrite the response if necessary.

       rewrite_body_with_session_id $sid
           Calls either "rewrite_html_with_session_id" or
           "rewrite_text_with_session_id" depending on the content type.

       rewrite_html_with_session_id $sid
           Rewrites the body using HTML::TokePaser::Simple.

           This method of rewriting also matches relative URIs, and is thus
           more robust.

       rewrite_text_with_session_id $sid
           Rewrites the body using URI::Find.

           This method is used when the content does not appear to be HTML.

       rewrite_redirect_with_session_id $sid
           Rewrites the "Location" header.

       uri_with_param_sessionid
       uri_with_path_sessionid

EXTENDED METHODS
       prepare_path
           Will restore the session if the request URI is formatted
           accordingly, and rewrite the URI to remove the additional part.

       finalize
           Rewrite a redirect or the body HTML as appropriate.

       delete_session_id
       get_session_id
       set_session_id
       setup_session
       uri_for

CAVEATS
   Session Hijacking
       URI sessions are very prone to session hijacking problems.

       Make sure your users know not to copy and paste URIs to prevent these
       problems, and always provide a way to safely link to public resources.

       Also make sure to never link to external sites without going through a
       gateway page that does not have session data in it's URI, so that the
       external site doesn't get any session IDs in the http referrer header.

       Due to these issues this plugin should be used as a last resort, as
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie is more appropriate 99% of the
       time.

       Take a look at the IP address limiting features in
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session to see make some of these problems less
       dangerous.

       Goodbye page recipe

       To exclude some sections of your application, like a goodbye page (see
       "CAVEATS") you should make extend the "session_should_rewrite_uri"
       method to return true if the URI does not point to the goodbye page,
       extend "prepare_path" to not rewrite URIs that match "/-/" (so that
       external URIs with that in their path as a parameter to the goodbye
       page will not be destroyed) and finally extend "uri_with_sessionid" to
       rewrite URIs with the following logic:

       •   URIs that match "/^$base/" are appended with session data (
           "$c->maybe::next::method").

       •   External URIs (everything else) should be prepended by the goodbye
           page. (e.g.
           "http://myapp/link/http://the_url_of_whatever/foo.html").

       But note that this behavior will be problematic when you are e.g.
       submitting POSTs to forms on external sites.
