NAME
     crate – containerizer for FreeBSD

SYNOPSIS
     crate crate-specification.yml
     crate crate-file.crate

DESCRIPTION
     The crate utility is a containerizer program that is able to create
     containers from container definition files, and then run containers as
     processes that have no dependencies besides system functions in the
     kernel.

   Mechanism of action
     crate uses FreeBSD jails to run containerized applications. It also uses
     ipfw(8)-based firewall rules to route network traffic in and out of
     containers.

   Invocation
     There are two basic operations that crate supports: create and run.  When
     crate is invoked with a crate definition file (having the .yml
     extension), this triggers the create mode. When crate is invoked with a
     crate file (having the .create extension), this triggers the run mode.
