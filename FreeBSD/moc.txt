NAME
       MOC - Console audio player

SYNOPSIS
       mocp [OPTIONS] [FILE|DIR ...]

DESCRIPTION
       MOC is a console audio player with simple ncurses interface.  It
       supports OGG, WAV, MP3 and other formats.  Just run mocp, go to some
       directory using the menu and press enter to start playing the file.
       The program will automatically play the rest of the files in the
       directory.

       With no options and no file arguments the program begins in current
       directory, or in MusicDir if the StartInMusicDir option is set in the
       configuration file.  If you give a directory on the command line, MOC
       will try to go there.  If a playlist is given, then it is loaded.  With
       multiple files, playlists or directories, everything will be added to
       the playlist recursively (including the contents of any playlist
       given).  (Note that relative paths in playlists are resolved with
       respect to the directory of the playlist, or of the symlink being used
       to reference it.)

OPTIONS
       If an option can also be set in the configuration file the command line
       overrides it (but see the -O option for the list-valued configuration
       options exception).

       -D, --debug
              Run MOC in debug mode.  The client and server log a lot of
              information to debug files.  Don't use this; the server log is
              large.  This is only available if MOC was compiled without
              --disable-debug.

       -S, --server
              Run only the server and exit.

       -F, --foreground
              Implies -S.  Run the server in foreground and log everything to
              stdout.

       -R NAME[:...], --sound-driver NAME[:...]
              Use the specified sound driver(s).  They can be OSS, ALSA, JACK,
              SNDIO or null (for debugging).  Some of the drivers may not have
              been compiled in.  This option is called SoundDriver in the
              configuration file.

       -m, --music-dir
              Start in MusicDir (set in the configuration file).  This can be
              also set in the configuration file as StartInMusicDir.

       -q, --enqueue
              Add files given after command line options to the queue.  Don't
              start the interface.

       -a, --append
              Append files, directories (recursively) and playlists given
              after command line options to the playlist.  Don't start the
              interface.

       -c, --clear
              Clear the playlist.

       -p, --play
              Start playing from the first item on the playlist.

       -f, --next
              Request playing the next song from the server's playlist.

       -r, --previous
              Request playing the previous song from the server's playlist.

       -s, --stop
              Request the server to stop playing.

       -x, --exit
              Bring down the server.

       -P, --pause
              Request the server to pause playing.

       -U, --unpause
              Request the server to resume playing when paused.

       -G, --toggle-pause
              Toggle between play and pause.

       -k [+|-]N, --seek [+|-]N
              Seek forward (positive) or backward (negative) by N seconds in
              the file currently being played.

       -T THEME, --theme THEME
              Use a theme file.  If the path is not absolute, the file will be
              searched for in /usr/share/moc/themes/ (depends on installation
              prefix), ~/.moc/themes/ and the current directory.

       -C FILE, --config FILE
              Use the specified configuration file instead of the default.  As
              this file can specify commands which invoke other applications
              MOC will refuse to start if it is not owned by either root or
              the current user, or if it is writable by anyone other than its
              owner.

       -O NAME[+]=VALUE, --set-option NAME[+]=VALUE
              Override configuration option NAME with VALUE.  This option can
              be repeated as many times as needed and the option name is not
              case sensitive.  Most option values are set before the
              configuration file is processed (which allows the new values to
              be picked up by substitutions); however, list-valued options are
              overridden afterwards (which gives the choice of whether the
              configured values are replaced or added to).

              See the example configuration file (config.example) for a
              description of the options available.

              Examples: -O AutoNext=no
                        -O messagelingertime=1 -O XTerms+=xxt:xwt

              Note that MOC does not perform variable substitution as it does
              for values read from the configuration file.

       -M DIR, --moc-dir DIR
              Use the specified MOC directory instead of the default.  This
              also causes the configuration file from that directory to be
              used.  This can also be specified in the configuration file
              using the MOCDir option.

       -y, --sync
              This copy of the interface will synchronize its playlist with
              other clients.  This option is called SyncPlaylist in the
              configuration file.

       -n, --nosync
              This copy of the interface will not synchronize its playlist
              with other clients (see above).

       -A, --ascii
              Use ASCII characters to draw lines.  (This helps on some
              terminals.)

       -i, --info
              Print the information about the file currently being played.

       -Q FORMAT_STRING, --format FORMAT_STRING
              Print information about the file currently being played using a
              format string.  Replace string sequences with the actual
              information:
                       %state     State
                       %file      File
                       %title     Title
                       %artist    Artist
                       %song      SongTitle
                       %album     Album
                       %tt        TotalTime
                       %tl        TimeLeft
                       %ts        TotalSec
                       %ct        CurrentTime
                       %cs        CurrentSec
                       %b         Bitrate
                       %r         Rate

              It is also possible to use variables from the FormatString
              configuration file option.

       -e, --recursively
              Alias of -a for backward compatibility.

       -h, --help
              Print a list of options with short descriptions and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the program version and exit.

       -v [+|-]N, --volume [+|-]N
              Adjust the mixer volume.  You can set (-v 50) or adjust (-v +10,
              -v -10).

       -t OPTION[,...], --toggle OPTION[,...]
       -o OPTION[,...], --on OPTION[,...]
       -u OPTION[,...], --off OPTION[,...]
              Followed by a list of identifiers, these will control MOC's
              playlist options.  Valid identifiers are shuffle, repeat and
              autonext.  They can be shortened to 's', 'r' and 'n'
              respectively.

              Example: -t shuffle,r,n
                       would toggle shuffle, repeat and autonext all at once.

       -j N{s|%}, --jump N{s|%}
              Jump to some position in the current file.  N is the number of
              seconds (when followed by an 's') or the percent of total file
              time (when followed by a '%').

              Examples: -j 10s, -j 50%

FILES
       ~/.moc MOC directory for the configuration file, socket, the pid file
              and other data.

       ~/.moc/config
              Configuration file for MOC.  The format is very simple; to see
              how to use it look at the example configuration file
              (config.example) distributed with the program.  The example file
              fully describes all the configuration options, and so is a
              useful reference when using the -O option.  As this file can
              specify commands which invoke other applications MOC will refuse
              to start if it is not owned by either root or the current user,
              or if it is writable by anyone other than its owner.

       ~/.moc/themes
       /usr/share/moc/themes
              Default directories for the theme files.

       /usr/share/moc/decoder_plugins
              Default directories for the audio decoder plugins.

       mocp_client_log
       mocp_server_log
              Client and server log files.  These files are created in the
              directory in which the client and server are started.  (Also see
              the -D option.)

BUGS
       Command line options that affect the server behaviour (like
       --sound-driver) are ignored if the server is already running at the
       time of executing mocp.  The user is not warned about this.
