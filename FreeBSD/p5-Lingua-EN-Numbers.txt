Lingua::EN::Numbers(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Lingua::EN::Numbers - turn "407" into "four hundred and seven", etc.

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::EN::Numbers qw(num2en num2en_ordinal);

         my $x = 234;
         my $y = 54;
         print "You have ", num2en($x), " things to do today!\n";
         print "You will stop caring after the ", num2en_ordinal($y), ".\n";

       prints:

         You have two hundred and thirty-four things to do today!
         You will stop caring after the fifty-fourth.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a function "num2en", which converts a number (such
       as 123) into English text ("one hundred and twenty-three").  It also
       provides a function "num2en_ordinal", which converts a number into the
       ordinal form in words, so 54 becomes "fifty-fourth".

       If you pass either function something that doesn't look like a number,
       they will return "undef".

       This module can handle integers like "12" or "-3" and real numbers like
       "53.19".

       This module also understands exponential notation -- it turns "4E9"
       into "four times ten to the ninth").  And it even turns "INF", "-INF",
       "NaN" into "infinity", "negative infinity", and "not a number",
       respectively.

       Any commas in the input numbers are ignored.

LEGACY INTERFACE
       The first version of this module, 0.01 released in May 1995, had an OO
       interface. This was finally dropped in the 1.08 release.

SEE ALSO
       <http://neilb.org/reviews/spell-numbers.html> - a review of CPAN
       modules for converting numbers into English words.

       The following modules will convert a number into words:

       •   Lingua::EN::Inflect provides a lot more besides, including
           conversion of singular to plural, selecting whether to use 'an' or
           'a' before a word, and plenty more

       •   Lingua::EN::Nums2Words provides similar functionality, but can't
           handle exponential notation, and 3.14 produces "three and fourteen
           hundredths" instead of "three point one four".

       •   Math::BigInt::Named doesn't work.

       •   Number::Spell doesn't handle negative numbers, exponential
           notation, or non-integer real numbers. The generated text doesn't
           contain any commas or the word 'and', so the results for long
           numbers don't scan.

       There are other modules which provide related, but not identical,
       functionality:

       •   Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate provides a function that will convert
           a cardinal number (such as "3") to an ordinal ("3rd").

       •   Lingua::EN::Numbers::Years provides a function that will convert a
           year in numerals (eg "1984") into words ("nineteen eighty-four").

       •   Lingua::EN::Fractions provides a function that will convert a
           numeric fraction (eg "3/4") into words ("three quarters").
