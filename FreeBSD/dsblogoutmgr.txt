DSBLogoutmgr(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        DSBLogoutmgr(1)

NAME
     dsblogoutmgr – Graphical logout manager

SYNOPSIS
     dsblogoutmgr [-L <lock command>] [-S <suspend command>]
                  [-l <logout command>] [-r <reboot command>]
                  [-s <shutdown command>]

DESCRIPTION
     dsblogoutmgr is a Qt utility that allows you to leave your current window
     manager-session, reboot, suspend or shutdown your system. Furthermore, it
     supports time-controlled shutdown.

     The following options are available:

     -L      Defines the screen lock command. Default "metalock"

     -S      Defines the suspend command. Default "acpiconf -s 3"

     -l      Defines the logout command. Default "fluxbox exit"

     -r      Defines the reboot command. Default "shutdown -r now"

     -s      Defines the shutdown command. Default "shutdown -p now"

SETUP
     Commands for the actions can also be defined in
     ~/.config/DSB/dsblogoutmgr/config using variable=value pairs by setting
     the variables lock, logout, shutdown, reboot, and suspend.  Commands
     containing white spaces must be enclosed in double quotes. If an action
     is defined on the command line, it is used instead of the one defined in
     ~/.config/DSB/dsblogoutmgr/config.

   Permissions
     In order to be able to execute shutdown as regular user, you can either
     use sudo(8) (see below), or you can add your username to the operator
     group:

           # pw groupmod operator -m yourusername

     If you want to be able to suspend your system as regular user, you can
     use sudo(8).  Add

           %wheel  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/acpiconf *

     to /usr/local/etc/sudoers, and define the suspend action accordingly by
     using the -S flag on the command line, or set

           suspend = "sudo acpiconf -s 3"

     in ~/.config/DSB/dsblogoutmgr/config

     Note: On FreeBSD >= 12, members of the operator group are allowed to
     execute acpiconf.  Using sudo(8) is not necessary.

   Closing window manager-sessions
     Openbox
             Users of OpenBox can set the logout action to "openbox --exit"
             using the -l flag.

     Fluxbox
             Users of Fluxbox can set the logout action to "fluxbox-remote
             exit" using the -l flag. This requires

                   session.screen0.allowRemoteActions: true

             to be set in ~/.fluxbox/init.
