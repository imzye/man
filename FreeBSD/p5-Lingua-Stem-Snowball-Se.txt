NAME
       Lingua::Stem::Snowball::Se - Porters stemming algorithm for Swedish

VERSION
       This document describes version 1.1.

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::Stem::Snowball::Se
         my $stemmer = new Lingua::Stem::Snowball::Se (use_cache => 1);

         foreach my $word (@words) {
               my $stemmed = $stemmer->stem($word);
               print $stemmed, "\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       The stem function takes a scalar as a parameter and stems the word
       according to Martin Porters Swedish stemming algorithm, which can be
       found at the Snowball website: <http://snowball.tartarus.org/>.

       It also supports caching if you pass the use_cache option when
       constructing a new L:S:S:S object.
