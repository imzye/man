YATE(8)                        Telephony Engine                        YATE(8)

NAME
       yate - launch the YATE telephony engine

SYNOPSIS
       yate [options] [commands]

DESCRIPTION
       yate is a telephony engine that supports client, PBX and IVR functions
       trough plugins.

OPTIONS
   General
       -h, --help
              Display a short help message and exit

       -V, --version
              Display program version and exit

       -v     Verbose logging (you can use more than once)

       -q     Quieter logging (you can use more than once)

       -d     Daemonify, suppress output unless logged

       -s[=msec]
              Supervised, restart if crashes or locks up, optionally sleeps
              initially

       -r     Enable rotation of log file (needs -s and -l)

       -l filename
              Log to file - should be used whenever running in daemon mode

       -p filename
              Write PID of the supervisor or primary thread to file

       -n configname
              Use specified configuration name, overrides default "yate"

       -c pathname
              Path to conf files directory, overrides compiled-in value

       -u pathname
              Path to user data files directory, overrides compiled-in value

       -m pathname
              Path to modules directory, overrides compiled-in value

       -e pathname
              Path to shared directory, overrides compiled-in value

       -x dirpath
              Absolute or relative path to extra modules directory (can be
              repeated)

       -w directory
              Change working directory

       -N nodename
              Set the name of the node in a cluster

   Debugging options (may not be compiled in)
       -C     Enable core dumps if supported by the operating system

       -F     Increase the maximum file handle to compiled value

       -S     Set size of supervised sanity points pool

       -t     Truncate the log file instead of appending to it

       -D[options]
              Special debugging options

       -Da    Abort (coredumps if allowed) if bugs are encountered

       -Dm    Attempt to debug mutex deadlocks by setting a maximum 10s limit,
              if repeated halves the limit

       -Dd    Enable some locking debugging and safety features, degrades
              performance

       -Dl    Attempt to load modules without having their symbols globally
              visible

       -Dc    Call dlclose() until it gets an error

       -Du    Do not unload modules, just try to call thier finalization code

       -Di    Reinitialize after first initialization

       -Dx    Exit immediately after initialization

       -Dw    Delay for one second the creation of the first worker thread

       -Do    Colorize the output using ANSI control character sequences

       -Ds    Abort if bugs are encountered even during shutdown

       -DO    Attempt to debug all object allocations by counting objects per
              plugin, degrades performance

       -Dn    Do not add timestamps to debugging messages

       -Dt    Add start time relative timestamps to debugging messages

       -De    Add EPOCH (1-1-1970 GMT) based timestamps to debugging messages

       -Df    Add GMT timestamps to debugging messages in format
              YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuuuuu

       -DF    Add GMT timestamps to debugging messages in format YYYY-MM-
              DD_hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu

       -Dz    Add local timezone timestamps to debugging messages in format
              YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuuuuu

       -DZ    Add local timezone timestamps to debugging messages in format
              YYYY-MM-DD_hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu

COMMANDS
       Each command is sent to the YATE modules immediately after
       initialization.  Modules define command syntax so that is not described
       here. Please look at the documentation for each module.

SIGNALS
       - SIGTERM and SIGINT (Ctrl-C) will cleanly stop the engine

       - SIGQUIT (Ctrl-\) will reinitialize the modules

       - SIGHUP will reinitialize the modules if started in daemon mode (-d)

       - SIGUSR1 will initiate a gracefull restart (when no plugin is busy)

       - SIGUSR2 will initiate an immediate restart

BUGS
       Under various *BSD implementations the dlclose() function is broken and
       may generate a segfault on exit.

       Some libpthread implementations are broken and may fail to start the
       threads or fail to cleanup when the thread terminates.
