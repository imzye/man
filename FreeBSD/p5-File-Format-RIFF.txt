File::Format::RIFF(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       File::Format::RIFF - Resource Interchange File Format/RIFF files

SYNOPSIS
          use File::Format::RIFF;

          open( IN, 'file' ) or die "Could not open file: $!";
          my ( $riff1 ) = File::Format::RIFF->read( \*IN );
          close( IN );
          $riff1->dump;

          my ( $riff2 ) = new File::Format::RIFF( 'TYPE' );
          foreach my $chunk ( $riff1->data )
          {
             next if ( $chunk->id eq 'LIST' );
             $riff2->addChunk( $chunk->id, $chunk->data );
          }
          open( OUT, ">otherfile" ) or die "Could not open file: $!";
          $riff2->write( \*OUT );
          close( OUT );

DESCRIPTION
       "File::Format::RIFF" provides an implementation of the Resource
       Interchange File Format.  You can read, manipulate, and write RIFF
       files.

CONSTRUCTORS
       $riff = new File::Format::RIFF( $type, $data );
           Creates a new File::Format::RIFF object.  $type is a four character
           code that identifies the type of this particular RIFF file.
           Certain types are defined to have a format, specifying which chunks
           must appear (e.g., WAVE files).  If $type is not specified, it
           defaults to '    ' (four spaces).  $data must be an array reference
           containing some number of RIFF lists and/or RIFF chunks.  If $data
           is "undef" or not specified, then the new RIFF object is
           initialized empty.

       $riff = File::Format::RIFF->read( $fh, $filesize );
           Reads and parses an existing RIFF file from the given filehandle
           $fh.  An exception will be thrown if the file is not a valid RIFF
           file.  $filesize controls one aspect of the file format checking --
           if $filesize is not specified, then "stat" will be called on $fh to
           determine how much data to expect.  You may explicitly specify how
           much data to expect by passing in that value as $filesize.  In
           either case, the amount of data read will be checked to make sure
           it matches the amount expected.  Otherwise, it will throw an
           exception.  If you do not wish it to make this check, pass in
           "undef" for $filesize.

           Please note, if you wish to read an "in memory" filehandle, such as
           by doing this: "open( $fh, '<', \$variable )", you may do so, but
           you must pass in length( $variable ) for $filesize, because
           filehandles opened this way to do not support the "stat" call.

           You may also use sockets for $fh.  But if you do, you must either
           specify the amount of data expected by passing in a value for
           $filesize, or if you do not know ahead of time how much data to
           expect, you must pass in "undef" for $filesize.  (An example of
           using sockets to read and write RIFF files is available with your
           File::Format::RIFF distribution, at eq/socketpair.pl.)

METHODS
       $riff->read( $fh, $filesize );
           The "read" constructor may also be used as a method.  If used in
           this manner, then all existing data contained in $riff will be
           discarded, and replaced by the contents read from $fh.

       $riff->write( $fh );
           Outputs a properly-formatted RIFF file to the given filehandle $fh.

SEE ALSO
       File::Format::RIFF::Container
           "File::Format::RIFF" inherits from "File::Format::RIFF::Container",
           so all methods available for Containers can be used on RIFF
           objects.  A Container essentially contains an array of RIFF lists
           and/or RIFF chunks.  See the File::Format::RIFF::Container page for
           more information.
