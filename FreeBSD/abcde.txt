abcde(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               abcde(1)

NAME
       abcde - Grab an entire CD and compress it to Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC,
       Ogg/Speex, AAC, WavPack, Monkey's Audio (ape), MPP/MP+(Musepack), True
       Audio (tta), MP2 format and/or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format).

SYNOPSIS
       abcde [options] [tracks]

DESCRIPTION
       Ordinarily, the process of grabbing the data off a CD and encoding it,
       then tagging or commenting it, is very involved.  abcde is designed to
       automate this. It will take an entire CD and convert it into a
       compressed audio format - Ogg/Vorbis, MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3), Free
       Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), Ogg/Speex, MPP/MP+(Musepack), M4A (AAC) wv
       (WavPack), Monkey's Audio (ape), Opus, True Audio (tta), MPEG Audio
       Layer II (MP2) or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) format(s).  With
       one command, it will:

       *      Do a CDDB or Musicbrainz query over the Internet to look up your
              CD or use a locally stored CDDB entry, or read CD-TEXT from your
              CD if it's available

       *      Download the album art appropriate for your music tracks with
              many user configurable options for download and post download
              alterations including automated embedding of the album art for
              some containers

       *      Grab an audio track (or all the audio CD tracks) from your CD

       *      Normalize the volume of the individual file (or the album as a
              single unit)

       *      Compress to Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, Ogg/Speex, MPP/MP+(Musepack),
              M4A, wv (WavPack), Monkey's Audio (ape), Opus format(s), True
              Audio (tta), MP2 or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) all in
              one CD read

       *      Comment or ID3/ID3v2 tag

       *      Give an intelligible filename

       *      Calculate replaygain values for the individual file (or the
              album as a single unit)

       *      Delete the intermediate WAV file (or save it for later use)

       *      Repeat until finished

       Alternatively, abcde can also grab a CD and turn it into a single FLAC
       file with an embedded cuesheet which can be user later on as a source
       for other formats, and will be treated as if it was the original CD. In
       a way, abcde can take a compressed backup of your CD collection.

OPTIONS
       -1     Encode the whole CD in a single file. The resulting file uses
              the CD title for tagging. If the resulting format is a flac file
              with an embedded cuesheet, the file can be used as a source for
              creating other formats. Use "-1 -o flac -a default,cue" for
              obtaining such a file.

       -a [actions]
              Comma-delimited list of actions to perform. Can be one or more
              of: cddb, cue, read, getalbumart, embedalbumart, normalize,
              encode, tag, move, replaygain, playlist, clean. Normalize and
              encode imply read. Tag implies cddb, read, encode. Move implies
              cddb, read, encode, tag. Replaygain implies cddb, read, encode,
              tag and move. Playlist implies cddb. embedalbumart implies
              getalbumart.  The default is to do all actions except cue,
              normalize, replaygain, getalbumart, embedalbumart and playlist.

       -b     Enable batch mode normalization. See the BATCHNORM configuration
              variable.

       -B     Enable automatic embedding of album art with certain containers.
              As of abcde 2.8.2 supported containers are mp3 (using eyeD3),
              flac (using metaflac), m4a (using AtomicParsley), WavPack aka wv
              (using wvtag) and experimental support for ogg (using
              vorbiscomment). This command line option also calls the
              getalbumart function. Further details of album art embedding
              using the embedalbumart function can be found in the abcde FAQ
              document packaged with abcde.

       -c [filename]
              Specifies an additional configuration file to parse.
              Configuration options in this file override those in
              /usr/local/etc/abcde.conf or $HOME/.abcde.conf.

       -C [discid]
              Allows you to resume a session for discid when you no longer
              have the CD available (abcde will automatically resume if you
              still have the CD in the drive). You must have already finished
              at least the "read" action during the previous session.

       -d [devicename | filename]
              CD-ROM block device that contains audio tracks to be read.
              Alternatively, a single-track flac file with embedded cuesheet.

       -D     Capture debugging information (you'll want to redirect this -
              try 'abcde -D 2>logfile')

       -e     Erase information about encoded tracks from the internal status
              file, to enable other encodings if the wav files have been kept.

       -f     Force the removal of the temporary ABCDETEMPDIR directory, even
              when we have not finished. For example, one can read and encode
              several formats, including ´.ogg´, and later on execute a ´move´
              action with only one of the given formats. On a normal situation
              it would erase the rest of those encoded formats. In this case,
              abcde will refuse to execute such command, except if -f is used.

       -g     Enable lame's --nogap option.  See the NOGAP variable. WARNING:
              lame's --nogap disables the Xing mp3 tag.  This tag is required
              for mp3 players to correctly display track lengths when playing
              variable-bit-rate mp3 files.

       -G     Download album art using the getalbumart function. This is best
              done with CDDBMETHOD including musicbrainz and requires the
              installation of glyrc.  ImageMagick is an optional but highly
              recommended package. Further details of getalbumart can be found
              in the abcde FAQ document packaged with abcde.

       -h     Get help information.

       -j [number]
              Start [number] encoder processes at once. Useful for SMP
              systems. Overrides the MAXPROCS configuration variable. Set it
              to "0" when using distmp3 to avoid local encoding processes.

       -k     Keep the wav files after encoding.

       -l     Use the low-diskspace algorithm. See the LOWDISK configuration
              variable.

       -L     Use a local CDDB repository. See CDDBLOCALDIR variable.

       -m     Create DOS-style playlists, modifying the resulting one by
              adding CRLF line endings. Some hardware players insist on having
              those to work.

       -n     Do not query CDDB database. Create and use a template. Edit the
              template to provide song names, artist(s), ...

       -N     Non interactive mode. Do not ask anything from the user. Just go
              ahead.

       -o [filetype][:filetypeoptions]
              Select output type. Can be "vorbis" (or "ogg"), "mp3", "flac",
              "spx", "mpc", "m4a", "wav", "wv", "ape", "opus", "mka" or
              "aiff".  Specify a comma-delimited list of output types to
              obtain all specified types.  See the OUTPUTTYPE configuration
              variable. One can pass options to the encoder for a specific
              filetype on the command line separating them with a colon. The
              options must be escaped with double-quotes.

       -p     Pads track numbers with 0´s.

       -P     Use Unix PIPES to read and encode in one step (USEPIPES). This
              disables multiple encodings, since the WAV audio file is never
              stored in the disc. For more detail on this option see the FAQ
              document in the source tarball.

       -r [hosts...]
              Remote encode on this comma-delimited list of machines using
              distmp3. See the REMOTEHOSTS configuration variable.

       -s [fields...]
              List, separated by commas, the fields to be shown in the CDDB
              parsed entries.  Right now it only uses "year" and "genre".

       -S [speed]
              Set the speed of the CD drive. Needs CDSPEED and CDSPEEDOPTS set
              properly and both the program and device must support the
              capability.

       -t [number]
              Start the numbering of the tracks at a given number. It only
              affects the filenames and the playlist. Internal (tag) numbering
              remains the same.

       -T [number]
              Same as -t but changes also the internal (tag) numbering. Keep
              in mind that the default TRACK tag for MP3 is $T/$TRACKS so it
              is changed to simply $T.

       -U     Set CDDBPROTO to version 5, so that we retrieve ISO-8859-15
              encoded CDDB information, and we tag and add comments with
              Latin1 encoding.

       -v     Show the version and exit

       -V     Be more verbose. On slow networks the CDDB requests might give
              the sensation nothing is happening. Add this more than once to
              make things even more verbose.

       -x     Eject the CD when all tracks have been read. See the EJECTCD
              configuration variable.

       -X [cue2discid]
              Use an alternative "cue2discid" implementation. The name of the
              binary must be exactly that. abcde comes with an implementation
              in python under the examples directory. The special keyword
              "builtin" forces the usage of the internal (default)
              implementation in shell script.

       -w [comment]
              Add a comment to the tracks ripped from the CD. If you wish to
              use parentheses, these will need to be escaped. i.e. you have to
              write "\(" instead of "(".

       -W [number]
              Concatenate CD´s. It uses the number provided to define a
              comment "CD #" and to modify the numbering of the tracks,
              starting with "#01". For Ogg/Vorbis and FLAC files, it also
              defines a DISCNUMBER tag.

       -z     DEBUG mode: it will rip, using cdparanoia, the very first second
              of each track and proceed with the actions requested very
              quickly, also providing some "hidden" information about what
              happens on the background. CAUTION: IT WILL ERASE ANY EXISTING
              RIPS WITHOUT WARNING!

       [tracks]
              A list of tracks you want abcde to process. If this isn't
              specified, abcde will process the entire CD. Accepts ranges of
              track numbers - "abcde 1-5 7 9" will process tracks 1, 2, 3, 4,
              5, 7, and 9.

OUTPUT
       Each track is, by default, placed in a separate file named after the
       track in a subdirectory named after the artist under the current
       directory. This can be modified using the OUTPUTFORMAT and
       VAOUTPUTFORMAT variables in your abcde.conf. Each file is given an
       extension identifying  its compression format, 'vorbis' for '.ogg',
       '.mp3', '.flac', '.spx', '.mpc', '.wav', '.wv', '.ape', '.opus', '.mka'
       or 'aiff'.

CONFIGURATION
       abcde sources two configuration files on startup -
       /usr/local/etc/abcde.conf and $HOME/.abcde.conf, in that order.

       The configuration options stated in those files can be overridden by
       providing the appropriate flags at runtime.

       The configuration variables have to be set as follows:

       VARIABLE=value
              Except when "value" needs to be quoted or otherwise interpreted.
              If other variables within "value" are to be expanded upon
              reading the configuration file, then double quotes should be
              used. If they are only supposed to be expanded upon use (for
              example OUTPUTFORMAT) then single quotes must be used.

       All shell escaping/quoting rules apply.

       Here is a list of options abcde recognizes:

       CDDBMETHOD
              Specifies the methods we want to use to retrieve the track
              information. Three values are recognized: "cddb", "musicbrainz"
              and "cdtext". List all the methods desired in a comma delimited
              list and abcde will attempt them all, returning a list of all
              search results. The "cddb" value needs the CDDBURL and HELLOINFO
              variables described below. The "musicbrainz" value uses the Perl
              helper script abcde-musicbrainz-tool to establish a conversation
              with the Musicbrainz server for information retrieval. "cdtext"
              needs "icedax" or "cdda2wav" to be installed.

       CDDBURL
              Specifies a server to use for CDDB lookups.

       CDDBPROTO
              Specifies the protocol version used for the CDDB retrieval of
              results. Version 6 retrieves CDDB entries in UTF-8 format.

       HELLOINFO
              Specifies the Hello information to send to the CDDB server. The
              CDDB protocol requires you to send a valid username and hostname
              each time you connect. The format of this is username@hostname.

       CDDBLOCALDIR
              Specifies a directory where we store a local CDDB repository.
              The entries must be standard CDDB entries, with the filename
              being the DISCID value. Other CD playing and ripping programs
              (like Grip) store the entries under ~/.cddb and we can make use
              of those entries.

       CDDBLOCALRECURSIVE
              Specifies if the CDDBLOCALDIR has to be searched recursively
              trying to find a match for the CDDB entry. If a match is found
              and selected, and CDDBCOPYLOCAL is selected, it will be copied
              to the root of the CDDBLOCALDIR if CDDBLOCALPOLICY is "modified"
              or "new". The default "y" is needed for the local CDDB search to
              work.

       CDDBLOCALPOLICY
              Defines when a CDDB entry should be stored in the defined
              CDDBLOCALDIR. The possible policies are: "net" for a CDDB entry
              which has been received from the net (overwriting any possible
              local CDDB entry); "new" for a CDDB entry which was received
              from the net, but will request confirmation to overwrite a local
              CDDB entry found in the root of the CDDBLOCALDIR directory;
              "modified" for a CDDB entry found in the local repository but
              which has been modified by the user; and "always" which forces
              the CDDB entry to be stored back in the root of the CDDBLOCALDIR
              no matter where it was found, and no matter it was not edited.
              This last option will always overwrite the one found in the root
              of the local repository (if any). STILL NOT WORKING!!

       CDDBCOPYLOCAL
              Store local copies of the CDDB entries under the $CDDBLOCALDIR
              directory.

       CDDBUSELOCAL
              Actually use the stored copies of the CDDB entries. Can be
              overridden using the "-L" flag (if is CDDBUSELOCAL in "n"). If
              an entry is found, we always give the choice of retrieving a
              CDDB entry from the internet.

       SHOWCDDBFIELDS
              Coma-separated list of fields we want to parse during the CDDB
              parsing.  Defaults to "year,genre".

       OGGENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the Ogg/Vorbis
              encoder. Valid options are ´oggenc´ (default for Ogg/Vorbis) and
              ´vorbize´.  This affects the default location of the binary, the
              variable to pick encoder command-line options from, and where
              the options are given.

       MP3ENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the MP3 encoder. Valid
              options are ´lame´ (default for MP3), ´gogo´, ´bladeenc´,
              ´l3enc´ and ´mp3enc´.  Affects the same way as explained above
              for Ogg/Vorbis.

       FLACENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the FLAC encoder. At
              this point only ´flac´ is available for FLAC encoding.

       MP2ENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the MPEG-1 Audio Layer
              II (MP2) encoder.  At this point both ´twolame´ and ´ffmpeg´ are
              available for MP2 encoding.

       SPEEXENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for Speex encoder. At this
              point only ´speexenc´ is available for Ogg/Speex encoding.

       MPCENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for MPP/MP+ (Musepack)
              encoder. At this point we only have ´mpcenc´ available, from
              musepack.net.

       AACENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for M4A (AAC) encoder. We
              support ´fdkaac´ as ´default´ as well as FFmpeg or avconv,
              neroAacEnc, qaac and fhgaacenc. If qaac, refalac or FFmpeg /
              avconv are used it is also possible to generate Apple Lossless
              Audio Codec (alac) files. Note that qaac, refalac and fhgaacenc
              are Windows applications which require Wine to be installed.

       TTAENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for True Audio (tts)
              encoding. We support ´tta´ as default but the older ´ttaenc´ can
              be used as well.

       WVENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for WavPack. We support
              ´wavpack´ as ´default´ but ´ffmpeg' is the other option (Note
              that this is for FFmpeg only as avconv does not have a native
              WavPack encoder).

       APENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for Monkey's Audio (ape).
              We support ´mac´, Monkey's Audio Console, as ´default´.

       OPUSENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the Opus encoder. At
              this point only ´opusenc´ is available for Opus encoding.

       MKAENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the Matroska or mka
              container. At this point only ´ffmpeg´ is available to utilise
              the mka container. Safe audio codecs for mka include Vorbis,
              MP2, MP3, LC-AAC, HE-AAC, WMAv1, WMAv2, AC3, eAC3 and Opus.  See
              the FAQ document for more information.

       AIFFENCODERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for Audio Interchange File
              Format (AIFF).  At this point only ´ffmpeg´ is available to
              utilise the AIFF container.

       NORMALIZERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of normalizer to use.  Valid options are
              ´default´ and ´normalize' (and both run ´normalize-audio´),
              since we only support it, ATM.

       CDROMREADERSYNTAX
              Specifies the style of cdrom reader to use. Valid options are
              ´cdparanoia´, ´libcdio' ´debug´ and ´flac´. It is used for
              querying the CDROM and obtain a list of valid tracks and DATA
              tracks. The special ´flac´ case is u sed to "rip" CD tracks from
              a single-track flac file.

       CUEREADERSYNTAX
              Specifies the syntax of the program we use to read the CD CUE
              sheet. Right now we only support ´mkcue´, but in the future
              other readers might be used.

       KEEPWAVS
              It defaults to no, so if you want to keep those wavs ripped from
              your CD, set it to "y". You can use the "-k" switch in the
              command line. The default behaviour with KEEPWAVS set is to keep
              the temporary directory and the wav files even you have
              requested the "clean" action.

       PADTRACKS
              If set to "y", it adds 0's to the file numbers to complete a
              two-number holder. Useful when encoding tracks 1-9.

       INTERACTIVE
              Set to "n" if you want to perform automatic rips, without user
              intervention.

       NICE VALUES
              Define the values for priorities (nice values) for the different
              CPU-hungry processes: encoding (ENCNICE), CDROM read (READNICE)
              and distributed encoder with distmp3 (DISTMP3NICE).

       PATHNAMES
              The following configuration file options specify the pathnames

              ATOMICPARSLEYOPTS, FFMPEGENCOPTS, DAGRABOPTS, TWOLAMENCOPTS and
              TTAENCOPTS.

       CDSPEEDVALUE
              Set the value of the CDROM speed. The default is to read the
              disc as fast as the reading program and the system permits. The
              steps are defined as 150kB/s (1x).

       ACTIONS
              The default actions to be performed when reading a disc.

       CDROM  If set, it points to the CD-Rom device which has to be used for
              audio extraction. Abcde tries to guess the right device, but it
              may fail. The special ´flac´ option is defined to extract tracks
              from a single-track flac file.

       CDPARANOIACDROMBUS
              Defined as "d" when using cdparanoia with an IDE bus and as "g"
              when using cdparanoia with the ide-scsi emulation layer.

       OUTPUTDIR
              Specifies the directory to place completed tracks/playlists in.

       WAVOUTPUTDIR
              Specifies the temporary directory to store .wav files in. Abcde
              may use up to 700MB of temporary space for each session
              (although it is rare to use over 100MB for a machine that can
              encode music as fast as it can read it).

       OUTPUTTYPE
              Specifies the encoding format to output, as well as the default
              extension and encoder. Defaults to "vorbis". Valid settings are
              "vorbis" (or "ogg") (Ogg/Vorbis), "mp3" (MPEG-1 Audio Layer
              III), "flac" (Free Lossless Audio Codec), "mp2" (MPEG-1 Audio
              Layer III), "spx" (Ogg/Speex), "mpc" (MPP/MP+ (Musepack), "m4a"
              (AAC or ALAC),"wv" (WavPack"), "wav" (Microsoft Waveform),
              "opus" (Opus Interactive Audio Codec), "tta" (True Audio), "mka"
              (Matroska) or "aiff" (Audio Interchange File Format). Values
              like "vorbis,mp3" encode the tracks in both Ogg/Vorbis and MP3
              formats. For example:
              OUTPUTTYPE=vorbis,flac
              For each value in OUTPUTTYPE, abcde expands a different process
              for encoding, tagging and moving, so you can use the format
              placeholder, OUTPUT, to create different subdirectories to hold
              the different types. The variable OUTPUT will be 'vorbis',
              'mp3', 'flac', 'spx', 'mpc', 'm4a', mp2, 'wv', 'ape', 'tta',
              'wav',
              OUTPUTFORMAT='${OUTPUT}/${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${TRACKNUM}._${TRACKFILE}'

       OUTPUTFORMAT
              Specifies the format for completed Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC,
              Ogg/Speex, MPP/MP+ (Musepack) or M4A filenames. Variables are
              included using standard shell syntax. Allowed variables are
              GENRE, ALBUMFILE, ARTISTFILE, TRACKFILE, TRACKNUM, and YEAR.
              Default is
              ´${ARTISTFILE}-${ALBUMFILE}/${TRACKNUM}-${TRACKFILE}´.  Make
              sure to use single quotes around this variable. TRACKNUM is
              automatically zero-padded, when the number of encoded tracks is
              higher than 9. When lower, you can force with '-p' in the
              command line.

       VAOUTPUTFORMAT
              Just like OUTPUTFORMAT but for Various Artists discs. The
              default is
              'Various-${ALBUMFILE}/${TRACKNUM}.${ARTISTFILE}-${TRACKFILE}'

       ONETRACKOUTPUTFORMAT
              Just like OUTPUTFORMAT but for single-track rips (see option
              "-1"). The default is '${ARTISTFILE}-${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}'

       VAONETRACKOUTPUTFORMAT
              Just like ONETRACKOUTPUTFORMAT but for Various Artists discs.
              The default is 'Various-${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}'

       MAXPROCS
              Defines how many encoders to run at once. This makes for huge
              speedups on SMP systems. You should run one encoder per CPU at
              once for maximum efficiency, although more doesn't hurt very
              much. Set it "0" when using mp3dist to avoid getting encoding
              processes in the local host.

       LOWDISK
              If set to y, conserves disk space by encoding tracks immediately
              after reading them. This is substantially slower than normal
              operation but requires several hundred MB less space to complete
              the encoding of an entire CD. Use only if your system is low on
              space and cannot encode as quickly as it can read.

              Note that this option may also help when reading a CD with
              errors. This is because on a scratchy disk reading is quite
              timing sensitive and this option reduces the background load on
              the system which allows the ripping program more precise
              control.

       BATCHNORM
              If set to y, enables batch mode normalization, which preserves
              relative volume differences between tracks of an album. Also
              enables nogap encoding when using the ´lame´ encoder.

       NOGAP  Activate the lame's --nogap option, that allows files found in
              CDs with no silence between songs (such as live concerts) to be
              encoded without noticeable gaps. WARNING: lame's --nogap
              disables the Xing mp3 tag.  This tag is required for mp3 players
              to correctly display track lengths when playing variable-bit-
              rate mp3 files.

       PLAYLISTFORMAT
              Specifies the format for completed playlist filenames. Works
              like the OUTPUTFORMAT configuration variable. Default is
              ´${ARTISTFILE}_-_${ALBUMFILE}.m3u´.  Make sure to use single
              quotes around this variable.

       PLAYLISTDATAPREFIX
              Specifies a prefix for filenames within a playlist. Useful for
              http playlists, etc.

       DOSPLAYLIST
              If set, the resulting playlist will have CR-LF line endings,
              needed by some hardware-based players.

       COMMENT
              Specifies a comment to embed in the ID3 or Ogg comment field of
              each finished track. Can be up to 28 characters long. Supports
              the same syntax as OUTPUTFORMAT. Does not currently support
              ID3v2.

       REMOTEHOSTS
              Specifies a comma-delimited list of systems to use for remote
              encoding using distmp3. Equivalent to -r.

       mungefilename
              mungefilename() is an abcde shell function that can be
              overridden via abcde.conf. It takes CDDB data as $1 and outputs
              the resulting filename on stdout. It defaults to deleting any
              preceding dots to filename, replacing spaces with an underscore
              and eating characters which variously Windows and Linux do not
              permit.
              If you modify this function, it is probably a good idea to keep
              the forward slash munging (UNIX cannot store a file with a '/'
              char in it) as well as the control character munging (NULs can't
              be in a filename either, and newlines and such in filenames are
              typically not desirable).
              New to abcde 2.7.3 are the user definable functions
              mungetrackname, mungeartistname and mungealbumname which default
              to mungefilename. These permit finer-grained control of track
              name, artist name and album name for the ultra-fastidious.

       mungegenre
              mungegenre () is a shell function used to modify the $GENRE
              variable. As a default action, it takes $GENRE as $1 and outputs
              the resulting value to stdout converting all UPPERCASE
              characters to lowercase.

       pre_read
              pre_read () is a shell function which is executed before the
              CDROM is read for the first time, during abcde execution. It can
              be used to close the CDROM tray, to set its speed (via "setcd"
              or via "eject", if available) and other preparation actions. The
              default function is empty.

       post_read
              post_read () is a shell function which is executed after the
              CDROM is read (and, if applies, before the CDROM is ejected). It
              can be used to read a TOC from the CDROM, or to try to read the
              DATA areas from the CD (if any exist).  The default function is
              empty.

       post_encode
              post_encode () is a shell function which is executed after the
              encoding process.  It can be used to move completed files to
              another location, run any sort of testing on the completed files
              or embed album art if the built in embedding provided by abcde's
              embedalbumart function is not to your taste.  The default
              function is empty.

       EJECTCD
              If set to "y", abcde will call eject(1) to eject the cdrom from
              the drive after all tracks have been read. It has no effect when
              CDROM is set to a flac file.

       EXTRAVERBOSE
              If set to "1", some operations which are usually now shown to
              the end user are visible, such as CDDB queries. Useful for
              initial debug and if your network/CDDB server is slow. Set to
              "2" or more for even more verbose output.

EXAMPLES
       Possible ways one can call abcde:

       abcde  Will work in most systems

       abcde -d /dev/cdrom2
              If the CDROM you are reading from is not the standard /dev/cdrom
              (in GNU/Linux systems)

       abcde -o vorbis,flac
              Will create both Ogg/Vorbis and Ogg/FLAC files.

       abcde -o vorbis:"-b 192"
              Will pass "-b 192" to the Ogg/Vorbis encoder, without having to
              modify the config file

       abcde -o mp3,flac,m4a,wv,ogg -B
              abcde will create mp3, flac, m4a, wv and ogg files and also
              select suitable album art, download and embed the album art into
              all 5 sets of tracks.

       abcde -W 1
              For double+ CD settings: will create the 1st CD starting with
              the track number 101, and will add a comment "CD 1" to the
              tracks, the second starting with 201 and so on.

       abcde -d singletrack.flac -o vorbis:"-q 6"
              Will extract the files contained in singletrack FLAC file using
              the embedded cuesheet and then encode the output files to
              Ogg/Vorbis with a quality setting of 6.

BACKEND TOOLS
       abcde requires the following backend tools to work:

       *      An Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, Ogg/Speex, MPP/MP+(Musepack), M4A
              encoder or Opus encoder (oggenc, vorbize, lame, gogo, bladeenc,
              l3enc, mp3enc, flac, speexenc, mpcenc, fdkaac, neroAacEnc, faac,
              wavpack, opusenc).

       *      An audio CD reading utility (cdparanoia, icedax, cdda2wav,
              libcdio (cd-paranoia), pird, dagrab). To read CD-TEXT
              information, icedax or cdda2wav will be needed.

       *      cd-discid, a CDDB DiscID reading program.

       *      An HTTP retrieval program: wget, fetch (FreeBSD) or curl (Mac OS
              X, among others). Alternatively, abcde-musicbrainz-tool (which
              depends on Perl and some Musicbrainz libraries) can be used to
              retrieve CDDB information about the CD.

       *      (for MP3s) id3 or eyeD3, id3 v1 and v2 tagging programs.

       *      For Monkey's Audio (ape) tagging Robert Muth's 'apetag' is
              required.

       *      To retrieve album art a glyrc package is required and optionally
              the ImageMagick package should be installed.

       *      (optional) distmp3, a client/server for distributed mp3
              encoding.

       *      (optional) normalize-audio, a WAV file volume normalizer.

       *      (optional) a replaygain file volume modifier (vorbisgain,
              metaflac, mp3gain, mpcgain, wvgain),

       *      (optional) mkcue, a CD cuesheet extractor.

DATA FORMATS
       The CDDB metadata format is used a lot by abcde, both for lookups and
       internally. It's documented online at
