ALC(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 ALC(4)

NAME
     alc – Atheros AR813x/AR815x/AR816x/AR817x Gigabit/Fast Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device alc

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_alc_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The alc device driver provides support for Atheros AR813x, AR815x, AR816x
     and AR817x PCI Express Gigabit/Fast Ethernet controllers.

     All LOMs supported by the alc driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload for
     transmit, TCP segmentation offload (TSO), hardware VLAN tag
     stripping/insertion features, Wake On Lan (WOL) and an interrupt
     moderation mechanism as well as a 64-bit multicast hash filter.

     The AR813x, AR815x, AR816x and AR817x supports Jumbo Frames (up to 9216,
     6144, 9216 and 9216 bytes, respectively), which can be configured via the
     interface MTU setting.  Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
     ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo
     Frames.

     The alc driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.

     1000baseTX       Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.

     The alc driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The alc device driver provides support for the following Ethernet
     controllers:

     •   Atheros AR8131 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8132 PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8151 v1.0 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8151 v2.0 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8152 v1.1 PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8152 v2.0 PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8161 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8162 PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8171 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller
     •   Atheros AR8172 PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller
     •   Killer E2200 Gigabit Ethernet controller
     •   Killer E2400 Gigabit Ethernet controller
     •   Killer E2500 Gigabit Ethernet controller

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.alc.msi_disable
             This tunable disables MSI support on the Ethernet hardware.  The
             default value is 0.

     hw.alc.msix_disable
             This tunable disables MSI-X support on the Ethernet hardware.
             The default value is 0.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     dev.alc.%d.int_rx_mod
             Maximum amount of time to delay receive interrupt processing in
             units of 1us.  The accepted range is 0 to 130000, the default is
             100(100us).  Value 0 completely disables the interrupt
             moderation.

     dev.alc.%d.int_tx_mod
             Maximum amount of time to delay transmit interrupt processing in
             units of 1us.  The accepted range is 0 to 130000, the default is
             1000(1ms).  Value 0 completely disables the interrupt moderation.

     dev.alc.%d.process_limit
             Maximum amount of Rx frames to be processed in the event loop
             before rescheduling a taskqueue.  The accepted range is 32 to
             255, the default value is 64 events.  The interface does not need
             to be brought down and up again before a change takes effect.
