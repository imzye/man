NAME
       PDL::Minuit - a PDL interface to the Minuit library

DESCRIPTION
       This package implements an interface to the Minuit minimization
       routines (part of the CERN Library)

SYNOPSIS
         use PDL::LiteF;
         use PDL::Minuit;
         $x = sequence(10);
         $y = 3.0 + 4.0*$x;
         mn_init(\&chi2, {Title => 'test title'});
         mn_def_pars($pars=pdl(2.5,3.0), $steps=pdl(0.3,0.5), {Names => [qw(intercept slope)]});
         mn_excm('set pri',pdl(3.0));
         mn_excm('migrad');
         mn_excm('minos');
         print "emat=", mn_emat();
         print "out=", mn_pout(1), "\n";
         mn_err(1);
         mn_stat();

         sub chi2 {
             my ($npar,$grad,$fval,$xval,$iflag) = @_;
             $fval = (($y - $xval->slice(0) - $xval->slice(1)*$x)**2)->sumover
               if $iflag == 4;
             ($fval,$grad);
         }

       A basic fit with Minuit will call three functions in this package.
       First, a basic initialization is done with mn_init(). Then, the
       parameters are defined via the function mn_def_pars(), which allows
       setting upper and lower bounds. Then the function mn_excm() can be used
       to issue many Minuit commands, including simplex and migrad
       minimization algorithms (see Minuit manual for more details).

   mn_init()
       The function mn_init() does the basic initialization of the fit. The
       first argument has to be a reference to the function to be minimized.
       The function to be minimized has to receive five arguments
       ($npar,$grad,$fval,$xval,$iflag). The first is the number of parameters
       currently variable. The second is the gradient of the function (which
       is not necessarily used, see the Minuit documentation). The third is
       the current value of the function. The fourth is an ndarray with the
       values of the parameters.  The fifth is an integer flag, which
       indicates what the function is supposed to calculate. The function has
       to return the  values ($fval,$grad), the function value and the
       function gradient.

       There are three optional arguments to mn_init(). By default, the output
       of Minuit will come through STDOUT unless a filename $logfile is given
       in the Log option. Note that this will mercilessly erase $logfile if it
       already exists. Additionally, a title can be given to the fit by the
       Title option, the default is 'Minuit Fit'. If the output is written to
       a logfile, this is assigned Fortran unit number 88. If for whatever
       reason you want to have control over the unit number that Fortran
       associates to the logfile, you can pass the number through the Unit
       option.

       Usage:

        mn_init($function_ref,{Log=>$logfile,Title=>$title,Unit=>$unit})

       Example:

        mn_init(\&my_function);

        #same as above but outputting to a file 'log.out'.
        #title for fit is 'My fit'
        mn_init(\&my_function,
                {Log => 'log.out', Title => 'My fit'});

        sub my_function{
           # the five variables input to the function to be minimized
           # xval is an ndarray containing the current values of the parameters
           my ($npar,$grad,$fval,$xval,$iflag) = @_;

           # Here is code computing the value of the function
           # and potentially also its gradient
           # ......

           # return the two variables. If no gradient is being computed
           # just return the $grad that came as input
           return ($fval, $grad);
        }

   mn_def_pars()
       The function mn_def_pars() defines the initial values of the parameters
       of the function to be minimized and the value of the initial steps
       around these values that the minimizer will use for the first
       variations of the parameters in the search for the minimum.  There are
       several optional arguments. One allows assigning names to these
       parameters which otherwise get names (Par_0, Par_1,....,Par_n) by
       default. Another two arguments can give lower and upper bounds for the
       parameters via two ndarrays. If the lower and upper bound for a given
       parameter are both equal to 0 then the parameter is unbound. By default
       these lower and upper bound ndarrays are set to  zeroes(n), where n is
       the number of parameters, i.e. the parameters are unbound by default.

       The function needs two input variables: an ndarray giving the initial
       values of the parameters and another ndarray giving the initial steps.
       An optional reference to a perl array with the  variable names can be
       passed, as well as ndarrays with upper and lower bounds for the
       parameters (see example below).

       It returns an integer variable which is 0 upon success.

       Usage:

        $iflag = mn_def_pars($pars, $steps,{Names => \@names,
                               Lower_bounds => $lbounds,
                               Upper_bounds => $ubounds})

       Example:

        #initial parameter values
        my $pars = pdl(2.5,3.0);

        #steps
        my $steps = pdl(0.3,0.5);

        #parameter names
        my @names = ('intercept','slope');

        #use mn_def_pars with default parameter names (Par_0,Par_1,...)
        my $iflag = mn_def_pars($pars,$steps);

        #use of mn_def_pars explicitly specify parameter names
        $iflag = mn_def_pars($pars,$steps,{Names => \@names});

        # specify lower and upper bounds for the parameters.
        # The example below leaves parameter 1 (intercept) unconstrained
        # and constrains parameter 2 (slope) to be between 0 and 100
        my $lbounds = pdl(0, 0);
        my $ubounds = pdl(0, 100);

        $iflag = mn_def_pars($pars,$steps,{Names => \@names,
                               Lower_bounds => $lbounds,
                               Upper_bounds => $ubounds}});

        #same as above because $lbounds is by default zeroes(n)
        $iflag = mn_def_pars($pars,$steps,{Names => \@names,
                               Upper_bounds => $ubounds}});

   mn_excm()
       The function mn_excm() executes a Minuit command passed as a string.
       The first argument is the command string and an optional second
       argument is an ndarray with arguments to the command.  The available
       commands are listed in Chapter 4 of the Minuit manual (see url below).

       It returns an integer variable which is 0 upon success.

       Usage:

        $iflag = mn_excm($command_string, {$arglis})

       Example:

         #start a simplex minimization
         my $iflag = mn_excm('simplex');

         #same as above but specify the maximum allowed numbers of
         #function calls in the minimization
         my $arglist = pdl(1000);
         $iflag = mn_excm('simplex',$arglist);

         #start a migrad minimization
         $iflag = mn_excm('migrad')

         #set Minuit strategy in order to get the most reliable results
         $arglist = pdl(2)
         $iflag = mn_excm('set strategy',$arglist);

         # each command can be specified by a minimal string that uniquely
         # identifies it (see Chapter 4 of Minuit manual). The command above
         # is equivalent to:
         $iflag = mn_excm('set stra',$arglis);

   mn_pout()
       The function mn_pout() gets the current value of a parameter. It takes
       as input the parameter number and returns an array with the parameter
       value, the current estimate of its uncertainty (0 if parameter is
       constant), lower bound on the parameter, if any (otherwise 0), upper
       bound on the parameter, if any (otherwise 0), integer flag (which is
       equal to the parameter number if variable, zero if the parameter is
       constant and negative if parameter is not defined) and the parameter
       name.

       Usage:

            ($val,$err,$bnd1,$bnd2,$ivarbl,$par_name) = mn_pout($par_number);

   mn_stat()
       The function mn_stat() gets the current status of the minimization.  It
       returns an array with the best function value found so far, the
       estimated vertical distance remaining to minimum, the value of UP
       defining parameter uncertainties (default is 1), the number of
       currently variable parameters, the highest parameter defined and an
       integer flag indicating how good the covariance matrix is (0=not
       calculated at all; 1=diagonal approximation, not accurate; 2=full
       matrix, but forced positive definite; 3=full accurate matrix)

       Usage:

           ($fmin,$fedm,$errdef,$npari,$nparx,$istat) = mn_stat();

   mn_emat()
       The function mn_emat returns the covariance matrix as an ndarray.

       Usage:

         $emat = mn_emat();

   mn_err()
       The function mn_err() returns the current existing values for the error
       in the fitted parameters. It returns an array with the positive error,
       the negative error, the "parabolic" parameter error from the error
       matrix and the global correlation coefficient, which is a number
       between 0 and 1 which gives the correlation between the requested
       parameter and that linear combination of all other parameters which is
       most strongly correlated with it. Unless the command 'MINOS' has been
       issued via the function mn_excm(), the first three values will be
       equal.

       Usage:

         ($eplus,$eminus,$eparab,$globcc) = mn_err($par_number);

   mn_contour()
       The function mn_contour() finds contours of the function being
       minimized with respect to two chosen parameters. The contour level is
       given by F_min + UP, where F_min is the minimum of the function and UP
       is the ERRordef specified by the user, or 1.0 by default (see Minuit
       manual). The contour calculated by this function is dynamic, in the
       sense that it represents the minimum of the function being minimized
       with respect to all the other NPAR-2 parameters (if any).

       The function takes as input the parameter numbers with respect to which
       the contour is to be determined (two) and the number of points $npt
       required on the contour (>4).  It returns an array with ndarrays
       $xpt,$ypt containing the coordinates of the contour and a variable
       $nfound indicating the number of points actually found in the contour.
       If all goes well $nfound will be equal to $npt, but it can be negative
       if the input arguments are not valid, zero if less than four points
       have been found or <$npt if the program could not find $npt points.

       Usage:

         ($xpt,$ypt,$nfound) = mn_contour($par_number_1,$par_number_2,$npt)
