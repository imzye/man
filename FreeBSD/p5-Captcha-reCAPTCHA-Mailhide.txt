DESCRIPTION
       reCAPTCHA is a hybrid mechanical turk and captcha that allows visitors
       who complete the captcha to assist in the digitization of books.

       From <http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html>:

           reCAPTCHA improves the process of digitizing books by sending words that
           cannot be read by computers to the Web in the form of CAPTCHAs for
           humans to decipher. More specifically, each word that cannot be read
           correctly by OCR is placed on an image and used as a CAPTCHA. This is
           possible because most OCR programs alert you when a word cannot be read
           correctly.

       This Perl implementation is modelled on the PHP interface that can be
       found here:

       <http://recaptcha.net/plugins/php/>

INTERFACE
       To use reCAPTCHA Mailhide you need to get a public, private key pair
       from this page:

       <http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/apikey>

       The Mailhide API consists of two methods "mailhide_html" and
       "mailhide_url". The methods have the same parameters.

       The _html version returns HTML that can be directly put on your web
       page. The username portion of the email that is passed in is truncated
       and replaced with a link that calls Mailhide. The _url version gives
       you the url to decode the email and leaves it up to you to place the
       email in HTML.

       "new"
           Create a new "Captcha::reCAPTCHA::Mailhide".

       "mailhide_url( $pubkey, $privkey, $email )"
           Generate a link that will decode the specified email address.

           $pubkey
               The Mailhide public key from the signup page

           $privkey
               The Mailhide private key from the signup page

           $email
               The email address you want to hide.

           Returns a URL that when clicked will allow the user to decode the
           hidden email address.

       "mailhide_html( $pubkey, $privkey, $email )"
           Generates HTML markup to embed a Mailhide protected email address
           on a page.

           The arguments are the same as for "mailhide_url".

           Returns a string containing HTML that may be embedded directly in a
           web page.
