NAME
       dillo - web browser

SYNOPSIS
       dillo [OPTION]...  [--] [URL|FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Dillo is a lightweight graphical web browser that aims to be secure.
       It handles HTTP internally, and FILE, FTP, and DATA URIs are handled
       through a plugin system (dpi). In addition, EXPERIMENTAL HTTPS support
       can be enabled. Both FTP and Dillo's download manager use the wget(1)
       downloader.

       Dillo displays HTML, text, PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG and WebP files.  It
       handles cookies, HTTP authentication (basic and digest), proxying
       (basic), and some CSS.

       Framesets are displayed as links to frames, and there is currently no
       support for javascript or video.

       In order to use the hyphenation feature, pattern files from CTAN need
       to be installed to /usr/local/libexec/dillo/hyphenation/.  This can be
       done with the script dillo-install-hyphenation.  Call it with ISO-639-1
       language codes as arguments, or without arguments to get more help.
