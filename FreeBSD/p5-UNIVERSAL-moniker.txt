NAME
       UNIVERSAL::moniker

SYNOPSIS
         use UNIVERSAL::moniker;

DESCRIPTION
       Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good
       when written in prose.  For this reason, we tend to say things like
       "customer" or "basket" when we are referring to
       "My::Site::User::Customer" or "My::Site::Shop::Basket".  We thought it
       would be nice if our classes knew what we would prefer to call them.

       This module will add a "moniker" (and "plural_moniker") method to
       "UNIVERSAL", and so to every class or module.

   moniker
         $ob->moniker;

       Returns the moniker for $ob.  So, if $ob->isa("Big::Scary::Animal"),
       "moniker" will return "animal".

   plural_moniker
         $ob->plural_moniker;

       Returns the plural moniker for $ob.  So, if
       $ob->isa("Cephalopod::Octopus"), "plural_moniker" will return
       "octopuses".

       (You need to install Lingua::EN::Inflect for this to work.)
