RTFM(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                RTFM(1)

NAME
     rtfm – Documentation search

SYNOPSIS
     rtfm [-cdimtw] keyword

DESCRIPTION
     rtfm searches for keyword in the FreeBSD manual pages and the GNU Texinfo
     pages.

     The following options are availible:

     -c      Prints the command for the user to type instead of the default
             search output.

     -d      Print descriptions if manual pages are being searched.

     -i      Case-insensitive search.  This implies the -i flag for zgrep(1)

     -m      Search manual pages only.

     -t      Search texinfo pages only.

     -w      Searches for the exact word.  This implies the -w flag for
             zgrep(1) and causes rtfm to use whatis(1) instead of apropos(1)
             for searching manual pages.

SEE ALSO
     apropos(1), info(1), man(1), whatis(1)
