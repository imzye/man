RUN_SCALED(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          RUN_SCALED(1)

NAME
       run_scaled - run an X11 application upscaled or downscaled

SYNOPSIS
       run_scaled [--scale=VALUE] application [application-arguments]
       run_scaled [--scale=VALUE] [xpra-arguments] -- application
                  [application-arguments]


DESCRIPTION
       run_scaled uses xpra(1) to show any X11 application with arbitrary
       scaling applied.


EXAMPLES
       run_scaled xterm -ls
              Starts the command "xterm -ls", with the default scaling of 2.
              The xterm window will be twice as big as it normally would be.

       run_scaled --scale=250% firefox
              Start firefox, upscaled by 250%.

       run_scaled --speaker=off --microphone=off -- wine notepad.exe
              Starts the command "wine notepad.exe", with audio inputs and
              outputs disabled (by additional Xpra arguments) and the default
              scaling of 2.


OPTIONS
       --scale=VALUE
              The scaling factor to apply, specified as:

              number ie: 2, 1.5

              fraction
                     ie: 3/2

              percentage
                     ie: 250%
       If unspecified, the default value is 2.


LIMITATIONS
       The scaling value is limited to the range 0.1 to 10, and even within
       that range, values lower than 1 may not work correctly with large
       displays.
