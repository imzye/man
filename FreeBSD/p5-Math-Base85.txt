NAME
       Math::Base85 - Perl extension for base 85 numbers, as referenced by RFC
       1924

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Base85;

         $bigint = from_base85($number);
         $b85str = to_base85($bigint);

DESCRIPTION
       RFC 1924 describes a compact, fixed-size representation of IPv6
       addresses which uses a base 85 number system.  This module handles some
       of the uglier details of it.

       The base 85 numbers (from 0 to 84) are as follows:

           0..9 A..Z a..z ! # $ % & ( ) * + - ; < = > ? @ ^ _ ` { | } ~

       At the moment, there's not much in this module.  But it should be
       sufficient for the purposes of RFC 1924.

       This module has a variable called $Math::Base85::base85_digits, which
       is a string containing the digits of the base 85 alphabet from lowest
       (0) to highest (~), in that order.

       Additionally, the following two functions are defined for general use.
       (They will be exported upon request.)

from_base85
   Parameters
       A string composed of valid base 85 digits.

   Returns
       A "Math::BigInt" object representing the number.

to_base85
   Parameters
       A "Math::BigInt" object.

   Returns
       A string of base 85 digits representing the number.
