DESCRIPTION
       The autotrace program accepts bitmap graphics from the file inputfile
       specified on the command line, and as output produces a collection of
       splines approximating the original image, the converting the image from
       bitmap to vector format.  It behaves in a manner similar to the
       commercial software known as *tream*ine or *orel*race.  The result is
       sent to standard output unless the -output-file option is active.

OPTIONS
       Options can begin with either -- or -.  Any unambiguous abbreviation
       can be used for the option name.  Option names and values can be
       separated with either a space or equal sign (=).

       -background-color hexvalue
              Employ the color specified by the hexadecimal code hexcode as
              the background that should be ignored, for example FFFFFF
              (default: no background color or 0xFFFFFF if -centerline is
              set).

       -centerline
              Trace an object's centerline (default: employ its outline).

       -color-count int
              Reduce the bitmap to using the number of colors specified by the
              unsigned integer int (range: 1-256).  The default value of 0
              indicates that no color reduction is to be done.  Does not work
              with grayscale images.

       -corner-always-threshold angle
              Consider any angle at a pixel which falls below the specified
              angle (in degrees) as a corner, even if it is bordered by other
              corner pixels (default: 60).

       -corner-surround int
              Consider the specified number of pixels on either side of a
              point when determining if that point is a corner (default: 4).

       -corner-threshold angle
              Consider any pixel which forms an angle with its predecessor(s)
              and successor(s) that is smaller than the specified angle (in
              degrees) as a corner (default: 100).

       -despeckle-level int
              Employ the specified integer (range: 1-20) as the value for
              despeckling (default: no despeckling).

       -despeckle-tightness real
              Employ the specified real number (range: 0.0-8.0) as the value
              for despeckle tightness (default: 2.0).

       -dpi int
              The dots per inch value in the input image, affects scaling of
              mif output image.

       -error-threshold real
              Subdivide fitted curves that are offset by a number of pixels
              exceeding the specified real number (default: 2.0).

       -filter-iterations int
              Smooth the curve the specified number of times prior to fitting
              (default: 4).

       -help  Print a help message and exit.

       -input-format format
              Employ the specified input format, where format is one of:

              BMP (Windows bitmap format)

              PBM (Portable BitMap format)

              PGM (Portable Graymap format)

              PNM (Portable Anymap format)

              PPM (Portable Pixmap format)

              TGA (Targa format)

              The supported input formats are determined when the application
              is built and depend upon the availability of other software (the
              -list-input-formats command can be used to determine which are
              supported locally).

       -line-reversion-threshold real
              When a spline is closer to a straight line than the specified
              real number weighted by the square of the curve length (default:
              .01), maintain it as a straight line, even if it is a list with
              curves.

       -line-threshold real
              If a spline does not deviate from the straight line defined by
              its endpoints by more than the specified number of pixels, then
              treat it as a straight line (default: 1).

       -list-input-formats
              Send a list of the supported input formats to stderr.

       -list-output-formats
              Send a list of the supported output formats to stderr.

       -log   Send a detailed progress report to the file inputfile.log.

       -output-file file
              Send the output to the specified file.

       -output-format format
              Employ the specified output format, where format is one of:

              platforms)

              emf(Windows Enhanced Metafile format)

              epd(Encapsulated Vectorial Graphics format)

              sk(Sketch)

              svg(Scalable Vector Graphics)

              swf(Shockwave Flash 3)

              The supported output formats are determined when the application
              is built and depend upon the availability of other software (the
              -list-output-formats command can be used to determine which are
              supported locally).

       -preserve-width
              Whether to preserve line width prior to thinning.
