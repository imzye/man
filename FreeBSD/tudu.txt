NAME
       TuDu - A command-line tool to manage TODO lists hierarchically.

SYNOPSIS
       tudu [-f tudu_file] [-c config_file] [-v[v]] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       TuDu is a commandline tool to manage hierarchical TODO lists, so that
       you can organize everything you have to do in a simple and efficient
       way.  It does not use any database backend, but plain XML files.

       Every TODO is composed by:

       Status             Currently only two options: Pending and Done.
       Title              A short sentence summarizing the task.
       Description text   A longer text providing more details. (Optional)
       Priority           The urgency of the task. (Optional)
       Category           A short tag such as @home, @work, @inet. (Optional)
       Deadline           The latest date the task should be done. (Optional)
       Scheduled date     The planned date to do the task. (Optional)
       Subtasks           Every task can have any number of subtasks. (Optional)

       Tasks can be ordered by any of those fields, and categories can be used
       to show only some certain kinds of tasks. Tudu also warns when a
       deadline is approaching, and shows the percentage of the task done so
       far.

   keys
       This section defines any key binding on the program. See the example in
       the default config file.

   theme
       Window positions are described by rows; each row with the syntax:
              row = [height]([width|]window[, [width|]window, ...])
       The height and width can be the number of characters or a percentage
       followed by %. The possible windows are: help, tree, info, blank,
       vpipe, hpipe text, and schedule. The windows help, vpipe and info don't
       need to have height, neither hpipe needs to have width, because is
       predefined as 1.  TuDu will try to guess the non given information.

       Other options for the theme are:

       columns = colm1,...,colmN
              Columns in tree window. The possible columns are: title,
              priority, category and deadline.

       category_length = numChar
              Number of characters to be displayed of the category.

       color = color_text, color_background
              The default colors for the text and background. If your terminal
              has support to change colora the colors can be defined  as (r,
              g, b), where r, g and b are numbers from 0 to 1000, or with the
              words: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white,
              transparent.

       window = color_text, color_background
              For each window can be defined it's own colors. The colors of
              vpipe and hpipe are the same, and defined with the window name
              pipe.

       selected = color_text, color_background
              Color for the items under the cursor.

       warn = color_text, color_background
              Color for the warnings, like the mark of deadline soon or the
              color of the task scheduled on the past.
