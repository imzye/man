NAME
       ximaging - raster graphics browser/viewer.

SYNOPSIS
       ximaging [options] [directory|file]

DESCRIPTION
       XImaging is a graphics image browser and viewer for Unix operating
       systems running X11.

   Options
       In addition to standard X toolkit options, following can be specified
       on the command line:

       -browse
              Open a browser rather than a viewer window when the application
              is launched without a file/directory argument.

       -format <suffix>
              Deduce image file format from the suffix specified (see
              SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS and FILTERS).

       -f <suffix>
              Same as -format.

       -pin   Pin newly opened window so it won't be reused.

       -server
              Launch in the background and wait for IPC requests.  (first
              instance in a session launches as a server by default).

       -quiet Don't write anything to stdout.

   Operands
       directory
              Directory containing images to browse.

       file   Single image file name to be displayed.

GUI USAGE
       Browser
              The Browser window displays miniature previews of images
              contained within a directory. The navigation bar displays the
              current location and may be used to input a desired path
              directly.

              Items displayed in the view area can be selected and manipulated
              using either keyboard or mouse. MB1 click selects an item. The
              selection may be extended to another item by holding the Shift
              key, while clicking another item using MB1. Selection state of a
              single item may be toggled by clicking on it using MB1, while
              holding down the Control key. MB2 behaves the same way as MB1,
              except that it displays a pop-up menu with commonly used
              functions. Double- clicking an image with MB1 opens the file in
              the Viewer. Double-clicking the file name with MB1 posts the
              Rename dialog. Double-clicking an image, or pressing enter when
              the view area is focused, will display the selected file in a
              Viewer window.

              Navigation keys may be used to move the focus rectangle among
              the items.  Pressing the Space key toggles the selection state
              of the focused item. Holding theShift key while moving the
              selection rectangle extends the selection.

              Pressing the Backspace key, while the view area or the directory
              list is focused, changes current location to the parent
              directory.

       Viewer The Viewer window is used to display single images, and provides
              functionality to zoom in and out, rotate, flip the image, and
              display multi-page images.  Note that transformations applied to
              the image within the viewer are only temporary, since XImaging
              doesn't provide destructive image editing capabilities.  The
              image, if larger than the view, may be panned either by holding
              MB1 pressed and dragging the image, or by pushing one of the
              direction keys on the keyboard.

       Window Management
              By default the last active browser or viewer window is reused
              when XImaging receives a file/directory open request, but every
              window can be configured to stay within its current state by
              choosing Pin This from its Window menu. The initial value for
              this setting may also be specified as X resource (see RESOURCES)
              or using the -pin command line switch.

RESOURCES
   General Resources
       The the application class name is XImaging, class names of its viewer
       and browser shell windows are XImagingViewer and XImagingBrowser,
       respectively.

       advanceOnDelete Boolean
              If True, the viewer will load next file in the directory, when
              currently displayed file is being deleted. Default is True.

       browse Boolean
              Open a browser window rather than a viewer window when the
              application is launched without a file/directory argument.

       confirmFileRemoval Boolean
              Ask before deleting files. Default is True.

       downsamplingFilter Boolean
              Apply filtering when down-sampling (zooming out) images in the
              viewer window.  Results in better image quality if enabled, but
              is computationally intensive, especially on large images. The
              default value is True.  NOTE: This option is only supported on
              true color visuals.  See also fastPanning.

       editCommand String
              A command to be invoked when the Edit item is chosen from the
              File menu. The list of currently selected files will be appended
              to the end of the command string specified.

       fastPanning Boolean
              If set to True, up/down-sampling filter in the viewer will be
              temporarily disabled when the image is being panned using the
              mouse.  Only effective if downsamplingFilter and/or
              upsamplingFilter resources are set to True. Default value is
              False.

              Keep rotation settings across images. Default is False.

       pinWindow Boolean
              Pin newly opened windows by default so that it won't be reused.
              Default is False.

       quiet Boolean
              Don't write anything to stdout. Default is False.

       refreshInterval Integer
              Time interval in seconds at which XImaging checks for file and
              directory content changes. Default is 4 seconds.

       showDirectories Boolean

              True.

       tileAspectRatio Integer:Integer
              Aspect ratio of preview tiles in browser window. Default is 4:3.

       tileSize small|medium|large
              Default size of preview tiles in browser window. Must be either
              "small", "medium", or "large". NOTE: Actual pixel values for
              these mnemonics are obtained from tileSizeList and
              tileAspectRatio resources.

       tileSizeList Integer, Integer, Integer
              Comma separated list of three (small, medium, large) tile size
              values in pixels. The final size is calculated using the aspect
              ratio specified with the tileAspectRatio resource.

       upsamplingFilter Boolean
              Apply filtering when up-sampling (zooming in) images in the
              viewer window.  Results in a smooth transition between zoomed-in
              pixels. Default value is False. NOTE: This option is only
              supported on true color visuals.

       viewerToolbar Boolean
              If set to True, a toolbar containing some of the most frequently
              used commands will be shown in the viewer window. The default
              value is False.

              be in the 1.1 - 4.0 range. Default is 1.6.

   Path Field Widget Resources
       The path field widget consists of a text field that displays the
       current working directory with an array of push buttons, each
       representing an element of the path, above.

       The class name of the widget is PathField, the widget name pathField.
       Aside from resources described below, the widget inherits resources
       from XmManager(3).

       buttonHeight Integer
              A value in percent that sets the vertical size of path element
              buttons relative to the height of the font used to draw text in
              the widget.  Default is 100.

       compactPath Boolean
              If True, the $HOME part of the path will be represented by a
              tilde.  Default is true.

       Support for additional image types is available through filters.

FILTERS
       A filter is an executable program that can read a particular image
       format and write its contents to the stdout in PNM (Netpbm) format,
       which XImaging will then read and display.

       To use a filter, XImaging needs to know the executable's file name, and
       what image name suffixes it should be invoked for. This is defined by
       two mandatory and one optional Xresource records.

       XImaging.filter.<filter_name>: <executable_file_name>
       XImaging.filter.<filter_name>.suffixes: <list_of_suffixes>
       XImaging.filter.<filter_name>.description: <type_description>

       filter_name may be any string adhering to X resource specification.

       executable_file_name specifies the file name of the filter executable
       and its arguments, in which the placeholder %n is expanded to the image
       file name.

       list_of_suffixes should contain one or more, space separated, file name
       suffixes (without the dot character) this filter should be invoked for.

       type_description is optional and specifies the descriptive text to be
       displayed in viewer's status area, which defaults to PNM data type if
       omitted.

       Filter examples using convert (ImageMagick) and xcf2pmn (xcftools):

       XImaging.filter.imagemagick: convert %n pam:-
       XImaging.filter.imagemagick.suffixes: svg gif psd

       XImaging.filter.gimp: xcf2pnm -c -b #ffffff %n
       XImaging.filter.gimp.suffixes: xcf

CAVEATS
       XImaging doesn't provide file format conversion features. There are
       tools - e.g., ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org) - designed for
       this purpose.
