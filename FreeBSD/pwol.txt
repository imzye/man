NAME
       pwol - Send Wake-On-LAN (WoL) packets to wake-up hosts over the network


SYNOPSIS
       pwol [options] [<hosts|groups>]


DESCRIPTION
       pwol is a tool that can be used to send WoL (Wake-On-LAN) network
       packets in order to wake-up sleeping hosts, either directly or via
       routers.

       It can also be used as a WoL proxy daemon listening to incoming WoL
       packets (possibly authenticated) and then forwarding requests to one or
       many other targets.

       If no hosts or groups are specified on the command line then pwol will
       read them from the command line.
