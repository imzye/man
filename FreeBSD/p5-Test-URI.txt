NAME
       Test::URI - Check Uniform Resource Identifiers

SYNOPSIS
               use Test::More tests => 5;
               use Test::URI;

               my $uri = 'http://www.example.com:8080/index.html#name'

               uri_scheme_ok( $uri, 'http' );
               uri_host_ok( $uri, 'www.example.com' );
               uri_port_ok( $uri, '8080' );
               uri_path_ok( $uri, '/index.html' );
               uri_fragment_ok( $uri, 'name' );

DESCRIPTION
       Check various parts of Uniform Resource Locators

FUNCTIONS
       uri_scheme_ok( STRING|URI, SCHEME )
           Ok is the STRING is a valid URI, in any format that URI accepts,
           and the URI uses the same SCHEME (i.e.  protocol: http, ftp, ...).
           SCHEME is not case sensitive.

           STRING can be an URI object.

       uri_host_ok( STRING|URI, HOST )
           Ok is the STRING is a valid URI, in any format that URI accepts,
           and the URI uses the same HOST.  HOST is not case sensitive.

           Not Ok is the URI scheme does not have a host portion.

           STRING can be an URI object.

       uri_port_ok( STRING|URI, PORT )
           Ok is the STRING is a valid URI, in any format that URI accepts,
           and the URI uses the same PORT.

           Not Ok is the URI scheme does not have a port portion.

           STRING can be an URI object.

       uri_canonical_ok
           UNIMPLEMENTED.  I'm not sure why I thought this should be a test.
           If anyone else knows, I'll implement it.

       uri_path_ok( STRING|URI, PATH )
           Ok is the STRING is a valid URI, in any format that URI accepts,
           and the URI has the path PATH. Remember that paths start with a /,
           even if it doesn't look like there is anything after the host
           parts.

           STRING can be an URI object.

       uri_fragment_ok( STRING|URI, FRAGMENT )
           Ok is the STRING is a valid URI, in any format that URI accepts,
           and the URI has the fragment FRAGMENT.

           STRING can be an URI object.

TO DO
       •   add methods: uri_canonical_ok, uri_query_string_ok

       •   add convenience methods such as uri_is_web, uri_is_ftp
