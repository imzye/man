DESCRIPTION
     The function login_tty() prepares a terminal for a new login session.
     The file descriptor fd passed to login_tty() must be opened for reading
     and writing on a terminal device.  It will be made the controlling
     terminal for the calling process, after allocating a new session with
     setsid(2).  This terminal device will also be made the standard input,
     standard output, and standard error output of the calling process.

RETURN VALUES
     The login_tty() function returns -1 if it could not make the device
     referenced by fd the controlling terminal of the calling process, and 0
     otherwise.
