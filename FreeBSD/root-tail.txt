DESCRIPTION
       Displays a given file anywhere on your X11 root window, i.e. it is kind
       of tail -f for multiple files using your desktop background as output
       window.

       All non-option arguments on the command line are files to be logged. A
       null desc (example: "/var/log/messages,red,") will prevent the printing
       of a description and the []'s.

   General Options
       --color COLOR
              Use COLOR as default.

       --font | -fn FONTSPEC
              Use font FONTSPEC. This can be either a fixed width font like
              -fn fixed or any font using -fn '-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'
              with the appropriate fields filled out (see xfontsel).
              Specifying a different FONTSPEC before each filename will cause
              each file to be displayed in a different font.

       -f | --fork
              Forks to the background.

       --reverse
              Display the files in reverse order, with the newest lines at the
              top.

       --whole
              Only display whole lines. If the last line of a file doesn't yet
              end with a newline character then wait until it does before
              displaying it. This is the default if more than one file is
              being displayed.

       --partial
              This is the opposite of the --whole option (see above). It
              displays lines even if they don't yet have a newline at the end.
              This is the default if only one file is being displayed.

       --update
              Update partial lines 'in place' if they are still on the screen
              when they are updated in their files. Using --update
              automatically turns on --partial.

       --cont STRING
              When partial lines are broken into two lines in the display,
              prefix the 2nd line with STRING. Defaults to "|| ". Specify the
              "--whole" argument to ensure partial lines are never displayed,
              or specify "--update" to attempt to "repair" broken lines in-
              place.

       --cont-color COLOR
              Use COLOR when displaying the continuation string (as optionally
              specified with the --cont option above).

       --wordwrap
              The default behaviour is to fit as much as possible onto each
              line of output, even if this means splitting a word between one
              line and the next. The --wordwrap argument splits lines at
              spaces if possible.

       --justify
              After wrapping long lines, attempt to justify the text to
              produce a smooth right-hand margin.  Implies --wordwrap.

       --reload SEC COMMAND
              Re-display the file(s) and run COMMAND every SEC seconds. The
              default is to never re-display the file(s).

       --shade
              Add black shading to the font.

       --outline
              Add a black outline to the font (making redraws quite a bit
              slower).

       --minspace
              Use minimum linespace even when using shading or outlining. This
              might result in leftover pixels (dependign on font and logfile
              content).

       --noflicker
              Use slower but flicker-free update.

       --noinitial
              Don't display the end of the file(s) initially.

       --windowed
              Create a new window instead of reusing the root window. The
              newly created window covers the whole screen, puts itself behind
              all other windows and and does not accept events. Use this
              option if you use a compositing manager suihc as xcompmgr or
              compton, as the compositing extension has been very badly
              designed and cannot handle root windows correctly.

       -id ID Use the given window ID for output instead of the root window.

       -i | --interval SECONDS
              Use the specified sleeping interval between checks instead of
              the default 2.4 seconds. Fractional values are OK.

       -V     Print version information.

       --frame
              Draw a frame around the selected area.  This is useful when
              trying to find the perfect geometry.

EXAMPLE
       root-tail --windowed -g 800x250+100+50 -font 10x20
       /var/log/messages,green -font 12x24 /var/log/secure,red,'ALERT'

BUGS
       Some desktop environments open a virtual root window and make it
       difficult to share it. If you cannot see anything after starting root-
       tail, try the --windowed option, a setting "allow programs on desktop"
       or similar, or manually specify a window id.

       Should you happen to find any bugs please fix them and send me a diff.
