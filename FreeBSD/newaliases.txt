NEWALIASES(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          NEWALIASES(1)



NAME
       newaliases - rebuild the data base for the mail aliases file

SYNOPSIS
       newaliases

DESCRIPTION
       Newaliases rebuilds the random access data base for the mail aliases
       file /etc/mail/aliases.  It must be run each time this file is changed
       in order for the change to take effect.

       Newaliases is identical to ``sendmail -bi''.

       The newaliases utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

       Notice: do not use makemap to create the aliases data base, because
       newaliases puts a special token into the data base that is required by
       sendmail.

FILES
       /etc/mail/aliases   The mail aliases file

SEE ALSO
       aliases(5), sendmail(8)

HISTORY
       The newaliases command appeared in 4.0BSD.
