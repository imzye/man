NAME
       Search::Saryer - a perl interface of libsary

SYNOPSIS
         my $saryer = new Search::Saryer(filename=>'search.txt');
         print $saryer->grep($pattern)

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( FILE )
       new ( OPTIONS )
           Create "Search::Saryer" object.  If creation process was failed, it
           returns undef.  These following options are avaiable.

           file
               This option is used to set the target file name.

           filename
               This option is the alias of "file".

           array
               This option is used to set the array file name.  It can be
               omitted.

           arrayfile
           arrayfilename
               These options are aliases of "array".

           If it is required to specify the array file name cleary, the
           following expression can be used.

             Example:

               $sary = new Search::Saryer( file => "foo", array => "bar" );

DESTRUCTOR
       destroy
           Destruct "Search::Saryer" object. It is automatically called by
           destructor.  It is unnecessary that this function is called
           explicitly.

METHODS
       grep ( PATTERN, [IGNORE_CASE] )
           Search for the PATTERN, and return the list of lines which include
           it.  When IGNORE_CASE is true, do case-insensitive search.

       look ( PATTERN, [START_TAG, END_TAG, IGNORE_CASE] )
           Search for the PATTERN, and return the list of regions which
           include it.  Each of them is surrounded by START_TAG and END_TAG.
           When IGNORE_CASE is true, do case-insensitive search.

LOW LEVEL APIS
       enable_cache
           Enable the cache engine. Cache the search results and reuse them
           for the same pattern later.

       search ( PATTERN )
           Search for the PATTERN, and return true if success.

       icase_search ( PATTERN )
           Do case-insensitive search for the PATTERN, and return true if
           success.

       get_next_line
       get_next_context_lines
       get_next_tagged_region ( START_TAG, END_TAG )
           Get the next search result of search/icase_search.
