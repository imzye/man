NAME
     as86 – assembler for 8086/80386

SYNOPSIS
     as86 [-03agjuw] [-b [bin]] [-lm [list]] [-n name] [-o obj] [-s sym] src

DESCRIPTION
   Overview
     As86 is an assembler for 8086 or 80386 CPUs.  Its syntax resembles rather
     the usual 8086 assembler syntax than the AT&T-like syntax as used by the
     system's assembler as(1).

     It can also be compiled to support the Motorola 6809 CPU.  The name as86
     has only been chosen to make it distinct from the system's assembler.


   Options

     -0      (the digit 0) start with 16-bit code segment

     -3      start with 32-bit code segment

     -a      enable partial compatibility with asld

     -b      produce binary file, filename may follow (obsolete)

     -g      only put global symbols in object file

     -j      force all jumps to be long

     -l      produce list file, filename may follow

     -m      print macro expansions in listing

     -n      name of module follows (goes in object instead of source name)

     -o      produce object file, filename follows

     -s      produce symbol file, filename follows (obsolete)

     -u      take undefined symbols as imported-with-unspecified segment

     -w      don't print warnings


     The 6809 version does not support -0, -3, -a or -j.



   Defaults
     Off or none except for these; no output is produced without a flag:


     -0 | -3  native, i. e. 80386

     list     stdout (beware of clobbering next arg)

     name     basename of the source name

BUGS
     The -u and -w options are perhaps back to front because they are needed
     for cc1 output and Minix's make does the wrong thing with .s files left
     around.  However, all assembler code not written by compilers should
     assemble with them turned off.
