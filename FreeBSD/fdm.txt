FDM(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 FDM(1)

NAME
     fdm – fetch and deliver mail

SYNOPSIS
     fdm [-hklmnqv] [-a account] [-D name=value] [-f conffile] [-u user]
         [-x account] [fetch | poll | cache]

DESCRIPTION
     The fdm program fetches mail from a POP3 or IMAP server or from stdin and
     delivers it based on a ruleset in the configuration file.

     The options are as follows:

     -a name
             Process only the specified account.  This option may appear
             multiple times.  The account name may include shell glob
             characters to match multiple accounts.

     -D name=value
             This option defines a macro for use when parsing the
             configuration file.  The macro name must be prefixed with $ or %
             to specify a string or numeric macro.  This option may appear
             multiple times.

     -f conffile
             Specify the configuration file location.  Default is ~/.fdm.conf,
             or /usr/local/etc/fdm.conf if that doesn't exist.

     -h      Look at the HOME environment variable to ascertain the user's
             home directory.

     -k      Keep all mail after delivery, regardless of whether it matches a
             drop action.  Note that mails kept in this way will be refetched
             by fdm if it is run again on the same account.

     -l      Log using syslog(3) rather than to stderr.

     -m      Ignore the lock file and run regardless of other instances of
             fdm.

     -n      Do not process any accounts, just verify the configuration file
             syntax and exit.

     -q      Quiet mode. Only print errors.

     -u user
             Specify the default user for delivery.  This overrides the
             default-user option in the configuration file.

     -v      Request verbose logging.  This option may be specified multiple
             times.  -vv will print information on configuration (useful with
             -n).  -vvvv duplicates all traffic to and from remote servers to
             stdout.  This feature is disabled when using the -l flag.

     -x name
             Exclude the named account.  Multiple -x options may be specified.
             As with -a, shell glob characters may be used.

     fetch | poll | cache
             The fetch command instructs fdm to fetch and deliver messages.
             The poll command polls the accounts in the configuration file and
             reports a message count for each.  cache allows fdm cache files
             to be manipulated: see the next section.

CACHE COMMANDS
     The following cache manipulation commands are supported:

     cache add path string

     cache remove path string
             Add or remove string as a key in the cache at path.

     cache list [path]
             List the number of keys in the specified cache, or if path is
             omitted, in all caches declared in the configuration file.

     cache dump path
             Dump the contents of the cache path to stdout.  Each key is
             printed followed by a space and the timestamp as Unix time.

     cache clear path
             Delete all keys from the cache at path.

FILES
     ~/.fdm.conf
             default fdm configuration file
     /usr/local/etc/fdm.conf
             default system-wide configuration file
     ~/.fdm.lock
             default lock file
     /var/db/fdm.lock
             lock file for root user
