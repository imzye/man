NAME
       spflooder - Spread Performance Test Client

SYNOPSIS
       spflooder [-u connection_name] [-s spread_address] [-m num_messages]
       [-b bytes_per_message] [-ro] [-wo]

DESCRIPTION
       spflooder is a Spread client program that can flood messages and
       measure the time required to send a certain number of messages. This
       can be used to test the performance of Spread and the machines it runs
       on.  By default it trys to connect to a Spread daemon running on port
       4803 of the local machine.


OPTIONS
       -u connection_name
              The name this connection to the daemon will use to uniquely
              identify itself.

       -s spread address
              The port number, or port number and host to which the spuser
              program should connect in order to reach a Spread daemon.

       -m num messages
              The number of messages to flood.

       -b num bytes
              The size of each message to send in bytes.

       -ro    This flooder process will only receive messages sent by other
              flooders. It will not send any messages.

       -wo    This flooder process will only send messages to other flooders.
              It will not receive any messages.

BUGS
       Some limitations on message size and number of groups are hardcoded
       into spflooder.  Some changes to the code may be necessary to get
       maximum performance in large Spread configuarations.
