LIBNGATM(3)            FreeBSD Library Functions Manual            LIBNGATM(3)

NAME
     libngatm – ATM signalling library

LIBRARY
     Begemot ATM signalling library (libngatm, -lngatm)

DESCRIPTION
     The Begemot UNI signalling library handles message decoding and encoding
     as well as the Q.2110 and Q.2120 transport protocols and adaptation
     layers, and ATM-Forum UNI 4.0 compliant signalling.  Because of this
     complexity the description is broken down in several man pages:

     unimsg(3)
           Describes a data structure and functions for handling of variable
           sized messages.

     unistruct(3)
           describes data structures for the decoding, encoding and printing
           functions in the library.

     unifunc(3)
           describes the decoding, encoding and printing functions.

     uniaddr(3)
           describes address structures and handling functions.

     unisap(3)

     ATM Forum standards.
