WLAN_WEP(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            WLAN_WEP(4)

NAME
     wlan_wep – WEP crypto support for 802.11 devices

SYNOPSIS
     device wlan_wep

DESCRIPTION
     The wlan_wep module handles the WEP cryptographic requirements of the
     802.11 protocol.  It does encapsulation and decapsulation of WEP-encoded
     802.11 frames and optionally calculates the WEP cipher.  The wlan_wep
     module is an 802.11 cryptographic plugin module for use by the wlan(4)
     module.  This module is automatically loaded if a WEP key is configured
     with ifconfig(8).  Should the underlying network device not be capable of
     doing the WEP calculations in hardware, the wlan_wep module will do the
     work.

HISTORY
