NAME
       tidy - validate, correct, and pretty-print HTML files
       (version: 7 December 2008)

SYNOPSIS
       tidy [option ...] [file ...] [option ...] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Tidy reads HTML, XHTML and XML files and writes cleaned up markup.  For
       HTML variants, it detects and corrects many common coding errors and
       strives to produce visually equivalent markup that is both W3C
       compliant and works on most browsers. A common use of Tidy is to
       convert plain HTML to XHTML.  For generic XML files, Tidy is limited to
       correcting basic well-formedness errors and pretty printing.

       If no input file is specified, Tidy reads the standard input.  If no
       output file is specified, Tidy writes the tidied markup to the standard
       output.  If no error file is specified, Tidy writes messages to the
       standard error.  For command line options that expect a numerical
       argument, a default is assumed if no meaningful value can be found.

OPTIONS
   File manipulation
       -output <file>, -o <file>
              write output to the specified <file> (output-file: <file>)

       -config <file>
              set configuration options from the specified <file>


       -file <file>, -f <file>

USAGE
       Use --optionX valueX for the detailed configuration option "optionX"
       with argument "valueX".  See also below under Detailed Configuration
       Options as to how to conveniently group all such options in a single
       config file.

       Input/Output default to stdin/stdout respectively. Single letter
       options apart from -f and -o may be combined as in:

          tidy -f errs.txt -imu foo.html

       For further info on HTML see http://www.w3.org/MarkUp.

       For more information about HTML Tidy, visit the project home page at
       http://tidy.sourceforge.net.  Here, you will find links to
       documentation, mailing lists (with searchable archives) and links to
       report bugs.

ENVIRONMENT
       HTML_TIDY
              Name of the default configuration file.  This should be an
              absolute path, since you will probably invoke tidy from
              different directories.  The value of HTML_TIDY will be parsed
              after the compiled-in default (defined with -DTIDY_CONFIG_FILE),
              but before any of the files specified using -config.

EXIT STATUS
       0      All input files were processed successfully.

       1      There were warnings.

       2      There were errors.


______________________________
       DETAILED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       This section describes the Detailed (i.e., "expanded") Options, which
       may be specified by preceding each option with -- at the command line,
       followed by its desired value, OR by placing the options and values in
       a configuration file, and telling tidy to read that file with the
       -config standard option.

SYNOPSIS
       tidy --option1 value1 --option2 value2 [standard options ...]
       tidy -config config-file [standard options ...]

WARNING
       The options detailed here do not include the "standard" command-line
       options (i.e., those preceded by a single '-') described above in the
       first section of this man page.

DESCRIPTION
       A list of options for configuring the behavior of Tidy, which can be
       passed either on the command line, or specified in a configuration
       file.

       A Tidy configuration file is simply a text file, where each option is
       listed on a separate line in the form

          option1: value1
          option2: value2
          etc.

       The permissible values for a given option depend on the option's Type.
       There are five types: Boolean, AutoBool, DocType, Enum, and String.
       Boolean types allow any of yes/no, y/n, true/false, t/f, 1/0.
       AutoBools allow auto in addition to the values allowed by Booleans.
       Integer types take non-negative integers.  String types generally have
       no defaults, and you should provide them in non-quoted form (unless you
       wish the output to contain the literal quotes).

       Enum, Encoding, and DocType "types" have a fixed repertoire of items;
       consult the Example[s] provided below for the option[s] in question.

       You only need to provide options and values for those whose defaults
       you wish to override, although you may wish to include some already-
       defaulted options and values for the sake of documentation and
       explicitness.

       Here is a sample config file, with at least one example of each of the
       five Types:

           // sample Tidy configuration options
           output-xhtml: yes
           add-xml-decl: no
           doctype: strict
           char-encoding: ascii
           indent: auto
           wrap: 76
           repeated-attributes: keep-last
           error-file: errs.txt

       Below is a summary and brief description of each of the options. They
       are listed alphabetically within each category.  There are five
       categories: HTML, XHTML, XML options, Diagnostics options, Pretty Print
       options, Character Encoding options, and Miscellaneous options.

OPTIONS
   HTML, XHTML, XML options:
       add-xml-decl

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should add the XML declaration
              when outputting XML or XHTML. Note that if the input already
              includes an <?xml ... ?> declaration then this option will be
              ignored. If the encoding for the output is different from
              "ascii", one of the utf encodings or "raw", the declaration is
              always added as required by the XML standard.


                                      See also: char-encoding, output-encoding

       add-xml-space

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should add xml:space="preserve" to
              elements such as <PRE>, <STYLE> and <SCRIPT> when generating
              XML. This is needed if the whitespace in such elements is to be
              parsed appropriately without having access to the DTD.

       alt-text

              Type:    String
              Default: -
              Default: -

              This option specifies the default "alt=" text Tidy uses for
              <IMG> attributes. This feature is dangerous as it suppresses
              further accessibility warnings. You are responsible for making
              your documents accessible to people who can not see the images!

       anchor-as-name

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option controls the deletion or addition of the name
              attribute in elements where it can serve as anchor. If set to
              "yes", a name attribute, if not already existing, is added along
              an existing id attribute if the DTD allows it. If set to "no",
              any existing name attribute is removed if an id attribute exists
              or has been added.

       assume-xml-procins

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should change the parsing of
              processing instructions to require ?> as the terminator rather
              than >. This option is automatically set if the input is in XML.

       bare

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should strip Microsoft specific
              HTML from Word 2000 documents, and output spaces rather than
              non-breaking spaces where they exist in the input.

       clean

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should strip out surplus
              presentational tags and attributes replacing them by style rules
              and structural markup as appropriate. It works well on the HTML
              saved by Microsoft Office products.


                                                      See also: drop-font-tags

       css-prefix

              Type:    String
              Default: -
              Default: -

              This option specifies the prefix that Tidy uses for styles
              rules. By default, "c" will be used.

       decorate-inferred-ul

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should decorate inferred UL
              elements with some CSS markup to avoid indentation to the right.

       doctype

              Type:    DocType
              Default: auto
              Example: omit, auto, strict, transitional, user

              This option specifies the DOCTYPE declaration generated by Tidy.
              If set to "omit" the output won't contain a DOCTYPE declaration.
              If set to "auto" (the default) Tidy will use an educated guess
              based upon the contents of the document. If set to "strict",
              Tidy will set the DOCTYPE to the strict DTD. If set to "loose",
              the DOCTYPE is set to the loose (transitional) DTD.
              Alternatively, you can supply a string for the formal public
              identifier (FPI).

              For example:
              doctype: "-//ACME//DTD HTML 3.14159//EN"

              If you specify the FPI for an XHTML document, Tidy will set the
              system identifier to an empty string. For an HTML document, Tidy
              adds a system identifier only if one was already present in
              order to preserve the processing mode of some browsers. Tidy
              leaves the DOCTYPE for generic XML documents unchanged.
              --doctype omit implies --numeric-entities yes. This option does
              not offer a validation of the document conformance.

       drop-empty-paras

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should discard empty paragraphs.

       drop-font-tags

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should discard <FONT> and <CENTER>
              tags without creating the corresponding style rules. This option
              can be set independently of the clean option.


                                                               See also: clean

       drop-proprietary-attributes

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should strip out proprietary
              attributes, such as MS data binding attributes.

       enclose-block-text

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should insert a <P> element to
              enclose any text it finds in any element that allows mixed
              content for HTML transitional but not HTML strict.

       enclose-text

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should enclose any text it finds
              in the body element within a <P> element. This is useful when
              you want to take existing HTML and use it with a style sheet.

       escape-cdata

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should convert <![CDATA[]]>
              sections to normal text.

       fix-backslash

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should replace backslash
              characters "\" in URLs by forward slashes "/".

       fix-bad-comments

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should replace unexpected hyphens
              with "=" characters when it comes across adjacent hyphens. The
              default is yes. This option is provided for users of Cold Fusion
              which uses the comment syntax: <!--- --->

       fix-uri

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should check attribute values that
              carry URIs for illegal characters and if such are found, escape
              them as HTML 4 recommends.

       hide-comments

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should print out comments.

       hide-endtags

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should omit optional end-tags when
              generating the pretty printed markup. This option is ignored if
              you are outputting to XML.

       indent-cdata

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should indent <![CDATA[]]>
              sections.

       input-xml

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should use the XML parser rather
              than the error correcting HTML parser.

       join-classes

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should combine class names to
              generate a single new class name, if multiple class assignments
              are detected on an element.


                                    See also: join-styles, repeated-attributes

       join-styles

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should combine styles to generate
              a single new style, if multiple style values are detected on an
              element.


                                   See also: join-classes, repeated-attributes

       literal-attributes

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should ensure that whitespace
              characters within attribute values are passed through unchanged.

       logical-emphasis

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should replace any occurrence of
              <I> by <EM> and any occurrence of <B> by <STRONG>. In both
              cases, the attributes are preserved unchanged. This option can
              be set independently of the clean and drop-font-tags options.

       lower-literals

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should convert the value of an
              attribute that takes a list of predefined values to lower case.
              This is required for XHTML documents.

       merge-divs

              Type:    AutoBool
              Default: auto
              Example: auto, y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              Can be used to modify behavior of -c (--clean yes) option. This
              option specifies if Tidy should merge nested <div> such as
              "<div><div>...</div></div>". If set to "auto", the attributes of
              the inner <div> are moved to the outer one. As well, nested
              <div> with ID attributes are not merged. If set to "yes", the
              attributes of the inner <div> are discarded with the exception
              of "class" and "style".


                                                  See also: clean, merge-spans

       merge-spans

              Type:    AutoBool
              Default: auto
              Example: auto, y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              Can be used to modify behavior of -c (--clean yes) option. This
              option specifies if Tidy should merge nested <span> such as
              "<span><span>...</span></span>". The algorithm is identical to
              the one used by --merge-divs.

       ncr

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should allow numeric character
              references.

       new-blocklevel-tags

              Type:    Tag names
              Default: -
              Example: tagX, tagY, ...

              This option specifies new block-level tags. This option takes a
              space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless you declare
              new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the
              input includes previously unknown tags. Note you can't change
              the content model for elements such as <TABLE>, <UL>, <OL> and
              <DL>. This option is ignored in XML mode.


                       See also: new-empty-tags, new-inline-tags, new-pre-tags

       new-empty-tags

              Type:    Tag names
              Default: -
              Example: tagX, tagY, ...

              This option specifies new empty inline tags. This option takes a
              space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless you declare
              new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the
              input includes previously unknown tags. Remember to also declare
              empty tags as either inline or blocklevel. This option is
              ignored in XML mode.


                  See also: new-blocklevel-tags, new-inline-tags, new-pre-tags

       new-inline-tags

              Type:    Tag names
              Default: -
              Example: tagX, tagY, ...

              This option specifies new non-empty inline tags. This option
              takes a space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless you
              declare new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if
              the input includes previously unknown tags. This option is
              ignored in XML mode.


                   See also: new-blocklevel-tags, new-empty-tags, new-pre-tags

       new-pre-tags

              Type:    Tag names
              Default: -
              Example: tagX, tagY, ...

              This option specifies new tags that are to be processed in
              exactly the same way as HTML's <PRE> element. This option takes
              a space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless you declare
              new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the
              input includes previously unknown tags. Note you can not as yet
              add new CDATA elements (similar to <SCRIPT>). This option is
              ignored in XML mode.

       numeric-entities

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should output entities other than
              the built-in HTML entities (&amp;, &lt;, &gt; and &quot;) in the
              numeric rather than the named entity form. Only entities
              compatible with the DOCTYPE declaration generated are used.
              Entities that can be represented in the output encoding are
              translated correspondingly.


                                          See also: doctype, preserve-entities

       output-html

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should generate pretty printed
              output, writing it as HTML.

       output-xhtml

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should generate pretty printed
              output, writing it as extensible HTML. This option causes Tidy
              to set the DOCTYPE and default namespace as appropriate to
              XHTML. If a DOCTYPE or namespace is given they will checked for
              consistency with the content of the document. In the case of an
              inconsistency, the corrected values will appear in the output.
              For XHTML, entities can be written as named or numeric entities
              according to the setting of the "numeric-entities" option. The
              original case of tags and attributes will be preserved,
              regardless of other options.

       output-xml

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should pretty print output,
              writing it as well-formed XML. Any entities not defined in XML
              1.0 will be written as numeric entities to allow them to be
              parsed by a XML parser. The original case of tags and attributes
              will be preserved, regardless of other options.

       preserve-entities

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should preserve the well-formed
              entitites as found in the input.

       quote-ampersand

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should output unadorned &
              characters as &amp;.

       quote-marks

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should output " characters as
              &quot; as is preferred by some editing environments. The
              apostrophe character ' is written out as &#39; since many web
              browsers don't yet support &apos;.

       quote-nbsp

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should output non-breaking space
              characters as entities, rather than as the Unicode character
              value 160 (decimal).

       repeated-attributes

              Type:    enum
              Default: keep-last
              Example: keep-first, keep-last

              This option specifies if Tidy should keep the first or last
              attribute, if an attribute is repeated, e.g. has two align
              attributes.


                                           See also: join-classes, join-styles

       replace-color

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should replace numeric values in
              color attributes by HTML/XHTML color names where defined, e.g.
              replace "#ffffff" with "white".

       show-body-only

              Type:    AutoBool
              Default: no
              Example: auto, y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should print only the contents of
              the body tag as an HTML fragment. If set to "auto", this is
              performed only if the body tag has been inferred. Useful for
              incorporating existing whole pages as a portion of another page.
              This option has no effect if XML output is requested.

       uppercase-attributes

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should output attribute names in
              upper case. The default is no, which results in lower case
              attribute names, except for XML input, where the original case
              is preserved.

       uppercase-tags

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should output tag names in upper
              case. The default is no, which results in lower case tag names,
              except for XML input, where the original case is preserved.

       word-2000

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should go to great pains to strip
              out all the surplus stuff Microsoft Word 2000 inserts when you
              save Word documents as "Web pages". Doesn't handle embedded
              images or VML. You should consider using Word's "Save As: Web
              Page, Filtered".

   Diagnostics options:
       accessibility-check

              Type:    enum
              Default: 0 (Tidy Classic)
              Example: 0 (Tidy Classic), 1 (Priority 1 Checks), 2 (Priority 2
              Checks), 3 (Priority 3 Checks)

              This option specifies what level of accessibility checking, if
              any, that Tidy should do. Level 0 is equivalent to Tidy
              Classic's accessibility checking. For more information on Tidy's
              accessibility checking, visit the Adaptive Technology Resource
              Centre at the University of Toronto at
              http://www.aprompt.ca/Tidy/accessibilitychecks.html.

       show-errors

              Type:    Integer
              Default: 6
              Example: 0, 1, 2, ...

              This option specifies the number Tidy uses to determine if
              further errors should be shown. If set to 0, then no errors are
              shown.

       show-warnings

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should suppress warnings. This can
              be useful when a few errors are hidden in a flurry of warnings.

   Pretty Print options:
       break-before-br

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should output a line break before
              each <BR> element.

       indent

              Type:    AutoBool
              Default: no
              Example: auto, y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should indent block-level tags. If
              set to "auto", this option causes Tidy to decide whether or not
              to indent the content of tags such as TITLE, H1-H6, LI, TD, TD,
              or P depending on whether or not the content includes a block-
              level element. You are advised to avoid setting indent to yes as
              this can expose layout bugs in some browsers.


                                                       See also: indent-spaces

       indent-attributes

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should begin each attribute on a
              new line.

       indent-spaces

              Type:    Integer
              Default: 2
              Example: 0, 1, 2, ...

              This option specifies the number of spaces Tidy uses to indent
              content, when indentation is enabled.


                                                              See also: indent

       markup

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should generate a pretty printed
              version of the markup. Note that Tidy won't generate a pretty
              printed version if it finds significant errors (see force-
              output).

       punctuation-wrap

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap after some
              Unicode or Chinese punctuation characters.

       sort-attributes

              Type:    enum
              Default: none
              Example: none, alpha

              This option specifies that tidy should sort attributes within an
              element using the specified sort algorithm. If set to "alpha",
              the algorithm is an ascending alphabetic sort.

       split

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              Currently not used. Tidy Classic only.

       tab-size

              Type:    Integer
              Default: 8
              Example: 0, 1, 2, ...

              This option specifies the number of columns that Tidy uses
              between successive tab stops. It is used to map tabs to spaces
              when reading the input. Tidy never outputs tabs.

       vertical-space

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should add some empty lines for
              readability.

       wrap

              Type:    Integer
              Default: 68
              Example: 0 (no wrapping), 1, 2, ...

              This option specifies the right margin Tidy uses for line
              wrapping. Tidy tries to wrap lines so that they do not exceed
              this length. Set wrap to zero if you want to disable line
              wrapping.

       wrap-asp

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap text contained
              within ASP pseudo elements, which look like: <% ... %>.

       wrap-attributes

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap attribute values,
              for easier editing. This option can be set independently of
              wrap-script-literals.


                                                See also: wrap-script-literals

       wrap-jste

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap text contained
              within JSTE pseudo elements, which look like: <# ... #>.

       wrap-php

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap text contained
              within PHP pseudo elements, which look like: <?php ... ?>.

       wrap-script-literals

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap string literals
              that appear in script attributes. Tidy wraps long script string
              literals by inserting a backslash character before the line
              break.


                                                     See also: wrap-attributes

       wrap-sections

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should line wrap text contained
              within <![ ... ]> section tags.

   Character Encoding options:
       ascii-chars

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              Can be used to modify behavior of -c (--clean yes) option. If
              set to "yes" when using -c, &emdash;, &rdquo;, and other named
              character entities are downgraded to their closest ascii
              equivalents.

       char-encoding

              Type:    Encoding
              Default: ascii
              Example: raw, ascii, latin0, latin1, utf8, iso2022, mac,
              win1252, ibm858, utf16le, utf16be, utf16, big5, shiftjis

              This option specifies the character encoding Tidy uses for both
              the input and output. For ascii, Tidy will accept Latin-1
              (ISO-8859-1) character values, but will use entities for all
              characters whose value > 127. For raw, Tidy will output values
              above 127 without translating them into entities. For latin1,
              characters above 255 will be written as entities. For utf8, Tidy
              assumes that both input and output is encoded as UTF-8. You can
              use iso2022 for files encoded using the ISO-2022 family of
              encodings e.g. ISO-2022-JP. For mac and win1252, Tidy will
              accept vendor specific character values, but will use entities
              for all characters whose value > 127. For unsupported encodings,
              use an external utility to convert to and from UTF-8.

       input-encoding

              Type:    Encoding
              Default: latin1
              Example: raw, ascii, latin0, latin1, utf8, iso2022, mac,
              win1252, ibm858, utf16le, utf16be, utf16, big5, shiftjis

              This option specifies the character encoding Tidy uses for the
              input. See char-encoding for more info.


                                                       See also: char-encoding

       language

              Type:    String
              Default: -
              Default: -

              Currently not used, but this option specifies the language Tidy
              uses (for instance "en").

       newline

              Type:    enum
              Default: Platform dependent
              Example: LF, CRLF, CR

              The default is appropriate to the current platform: CRLF on PC-
              DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2, CR on Classic Mac OS, and LF
              everywhere else (Unix and Linux).

       output-bom

              Type:    AutoBool
              Default: auto
              Example: auto, y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should write a Unicode Byte Order
              Mark character (BOM; also known as Zero Width No-Break Space;
              has value of U+FEFF) to the beginning of the output; only for
              UTF-8 and UTF-16 output encodings. If set to "auto", this option
              causes Tidy to write a BOM to the output only if a BOM was
              present at the beginning of the input. A BOM is always written
              for XML/XHTML output using UTF-16 output encodings.

       output-encoding

              Type:    Encoding
              Default: ascii
              Example: raw, ascii, latin0, latin1, utf8, iso2022, mac,
              win1252, ibm858, utf16le, utf16be, utf16, big5, shiftjis

              This option specifies the character encoding Tidy uses for the
              output. See char-encoding for more info. May only be different
              from input-encoding for Latin encodings (ascii, latin0, latin1,
              mac, win1252, ibm858).


                                                       See also: char-encoding

   Miscellaneous options:
       error-file

              Type:    String
              Default: -
              Default: -

              This option specifies the error file Tidy uses for errors and
              warnings. Normally errors and warnings are output to "stderr".


                                                         See also: output-file

       force-output

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should produce output even if
              errors are encountered. Use this option with care - if Tidy
              reports an error, this means Tidy was not able to, or is not
              sure how to, fix the error, so the resulting output may not
              reflect your intention.

       gnu-emacs

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should change the format for
              reporting errors and warnings to a format that is more easily
              parsed by GNU Emacs.

       gnu-emacs-file

              Type:    String
              Default: -
              Default: -

              Used internally.

       keep-time

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should keep the original
              modification time of files that Tidy modifies in place. The
              default is no. Setting the option to yes allows you to tidy
              files without causing these files to be uploaded to a web server
              when using a tool such as SiteCopy. Note this feature is not
              supported on some platforms.

       output-file

              Type:    String
              Default: -
              Default: -

              This option specifies the output file Tidy uses for markup.
              Normally markup is written to "stdout".


                                                          See also: error-file

       quiet

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should output the summary of the
              numbers of errors and warnings, or the welcome or informational
              messages.

       slide-style

              Type:    String
              Default: -
              Default: -

              Currently not used. Tidy Classic only.

       tidy-mark

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: yes
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should add a meta element to the
              document head to indicate that the document has been tidied.
              Tidy won't add a meta element if one is already present.

       write-back

              Type:    Boolean
              Default: no
              Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0

              This option specifies if Tidy should write back the tidied
              markup to the same file it read from. You are advised to keep
              copies of important files before tidying them, as on rare
              occasions the result may not be what you expect.
