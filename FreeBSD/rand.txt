RAND(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                RAND(1)

NAME
     rand – randomize the order of a stream

SYNOPSIS
     rand [-lwvh] [-f <input file>] [-o <output file>] [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
     rand has 2 major modes of operation.  The first is as a pipe.  The second
     is to act on a specified file.  There are 2 minor modes of operation, the
     data can be randomized by line or word.

     As a pipe, rand collects the stream until it terminates, then displays
     the randomized results of this completed stream.  If the stream is the
     result of several operations, then the stream as a whole is randomized.

     When operating on a file, rand will read the input from a single given
     file, and display the results to stdout.

     The two command line parameters control if the randomization is per line
     or word.  The default behavior is to randomize by line.  rand will
     randomize by word, and return one word on every line.  A word in this
     sense is any string delimited by a whitespace.  Tabs, spaces, and
     newlines are ignored.

OPTIONS
     [-l]
       Line shuffle

     [-w]
       Word shuffle

     [-c]
       Character shuffle

     [-v, --version]
       Show version and exit.

     [-h, --help]
       Show help and exit.

     [-f <file>]
       Read from <file> instead of stdin.

     [-<file>]
       Write to <file> instead of stdout.

EXAMPLES
     play `find -name *.wav | rand `
     rand -w -f COPYING -o whatever
     rand -l -f history.test -o test.1
     /bin/ls | rand -w

DIAGNOSTICS
     rand returns EXIT_SUCCESS on success or EXIT_FAILURE on failure.  The
     only cases where EXIT_FAILURE may be returned are

     •   -f file can not be read.

     •   -o file cannot be written to.

     •   An unknown option is presented (in which case, usage is also printed)

SEE ALSO
     sort(1), rand(3)

HISTORY
     rand was created in October of 1998 when Erik Greenwald got tired of
     hacking things to shuffle stuff.
