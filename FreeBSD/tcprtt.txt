TCPRTT(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              TCPRTT(8)

NAME
     tcprtt – measure TCP handshake RTT using the stats(3) framework

SYNOPSIS
     tcprtt [-f] host port

DESCRIPTION
     The tcprtt utility reliably measures the TCP handshake round trip time
     using the stats(3) statistics framework.

     Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.  If the host argument is a hostname
     containing several A and AAAA records, one line per record will be
     printed.

     The options are as follows:

     -f      Stop after the first address of each family

     For each address measured, a line is printed with 3 columns: address
     family (4 or 6), the numerical address and the measured RTT in
     milliseconds.

     When an error occurs for one of the measurement, the -errno(2) is printed
     in place of the RTT.

     If at least one entry returns an error, the command exits with the value
     of the last encountered error.
