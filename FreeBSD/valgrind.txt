CALLGRIND ANNOTATE(1)         callgrind_annotate         CALLGRIND ANNOTATE(1)

NAME
       callgrind_annotate - post-processing tool for the Callgrind

SYNOPSIS
       callgrind_annotate [options] [callgrind-out-file [source-files...]]

DESCRIPTION
       callgrind_annotate takes an output file produced by the Valgrind tool
       Callgrind and prints the information in an easy-to-read form.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
           Show summary of options.

       --version
           Show version of callgrind_annotate.

       --show=A,B,C [default: all]
           Only show figures for events A,B,C.

       --threshold=<0--100> [default: 99%]
           Percentage of counts (of primary sort event) we are interested in.

           callgrind_annotate stops printing functions when the sum of the
           cost percentage of the printed functions is bigger or equal to the
           given threshold percentage.

       --sort=A,B,C
           Sort columns by events A,B,C [event column order].

           Optionally, each event is followed by a : and a threshold, to
           specify different thresholds depending on the event.

           callgrind_annotate stops printing functions when the sum of the
           cost percentage of the printed functions for all the events is
           bigger or equal to the given event threshold percentages.

           When one or more thresholds are given via this option, the value of
           --threshold is ignored.

       --show-percs=<no|yes> [default: no]
           When enabled, a percentage is printed next to all event counts.
           This helps gauge the relative importance of each function and line.

       --auto=<yes|no> [default: yes]
           Annotate all source files containing functions that helped reach
           the event count threshold.

       --context=N [default: 8]
           Print N lines of context before and after annotated lines.

       --inclusive=<yes|no> [default: no]
           Add subroutine costs to functions calls.

       --tree=<none|caller|calling|both> [default: none]
           Print for each function their callers, the called functions or
           both.

       -I, --include=<dir>
           Add dir to the list of directories to search for source files.
