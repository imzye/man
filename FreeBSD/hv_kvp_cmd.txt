NAME
     hv_kvp_cmd – manipulates with Hyper-V KVP records

SYNOPSIS
     hv_kvp_cmd [-vq1wr] [-d char] [key value | keys]

DESCRIPTION
     Hyper-V provides a mechanism for exchanging data between a host and a
     virtual machine. Data is presented as key-value pairs (KVP).  hv_kvp_cmd
     utility allows you to read KVP records from any pools, write to the guest
     pool and delete from the guest pool.

     By default, hv_kvp_cmd read all or listed keys from all pools.

     The options are as follows:

     -v      Verbose mode.

     -q      Quote keys and values.

     -1      Read the KVP and print the keyless value.

     -w      Writes pairs key value to a guest pool. There may be several
             pairs.

     -r      Removes the listed keys from the guest pool.

     -d char
             Uses char as the delimiter between key and his value instead of
             the equal character.

EXIT STATUS
     The hv_kvp_cmd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Reads all keys from all pools.

           hv_kvp_cmd

     Reads KVP with keys is the “VirtualMachineName”,
     “PhysicalHostNameFullyQualified”.

           hv_kvp_cmd VirtualMachineName PhysicalHostNameFullyQualified

     Reads KVP with key is the “VirtualMachineName” and output this value to
     the stdout.

           hv_kvp_cmd -1 VirtualMachineName

     Writes KVP with the UUID of the virtual machine with the
     “UUID_VM_from_OS” key in the guest pool.

           hv_kvp_cmd -w UUID_VM_from_OS `cat /etc/hostid`

     Removes key “UUID_VM_from_OS” from the guest pool.

           hv_kvp_cmd -r UUID_VM_from_OS
