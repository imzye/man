NAME
       ircat - print strings when pressing buttons

SYNOPSIS
       ircat [options] <prog>

DESCRIPTION
       This program prints config strings to standard output. It can be used
       to provide remote control input to scripts and to debug your .lircrc
       file.

       The argument to the program is the program name, as it appears in the
       prog entries in .lircrc.

       -v --version
              display version

       -c --config=<file>
              set config file

EXAMPLES
       If .lircrc contains:

       begin
            prog = myprog
            button = tv_p+
            config = next_file
       end

       then

       $ ircat myprog

       will print "next_file" (followed by newline) every time the button
       tv_p+ is pressed.
