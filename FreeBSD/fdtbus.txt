FDTBUS(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              FDTBUS(4)

NAME
     fdtbus – Flattened Device Tree bus driver

SYNOPSIS
     options FDT

DESCRIPTION
     The fdtbus abstract bus driver is the primary connection and translation
     layer between fdt(4) hardware resources description and FreeBSD native
     newbus device drivers framework.  For an embedded system fdtbus
     represents peripherals typically found on a highly integrated chip
     (system-on-chip).

     The fdtbus driver provides generic, common infrastructure for all fdt(4)
     oriented device drivers, and its main responsibilities are the following:

     •   Creating newbus children that reflect fdt(4) nodes in the flattened
         device tree.

     •   Managing SYS_RES_IRQ resources.

     •   Managing SYS_RES_MEMORY, SYS_RES_IOPORT resources.
