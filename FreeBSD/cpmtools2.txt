NAME
       cpmls - list sorted contents of directory

SYNOPSIS
       cpmls [-f format] [-T libdsk-type] [-d|-D|-F|-A|-l[-c][-i]] [-u] image
       [file-pattern...]

DESCRIPTION
       Cpmls lists the sorted contents of the directory.

OPTIONS
       -f format
              Use the given CP/M disk format instead of the default format.

       -T libdsk-type
              libdsk driver type, e.g. tele for Teledisk images or raw for raw
              images (requires building cpmtools with support for libdsk).

       -d     Old CP/M 2.2 dir output.

       -D     P2DOS 2.3 ddir-like output.

       -F     CP/M 3.x dir output. CP/M 3 DIR does not count the time stamp
              directory entries not referenced by files and the disc label
              directory entry as used, resulting in a higher number of free
              entries that really are not free.  cpmls counts everything as
              used that is not available for files, no matter if it is
              actually used or just reserved.  The total bytes are the sum of
              all used blocks, whereas total 1k blocks are the sum of 1k
              blocks needed if that was used as block size.

       -A     E2fs lsattr-like output.

       -l     Long UNIX-style directory listing including size, time stamp and
              user number.

       -c     Output the creation time, not the modification time.

       -i     Print index number of each file.

       -u     Show all CP/M file names in upper case.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, exit code 0 is returned.

ERRORS
       Any errors are indicated by exit code 1.

ENVIRONMENT
       CPMTOOLSFMT     Default format

FILES
       /usr/local/share/cpmtools2/diskdefs     CP/M disk format definitions
