NAME
       XML::Elemental - simplistic and perlish handling of XML data.

SYNOPSIS
        use XML::Elemental;
        my $p = XML::Elemental->parser;
        my $xml = '<foo>There is a <helloworld/> in my soup.</foo>';
        my $tree = $p->parse_string($xml);

DESCRIPTION
       XML::Elemental is a SAX-based package for easily parsing XML documents
       into a more native and mostly object-oriented perl form.

       The development of this package grew out of the desire for something
       more object-oriented then XML::Simple and was more simplistic and
       perlish then the various standard XML API modules such as XML::DOM.
       Easier installation of modules was also a contributing factor.

       Original this package began as a style plugin to XML::Parser. That
       proved to be too limiting that it was expanded. With the release of
       version 2.0 the package was refactored to take advantage of any parser
       supporting SAX that includes the pure perl option that ships with
       XML::SAX.

METHODS
       MT::Elemental->parser([\%options])
           Instantiates and returns a SAX2 parser using
           XML::Elemental::SAXHandler as its handler and thereby inherits all
           the methods found in XML::SAX::Base.

           The parser method can optionally take a hash reference containing
           SAX options. The hash reference can also include document, element
           and character class names to use during processing. The following
           keys and their defaults are used:

               KEY         DEFAULT
               Document    XML::Elemental::Document
               Element     XML::Elemental::Element
               Characters  XML::Elemental::Characters

           Any class that supports the same method signatures as the
           XML::Elemental default classes can be used.
