GTI(6)                       FreeBSD Games Manual                       GTI(6)



NAME
       gti - Humorous typo-based git runner; drives a car over the terminal.


DESCRIPTION
       gti is intended to catch accidental typos of 'gti' instead of 'git'. It
       displays an animation of a car driving by, and then launches git. Any
       parameters or arguments given to gti will be passed through to git.

       The car image is derived from the look of an old VW Golf GTI.


ENVIRONMENT
       GIT    gti respects the $GIT environment variable. If GIT is set, its
              value will be used to launch git after the animation finishes,
              instead of searching for git in your PATH.

       GTI_SPEED
              If $GTI_SPEED is set to a parsable integer, its value is used to
              control the speed of the animation.
