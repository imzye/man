NAME
       Class::Inner - A perlish implementation of Java like inner classes

SYNOPSIS
           use Class::Inner;

           my $object = Class::Inner->new(
               parent => 'ParentClass',
               methods => { method => sub { ... } }, },
               constructor => 'new',
               args => [@constructor_args],
           );

DESCRIPTION
       Yet another implementation of an anonymous class with per object
       overrideable methods, but with the added attraction of sort of working
       dispatch to the parent class's method.

   METHODS
       new HASH
           Takes a hash like argument list with the following keys.

           parent
               The name of the parent class. Note that you can only get single
               inheritance with this or SUPER won't work.

           methods
               A hash, keys are method names, values are CODEREFs.

           constructor
               The name of the constructor method. Defaults to 'new'.

           args
               An anonymous array of arguments to pass to the constructor.
               Defaults to an empty list.

           Returns an object in an 'anonymous' class which inherits from the
           parent class. This anonymous class has a couple of 'extra' methods:

           SUPER
               If you were to pass something like

                   $obj = Class::Inner->new(
                       parent  => 'Parent',
                       methods => { method =>  sub { ...; $self->SUPER::method(@_) } },
                   );

               then "$self-"gt"SUPER::method" almost certainly wouldn't do
               what you expect, so we provide the "SUPER" method which
               dispatches to the parent implementation of the current method.
               There seems to be no good way of getting the full "SUPER::"
               functionality, but I'm working on it.

           DESTROY
               Because Class::Inner works by creating a whole new class name
               for your object, it could potentially leak memory if you create
               a lot of them. So we add a "DESTROY" method that removes the
               class from the symbol table once it's finished with.

               If you need to override a parent's DESTROY method, adding a
               call to "Class::Inner::clean_symbol_table(ref $self)" to it. Do
               it at the end of the method or your other method calls won't
               work.

       clean_symbol_table
           The helper subroutine that DESTROY uses to remove the class from
           the symbol table.

       new_classname
           Returns a name for the next anonymous class.

       Thanks to the Iterative Software people: Leon Brocard, Natalie Ford and
       Dave Cross. Also, this module was written initially for use in the
       PerlUnit project, AKA Test::Unit. Kudos to Christian Lemburg and the
       rest of that team.

SEE ALSO
       There are a million and one differen Class constructors available on
       CPAN, none of them does quite what I want, so I wrote this one to add
       to that population where hopefully it will live and thrive.

BUGS
       Bound to be some. Actually the "SUPER" method is a workaround for what
       I consider to be a bug in perl.
