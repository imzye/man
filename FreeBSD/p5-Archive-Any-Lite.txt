Archive::Any::Lite(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Archive::Any::Lite - simple CPAN package extractor

SYNOPSIS
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Archive::Any::Lite;

           local $Archive::Any::Lite::IGNORE_SYMLINK = 1; # for safety

           my $tarball = 'foo.tar.gz';
           my $archive = Archive::Any::Lite->new($tarball);
           $archive->extract('into/some/directory/');

DESCRIPTION
       This is a fork of Archive::Any by Michael Schwern and Clint Moore. The
       main difference is this works properly even when you fork(), and may
       require less memory to extract a tarball. On the other hand, this isn't
       pluggable (this only supports file formats used in the CPAN
       toolchains), and this doesn't check mime types (at least as of this
       writing).

METHODS
   new
         my $archive = Archive::Any::Lite->new($archive_file);
         my $archive = Archive::Any::Lite->new($archive_file, {tar_filter => qr/foo/});

       Creates an object.  You can pass an optional hash reference for finer
       control.

   extract
         $archive->extract;
         $archive->extract($directory);
         $archive->extract($directory, {tar_filter => qr/foo/});

       Extracts the files in the archive to the given $directory. If no
       $directory is given, it will go into the current working directory.

       You can pass an optional hash reference for finer control. If passed,
       options passed in "new" will be ignored.

   files
         my @file = $archive->files;

       A list of files in the archive.

   is_impolite
         my $is_impolite = $archive->is_impolite;

       Checks to see if this archive is going to unpack into the current
       directory rather than create its own.

   is_naughty
         my $is_naughty = $archive->is_naughty;

       Checks to see if this archive is going to unpack outside the current
       directory.

   type
       Deprecated. For backward compatibility only.

GLOBAL VARIABLE
   $IGNORE_SYMLINK
       If set to true, symlinks (and hardlinks for tarball) will be ignored.
