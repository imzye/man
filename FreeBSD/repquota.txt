REPQUOTA(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            REPQUOTA(8)

NAME
     repquota – summarize quotas for a file system

SYNOPSIS
     repquota [-h] [-g] [-n] [-u] [-v] filesystem ...
     repquota [-h] [-g] [-n] [-u] [-v] -a

DESCRIPTION
     The repquota utility prints a summary of the disk usage and quotas for
     the specified file systems.

     Available options:

     -a      Print the quotas of all the file systems listed in /etc/fstab.

     -g      Print only group quotas (the default is to print both group and
             user quotas if they exist).

     -h      Display information in a more human readable format rather than
             in historic kilobyte format.

     -n      Display user and group IDs numerically rather than converting to
             a user or group name.

     -u      Print only user quotas (the default is to print both group and
             user quotas if they exist).

     -v      Print a header line before printing each file system quotas.

     For each user or group, the current number files and amount of space is
     printed, along with any quotas created with edquota(8).

     Only members of the operator group or the super-user may use this
     command.

FILES
     quota.user   at the file system root with user quotas
     quota.group  at the file system root with group quotas
     /etc/fstab   for file system names and locations

DIAGNOSTICS
     Various messages about inaccessible files; self-explanatory.
