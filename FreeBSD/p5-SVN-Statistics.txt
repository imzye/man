ABSTRACT
       SVN::Statistics - perl module to create subversion statistics

PREREQUISITS

SYNOPSIS
       Sample Script (please also have a look into the samples directory):

          use SVN::Statistics;

DESCRIPTION
       SVN::Statistics - perl module to create subversion statistics.

       I found a product (fisheye http://www.cenqua.com/fisheye/), which has
       most of the features I was looking for; because of this and a lack of
       time to work on this I have decided not to continue with the project.
       If you would like to take over, please let me know and I will give full
       repository access.

EXPORT
       none
