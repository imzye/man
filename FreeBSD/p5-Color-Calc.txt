DESCRIPTION
       The "Color::Calc" module implements simple calculations with RGB
       colors. This can be used to create a full color scheme from a few
       colors.

   USAGE
       Constructors

       Color::Calc->new( ... )
           This class method creates a new "Color::Calc" object.

             use Color::Calc();
             my $cc = new Color::Calc( 'ColorScheme' => 'X', OutputFormat => 'HTML' );
             print $cc->invert( 'white' );

           It accepts the following parameters:

           ColorScheme
               One of the color schemes accepted by "Graphics::ColorNames",
               which is used to interpret color names on input. Valid values
               include "X" (color names used in X-Windows) and "HTML" (color
               names defined in the HTML 4.0 specification). For a full list
               of possible values, please refer to the documentation of of
               "Graphics::ColorNames".

               Unlike "Graphics::ColorNames", barewords are always interpreted
               as a module name under "Graphics::ColorNames". If you really
               want to use a filename like "foo", you have to write it as
               "./foo".

               Default: "X" (Note: This is incompatible with HTML color
               names).

           OutputFormat
               One of the output formats defined by this module. Possible
               values are:

               tuple
                   Returns a list of three values in the range 0..255. The
                   first value is guaranteed to have a "length" that is not a
                   multiple of three.

               hex Returns a hexadecimal RGB value as a scalar that contains a
                   string in the format RRGGBB and a number representing the
                   hexadecimal number 0xRRGGBB.

               html
                   Returns a string compatible with W3C's HTML and CSS
                   specifications, i.e. #RRGGBB or one of the sixteen HTML
                   color names.

               obj (DEPRECATED) Returns a "Color::Object" reference. The
                   module "Color::Object" must be installed, of course.

               object
                   Returns a "Graphics::ColorObject" reference. The module
                   "Graphics::ColorObject" must be installed, of course.

               pdf Returns a string compatible with "PDF::API2", i.e. #RRGGBB.

               __MODEvar
                   (DEPRECATED) Uses the value of $Color::Calc::MODE to select
                   one of the above output formats. You should use "local"
                   when setting this variable:

                     local $Color::Calc::MODE = 'html';

               Default: "__MODEvar" (for compatibility)

       Color::Calc->import( ... )
           This method creates a new, hidden object and binds its methods to
           the namespace of the calling module.

           This method is usually not called directly but from perl's "use"
           statement:

             use Color::Calc(
               'ColorScheme' => 'X',
               'OutputFormat' => 'HTML',
               'Prefix' => 'cc' );
             print cc_invert( 'white' );   # prints 'black'

           On import, you can specify the following parameters:

           ColorScheme
               See above.

           OutputFormat
               See above.

           Prefix
               Adds a prefix to the front of the method names. The calculation
               methods are bound to the name  prefix_method_name (the
               specified prefix, an underscore, the calculation method's
               name). Further, prefix is made an alias for prefix"_get".

               Default: "color"

           Please note that with perl's "use" and "import" statemehts,
           omitting the list and specifying an empty list has different
           meanings:

             use Color::Calc;      # import with default settings (see below)

             use Color::Calc();    # don't import anything

       Property "set"/"get" methods

       These methods are inaccessible without a object reference, i.e. when
       the functions have been "import"ed.

       $cc->set_output_format( $format)
           Changes the output format for an existing "Color::Calc" object.

       Calculation methods

       All calculation methods always accept the following formats for $color
       or $color1/$color2:

       •   An arrayref pointing to an array with three elements in the range
           0..255 corresponding to the red, green, and blue component.

       •   A list of three values in the range 0..255 corresponding to the
           red, green, and blue component where the first value does not have
           3 or a multiple of 3 digits (e.g. "('0128',128,128)").

       •   A string containing a hexadecimal RGB value like
           "#RGB"/"#RRGGBB"/"#RRRGGGBBB"/..., or
           "RGB"/"RRGGBB"/"RRRGGGBBB"/...

       •   A color name accepted by "Graphics::ColorNames". The interpretation
           is controlled by the "ColorScheme" parameter.

       •   A "Graphics::ColorObject" reference.

       The calculation methods can be either accessed through a "Color::Calc"
       object reference (here: $cc) or through the method names imported by
       "import" (here using the prefix color).

       $cc->get($color) / color($color)
           Returns $color as-is (but in the selected output format). This
           function can be used for color format conversion/normalisation.

       $cc->invert($color) / color_invert($color)
           Returns the inverse of $color.

       $cc->opposite($color) / color_opposite($color)
           Returns a color that is on the opposite side of the color wheel but
           roughly keeps the saturation and lightness.

       $cc->bw($color) / color_bw($color)
       $cc->grey($color) / color_grey($color)
       $cc->gray($color) / color_gray($color)
           Converts $color to greyscale.

       $cc->round($color, $value_count) / color_round($color, $value_count)
           Rounds each component to to the nearest number determined by
           dividing the range 0..255 into $value_count+1 portions.

           The default for $value_count is 6, yielding 6^3 = 216 colors.
           Values that are one higher than divisors of 255 yield the best
           results (e.g. 3+1, 5+1, 7+1, 9+1, 15+1, 17+1, ...).

       $cc->safe($color) / color_safe($color)
           Rounds each color component to a multiple of 0x33 (dec. 51) or to a
           named color defined in the HTML 4.01 specification.

           Historically, these colors have been known as web-safe colors. They
           still provide a convenient color palette.

       $cc->mix($color1, $color2 [, $alpha]) / color_mix($color1, $color2 [,
       $alpha])
           Returns a color that is the mixture of $color1 and $color2.

           The optional $alpha parameter can be a value between 0.0 (use
           $color1 only) and 1.0 (use $color2 only), the default is 0.5.

       $cc->light($color [, $alpha]) / color_light($color [, $alpha])
           Returns a lighter version of $color, i.e. returns
           "mix($color,[255,255,255],$alpha)".

           The optional $alpha parameter can be a value between 0.0 (use
           $color only) and 1.0 (use [255,255,255] only), the default is 0.5.

       $cc->dark($color [, $alpha]) / color_dark($color [, $alpha])
           Returns a darker version of $color, i.e. returns
           "mix($color,[0,0,0],$alpha)".

           The optional $alpha parameter can be a value between 0.0 (use
           $color only) and 1.0 (use [0,0,0] only), the default is 0.5.

       $cc->contrast($color [, $cut]) / color_contrast($color [, $cut])
           Returns a color that has the highest possible contrast to the input
           color.

           This is done by setting the red, green, and blue values to 0 if the
           corresponding value in the input is above "($cut * 255)" and to 255
           otherwise.

           The default for $cut is .5, representing a cutoff between 127 and
           128.

       $cc->contrast_bw($color [, $cut]) / color_contrast_bw($color [, $cut])
           Returns black or white, whichever has the higher contrast to
           $color.

           This is done by returning black if the grey value of $color is
           above "($cut * 255)" and white otherwise.

           The default for $cut is .5, representing a cutoff between 127 and
           128.

       $cc->blend($color [, $alpha]) / color_blend($color [, $alpha])
           Returns a color that blends into the background, i.e. it returns
           "mix($color,contrast($color),$alpha)".

           The optional $alpha parameter can be a value between 0.0 (use
           $color only) and 1.0 (use contrast($color) only), the default is
           0.5.

           The idea is that $color is the foreground color, so
           contrast($color) is similar to the background color. Mixing them
           returns a color somewhere between them.

           You might want to use "mix($color, $background, $alpha)" instead if
           you know the real background color.

       $cc->blend_bw($color [, $alpha]) / color_blend_bw($color [, $alpha])
           Returns a mix of $color and black or white, whichever has the
           higher contrast to $color.

           The optional $alpha parameter can be a value between 0.0 (use
           $color only) and 1.0 (use black/white only), the default is 0.5.

       Functions

       The calculation methods are also available as functions. The output
       format is selected through the function name.

       These functions are deprecated as they do not allow selecting the
       scheme of recognized color names, which defaults to
       Graphics::ColorNames::X (and is incompatible with HTML's color names).

       By default, i.e. when no list is specified with "use" or "import", all
       of these functions are exported.

       color, color_mix, ...
           Use $Color::Calc::MODE as the output format. This is the default.

       color_hex, color_mix_html, ...
           Use "hex" as the output format.

       color_html, color_mix_html, ...
           Use "html" as the output format. Please note that the color names
           recognized are still based on X's color names, which are
           incompatible with HTML. You can't use the output of these functions
           as input for other color_*_html functions.

           See Color::Calc::WWW for an alternative that does not suffer from
           this problem.

       color_pdf, color_mix_pdf, ...
           Use "pdf" as the output format.

       color_object, color_mix_object, ...
           Use "object" as the output format.
