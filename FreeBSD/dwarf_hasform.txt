DWARF_HASFORM(3)       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual       DWARF_HASFORM(3)

NAME
     dwarf_hasform, dwarf_whatform, dwarf_whatform_direct – query attribute
     forms

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_hasform(Dwarf_Attribute attr, Dwarf_Half form, Dwarf_Bool *ret,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_whatform(Dwarf_Attribute attr, Dwarf_Half *retform,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_whatform_direct(Dwarf_Attribute attr, Dwarf_Half *retform,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_hasform() indicates whether the DWARF attribute denoted by
     argument attr has the attribute form specified by argument form.  If the
     attribute has the specified form, then argument ret is set to a non-zero
     value, otherwise it is set to zero.  If argument err is non-NULL, it will
     be used to return an error descriptor in case of an error.

     Function dwarf_whatform() sets the location specified by argument retform
     to the attribute form code for the DWARF attribute referenced by argument
     attr.  If the attribute referenced by argument attr has an indirect form
     attribute, this function will return the final form for the attribute.
     If argument err is non-NULL, it will be used to return an error
     descriptor in case of an error.

     Function dwarf_whatform_direct() sets the location specified by argument
     retform to the attribute form code for the DWARF attribute referenced by
     argument attr.  If the form is an indirect form, the function sets the
     location specified by argument retform to DW_FORM_indirect.  If argument
     err is non-NULL, it will be used to return an error descriptor in case of
     an error.

RETURN VALUES
     These functions return DW_DLV_OK on success.  In case of an error, these
     functions return DW_DLV_ERR and set argument err.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail with the following errors:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Any of the arguments attr, ret, or retform was
                             NULL.
