HPTMV(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               HPTMV(4)

NAME
     hptmv – HighPoint RocketRAID 182x device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device hptmv

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hptmv_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The hptmv driver provides support for HighPoint's RocketRAID 182x based
     RAID controller.

     These devices support ATA disk drives and provide RAID0 (striping), RAID1
     (mirroring), and RAID5 functionality.

HARDWARE
     The hptmv driver supports the following ATA RAID controllers:

     •   HighPoint's RocketRAID 182x series

NOTES
     The hptmv driver only works on the i386 and amd64 platforms as it
     requires a binary blob object from the manufacturer which they only
     supply for these platforms.  The hptmv driver does not work on i386 with
     pae(4) enabled.

SEE ALSO
     kld(4), kldload(8), loader(8)

HISTORY
     The hptmv device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.

AUTHORS
     The hptmv device driver was written by HighPoint Technologies, Inc., and
     ported to FreeBSD by Scott Long.  This manual page was written by David
     E. O'Brien.

BUGS
     The hptmv driver does not support manipulating the RAID from the OS,
     RAIDs need to be set up from the on-board BIOS.
