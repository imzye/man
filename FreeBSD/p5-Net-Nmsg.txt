NAME
       Net::Nmsg - Perl extension for the NMSG message interchange library

SYNOPSIS
         # The primary interface involves using the IO object; an IO
         # object can be assigned multiple inputs and outputs and
         # relies on the underlying threaded library to distribute
         # messages from the inputs to the outputs.

         use Net::Nmsg::IO;

         my $io = Net::Nmsg::IO->new();

         my $c = 0;

         my $cb = sub {
           my $msg = shift;
           print join(' ', "msg $c :", $msg->msgtype), "\n";
           print $msg->as_str, "\n\n";
           ++$c;
         };

         $io->add_input('infile.nmsg');
         $io->add_output($cb);

         $io->loop;

         # Another way of using the interface is through individual
         # input and output objects, handling the messsage distribution
         # loop in perl itself. Input and output handles are similar
         # to IO::Handle objects in how they can be used.

         use Net::Nmsg::Input;

         my $h = Net::Nmsg::Input->open('infile.nmsg');
         while (my $msg = <$h>) {
           ...
         }

         # alternatively...

         my $io = Net::Nmsg::Input->open('infile.nmsg');
         $io->loop($cb);

DESCRIPTION
       Net::Nmsg is a perl binding to libnmsg, the reference implementation of
       the NMSG binary structured message interchange format. The NMSG
       documentation describes the format as:

           The NMSG format is an efficient encoding of typed, structured data
           into payloads which are packed into containers which can be
           transmitted over the network or stored to disk. Each payload is
           associated with a specific message schema. Modules implementing a
           certain message schema along with functionality to convert between
           binary and presentation formats can be loaded at runtime by
           libnmsg. nmsgtool provides a command line interface to control the
           transmission, storage, creation, and conversion of NMSG payloads.

       The modules of primary use are Net::Nmsg::IO, Net::Nmsg::Input, and
       Net::Nmsg::Output. Individual messages are handled through a type
       specific subclass of Net::Nmsg::Msg depending on what vendor plugins
       are present on the host system.
