SNMP_WLAN(3)           FreeBSD Library Functions Manual           SNMP_WLAN(3)

NAME
     snmp_wlan – wireless networking module for bsnmpd(1)

LIBRARY
     (begemotSnmpdModulePath."wlan" = /usr/lib/snmp_wlan.so)

DESCRIPTION
     The snmp_wlan module implements a private BEGEMOT-WIRELESS-MIB, which
     allows management of virtual wireless interfaces.  The MIB defines
     objects similar to the state data and configuration capabilities of
     ifconfig(8) for configuring virtual wireless interfaces.  Therefore one
     should consider adding write communities or loading the snmp_wlan module
     on systems where security is crucial.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     A short description of the Tables and interesting objects in the MIB
     follows.

     wlanInterfaceTable
                The table is used for creation and deletion of virtual
                wireless interfaces.  To add a new interface, a SET should be
                executed on the wlanIfaceName column with value the desired
                name of the interface.  Next the parent interface must be set
                via wlanParentIfName column.  Any optional parameters may be
                set via the wlanIfaceOperatingMode, wlanIfaceFlags,
                wlanIfaceBssid and wlanIfaceLocalAddress columns.  To finally
                create the interface in the system, a SET with value of
                active(1) to wlanIfaceStatus column should be executed.  To
                destroy a wireless interface a SET with value of destroy(6) to
                the relevant wlanIfaceStatus column should be executed.

     wlanIfParentTable
                The table contains information about the hardware capabilities
                of the parent of a wireless interface.

     wlanIfaceConfigTable
                The table is used to get or set various configuration
                parameters for a virtual wireless interface.  Depending on the
                operating mode of the interface and the hardware capabilities
                of the underlying hardware interface, not all parameters and
                values may be supported.

     wlanIfacePeerTable
                The table contains information about the associated stations
                for interfaces operating as access points, or the stations
                identified as neighbors in the IBSS for interfaces operating
                in adhoc mode.

     wlanIfaceChannelTable
                Information about the active channels for the wireless
                interfaces in the system.

     wlanIfRoamParamsTable
                The parameters that govern the roaming operation on the
                wireless interfaces.

     wlanIfTxParamsTable
                The parameters that govern the transmit operation on the
                wireless interfaces.

     wlanScanConfigTable
                The table that contains a configuration for channel scanning
                initiated via SNMP.

     wlanScanResultsTable
                The table contains the scan results from the last scan for
                each wireless interface on the system.

     wlanIfaceStatisticsTable
                Summary statistics for each wireless interface on the system.

     wlanWepInterfaceTable
                WEP configuration for the wireless interfaces on the system.

     wlanMACAccessControlTable
                Access Control configuration for wireless interfaces operating
                as access points.

     wlanMACAccessControlMACTable
                The table with Access Control MAC entries for which the
                configured Access Control Policy on wireless interfaces
                operating in Host AP mode is applied.
                wlanMACAccessControlMACStatus column is used to add or delete
                MAC ACL entries.  A set with value createAndGo(4) will add new
                entry, while with value destroy(6) will delete an existing
                one.

     wlanMeshRoutingConfig
                The subtree contains system configuration related to Wireless
                Mesh Routing.

     wlanMeshInterfaceTable
                The table contains information for wireless interfaces
                operating as wireless mesh points.

     wlanMeshNeighborTable
                The table contains information for the neighbors of wireless
                interfaces operating in mesh mode.

     wlanMeshRouteTable
                The mesh routing table for interfaces operating as mesh
                points, used for forwarding packets on a mesh network.
                wlanMeshRouteStatus column is used to add or delete entries in
                the mesh routing table for an interface.  A set with value
                createAndGo(4) will add new entry, while with value destroy(6)
                will delete an existing one.

     wlanMeshStatsTable
                Summary statistics for each virtual wireless interface
                operating as mesh point.

     wlanMeshHWMPConfig
                The subtree contains system configuration related to Hybrid
                Wireless Mesh Protocol.

     wlanHWMPInterfaceTable
                The table contains HWMP information for wireless interfaces
                operating in mesh mode.

     wlanMeshHWMPStatsTable
                Summary statistics for HWMP operation on interfaces operating
                as mesh points.
