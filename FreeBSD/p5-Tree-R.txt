NAME
       Tree::R - Perl extension for the R-tree data structure and algorithms

SYNOPSIS
         use Tree::R;

         my $rtree = Tree::R->new

         for my $object (@objects) {
             my @bbox = $object->bbox(); # (minx,miny,maxx,maxy)
             $rtree->insert($object,@bbox);
         }

         my @point = (123, 456); # (x,y)
         my @results;
         $rtree->query_point(@point,\@results);
         for my $object (@results) {
             # point is in object's bounding box
         }

         my @rect = (123, 456, 789, 1234); # (minx,miny,maxx,maxy)
         @results = ();
         $rtree->query_completely_within_rect(@rect,\@results);
         for my $object (@results) {
             # object is within rectangle
         }

         @results = ();
         $rtree->query_partly_within_rect(@rect,\@results);
         for my $object (@results) {
             # object's bounding box and rectangle overlap
         }

DESCRIPTION
       R-tree is a data structure for storing and indexing and efficiently
       looking up non-zero-size spatial objects.
