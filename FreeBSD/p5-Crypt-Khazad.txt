NAME
       Crypt::Khazad - Crypt::CBC-compliant block cipher

ABSTRACT
       Khazad is a 128-bit key, 64-bit block cipher, designed by Vincent
       Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto.

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::Khazad;

           $cipher = new Crypt::Khazad $key;
           $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
           $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

DESCRIPTION
       Khazad is a 128-bit key, 64-bit block cipher. Designed by Vincent
       Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto, Khazad is a NESSIE finalist for
       legacy-level block ciphers. Khazad has many similarities with Rijndael,
       and has an extremely high rate of diffusion.

       This module supports the Crypt::CBC interface, with the following
       functions.

   Functions
       blocksize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the block (8, in this case).

       keysize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the key (16, in this case).

       encrypt($data)
           Encrypts 8 bytes of $data and returns the corresponding ciphertext.

       decrypt($data)
           Decrypts 8 bytes of $data and returns the corresponding plaintext.

EXAMPLE 1
           #!/usr/local/bin/perl

           use diagnostics;
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Crypt::Khazad;

           # key must be 16 bytes long
           my $key = "0123456789abcdef";

           my $cipher = new Crypt::Khazad $key;

           print "blocksize = ", $cipher->blocksize, " bytes \n";
           print "keysize = ", $cipher->keysize, " bytes \n";

           # block must be 8 bytes long
           my $plaintext1 = "Testing1";

           my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext1);
           my $plaintext2 = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           print "Decryption OK\n" if ($plaintext1 eq $plaintext2);

EXAMPLE 2
           #!/usr/local/bin/perl

           use diagnostics;
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Crypt::CBC;  # CBC automatically loads Khazad for us

           # when using Crypt::CBC, key may be of ANY length
           my $key = "0123456789abcdef";

           # IV must be exactly 8 bytes long
           my $IV = pack "H16", 0;

           my $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new({'key' => $key,
                                         'cipher' => 'Khazad',
                                         'iv' => $IV,
                                         'regenerate_key' => 1,
                                         'padding' => 'standard',
                                         'prepend_iv' => 0
                                       });

           # when using Crypt::CBC, plaintext may be of ANY length
           my $plaintext1 = "This is a test";

           my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext1);
           my $plaintext2 = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           print "Decryption OK\n" if ($plaintext1 eq $plaintext2);
