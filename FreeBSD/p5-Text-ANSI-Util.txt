CONTRIBUTING
       To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
       requests on GitHub.

       Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself.
       You can simply modify the code, then test via:

        % prove -l

       If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it
       locally on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
       Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
       Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
       other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
       required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
