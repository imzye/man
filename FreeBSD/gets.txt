FGETS(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual               FGETS(3)

NAME
     fgets, gets_s – get a line from a stream

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     char *
     fgets(char * restrict str, int size, FILE * restrict stream);

     char *
     gets_s(char *str, rsize_t size);

DESCRIPTION
     The fgets() function reads at most one less than the number of characters
     specified by size from the given stream and stores them in the string
     str.  Reading stops when a newline character is found, at end-of-file or
     error.  The newline, if any, is retained.  If any characters are read and
     there is no error, a ‘\0’ character is appended to end the string.

     The gets_s() function is equivalent to fgets() with a stream of stdin,
     except that the newline character (if any) is not stored in the string.

     The gets() function was unsafe and is no longer available.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, fgets() and gets_s() return a pointer to the
     string.  If end-of-file occurs before any characters are read, they
     return NULL and the buffer contents remain unchanged.  If an error
     occurs, they return NULL and the buffer contents are indeterminate.  The
     fgets() and gets_s() functions do not distinguish between end-of-file and
     error, and callers must use feof(3) and ferror(3) to determine which
     occurred.

ERRORS
     [EBADF]            The given stream is not a readable stream.

     The function fgets() may also fail and set errno for any of the errors
     specified for the routines fflush(3), fstat(2), read(2), or malloc(3).

     The function gets_s() may also fail and set errno for any of the errors
     specified for the routine getchar(3).

SEE ALSO
     feof(3), ferror(3), fgetln(3), fgetws(3), getline(3)

STANDARDS
     The fgets() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (“ISO C99”).  gets_s()
     conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:2011 (“ISO C11”) K.3.7.4.1.  gets() has been
     removed from ISO/IEC 9899:2011 (“ISO C11”).
