Tk::Role::HasWidgets(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Tk::Role::HasWidgets - keep track of your tk widgets

VERSION
       version 1.112380

SYNOPSIS
           package Your::Tk::Window::Class;

           use Moose;
           with 'Tk::Role::HasWidgets';

           # store a button
           $self->_set_w( my_button => $button );

           # later on, in one of the methods
           $self->_w( 'my_button' )->configure( ... );

           # when no longer needed:
           $self->_del_w( 'my_button' );

DESCRIPTION
       When programming Tk, it's almost always a good idea to keep a reference
       to the widgets that you created in the interface. Most of the time, a
       simple hash is enough; but it is usually wrapped up in methods to make
       the hash private to the window object. And of course, those methods are
       duplicated in all modules, under a form or another.

       Since duplication is bad, this module implements a Moose role
       implementing those methods once and forever. This implies that your
       class is using Moose in order to consume the role.

   About the method names
       The methods featured in this role begin with "_", that is, they are
       following Perl convention of private methods. This is on purpose:
       remember that this method is a role, consumed by your class. And you
       don't want those methods to be available outside of the window class,
       do you?

METHODS
   _set_w
           $object->_set_w( $name, $widget );

       Store a reference to $widget and associate it to $name.

   _w
           my $widget = $object->_w( $name );

       Get back the $widget reference associated to $name.

   _del_w
           $object->_del_w( $name );

       Delete the $name reference to a widget.

   _clear_w
       Empty the widget references.
