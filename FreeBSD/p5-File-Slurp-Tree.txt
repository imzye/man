NAME
       File::Slurp::Tree - slurp and emit file trees as nested hashes

SYNOPSIS
        # (inefficiently) duplicate a file tree from path a to b
        use File::Slurp::Tree;
        my $tree = slurp_tree( "path_a" );
        spew_tree( "path_b" => $tree );

DESCRIPTION
       File::Slurp::Tree provides functions for slurping and emitting trees of
       files and directories.

        # an example of use in a test suite
        use Test::More tests => 1;
        use File::Slurp::Tree;
        is_deeply( slurp_tree( "t/some_path" ), { foo => {}, bar => "sample\n" },
                   "some_path contains a directory called foo, and a file bar" );

       The tree datastructure is a hash of hashes.  The keys of each hash are
       names of directories or files.  Directories have hash references as
       their value, files have a scalar which holds the contents of the file.

EXPORTED ROUTINES
   slurp_tree( $path, %options )
       return a nested hash reference containing everything within $path

       %options may include the following keys:

       rule
           a File::Find::Rule object that will match the files and directories
           in the path.  defaults to an empty rule (matches everything)

   spew_tree( $path => $tree )
       Creates a file tree as described by $tree at $path
