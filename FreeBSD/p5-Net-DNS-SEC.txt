NAME
       Net::DNS::SEC - DNSSEC extensions to Net::DNS

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::DNS::SEC;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::DNS::SEC is installed as an extension to an existing Net::DNS
       installation providing packages to support DNSSEC as specified in
       RFC4033, RFC4034, RFC4035 and related documents.

       It also provides support for SIG0 which is useful for dynamic updates.

       Implements cryptographic signature generation and verification
       functions using RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and Edwards curve algorithms.

       The extended features are made available by replacing Net::DNS by
       Net::DNS::SEC in the use declaration.

UTILITY FUNCTIONS
   algorithm
           $mnemonic = algorithm( 5 );
           $numeric  = algorithm( 'RSA-SHA1' );
           print "algorithm mnemonic\t", $mnemonic, "\n";
           print "algorithm number:\t",  $numeric,  "\n";

       algorithm() provides conversions between an algorithm code number and
       the corresponding mnemonic.

   digtype
           $mnemonic = digtype( 2 );
           $numeric  = digtype( 'SHA-256' );
           print "digest type mnemonic\t", $mnemonic, "\n";
           print "digest type number:\t",  $numeric,  "\n";

       digtype() provides conversions between a digest type number and the
       corresponding mnemonic.

   key_difference
           @result = key_difference( \@a, \@b );

       Fills @result with all keys in array @a that are not in array @b.
