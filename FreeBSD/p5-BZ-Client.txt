NAME
         BZ::Client - A client for the Bugzilla web services API.

SYNOPSIS
         my $client = BZ::Client->new("url" => $url,
                                      "user" => $user,
                                      "password" => $password);
         $client->login();

CLASS METHODS
       This section lists the class methods of BZ::Client.

new
         my $client = BZ::Client->new("url" => $url,
                                      "user" => $user,
                                      "password" => $password);

       The new method constructs a new instance of BZ::Client. Whenever you
       want to connect to the Bugzilla server, you must first create a
       Bugzilla client. The methods input is a hash of parameters.

       url The Bugzilla servers URL, for example
           "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/".

       user

           Typically, this will be your email address.
