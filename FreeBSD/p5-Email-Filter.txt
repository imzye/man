NAME
       Email::Filter - Library for creating easy email filters

VERSION
       version 1.035

SYNOPSIS
           use Email::Filter;
           my $mail = Email::Filter->new(emergency => "~/emergency_mbox");
           $mail->pipe("listgate", "p5p")         if $mail->from =~ /perl5-porters/;
           $mail->accept("perl")                  if $mail->from =~ /perl/;
           $mail->reject("We do not accept spam") if $mail->subject =~ /enlarge/;
           $mail->ignore                          if $mail->subject =~ /boring/i;
           ...
           $mail->exit(0);
           $mail->accept("~/Mail/Archive/backup");
           $mail->exit(1);
           $mail->accept()

DESCRIPTION
       This module replaces "procmail" or "Mail::Audit", and allows you to
       write programs describing how your mail should be filtered.

PERL VERSION
       This code is effectively abandonware.  Although releases will sometimes
       be made to update contact info or to fix packaging flaws, bug reports
       will mostly be ignored.  Feature requests are even more likely to be
       ignored.  (If someone takes up maintenance of this code, they will
       presumably remove this notice.)  This means that whatever version of
       perl is currently required is unlikely to change -- but also that it
       might change at any new maintainer's whim.

METHODS
   new
           Email::Filter->new();                # Read from STDIN
           Email::Filter->new(data => $string); # Read from string

           Email::Filter->new(emergency => "~simon/urgh");
           # Deliver here in case of error

       This takes an email either from standard input, the usual case when
       called as a mail filter, or from a string.

       You may also provide an "emergency" option, which is a filename to
       deliver the mail to if it couldn't, for some reason, be handled
       properly.

       Hint
          If you put your constructor in a "BEGIN" block, like so:

              use Email::Filter;
              BEGIN { $item = Email::Filter->new(emergency => "~simon/urgh"); }

          right at the top of your mail filter script, you'll even be
          protected from losing mail even in the case of syntax errors in your
          script. How neat is that?

       This method provides the "new" trigger, called once an object is
       instantiated.

   exit
           $mail->exit(1|0);

       Sets or clears the 'exit' flag which determines whether or not the
       following methods exit after successful completion.

       The sense-inverted 'noexit' method is also provided for backwards
       compatibility with "Mail::Audit", but setting "noexit" to "yes" got a
       bit mind-bending after a while.

   simple
           $mail->simple();

       Gets and sets the underlying "Email::Simple" object for this filter;
       see Email::Simple for more details.

   header
           $mail->header("X-Something")

       Returns the specified mail headers. In scalar context, returns the
       first such header; in list context, returns them all.

   body
           $mail->body()

       Returns the body text of the email

   from
   to
   cc
   bcc
   subject
   received
           $mail-><header>()

       Convenience accessors for header($header)

   ignore
       Ignores this mail, exiting unconditionally unless "exit" has been set
       to false.

       This method provides the "ignore" trigger.

   accept
           $mail->accept();
           $mail->accept(@where);

       Accepts the mail into a given mailbox or mailboxes.  Unix "~/" and
       "~user/" prefices are resolved. If no mailbox is given, the default is
       determined according to Email::LocalDelivery: $ENV{MAIL},
       /var/spool/mail/you, /var/mail/you, or ~you/Maildir/.

       This provides the "before_accept" and "after_accept" triggers, and
       exits unless "exit" has been set to false.  They are passed a reference
       to the @where array.

   reject
           $mail->reject("Go away!");

       This rejects the email; if called in a pipe from a mail transport
       agent, (such as in a ~/.forward file) the mail will be bounced back to
       the sender as undeliverable. If a reason is given, this will be
       included in the bounce.

       This calls the "reject" trigger. "exit" has no effect here.

   pipe
           $mail->pipe(qw[sendmail foo\@bar.com]);

       Pipes the mail to an external program, returning the standard output
       from that program if "exit" has been set to false. The program and each
       of its arguments must be supplied in a list. This allows you to do
       things like:

           $mail->exit(0);
           $mail->simple(Email::Simple->new($mail->pipe("spamassassin")));
           $mail->exit(1);

       in the absence of decent "Mail::SpamAssassin" support.

       If the program returns a non-zero exit code, the behaviour is dependent
       on the status of the "exit" flag. If this flag is set to true (the
       default), then "Email::Filter" tries to recover. (See "ERROR RECOVERY")
       If not, nothing is returned.

       If the last argument to "pipe" is a reference to a hash, it is taken to
       contain parameters to modify how "pipe" itself behaves.  The only
       useful parameter at this time is:

         header_only - only pipe the header, not the body

TRIGGERS
       Users of "Mail::Audit" will note that this class is much leaner than
       the one it replaces. For instance, it has no logging; the concept of
       "local options" has gone away, and so on. This is a deliberate design
       decision to make the class as simple and maintainable as possible.

       To make up for this, however, "Email::Filter" contains a trigger
       mechanism provided by Class::Trigger, to allow you to add your own
       functionality. You do this by calling the "add_trigger" method:

           Email::Filter->add_trigger( after_accept => \&log_accept );

       Hopefully this will also help subclassers.

       The methods below will list which triggers they provide.

ERROR RECOVERY
       If something bad happens during the "accept" or "pipe" method, or the
       "Email::Filter" object gets destroyed without being properly handled,
       then a fail-safe error recovery process is called. This first checks
       for the existence of the "emergency" setting, and tries to deliver to
       that mailbox. If there is no emergency mailbox or that delivery failed,
       then the program will either exit with a temporary failure error code,
       queuing the mail for redelivery later, or produce a warning to standard
       error, depending on the status of the "exit" setting.
