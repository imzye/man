NAME
       Mozilla::PublicSuffix - Get a domain name's public suffix via the
       Mozilla Public Suffix List

SYNOPSIS
           use feature qw(say);
           use Mozilla::PublicSuffix qw(public_suffix);

           say public_suffix('org');       # 'org'
           say public_suffix('perl.org');  # 'org'
           say public_suffix('perl.orc');  # undef
           say public_suffix('ga.gov.au'); # 'gov.au'
           say public_suffix('ga.goo.au'); # undef

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a single function that returns the public suffix
       of a domain name by referencing a parsed copy of Mozilla's Public
       Suffix List.  From the official website at <http://publicsuffix.org/>:

           A "public suffix" is one under which Internet users can directly
           register names.  Some examples of public suffixes are com, co.uk
           and pvt.k12.wy.us. The Public Suffix List is a list of all known
           public suffixes.

       A copy of the official list is bundled with the distribution. As the
       official list continues to be updated, the bundled copy will inevitably
       fall out of date.  Aside from new releases always including the latest
       version of the list, this distribution's installer provides the option
       (defaults to "No") to check for a new version of the list and
       download/use it if one is found.

FUNCTIONS
       public_suffix($domain)
           Exported on request. Simply returns the public suffix of the passed
           domain name, or "undef" if either the domain name is not well-
           formed or the public suffix is not found.

SEE ALSO
       Domain::PublicSuffix
           Similar to this module, with an object-oriented interface and
           somewhat alternative interpretation of the rules Mozilla stipulates
           for determining a public suffix.

       IO::Socket::SSL::PublicSuffix
           Ships with "IO::Socket::SSL", used by many HTTP client libraries
           for SSL/TLS support, and makes it easy to use the current version
           of the public suffix list at run-time.
