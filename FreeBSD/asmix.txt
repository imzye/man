NAME
       asmix - the AfterStep volume control knob

SYNOPSIS
       asmix [-h] [-V]
               [-iconic] [-shape] [-withdrawn]
               [-geometry [+|-]x[+|-]y]
               [-channel channel-id]
               [-exe command]
               [-device mixer-device]
               [-name window-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The asmix is a X11 application that acts as a volume control knob for
       the /dev/mixer device.  The applet provides a distinctive AfterStep
       window manager look.

       The best thing about this applet is that you do not have to learn how
       to use it. If you used any volume knobs before - you know how to
       operate this one. If you never came across such a thing then just grab
       the knob with the left button of your mouse and turn it into the
       position you like.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       -h
              Prints a short description and usage message.

       -V
              Version control. Prints the version of the applet.

       -geometry [+|-]x[+|-]y
              Displays the window at the specified location on the screen.
              This works as standard X Windows geometry option.

       -iconic
              Starts the asmix application in the iconized mode.  The icon has
              the same appearance with the main window.

       -shape
              Starts the asmix application without groundplate.

       -withdrawn
              Starts the asmix applet in the "withdrawn" mode.  Necessary to
              be able to dock it to the Window Maker's dock.

       -channel <channel-id>
              Specifies the channel to control (default: volume).  The
              possible channels include: volume, pcm, bass, treble, synth,
              speaker, line, mic, cd, imix, pcm2, record, igain, ogain, line1,
              line2, line3, digital1, digital2, digital3, phone-in, phone-out,
              video, radio, monitor.  Note that not all systems support all
              channels.

       -exe <command>
              The applet will execute the specified command on a mouseclick
              with the middle mouse button in the window.

       -device <mixer-device>
              The applet will attempt to opern the specified mixer device
              instead of the standard /dev/mixer.

       -name <window-name>
              The applet will set the name of the window to the specified
              window-name instead of the standard "asmix". This is useful when
              swallowing multiple instances of asmix into the AfterStep Wharf.

INVOCATION
       asmix was written to be swallowed by the AfterStep wharf module, but it
       can be used with everything else too.  A common invocation is the
       command line:

            user@host[1]% asmix &

       Another way to call asmix is from the AfterStep Wharf:

            *Wharf asmix nil Swallow "asmix" asmix -shape &

       This line, when placed in the wharf file in the users Afterstep
       configuration directory will cause asmix to be a button on the Wharf
       (1) button bar under the afterstep (1) window manager.

BUGS
       None that I am aware of.

FILES
       /dev/mixer
