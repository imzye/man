NONSENSE(6)                  FreeBSD Games Manual                  NONSENSE(6)

NAME
     nonsense – generates random text from datafiles and templates

SYNOPSIS
     nonsense [-b bullet] [-dDeF] [-f data_file] [-n number]
              [-t template_file] [-p] [tag ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Nonsense generates random (and sometime humorous) text from datafiles and
     templates using a very simple, recursive grammar.  It's like having a
     million monkeys sitting in front of a million typewriters, without having
     to feed or clean up after them.  From fake Slashdot headlines to absurd
     college courses to buzzword bingo cards, nonsense is a good way to waste
     time.

     The following options are available:

     -b bullet
             Specify a “bullet” go in front of each item.

     -d      Debug mode (shows each substitution)

     -D      Verbose debug mode (shows each substitution and the result)

     -e      Disable direct eval()'s

     -f data_file
             Specify a data file to load in.  Use multiple -f options to
             include additional files.  The default.data file is always
             loaded.

     -F      Load all *.data files.

     -n number
             Repeat n times.

     -t template_file
             Use a template file.  The markup in this file will be processed
             and the result output to stdout.

     -p      Separate each item with a blank line.

     The -d and -D options are mutually exclusive.

     Thanks to contributions by Fred Hirsch ⟨truehand@darkhart.com⟩, nonsense
     can also be executed as a CGI script.  Details are in
     /usr/local/share/doc/nonsense/README.

FILES
     /usr/local/share/nonsense/data/*  nonsense data files.  Any files
                                       specified with the -f option are found
                                       by looking in the current directory and
                                       then this directory.  The -F option
                                       loads all files in this directory.
     /usr/local/share/nonsense/template/*
                                       nonsense template files.  Any file
                                       specified with the -t option is found
                                       by looking in the current directory and
                                       then this directory.

EXAMPLES
     Bellow is a list of things that nonsense can output with the data files
     included.

     For a realistic simulation of the Slashdot homepage:

           nonsense -t slashdot.html.template

     For a buzzword-enhanced mission statement that only a “Pointy Haired
     Boss” could love:

           nonsense -f mission.data

     For a PHB-inspired business plan (in HTML):

           nonsense -t bizplan.html.template -f mission.data

     For a person's name:

           nonsense Person

     For a long list of random fake e-mail addresses suitable for sending to a
     spammer's e-mail harvester:

           nonsense FakeEmail -n 1000

     For a buzzword bingo card (in HTML) to print out for your next meeting:

           nonsense -t bingo.html.template

     For a listing of absurd college classes (these might be offensive to
     liberal-arts professors):

           nonsense -f college.data -n 20

     For a listing of political organizations (again, these might be offensive
     to certain people):

           nonsense OrgPolitical -n 10

     For a listing of stupid laws that may or may not really exist:

           nonsense -f stupidlaws.data -n 10

     For a list of Open Source programs as they would appear on Freshmeat:

           nonsense -f linux.data FreshmeatApp

     For the resume of a random geek (in HTML):

           nonsense -f resume.data -t resume.html.template

     For a news headline:

           nonsense -f newspaper.data Headline

     For the front page of a newspaper (in HTML):

           nonsense -f newspaper.data -t newspaper.html.template

     For a cheap replacement for the fortune(6) program:

           nonsense -F Fortune

     To produce a file containing 100 items suitable for feeding to
     fortune(6):

           nonsense -F FortuneFile -n 100

FILE FORMATS
     Nonsense reads in “template files” and “data files”.

     A template file is merely a text file containing “tags” enclosed in curly
     braces (‘{’ and ‘}’).  Nonsense substitutes random text for these tags
     using a really crude markup language.

     A data file is a text file divided into sections (seperated by a blank
     line), each one containing a list of text items (seperated by a newline)
     that are randomly selected to fill in the template.

     There are a few special cases that allow nonsense to handle more
     elaborate situations:

     {#number1-number2}
             This tag will be replaced with a random number between number1
             and number2 (inclusive).

     {[item1|item2|item3...}
             This tag will be replaced with one item from the list.  If only
             one item is listed then it will be output %50 of the time (and
             nothing output the other 50%).

     {@strftime format}
             This tag will be replaced with the current date/time using the
             strftime(3) format string.  So, for instance, {@A} would be
             replaced with the current day of the week.

     {@strftime format|number1|number2}
             Same as above, but uses the date/time that occurred X seconds
             ago, where X is a random number between number1 and number2.  For
             instance, {@%H:%M|0|86400} would be replaced by the hour:minute
             anywhere from 0 to 86400 seconds (1 day) ago.

     {;short perl code segment}
             The perl code within the braces will be evaluated.  This is
             useful for doing something really complicated that requires the
             full power of Perl.  However, this is risky since there's no
             error checking and no “sandbox”.  You can disable this behavior
             with the -e option.

     {\character}
             This allows literal characters that couldn't otherwise be
             specified, such as:
                   {\n}    newline
                   {\0}    null (i.e. nothing)
                   {\L}    Left brace (‘{’)
                   {\R}    Right brace (‘}’)
                   {\###}  ascii(7) character in decimal

     {variablename=literal text}
             Stores the text on the right-hand side of the equals sign to the
             specified state variable, without outputting anything.  This is
             useful for preserving context and is used, for example, in the
             Slashdot simulator.

     {variablename:=command}
             Similar to above, but evaluates the command and stores the result
             into a state variable.

     {$variablename}
             Returns the contents of a state variable.

     {command#number1-number2}
             Evaluates the command a random number of times between number1
             and number2.

     Case is important!  {ProductName}, {productname} and {PRODUCTNAME} are
     slightly different.  If the name is given in lowercase, the substitution
     will be converted to all lowercase (i.e. fed through the perl lc
     function).

     Upercase names specify the opposite; the result is uppercoased with uc.
     Mixed case names tell nonsense to leave the case of the result alone
     (this is usually what is used).  Finally, if you prepend a name with a
     caret, ‘^’ (i.e. {^ProductName}), the result is fed through the perl
     ucfirst function, which will capitalize the first character only.
