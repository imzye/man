       the alerts established to control the status of data.

       There are ten different, specialised servers in Pandora FMS 3.x, in
       change of the previously mentioned tasks. All ten servers are
       integrated in one single application, generically named "Pandora
       Server" that is a multithread (multiprocess) application which executes
       in sepparated subprocesses (threads) each of the instances or Pandora
       FMS's specialised servers.
