KLDUNLOAD(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           KLDUNLOAD(8)

NAME
     kldunload – unload a file from the kernel

SYNOPSIS
     kldunload [-fv] -i id ...
     kldunload [-fv] [-n] name ...

DESCRIPTION
     The kldunload utility unloads a file which was previously loaded with
     kldload(8).

     The following options are available:

     -f             Force the unload.  This ignores error returns to
                    MOD_QUIESCE from the module and implies that the module
                    should be unloaded even if it is currently in use.  The
                    users are left to cope as best they can.

     -v             Be more verbose.

     -i id          Unload the file with this ID.

     -n name        Unload the file with this name.

     name           Unload the file with this name.

EXIT STATUS
     The kldunload utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     interface.
