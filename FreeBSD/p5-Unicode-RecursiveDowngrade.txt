NAME
       Unicode::RecursiveDowngrade - Turn off the UTF-8 flags inside of
       complex variable

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::RecursiveDowngrade;

        $rd = Unicode::RecursiveDowngrade->new;
        $var = {
            foo   => 'bar',
            baz   => [
                'qux',
                'quux',
            ],
            corge => \$grault,
        };
        $unflagged = $rd->downgrade($var);

DESCRIPTION
       Unicode::RecursiveDowngrade will turn off the UTF-8 flag inside of
       complex variable in a lump.  In spite of your intention, some modules
       turn it on every elements of returned variable.  You may be hard up for
       turn them off if you don't need any UTF-8 flags in your variable.  This
       module will fix it up easily.

       Sometime I think about the UTF-8 flag is not stead.  But some
       "XML::Parser" based modules will turn it on.  For example,
       "XML::Simple" is really simple way to parse XMLs, but this module
       returns a simple hashref including flagged values.  This hashref is
       very hard to use, isn't it?

METHODS
       •   new

           new() is a constructor method.

       •   filter

           You can set some filter to filter() accessor. The values of
           downgraded will be passed this filter function.  You have to set a
           code reference to this accessor.  Like this:

            use Unicode::RecursiveDowngrade;
            use Unicode::Japanese;

            $rd = Unicode::RecursiveDowngrade->new;
            $rd->filter(sub { Unicode::Japanese->new(shift, 'utf8')->euc });
            $unflagged = $rd->downgrade($var);

           the passed subref will be called inside downgrade() method.

       •   downgrade

           downgrade() returns a turned off variable of argument.

VARIABLES
       •   $Unicode::RecursiveDowngrade::DowngradeFunc

           This variable has a downgrade function for downgrade() method.  You
           can override the variable for some other way.
