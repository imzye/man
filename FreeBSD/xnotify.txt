XNOTIFY(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             XNOTIFY(1)

NAME
       xnotify - popup a notification on the screen

SYNOPSIS
       xnotify [-ow] [-G gravity] [-b button] [-g geometry] [-h height] [-m
       monitor] [-s seconds]

DESCRIPTION
       xnotify is a notification launcher for X, it receives a notification
       specification from standard input and shows a notification on the
       screen.  The notification disappears automatically after a given number
       of seconds or after a mouse click is operated on it.

       The options are as follows:

       -G gravity
              Specify the gravity, that is, where in the screen to display
              xnotify.  gravity can be "NE" for NorthEastGravity (display on
              the top right corner of the screen); "SE" for SouthEastGravity
              (display on the bottom right corner of the screen); "C" for
              CenterGravity (display on the center of the screen); etc.

       -b button
              Specifies a number between 1 and 5 to be the mouse action
              button.  When clicking over a notification with the action
              button, the notification will close, and xnotify will output to
              its stdout the value of the notification's CMD: option.

       -g geometry
              Specifies the geometry in the form
              [<WIDTH>x<HEIGHT>][{-+}<XOFFSET>{-+}<YOFFSET>].  Replace <WIDTH>
              by the desired width, <HEIGHT> by the desired minimum height,
              and so on.  The height is the minimum height of a notification;
              a notification that contains a more than one line or an image
              can get bigger than this minimum height.  A value of 0 sets a
              field to the default value.  So, for example, -g 0x80+0+0 set
              the minimum height to 80 pixels while maintaining other values
              to the default.  <XOFFSET> and <YOFFSET> can be preceded by
              either a minus or a plus (meaning negative or positive values).
              Fields in square brackets are optional.  So, for example, -g
              0x80 is the same as -g 0x80+0+0; and -g -10+10 is the same as -g
              0x0-10+10.

       -h height
              Maximum height (in pixels) of a notification window.

       -m monitor
              Makes xnotify be displayed on the specified monitor.  Monitor
              numbers start from 0.  Without this option, xnotify is displayed
              on the first monitor (that is, the monitor 0).

       -o     With this option, only one notification should exist at a time.
              So, when a new notification appears, the other ones are removed.

       -s seconds
              Specify the time, in seconds, for a notification to be displayed
              before it is removed from screen.  Without this option, the
              default of 10 seconds is used.  If this option is set to 0
              (zero), the notification is displayed indefinitely until
              manually closed.

       -w     Let the window manager control notification windows.

       Each line read from stdin specify a notification and has the following
       format:

              ITEM := [NAME:VALUE TABS] TEXT NEWLINE

       That means that each line is composed by an optional set of name-value
       pairs separated by colon (:) followed by tabs, then the text of the
       notification, then a newline.  Brackets group optional elements.  Empty
       lines are ignored.

       The TEXT of a notification specification can contain tabs.  Each tab is
       converted to a line break on the notification.

       The following names are currently accepted for the NAME:VALUE pairs:

       IMG:   Specify the path of a image to be displayed on the notification.

       TAG:   Specify a string to be the notification's tag.  When a
              notification with a given tag spawns, all other notifications
              with the same tag disappears.

       CMD:   Specify a string to be output when clicking on the notification
              with the action mouse button.

       BG:    Specify the color of the notification background.

       FG:    Specify the color of the notification text (i.e., its
              foreground).

       BAR:   Specify a percentage for a progress bar to be drawn below the
              text.

       BRD:   Specify the color of the notification border.

       SEC:   Specify the time, in seconds, that the notification should stay
              visible.  If set to zero, the notification will stay visible
              until being clicked.

       Clicking on a notification removes it from the screen.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables affect the execution of xnotify

       DISPLAY
              The display to start xnotify on.

RESOURCES
       xnotify understands the following X resources.

       xnotify.title.faceName
              The fonts to draw the notification title text.  The title is the
              first line of the notification, if there is more than one.  More
              than one font can be specified, separated by comma (,).  If more
              than one font is specified, the first font with a given glyph is
              used to display that glyph on the screen.

       xnotify.body.faceName
              The fonts to draw the notification body text.  The body text is
              any line after the first line.

       xnotify.background
              The color of the notification background.

       xnotify.foreground
              The color of the notification text.

       xnotify.border
              The color of the border around a notification.

       xnotify.geometry
              The geometry in the form
              [<WIDTH>x<HEIGHT>][{+-}<XOFFSET>{+-}<YOFFSET>].  See the
              description of the option -g for more information.

       xnotify.gravity
              Where in the screen to display notifications.  See the
              description of the option -G for more information.

       xnotify.borderWidth
              The size in pixels of the border around a notification.

       xnotify.maxHeight
              The maximum height of a notification window in pixels.

       xnotify.gap
              The gap between notifications.

       xnotify.imageWidth
              The size of the image attached to the notification.

       xnotify.leading
              The space between lines.

       xnotify.padding
              The space around the content inside the notification popup
              window.

       xnotify.shrink
              If set to "true", the notification width will shrink to its
              content size.  If set to "false", notification width will be
              constant.

       xnotify.alignment
              If set to "left", "center", or "right", text is aligned to the
              left, center, or right of the popup window, respectively.  By
              default, notification text is aligned to the left of the
              notification popup window.

       xnotify.alignTop
              If set to "true", The text will be vertically aligned to the top
              of the notification window.  If set to "false", text will be
              vertically centered.

       xnotify.wrap
              If set to "true", lines longer than the notification width will
              wrap rather than being truncated.  If set to "false", lines will
              be truncated.

SIGNALS
       xnotify respond to signals sent to it.

       SIGHUP Close all notifications.

       SIGUSR1
              Close the first notification.

       SIGUSR2
              Print the CMD of the first notification and then close it.

       SIGSTOP
              Stop xnotify.  When this signal is sent, all new notifications
              are accumuled until xnotify receive a SIGCONT signal.  This
              signal is useful to be sent when a window is fullscreen, so
              xnotify will not annoy with notifications on top of the
              fullscreen window.  A SIGHUP signal must be sent before a
              SIGSTOP in order to close all notifications before stop.

       SIGCONT
              Display all accumulated notifications and continue xnotify after
              being stop with SIGSTOP.

EXAMPLES
       The following is an example of how to run XNotify.

              $ xnotify -m 10 -G NE -g -10+10 -s 15

       This line means: read notifications from stdin, display the
       notifications on the north east (-G NE) of the monitor 0 (-m 0), that
       is, on the upper right corner of the first monitor.  The notifications
       should be placed -10 pixels to the left and +10 pixels down (thus
       creating a 10 pixel gap with the upper right corner).  Each
       notification stay alive for 15 seconds.

       To create a named pipe for XNotify, the following lines can be placed
       on ~/.xinitrc.  This will create a named pipe unique to the current X
       display in the home directory at ~/.cache.  Then, it will open xnotify
       in the background, reading from this named pipe.

              XNOTIFY_FIFO="$HOME/.cache/xnotify$DISPLAY.fifo"
              export XNOTIFY_FIFO
              rm -f $XNOTIFY_FIFO
              mkfifo $XNOTIFY_FIFO
              xnotify 0<>$XNOTIFY_FIFO &

       Then a notification can be created by echoing into the named pipe:

              $ echo Hello World > $XNOTIFY_FIFO

       To create a notification with a image, input to XNotify a line
       beginning with IMG:/path/to/file.png followed by a tab.  For example:

              $ printf 'IMG:/path/to/file.png\tThis is a notification\n' > $XNOTIFY_FIFO

       xnotify does not read notifications from dbus.  For xnotify to read
       dbus notifications, its stdin must be fed with the output of
       tiramisu(1).  The following line makes tiramisu(1) send dbus
       notifications to xnotify.  This line can be added to ~/.xinitrc after
       the line calling xnotify.

              tiramisu -o "$(printf '#summary\t#body\n')" > $XNOTIFY_FIFO &
