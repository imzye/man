AUE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 AUE(4)

NAME
     aue – ADMtek AN986 Pegasus USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device aue

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_aue_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The aue driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the
     ADMtek AN986 Pegasus chipset.

     The LinkSys USB10T adapters that contain the AN986 Pegasus chipset will
     operate at 100Base-TX and full-duplex.

     The Pegasus contains a 10/100 Ethernet MAC with MII interface and is
     designed to work with both Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers.  Although
     designed to interface with 100Mbps peripherals, the existing USB standard
     specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.  Users should therefore not
     expect to actually achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.

     The Pegasus supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect filter
     entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.  Packets are received
     and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.

     The aue driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect            Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
                           The user can manually override the autoselected
                           mode by adding media options to the /etc/rc.conf
                           file.

     10baseT/UTP           Set 10Mbps operation.  The mediaopt option can also
                           be used to enable full-duplex operation.  Not
                           specifying full duplex implies half-duplex mode.

     100baseTX             Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The
                           mediaopt option can also be used to enable
                           full-duplex operation.  Not specifying full duplex
                           implies half-duplex mode.

     The aue driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex           Force full duplex operation.  The interface will
                           operate in half duplex mode if this media option is
                           not specified.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS
     aue%d: watchdog timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
     transmit command was issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the
     transmission before a timeout expired.

     aue%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.
