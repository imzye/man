NAME
       colordiff - a tool to colorize diff output

SYNOPSIS
       colordiff [diff_options] [colordiff_options] {file1} {file2}

DESCRIPTION
       colordiff is a wrapper for diff and produces the same output as diff
       but with coloured syntax highlighting at the command line to improve
       readability. The output is similar to how a diff-generated patch might
       appear in Vim or Emacs with the appropriate syntax highlighting options
       enabled. The colour schemes can be read from a central configuration
       file or from a local user ~/.colordiffrc file.

       colordiff makes use of ANSI colours and as such will only work when
       ANSI colours can be used - typical examples are xterms and Eterms, as
       well as console sessions.

       colordiff has been tested on various flavours of Linux and under
       OpenBSD, but should be broadly portable to other systems.

USAGE
       Use colordiff wherever you would normally use diff, or instead pipe
       output to colordiff:

       For example:

           $ colordiff file1 file2
           $ diff -u file1 file2 | colordiff

       You can pipe the output to 'less', using the '-R' option (some systems
       or terminal types may get better results using '-r' instead), which
       keeps the colour escape sequences, otherwise displayed incorrectly or
       discarded by 'less':

           $ diff -u file1 file2 | colordiff | less -R

       If you want to force disable colour escape sequences (for example pipe
       the output to patch), you can use option '--color=no' to do so:

           $ diff -u file1 file2 | colordiff --color=no | patch -p0 -d another-working-dir

       If you have wdiff installed, colordiff will correctly colourise the
       added and removed text, provided that the '-n' option is given to
       wdiff:

           $ wdiff -n file1 file2 | colordiff

       You may find it useful to make diff automatically call colordiff. Add
       the following line to ~/.bashrc (or equivalent):

           alias diff=colordiff

       Any options passed to colordiff are passed through to diff except for
       the colordiff-specific option 'difftype', e.g.

           colordiff --difftype=debdiff file1 file2

       Valid values for 'difftype' are: diff, diffc, diffu, diffy, wdiff,
       debdiff; these correspond to plain diffs, context diffs, unified diffs,
       side-by-side diffs, wdiff output and debdiff output respectively. Use
       these overrides when colordiff is not able to determine the diff-type
       automatically.

       Alternatively, a construct such as 'cvs diff SOMETHING | colordiff' can
       be included in ~/.bashrc as follows:

           function cvsdiff () { cvs diff $@ | colordiff; }

       Or, combining the idea above using 'less':

           function cvsdiff () { cvs diff $@ | colordiff |less -R; }

       Note that the function name, cvsdiff, can be customized.

       By default colordiff returns the exit code of the underlying diff
       invocation (if there is one), but there are some circumstances where it
       is useful to force colordiff's exit code to be zero: to do this use the
       option '--fakeexitcode':

           colordiff --fakeexitcode ...


OPTIONS
       colordiff will send most options through to diff, but there are various
       colordiff-specific options which can be used:

       --help
           Show these colordiff-specific options

       --color=(yes|no)
           Force (or suppress) display of colours in output

       --color=patches=(yes|no)
           Force (or suppress) inclusion of colour codes in patch output

       --color-term-output-only
           Force colour to only appear in terminal output

       --difftype=DIFFTYPE
           Force difftype detection to specified format. DIFFTYPE can be:
           diff, diffc, diffu, diffy, debdiff, wdiff

       --(no)banner
           Show (or suppress) the colordiff banner

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/colordiffrc
           Central configuration file. User-specific settings can be enabled
           by copying this file to ~/.colordiffrc and making the appropriate
           changes.

       colordiffrc-lightbg
           Alternate configuration template for use with terminals having
           light backgrounds. Copy this to /usr/local/etc/colordiffrc or
           ~/.colordiffrc and customize.

       colordiffrc-gitdiff
           Alternate configuration template for use with terminals having dark
           backgrounds, with colour defaults set to match the output of 'git
           diff'. Copy this to /usr/local/etc/colordiffrc or ~/.colordiffrc
           and customize.
