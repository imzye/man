NAME
     hmt – MS Windows 7/8/10 - compatible HID multi-touch device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
     your kernel configuration file:

           device hmt
           device hidbus
           device hid
           device hconf
           device evdev


     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hmt_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The hmt driver provides support for the MS Windows 7/8/10 - compatible
     HID multi-touch devices found in many laptops.

     To get multi-touch device working in X(7), install
     ports/x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev.

FILES
     hmt creates a pseudo-device file, /dev/input/eventX which presents the
     multi-touch device as an input event device.
