NAME
       Text::Truncate - Perl module with simple string truncating routine.

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Truncate;

         my $long_string = "This is a very long string";

         # outputs "This is..."
         print truncstr( $long_string, 10);

         # outputs "This is a-"
         print truncstr( $long_string, 10, "-");

         # outputs "This is a "
         print truncstr( $long_string, 10, "");

         # outputs "This is---"
         $Text::Truncate::DEFAULT_MARKER = "---";
         print truncstr( $long_string, 10);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple, no-brainer subroutine to truncate a string and add an
       optional cutoff marker (defaults to ``...'').

       (Yes, this is a really brain-dead sort of thing to make a module out
       of, but then again, I use it so often that it might as well be in a
       module.)

       The synopsis gives examples of how to use it.

   EXPORT
       The following functions are exported:

       truncstr
             $rstring = truncstr( $istring, $cutoff_length );

             $rstring = truncstr( $istring, $cutoff_length, $continued_symbol );

           If the $istring is longer than the $cutoff_length, then the string
           will be truncated to $cutoff_length characters, including the
           $continued_symbol (which defaults to ``...'' if none is specified).

           The default $continued_symbol can be changed in
           $Text::Truncate::DEFAULT_MARKER.
