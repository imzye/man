DESCRIPTION
       IMPORTANT: DUE TO FRESHMEAT.NET CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR
       NEWSLETTERS, THE INTERFACE FOR THIS PACKAGE HAS CHANGED SINCE
       Mail::Freshmeat 0.94.

       Mail::Freshmeat is a subclass of Mail::Internet.

       This package provides parsing of the daily e-mail newsletters which are
       sent out from http://freshmeat.net/ to any individual who requests
       them.

NEWSLETTER METHODS
       •   new

           This is the constructor. Pass it something that Mail::Internet will
           like such as a file descriptor (reference to a GLOB) or a reference
           to an array and you will get back a newsletter object.

       •   entries

           This object method will return an array or an array reference
           (depending on context) of entry objects for all of the entries in
           the newsletter.

       •   articles

           This object method will return an array or an array reference
           (depending on context) of article objects for all of the articles
           in the newsletter.

ENTRY METHODS
       •   entry_keys

           This object method will return an array or an array reference
           (depending on context) of all the attribute names of an entry
           (e.g.: position, name, license, url) in the order that they
           appeared.

       •   short_entry

           This object method will return the short description of the entry
           as it appeared in the newsletter headlines section (eg: Linux
           2.4.9-ac15 (2.4-ac))

ARTICLE METHODS
       •   article_keys

           This object method will return an array or an array reference
           (depending on context) of all the attribute names of an article
           (e.g.: title, description, url) in the order that they appeared.
