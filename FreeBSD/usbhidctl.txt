NAME
     usbhidctl – manipulate USB HID devices

SYNOPSIS
     usbhidctl -f device [-t table] [-v] [-x] -r
     usbhidctl -f device [-t table] [-l] [-v] [-x] [-z] -a
     usbhidctl -f device [-t table] [-l] [-n] [-v] [-x] [-z] item ...
     usbhidctl -f device [-t table] [-v] [-z] -w item=value ...

DESCRIPTION
     The usbhidctl utility can be used to dump and modify the state of a USB
     HID (Human Interface Device).  Each named item is printed.  If the -w
     flag is specified usbhidctl attempts to set the specified items to the
     given values.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Show all items and their current values if device returns.

     -f device
             Specify a path name for the device to operate on.

     -l      Loop and dump the device data every time it changes.

     -n      Suppress printing of the item name.

     -r      Dump the report descriptor.

     -t table
             Specify a path name for the HID usage table file.

     -v      Be verbose.

     -w      Change item values.  Only 'output' and 'feature' kinds can be set
             with this option.

     -x      Dump data in hexadecimal as well as decimal.

     -z      Reset reports to zero before processing other arguments.  If not
             specified, current values will be requested from device.

SYNTAX
     usbhidctl compares the names of items specified on the command line
     against the human interface items reported by the USB device.  Each human
     interface item is mapped from its native form to a human readable name,
     using the HID usage table file.  Command line items are compared with the
     generated item names, and the USB HID device is operated on when a match
     is found.

     Each human interface item is named by the "page" it appears in, the
     "usage" within that page, and the list of "collections" containing the
     item.  Each collection in turn is also identified by page, and the usage
     within that page.

     On the usbhidctl command line the page name is separated from the usage
     name with the character ‘:’.  The collections are separated by the
     character ‘.’.

     Some devices give the same name to more than one item.  usbhidctl
     supports isolating each item by appending a ‘#’.  character and a decimal
     item instance number, starting at zero.

FILES
     /usr/share/misc/usb_hid_usages  The default HID usage table.
