NAME
       grim - grab images from a Wayland compositor

SYNOPSIS
       grim [options...] [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       grim is a command-line utility to take screenshots of Wayland desktops.
       For now it requires support for the screencopy protocol to work.
       Support for the xdg-output protocol is optional, but improves
       fractional scaling support.

       grim will write an image to output-file, or to a timestamped file name
       in $GRIM_DEFAULT_DIR if not specified. If $GRIM_DEFAULT_DIR is not set,
       it falls back first to $XDG_PICTURES_DIR and then to the current
       working directory. If output-file is -, grim will write the image to
       the standard output instead.

OPTIONS
       -h
           Show help message and quit.

       -s <factor>
           Set the output image's scale factor to factor. By default, the
           scale factor is set to the highest of all outputs.

       -g "<x>,<y> <width>x<height>"
           Set the region to capture, in layout coordinates.

           If set to -, read the region from the standard input instead.

       -t <type>
           Set the output image's file format to type. By default, the
           filetype is set to png, valid values are png, jpeg or ppm.

       -q <quality>
           Set the output jpeg's filetype compression rate to quality. By
           default, the jpeg quality is 80, valid values are between 0-100.

       -l <level>
           Set the output PNG's filetype compression level to level. By
           default, the PNG compression level is 6 on a scale from 0 to 9.
           Level 9 gives the highest compression ratio, but may be slow; level
           1 gives a lower compression ratio, but is faster. Level 0 does no
           compression at all, and produces very large files; it can be useful
           when grim is used in a pipeline with other commands.

       -o <output>
           Set the output name to capture.

       -c
           Include cursors in the screenshot.
