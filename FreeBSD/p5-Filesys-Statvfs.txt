NAME
       Filesys::Statvfs - Perl extension for statvfs() and fstatvfs()

SYNOPSIS
         use Filesys::Statvfs;

               my($bsize, $frsize, $blocks, $bfree, $bavail,
               $files, $ffree, $favail, $flag, $namemax) = statvfs("/tmp");

               #### Pass an open filehandle. Verify that fileno() returns a defined
               #### value. If you pass undef to fstatvfs you will get unexpected results
               my $fd = fileno(FILE_HANDLE);
               if(defined($fd)) {
                       ($bsize, $frsize, $blocks, $bfree, $bavail,
                       $files, $ffree, $favail, $flag, $namemax) = fstatvfs($fd);
               }

DESCRIPTION
       Interface for statvfs() and fstatvfs()

       Unless you need access to the bsize, flag, and namemax values, you
       should probably look at using Filesys::DfPortable or Filesys::Df
       instead. They will generally provide you with more functionality and
       portability.

       The module should work with all flavors of Unix that implement the
       statvfs() and fstatvfs() calls. This would include Linux, *BSD, HP-UX,
       AIX, Solaris, Mac OS X, Irix, Cygwin, etc ...

       The statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions will return a list of values, or
       will return "undef" and set $! if there was an error.

       The values returned are described in the statvfs/fstatvfs header or the
       "statvfs()/fstatvfs()" man page.

       The module assumes that if you have statvfs(), fstatvfs() will also be
       available.
