NAME
       CGI::Cache - Perl extension to help cache output of time-intensive CGI
       scripts

WARNING
       The interface as of version 1.01 has changed considerably and is NOT
       compatible with earlier versions. A smaller interface change also
       occurred in version 1.20.

SYNOPSIS
       Here's a simple example:

         #!/usr/bin/perl

         use CGI;
         use CGI::Cache;

         # Set up cache
         CGI::Cache::setup();

         my $cgi = new CGI;

         # CGI::Vars requires CGI version 2.50 or better
         CGI::Cache::set_key($cgi->Vars);

         # This should short-circuit the rest of the loop if a cache value is
         # already there
         CGI::Cache::start() or exit;

         print $cgi->header, "\n";

         print <<EOF;
         <html><body>
         <p>
         This prints to STDOUT, which will be cached.
         If the next visit is within 24 hours, the cached STDOUT
         will be served instead of executing this 'print'.
         </body></html>
         EOF

       Here's a more complex example:

         use CGI;
         use CGI::Cache;

         my $query = new CGI;

         # Set up a cache in /tmp/CGI_Cache/demo_cgi, with publicly
         # unreadable cache entries, a maximum size of 20 megabytes,
         # and a time-to-live of 6 hours.
         CGI::Cache::setup( { cache_options =>
                              { cache_root => '/tmp/CGI_Cache',
                                namespace => 'demo_cgi',
                                directory_umask => 077,
                                max_size => 20 * 1024 * 1024,
                                default_expires_in => '6 hours',
                              }
                            } );

         # CGI::Vars requires CGI version 2.50 or better
         CGI::Cache::set_key( $query->Vars );
         CGI::Cache::invalidate_cache_entry()
           if $query->param( 'force_regenerate' ) eq 'true';
         CGI::Cache::start() or exit;

         print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

         print <<EOF;
         <html><body>
         <p>
         This prints to STDOUT, which will be cached.
         If the next visit is within 6 hours, the cached STDOUT
         will be served instead of executing these 'prints'.
         </p>
         EOF

         CGI::Cache::pause();

         print <<EOF;
         <p>This is not cached.</p>
         EOF

         CGI::Cache::continue();

         print <<EOF;
         </body></html>
         EOF

         # Optional unless you're using mod_perl for FastCGI
         CGI::Cache::stop();

DESCRIPTION
       This module is intended to be used in a CGI script that may benefit
       from caching its output. Some CGI scripts may take longer to execute
       because the data needed in order to construct the page may not be
       quickly computed. Such a script may need to query a remote database, or
       may rely on data that doesn't arrive in a timely fashion, or it may
       just be computationally intensive.  Nonetheless, if you can afford the
       tradeoff of showing older, cached data vs. CGI execution time, then
       this module will perform that function.

       This module was written such that any existing CGI code could benefit
       from caching without really changing any of existing CGI code guts.
       The CGI script can do just what it has always done, that is, construct
       an html page and print it to the output file descriptor, then exit.
       What you'll do in order to cache pages is include the module, specify
       some cache options and the cache key, and then call start() to begin
       caching output.

       Internally, the CGI::Cache module ties the output file descriptor
       (usually STDOUT) to an internal variable to which all output is saved.
       When the user calls stop() (or the END{} block of CGI::Cache is
       executed during script shutdown) the contents of the variable are
       inserted into the cache using the cache key the user specified earlier
       with set_key().

       Once a page has been cached in this fashion, a subsequent visit to that
       page will invoke the start() function again, which will then check for
       an existing cache entry for the given key before continuing through the
       code. If the cache entry exists, then the cache entry's content is
       printed to the output filehandle (usually STDOUT) and a 0 is returned
       to indicate that cached output was used.

   CHOOSING A CACHE KEY
       The cache key is used by CGI::Cache to determine when cached output can
       be used. The key should be a unique data structure that fully describes
       the execution of the script. Conveniently, CGI::Cache can take the CGI
       module's parameters (using CGI::Vars) as the key. However, in some
       cases you may want to specially construct the key.

       For example, say we have a CGI script "airport" that computes the
       number of miles between major airports. You supply two airport codes to
       the script and it builds a web page that reports the number of miles by
       air between those two locations. In addition, there is a third
       parameter which tells the script whether to write debugging information
       to a log file. Suppose the URL for Indianapolis Int'l to Chicago O'Hare
       looked like:

         http://www.some.machine/cgi/airport?from=IND&to=ORD&debug=1

       We might want to remove the debug parameter because the output from the
       user's perspective is the same regardless of whether a log file is
       written:

         my $params = $query->Vars;
         delete $params->{'debug'};
         CGI::Cache::set_key( $params );
         CGI::Cache::start() or exit;

   THE CGI::CACHE ROUTINES
       setup(...)
             setup( { cache_options => \%cache_options,
                        [enable_output => 1],
                        [watched_output_handle => \*STDOUT],
                        [watched_error_handle => \*STDERR] );
                        [output_handle => <watched_output_handle>],
                        [error_handle => <watched_error_handle>] } );

             <enable_output> - used to disable output while caching
             <cache_options> - options for configuration of the cache
             <watched_output_handle> - the file handle to monitor for normal output
             <watched_error_handle> - the file handle to monitor for error output
             <output_handle> - the file handle to which to send normal output
             <error_handle> - the file handle to which to send error output

           Sets up the module. The cache_options parameter contains the same
           values as the parameters for the Cache::SizeAwareFileCache module's
           new() method, with the same defaults. Below is a brief overview of
           the options and their defaults. This overview may be out of date
           with your version of Cache::SizeAwareFileCache. Consult perldoc
           Cache::SizeAwareFileCache for more accurate information.

           $cache_options{cache_root}
               The cache_root is the file system location of the cache.
               Leaving this unset will cause the cache to be created in a
               subdirectory of your temporary directory called CGI_Cache.

           $cache_options{namespace}
               Namespaces provide isolation between cache objects. It is
               recommended that you use a namespace that is unique to your
               script. That way you can have multiple scripts whose output is
               cached by CGI::Cache, and they will not collide. This value
               defaults to a subdirectory of your temp directory whose name
               matches the name of your script (as reported by
               $ENV{SCRIPT_NAME}, or $0 if $ENV{SCRIPT_NAME} is not defined).

           $cache_options{default_expires_in}
               If the "default_expires_in" option is set, all objects in this
               cache will be cleared after that number of seconds. If this
               option is not provided, the cache entry will never expire by
               default.

           $cache_options{max_size}
               "max_size" specifies the maximum size of the cache, in bytes.
               Cache objects are removed during the set() operation in order
               to reduce the cache size before the new cache value is added.
               The default size is unlimited.

           Normally CGI::Cache monitors STDOUT, storing output in a temporary
           buffer, before printing it to the output filehandle. It also
           monitors STDERR in order to determine if your CGI script has
           failed: if it has failed, then the buffer is discarded. Otherwise,
           the buffered output is cached for a later execution of your
           program.

           The enable_output option allows you to cache the output but not
           send it to the output filehandle. This is useful, for example, if
           you want to store the output, then use buffer() to access it for
           processing before calling stop(), which stores the buffer in the
           cache.

           The remaining four optional parameters allow you to modify the
           filehandles that CGI::Cache listens on and outputs to. The watched
           handles are the handles which CGI::Cache will monitor for output.
           The output and error handles are the handles to which CGI::Cache
           will send the output after it is cached. These default to whatever
           the watched handles are. This feature is useful when CGI::Cache is
           used to cache output to files:

             use CGI::Cache;

             open FH, ">TEST.OUT";

             CGI::Cache::setup( { watched_output_handle => \*FH } );
             CGI::Cache::set_key( 'test key' );
             CGI::Cache::start() or exit;

             # This is cached, and then sent to FH
             print FH "Test output 1\n";

             CGI::Cache::stop();

             close FH;

           NOTE: If you plan to modify warn() or die() (i.e. redefine
           $SIG{__WARN__} or $SIG{__DIE__}) so that they no longer print to
           STDERR, you must do so before calling setup(). For example, if you
           do a "require CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser)", make sure you do it
           before calling CGI::Cache::setup().

       set_key ( <data> );
           set_key takes any type of data (e.g. a list, a string, a reference
           to a complex data structure, etc.) and uses it to create a unique
           key to use when caching the script's output.

       start();
           Could you guess that the start() routine is what does all the work?
           It is this call that actually looks for an existing cache file and
           prints the output if it exists. If the cache file does not exist,
           then CGI::Cache captures the output filehandle and redirects the
           CGI script's output to the cache file.

           This function returns 1 if caching has started, and 0 if the cached
           output was printed. A common metaphor for using this function is:

             CGI::Cache::start() or exit;

           This function dies if you haven't yet defined your cache key.

       $status = stop( [<cache_output>] );
               <cache_output> - do we write the captured output to a cache file?

           The stop() routine tells us to stop capturing output.  The argument
           "cache_output" tells us whether or not to store the captured output
           in the cache. By default this argument is 1, since this is usually
           what we want to do. In an error condition, however, we may not want
           to cache the output.  A cache_output argument of 0 is used in this
           case.

           You don't have to call the stop() routine if you simply want to
           catch all output that the script generates for the duration of its
           execution.  If the script exits without calling stop(), CGI::Cache
           will call it for you upon program exit. Note that CGI::Cache will
           detect whether your script is exiting as the result of an error,
           and will not cache the output in this case.

           This function returns 0 if capturing has not been started (by a
           call to start()), and 1 otherwise.

       $status = pause();
           Temporarily disable caching of output. Returns 0 if CGI::Cache is
           not currently caching output, and 1 otherwise.

       $status = continue();
           Re-enable caching of output.  This function returns 0 if capturing
           has not been started (by a call to start()) or if pause() was not
           previously called, and 1 otherwise.

       $scalar = buffer( [<content>] );
           The buffer method gives direct access to the buffer of cached
           output. The optional <content> parameter allows you to set the
           contents using a list or scalar. (The list will be joined into a
           scalar and stored in the buffer.) The return value is the contents
           of the buffer after any changes.

       $status = invalidate_cache_entry();
           Forces the cache entry to be invalidated. It is always successful,
           and always returns 1. It doesn't make much sense to call this after
           calling start(), as CGI::Cache will have already determined that
           the cache entry is invalid.

       $status = clear_cache();
           Deletes the cache. It is always successful, and always returns 1.

CGI::Cache and Persistent Environments
       CGI::Cache supports persistent environments. The key is the return
       value from start()---if the return value is 0, then cached output has
       been printed, and your persistent script should not regenerate its
       output. Typically you would do something like:

         use vars qw($COUNTER);

         while(NEW CONNECTION)
         {
           CGI::Cache::set_key(...);

           $COUNTER++;

           CGI::Cache::start() or next;

           ... NORMAL OUTPUT ...
           print $COUNTER;

           CGI::Cache::stop();
         }

       When you invoke a CGI script like this using a URL like
       http://www.some.machine/cgi-bin/scriptname.fcgi the output will report
       that the counter is 1. If you reload this web page, you will get cached
       information--even though the counter was incremented, the reloaded web
       page will say that the counter is 1.

       However, if you change the parameters to the request by visiting
       http://www.some.machine/cgi-bin/scriptname.fcgi?var=1 (assuming your
       cache key is based on the parameters) you will get an updated web page.
       The counter will show the correct value based on the number of times
       you reloaded the web page.  For example, if you did 2 reloads, the
       counter should be reported as 4---the first load, plus two reloads,
       plus the final load with changed parameters.

       Finally, if you revisit
       http://www.some.machine/cgi-bin/scriptname.fcgi, you will see the
       cached web page with the counter equal to 1.

       The next few subsections provide examples of how to use CGI::Cache with
       different persistent CGI environments.

   CGI::Fast
       Here's an example with CGI::Fast:

         #!/usr/bin/perl

         use strict;

         use CGI::Fast;
         use CGI::Cache;

         my $COUNTER = 0;

         # Set up cache
         CGI::Cache::setup();

         while (my $cgi = new CGI::Fast)
         {
           CGI::Cache::set_key($cgi->Vars);

           $COUNTER++;

           # This should short-circuit the rest of the loop if a cache value is
           # already there
           CGI::Cache::start() or next;

           print $cgi->header, "\n";

           print<<EOF;
         <html>
         <head><title>FastCGI</title></head>
         <body>Counter: $COUNTER PID: $$</body>
         </html>
         EOF

           CGI::Cache::stop();
         }

   FCGI
       Here's an example with FCGI:

         #!/usr/bin/perl

         use strict;

         use FCGI;
         use CGI::Cache;
         use CGI;
         use IO::Handle;

         my $COUNTER = 0;

         my $stdout = new IO::Handle;
         my $stderr = new IO::Handle;

         my %env;

         my $request = FCGI::Request(\*STDIN, $stdout, $stderr, \%env);

         # Set up cache
         if ($request->IsFastCGI())
         {
           CGI::Cache::setup( { output_handle => $stdout,
                                error_handle => $stderr } );
         }
         else
         {
           CGI::Cache::setup();
         }

         while ($request->Accept() >= 0)
         {
           my $cgi = new CGI($env{QUERY_STRING});
           CGI::Cache::set_key($cgi->Vars);

           $COUNTER++;

           # This should short-circuit the rest of the loop if a cache value is
           # already there
           CGI::Cache::start() or next;

           print $cgi->header, "\n";

           print<<EOF;
         <html>
         <head><title>FastCGI</title></head>
         <body>Counter: $COUNTER PID: $$</body>
         </html>
         EOF

           CGI::Cache::stop();
         }

   SpeedyCGI
       Here's an example with SpeedyCGI:

         #!/usr/bin/speedy

         use strict;

         use CGI;
         use CGI::Cache;

         use vars qw($COUNTER);

         # Set up cache
         CGI::Cache::setup();

         $COUNTER++;

         my $cgi = new CGI;

         CGI::Cache::set_key($cgi->Vars);

         # This should short-circuit the rest of the program if a cache value is
         # already there
         CGI::Cache::start() or exit;

         print $cgi->header, "\n";

         print<<EOF;
         <html>
         <head><title>SpeedyCGI</title></head>
         <body>Counter: $COUNTER PID: $$</body>
         </html>
         EOF

         CGI::Cache::stop();
