NAME
       HTML::Diff - compare two HTML strings and return a list of differences

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::Diff;

        $result = html_word_diff($left_text, $right_text);

DESCRIPTION
       This module compares two strings of HTML and returns a list of a chunks
       which indicate the diff between the two input strings, where changes in
       formatting are considered changes.

       HTML::Diff does not strictly parse the HTML. Instead, it uses regular
       expressions to make a decent effort at understanding the given HTML.
       As a result, there are many valid HTML documents for which it will not
       produce the correct answer. But there may be some invalid HTML
       documents for which it gives you the answer you're looking for. Your
       mileage may vary; test it on lots of inputs from your domain before
       relying on it.

       Returns a reference to a list of triples [<flag>, <left>, <right>].
       Each triple represents a check of the input texts. The flag tells you
       whether it represents a deletion, insertion, a modification, or an
       unchanged chunk.

       Every character of each input text is accounted for by some triple in
       the output. Specifically, Concatenating all the <left> members from the
       return value should produce $left_text, and likewise the <right>
       members concatenate together to produce $right_text.

       The <flag> is either 'u', '+', '-', or 'c', indicating whether the two
       chunks are the same, the $right_text contained this chunk and the left
       chunk didn't, or vice versa, or the two chunks are simply different.
       This follows the usage of Algorithm::Diff.

       The difference is computed on a word-by-word basis, "breaking" on
       visible words in the HTML text. If a tag only is changed, it will not
       be returned as an independent chunk but will be shown as a change to
       one of the neighboring words. For balanced tags, such as <b> </b>, it
       is intended that a change to the tag will be treated as a change to all
       words in between.

SEE ALSO
       Algorithm::Diff provides the diff algorithm used in this module.

       XML::Diff can generate a diff between two XML files, and also patch an
       XML file, given a diff.
