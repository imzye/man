NAME
       heXcalc - programmers calculator for X

SYNOPSIS
       heXcalc [standard X options]

DESCRIPTION
       heXcalc is a mutli-radix calculator that offers the standard C integer
       operations.

OPTIONS
       The standard X toolkit options.

OPERATION
       Calculator Modes: The calculator operates in several modes. The modes
       are controlled by buttons on the calculator. The current mode setting
       is indicated by setting the corresponding button to "insensitive".


       Pointer Usage: All operations are done with the Button1 (usually
       leftmost button on the pointer).  These can be changed using the
       translation manager.


       button Usage: Most of the buttons are self explanatory (for C
       programmers).  The others are explained below.


       16/32 buttons: These buttons toggle the calculator between 16 and 32
       bit mode.

       sgn/usgn buttons: These buttons determine whether data is treated as
       signed (2's complement) or unsinged.


       CE/C button: Clears the current entry without affecting other settings
       of the calculator.


       C button: Clears everything.  The display and memory are set to zero.
       The mode is set to signed, 32 bit decimal.


KEYBOARD EQUIVALENTS
       All calculator buttons are also available from the keyboard.  The
       default bindings are shown below.

              =            =
             Return             =


       You can rebind the keys to your liking using the X defaults file.  The
       action 'doKey("string")' makes the calculator behave as though the
       button labeled "string" was hit.  For example


            <Key>Return:          DoKey(=)
       binds the return key to act as though the equals button was pressed.


RESOURCES
       heXcalc consists of a a vPaned widget ("wholePane") with two panes. The
       top pane is a label widget ("display"). The bottom half is a from
       widget ("buttonForm") holding the command widgets that make up the
       calculator buttons. The buttons are named in such that groups of
       buttons have the same name. This allows like buttons to be assigned
       similar colors with a single entry in the .Xdefaults file.  These
       groups are:

            Name           Buttons

            baseKey        dec, hex, oct, bin
            controlKey     off, C, CE/C
            evalKey        (, ), =
            sizeKey        16, 32
            signKey        sgn, usgn
            memKey         Stro, Rcl, Clr
            shiftKey       <<, >>
            digitKey       [0-9a-f]
            arithKey       +, -, *, /
            bitKey         ~, |, &, ^
            +/-            +/-

       Two actions are supported. "DoKey" (described above) and "Delete" with
       deletes the last digit button pressed.

BUGS
       Shift operations probably should have the shift count always
       interpreted as decimal.

       Overflow detection on input leaves something to be desired.
