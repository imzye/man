VERIFY_KRB5_CONF(8)     FreeBSD System Manager's Manual    VERIFY_KRB5_CONF(8)

NAME
     verify_krb5_conf – checks krb5.conf for obvious errors

SYNOPSIS
     verify_krb5_conf [config-file]

DESCRIPTION
     verify_krb5_conf reads the configuration file krb5.conf, or the file
     given on the command line, parses it, checking verifying that the syntax
     is not correctly wrong.

     If the file is syntactically correct, verify_krb5_conf tries to verify
     that the contents of the file is of relevant nature.

ENVIRONMENT
     KRB5_CONFIG points to the configuration file to read.

FILES
     /etc/krb5.conf  Kerberos 5 configuration file

DIAGNOSTICS
     Possible output from verify_krb5_conf include:

     <path>: failed to parse <something> as size/time/number/boolean
             Usually means that <something> is misspelled, or that it contains
             weird characters. The parsing done by verify_krb5_conf is more
             strict than the one performed by libkrb5, so strings that work in
             real life might be reported as bad.

     <path>: host not found (<hostname>)
             Means that <path> is supposed to point to a host, but it can't be
             recognised as one.

     <path>: unknown or wrong type
             Means that <path> is either a string when it should be a list,
             vice versa, or just that verify_krb5_conf is confused.

     <path>: unknown entry
             Means that <string> is not known by verify_krb5_conf.

SEE ALSO
     krb5.conf(5)

BUGS
     Since each application can put almost anything in the config file, it's
     hard to come up with a watertight verification process. Most of the
     default settings are sanity checked, but this does not mean that every
     problem is discovered, or that everything that is reported as a possible
     problem actually is one. This tool should thus be used with some care.

     It should warn about obsolete data, or bad practice, but currently
     doesn't.
