Dancer::Plugin::Memcached(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Dancer::Plugin::Memcached - Cache response content to memcached

SYNOPSIS
       This plugin gives Dancer the ability to get and store page content in a
       memcached server, which in specific configurations could give a
       performance boost - particulary on GET requests that incur significant
       database calls.

       In your configuration, a list of servers with port numbers needs to be
       defined.

           plugins:
               Memcached:
               servers:
                   - "10.0.0.15:11211"
               - "10.0.0.17:11211"
                   default_timeout: 86400

       The "default_timeout" specifies an fallback time for keys to expire
       from the cache. If this value is less than 60*60*24*30 (30 days), time
       is assumed to be seconds after the key was stored. If larger, it's
       considered an absolute Unix time.

       In your package:

           package MyWebService;
           use Dancer;
           use Dancer::Plugin::Memcached;

           get '/' sub => {
               # Do your logic here
           ...
               memcached_set template($foo);
           };

       This plugin will use the PATH_INFO environment variable to store as the
       key so routes that make use of parameters in the form of "/foo/:bar"
       will be cached, but GET/POST variables will not.

KEYWORDS
   memcached_check
       Will check for any route and return the page stored in memcached where
       available.

   memcached_set($content, [$expiration])
       For any given content, set and return the content. Expiration time for
       the set can optionally be set.

   memcached_get($key)
       Grab a specified key. Returns false if the key is not found.

   memcached_store($key, $content, [$expiration])
       This keyword is identical to memcached_set with the exception that you
       can set any key name.
