NAME
       ngrams - Compute the ngram frequencies and produce tables to the
       stdout.

SYNOPIS
         ngram [--version] [--help] [--n=3] [--normalize] [--type=TYPE]
               [--orderby=ORD] [--onlyfirst=N] [input files]

DESCRIPTION
       This script produces n-grams tables of the input files to the standard
       ouput.

       Options:

       --normalize
           Prints normalized n-gram frequencies; i.e., the n-gram counts
           divided by the total number of n-grams of the same size.

       --onlyfirst=NUMBER
           Prints only the first NUMBER n-grams for each n.  See Text::Ngrams
           module.

       --limit=NUMBER
           Limit the total number of distinct n-grams (for efficiency reasons,
           the counts may not be correct at the end).

       --version
           Prints version.

       --help
           Prints help.

       --n=NUMBER
           N-gram size, produces 3-grams by default.

       --orderby=frequency|ngram
           The n-gram order.  See Text::Ngrams module.

       --type=character|byte|word|utf8
           Type of n-grams produces. See Text::Ngrams module.
