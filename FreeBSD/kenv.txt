KENV(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                KENV(1)

NAME
     kenv – dump or modify the kernel environment

SYNOPSIS
     kenv [-hNq]
     kenv [-qv] variable[=value]
     kenv [-q] -u variable

DESCRIPTION
     The kenv utility will dump the kernel environment if invoked without
     arguments.  If the -h option is specified, it will limit the report to
     kernel probe hints.  If an optional variable name is specified, kenv will
     only report that value.  If the -N option is specified, kenv will only
     display variable names and not their values.  If the -u option is
     specified, kenv will delete the given environment variable.  If the
     environment variable is followed by an optional value, kenv will set the
     environment variable to this value.

     If the -q option is set, warnings normally printed as a result of being
     unable to perform the requested operation will be suppressed.

     If the -v option is set, the variable name will be printed out for the
     environment variable in addition to the value when kenv is executed with
     a variable name.

     Variables can be added to the kernel environment using the
     /boot/loader.conf file, or also statically compiled into the kernel using
     the statement

           env filename

     in the kernel config file.  The file can contain lines of the form

           name = value # this is a comment

     where whitespace around ‘name’ and ‘=’, and everything after a ‘#’
     character, are ignored.  Almost any printable character except ‘=’ is
     acceptable as part of a name.  Quotes are optional and necessary only if
     the value contains whitespace.
