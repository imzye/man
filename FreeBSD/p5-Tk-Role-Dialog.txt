           }
           sub _valid {
               # called when user clicked the 'ok' button
               $self->close;
           }


           # in your main program
           use Your::Tk::Dialog::Class;
           # create & show a new dialog
           Your::Tk::Dialog::Class->new( parent => $main_window );

DESCRIPTION
       Tk::Role::Dialog is meant to be used as a Moose role to be composed for
       easy Tk dialogs creation.

       It will create a new toplevel with a title, and possibly a header as
       well as some buttons.

       One can create the middle part of the dialog by providing a
       _build_gui() method, that will receive a Tk::Frame where widgets are
       supposed to be placed.

       The attributes (see below) can be either defined as defaults using the
       _build_attr() methods, or passed arguments to the constructor call.
       The only mandatory attribute is "parent", but you'd better provide some
       other attributes if you want your dialog to be somehow usable! :-)

ATTRIBUTES
   parent
       The parent window of the dialog, required.

   hidden
       Whether the dialog should popup or stay hidden after creation. Default
       to false, which means the dialog is shown.

   icon
       The path to an image to be used as window icon. Default to empty string
       (meaning no customized window icon), but not required.

   title
       The dialog title, default to "tk dialog".

   header
       A header (string) to display at the top of the window. Default to empty
       string, meaning no header.

   image
       The path to an image to be displayed alongside the dialog text. Not
       taken into account if "text" attribute is empty. Default to empty
       string, meaning no image.

   text
       Some text to be displayed, for simple information dialog boxes. Default
       to empty string, meaning dialog is to be filled by providing a
       _build_gui() method. Can be combined with an "image" attribute for
       enhanced appearance.

   resizable
       A boolean to control whether the dialog can be resized or not
       (default).

   ok
       A string to display as validation button label. Default to empty
       string, meaning no validation button. The validation action will call
       "$self->_valid()".

   cancel
       A string to display as cancellation button label. Default to empty
       string, meaning no cancellation button. The cancel action is to just
       close the dialog.

   hide
       A string to display as hiding button label. Default to empty string,
       meaning no hiding button. The hiding action is to just hide the dialog
       (think "withdraw").

METHODS
   close
           $dialog->close;

       Request to destroy the dialog.
