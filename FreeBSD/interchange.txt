NAME
       compile_link -- compile and copy Interchange link CGI

VERSION
       1.0

SYNOPSIS
          compile_link [-p NNNN] [-s sfile] [-h host] [-w N] \\
                       [--perl] [-nf] [-o outputfile] [-b dir] [-s dir]

DESCRIPTION
       The "compile_link" program configures (including compilation if
       necessary) a link CGI for talking to the Interchange server daemon.

       If the --perl option is given, it will not compile but instead use the
       tlink.pl program, setting its variables as needed.

       Designed to be used in conjunction with Interchange's makecat.

OPTIONS
       -b dir, --build=dir
           Sets the directory where the build files will be made. Default is
           "src" in the Interchange software directory.

       -h hostname, --host=hostname
           Sets the host address or host name that should be compiled into the
           TCP-based link program.  This sets the default, which still can be
           overridden by "MINIVEND_HOST" in the environment of the executing
           process.

       -p NNNN, --port=NNNN
           Sets the port number that should be compiled into the TCP-based
           link program.  This sets the default, which still can be overridden
           by "MINIVEND_PORT" in the environment of the executing process. The
           port must be higher than 1024.

       -s sfile, --socket=sfile
           The name of the UNIX-domain socket file which should be compiled
           into the UNIX-domain link program. This sets the default, which
           still can be overridden by "MINIVEND_SOCKET" in the environment of
           the executing process.

       --source=dir
           Sets the directory containing the source files. Default is "src" in
           the Interchange software directory.

       -w N, --timeout=N
           The number of seconds the link program should wait for a connection
           before sending its timeout page.
