VM_MAP_WIRE(9)         FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual        VM_MAP_WIRE(9)

NAME
     vm_map_wire, vm_map_unwire – manage page wiring within a virtual memory
     map

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/vm_map.h>

     int
     vm_map_wire(vm_map_t map, vm_offset_t start, vm_offset_t end, int flags);

     int
     vm_map_unwire(vm_map_t map, vm_offset_t start, vm_offset_t end,
         int flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_map_wire() function is responsible for wiring pages in the range
     between start and end within the map map.  Wired pages are locked into
     physical memory, and may not be paged out as long as their wire count
     remains above zero.

     The vm_map_unwire() function performs the corresponding unwire operation.

     The flags argument is a bit mask, consisting of the following flags:

     If the VM_MAP_WIRE_USER flag is set, the function operates within user
     address space.

     If the VM_MAP_WIRE_HOLESOK flag is set, it may operate upon an arbitrary
     range within the address space of map.

     If a contiguous range is desired, callers should explicitly express their
     intent by specifying the VM_MAP_WIRE_NOHOLES flag.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     Both functions will attempt to acquire a lock on the map using
     vm_map_lock(9) and hold it for the duration of the call.  If they detect
     MAP_ENTRY_IN_TRANSITION, they will call vm_map_unlock_and_wait(9) until
     the map becomes available again.

     The map could have changed during this window as it was held by another
     consumer, therefore consumers of this interface should check for this
     condition using the return values below.

RETURN VALUES
     The vm_map_wire() and vm_map_unwire() functions have identical return
     values.  The functions return KERN_SUCCESS if all pages within the range
     were [un]wired successfully.

     Otherwise, if the specified range was not valid, or if the map changed
     while the MAP_ENTRY_IN_TRANSITION flag was set, KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS is
     returned.
