NAME
       yydecode - decode yEnc encoded files

SYNOPSIS
       yydecode [-b|--write-broken] [-r|--remove-broken] [-e|--evil-filenames]
              [-f|--force-overwrite] [-l|--large-parts]
              [-o|--output-file=FILE] [-v|--verbose] FILE ...

       yydecode [-h|--help]

       yydecode [-V|--version]

DESCRIPTION
       yydecode started life as a decoder for yEnc encoded binaries, which
       have recently appeared on Usenet.  yydecode works almost identically to
       the infamous uudecode program. Version 0.2.8 and onwards contains a
       superset of uudecode's functionality, (ie. decodes standard uuencoded
       files, as well as Base64 [RFC2045] encoded files produced by uuencode)
       and hence can be used as a drop-in replacement in all circumstances.

EXAMPLES
       Given a selection of parts saved by your newsreader across msg-1.txt,
       msg-2.txt and msg-3.txt, any of the following (plus many more
       variations on the incantation) will correctly decode the file(s):

       $ yydecode msg-1.txt msg-2.txt msg-3.txt

       $ cat msg-1.txt msg-2.txt msg-3.txt | yydecode

OPTIONS
       -o, --output-file=FILE
              Direct all output to FILE (use "-" for stdout). See BUGS below.

       -D, --directory=DIR
              Write output files to DIR instead of the current working
              directory.

       -e, --evil-filename
              Allow evil filenames with e.g. high ASCII and shell
              metacharacters. Use twice to allow any character. (DANGEROUS!)
              Otherwise, any such characters are converted to an underscore
              ("_").

       -c, --clobber-filename
              Append a counter to the filename if it already exists. Has no
              effect if --force-overwrite is also used.

       -f, --force-overwrite
              Overwrite (truncate) the output file, if it exists. Behaves
              differently when used in conjunction with --write-broken.

       -b, --write-broken
              Write decoded parts even if they are verified to be broken. The
              output file will not be renamed to file.broken.

              When used in conjunction with --force-overwrite, the output file
              will not be truncated. Thus one can decode e.g. a two part
              multi-part file in stages by invoking:

              $ yydecode -f -b msg-1.txt ; yydecode -f -b msg-2.txt

              Note that yydecode cannot check for missing parts when used in
              this way.  This is intended to allow one to preview certain
              media files which may be usable without being complete.

              For uuencoded files, this option causes short lines not to be
              padded, and overlong ones not to be truncated. Be aware that the
              file will be zero padded up to a multiple of three bytes when
              used with output generated by most implementations (e.g. GNU
              sharutils) of uuencode that output more characters than strictly
              necessary.

       -i, --broken-encoder
              Certain encoders outputs a file CRC of 00000001 regardless of
              the actual input. This option tells yydecode to ignore such
              CRCs, and issue a warning. Please pester the sender to upgrade
              their software if you see this.

       -r, --remove-broken
              Remove instead of renaming broken files. When used in
              conjunction with --write-broken, yydecode renames the file
              instead.

       -l, --large-parts
              Expect parts larger than 8192k (changable at compile-time).
              Because yydecode decodes each part in memory before writing it
              to disk, it needs to allocate enough memory to hold each part.
              There is a soft limit of 8192k to guard against parts with
              broken headers which specify ridiculously large part sizes. This
              switch disables the check.

       -h, --help
              Display a short help message, and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase verbosity.

       -V, --version
              Print the version information, and exit.

BUGS
       When using --output-file with stdout ("-"), data is written in the
       order in which it is received; no attempt is made to reorder the
       encoded input. When used with a file output, only the first encoded
       file encountered will be decoded -- subsequent ones will fail with an
       error complaining about the existing output file. There is no intention
       to fix this.
