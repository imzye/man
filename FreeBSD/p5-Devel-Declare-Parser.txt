Devel::Declare::Interface(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Devel::Declare::Interface - Interface to Devel-Declare parsers.

DESCRIPTION
       A higher level interface to Devel-Declare. This is the package you will
       interact with the most when using Devel::Declare::Parser.

SYNOPSIS
           package My::Keyword::Method;
           use strict;
           use warnings;

           use Devel::Declare::Parser;

           # Look at Exporter-Declare to have most of this done for you.
           sub import {
               my $class = shift;
               my $destination = caller;

               enhance( $destination, "make_method", "method" );
               no strict 'refs';
               *{ $destination . '::make_method' } = \&my_keyword;
           }

           sub make_method {
               my ( $name, $code ) = @_;
               my $dest = caller;
               no strict 'refs';
               *{ $destination . '::' . $name } = $code;
           }

           1;

API
       The following functions are all exported by default.

       register_parser( $name )
       register_parser( $name, $class )
           Register a parser under a short name. If $class is not provided
           caller will be used.

       get_parser( $name );
           Get the parser class by short name.

       enhance( $dest_class, $name, $parser );
       enhance( $dest_class, $name, $parser, $type );
           Make $name a keyword in $dest_class that uses $parser. $parser can
           be a short name or class name. $type defaults to 'const'.

FENNEC PROJECT
       This module is part of the Fennec project. See Fennec for more details.
       Fennec is a project to develop an extendable and powerful testing
       framework.  Together the tools that make up the Fennec framework
       provide a potent testing environment.

       The tools provided by Fennec are also useful on their own. Sometimes a
       tool created for Fennec is useful outside the greator framework. Such
       tools are turned into their own projects. This is one such project.

       Fennec - The core framework
         The primary Fennec project that ties them all together.
