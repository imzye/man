SDB(1)                          CSNOBOL4 Manual                         SDB(1)

NAME
       sdb - SNOBOL4 debugger

SYNOPSIS
       sdb [ options ... ] program.sno

DESCRIPTION
       sdb is a debugger for snobol4(1) programs, in the mold (clawning fone)
       of gdb(1), The GNU debugger.  sdb(1) uses readline(3) for command line
       editing/history when available.

   Commands
       break LABEL_OR_STATEMENT_NUMBER
           Set a breakpoint.

       bt
           Display call stack back trace.

       commands BREAKPOINT_NUMBER
           Add sdb commands to execute (ie; print & continue) to a breakpoint.

       condition BREAKPOINT_NUMBER [ EXPR ]
           If EXPR is supplied, it is used as a predicate to make the
           breakpoint conditional, if no EXPR is supplied, any previous
           condition is removed.

       continue [ COUNT ]
           Continue from breakpoint.  The optional count specifies how many
           times to continue past this breakpoint (sets ignore count).

       delete [ BREAKPOINT_NUMBER ]
           Delete a single breakpoint, or all breakpoints.

       disable [ BREAKPOINT_NUMBER ]
           Temporarily disable a breakpoint, or all breakpoints.

       enable [ BREAKPOINT_NUMBER ]
           Re-enable a breakpoint, or all breakpoints.

       finish
           Resume debugging after current function returns.  Will display
           function return type and value, if any.

       help
           Display help.

       ignore BREAKPOINT_NUMBER [ COUNT ]
           Set (or clear) breakpoint ignore count.

       info
           Display list of breakpoints and their status.

       list [ LABEL_OR_STATEMENT_NUMBER ]
           Display source code.

       next [ COUNT ]
           Single step execution, skipping over function calls.

       print EXPRESSION
           Evaluate expression and print result.  Can be used to call
           functions, or set variables.

       quit
           Exit debugger.

       run
           Restart program (works by saving breakpoints and restarting
           snobol4).  New in version 2.1, some restrictions may apply.

       save FILENAME
           Save breakpoints to file.

       source FILENAME
           Read sdb commands from file.

       step [ COUNT ]
           Single step.

       watch VARIABLE
           Set watchpoint on a variable (break when value changes).

       what EXPRESSION
           Display the datatype of expression.

       where
           An alias for bt.

       A blank line repeats the previous command.

       Non-ambiguous abbreviations of commands can be used (ie; s, n).

       The GNU Readline library (when available) will be used for sdb(1) input
       for command editing and history.

       The keyboard interrupt character (eg; Control-C) will stop a running
       program and return control to the sdb(1) command prompt.

       If your program calls the SDB() function, it will act as a breakpoint.
       You can check whether sdb(1) is loaded with the FUNCTION() predicate,
       ie;

                   FUNCTION('SDB') SDB()

FILES
       ~/.sdbinit
           initial command file, read on startup.

       .sdb_history
           saved command history

       /tmp/sdb_listing.pid
           temporary listing file for sdb.sno to read

       /tmp/sdb_bkpts.pid
           temporary breakpoint save file for "run" command

LIMITATIONS
       sdb(1) uses a wide variety of system facilities and will interact
       poorly with any programs that use any number of features, including:

       •      Altering listing settings with directive/control lines.

       •      Altering &STLIMIT, &ERRLIMIT, or &TRACE.

       •      Calling SETEXIT()

BUGS
       If you try to put a breakpoint on a label or line with no code or goto
       fields, the breakpoint will never be triggered.

       You cannot put a breakpoint on the END label (however control always
       returns to sdb when the END label is reached).

       Interrupt character trapping is in it's infancy, and only occurs at the
       start of a each statement executed.

       The interrupt character is silently ignored when at the sdb command
       prompt.

       Leaves an unprotected listing file of the sources in the /tmp directory
       (create a protected directory?).

       ``quit'' and ``run'' commands say program is running even if first line
       of the program has not yet been executed!

       Some fatal errors cannot be trapped, and sdb will be terminated.
