CLOUDABI(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            CLOUDABI(4)

NAME
     cloudabi, cloudabi32, cloudabi64 – CloudABI support

SYNOPSIS
     Support for 32-bit CloudABI executables can be compiled into the kernel
     by adding this line to the kernel configuration file:

           options COMPAT_CLOUDABI32

     Similarly, support for 64-bit CloudABI executables can be enabled by
     adding this line:

           options COMPAT_CLOUDABI64

     CloudABI support can also be loaded at boot time from loader.conf(5):

           cloudabi_load="YES"
           cloudabi32_load="YES"
           cloudabi64_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE
     cloudabi support is not present in FreeBSD 14.0.

DESCRIPTION
     CloudABI is a POSIX-like pure capability-based runtime environment,
     similar to capsicum(4).  It can be used to develop applications that are
     cross-platform, easier to test, and hardened against security exploits.

     Support for CloudABI on FreeBSD consists of three separate kernel
     modules.  The cloudabi kernel module implements all of the system calls
     that do not depend on data structures that differ between hardware
     architectures.

     The cloudabi32 and cloudabi64 kernel modules provide implementations of
     all of the machine-dependent system calls, assuming that pointers stored
     in data structures are either 32 bits or 64 bits in size.  These modules
     also provide the image activators that load and start ELF executables.

     Though the cloudabi module can be loaded on any architecture supported by
     FreeBSD, the cloudabi32 module is only available on amd64, arm64, armv6,
     armv7 and i386.  The same holds for the cloudabi64 module, which is only
     available for amd64 and arm64.

     A full cross compilation toolchain for CloudABI is available in the
     devel/cloudabi-toolchain port.

     The sysutils/cloudabi-utils port provides the cloudabi-run(1) utility.
     cloudabi-run(1) can be used to safely execute CloudABI processes with
     access to a restricted set of resources.
