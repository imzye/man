IPV6MON.CONF(5)           FreeBSD File Formats Manual          IPV6MON.CONF(5)

NAME
       ipv6mon.conf - Configuration file for the IPv6 address monitoring
       daemon (ipv6mon)

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/etc/ipv6mon.conf

DESCRIPTION
       This file controls the operation of the ipv6mon daemon. It aloows the
       system administrator to configure parameters such as:

           + Network interface card to use for address monitoring
           + Type of probe packets to use
           + Various timing paramaters (such as probe frequency)

       The configuration file follows the following general format:

             # Comments
             Variable1=Value1  # Comments
             Variable2=Value2


       The following configuration options are currently supported:

       NetworkInterface
              This variable specifies the network interface that will be used
              for IPv6 address monitoring.

       AddressLogFile
              This variable specifies the pathname of the log file where
              address usage will be recorded. If left unspecified, the
              pathname defaults to /var/log/ipv6mon.log.

       LockFile
              This variable is used to specify the pathname of the lockfile
              (PID file) to be used to easily identify running instances of
              ipv6mon /var/run/ipv6mon.pid.

       UnprivilegedUser
              This variable specifies the unprivileged username that will
              switch to (i.e., setuid), such that superuser privileges are
              released. If left unspecified, it defaults to ipv6mon

       UnprivilegedGroup
              This variable specifies the unprivileged group that ipv6mon will
              switch to (i.e., setgid), such that superuser privileges are
              released. If left unspecified, it defaults to ipv6mon

       TimestampFormat
              This option specifies the format to be used for the timestamps
              that are included in the log file. Possible values are date and
              epoch.  The former causes the tool to include the timestamps in
              the format “Sat Dec 24 05:24:50 2011”, whereas the latter causes
              the tool to include timestamps as the number of seconds since
              the Epoch. If left unspecified, this option defaults to date

       MaxAddressEntries
              This variable specifies the maximum number of addresses that
              ipv6mon will keep track of at any given time. Since ipv6mon
              keeps the list of currently-used addresses in memory (such that
              they can be probed on a regular basis), the variable
              MaxAddressEntries indirectly enforces a limit on the amount of
              system memory that ipv6mon will use.

       MaxCandidateEntries
              This variable specifies the maximum number of "candidate
              addresses" that ipv6mon will create at any given time. If left
              unspecified, it defaults to MaxAddressEntries / 4.

       AddressTimeout
              This variable specifies the amount of time (in seconds) after
              which an IPv6 address will be considered “unused” if no response
              is received from that address.

       CandidateAddressTimeout
              This variable specifies the amount of time (in seconds) after
              which a “candidate” IPv6 address will be considered “unused” if
              no response is received from such address. Since candidate
              addresses are created as a result of a heuristics (rather than
              in response to packets originated from such addresses),
              CandidateAddressTimeout will typically be shorter than
              AddressTimeout , such that system resources are not tied to
              these (possibly unused) addresses for an unnecessarily long
              period of time.

       MaxUnprobedInterval
              This variable specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds)
              that an address will remain “unprobed”. For obvious reasons, its
              value should be smaller than that of AddressTimeout and that of
              CandidateAddressTimeout , and should also usually account for
              more than one probe packet to be sent before an address is
              "timed out".

       UnicastProbeInterval
              This variable specifies the amount of time (in seconds) between
              unicast probes sent to an IPv6 address. Once MaxUnprobedInterval
              seconds have elapsed without probing an addresses, unicast
              probes will be sent every UnicastProbeInterval seconds until a
              response is received or the address is timed out.

       McastEchoProbeInterval
              This variable specifies the amount of time (in seconds) between
              ICMPv6 Echo Request probe packets sent to the all-nodes on-link
              multicast address (ff02::1). Multicast Echo Request packets can
              easily detect newly attached devices and probe existing devices.
              However, because they are sent to a multicast address, the
              interval should be long enough such that unnecessary traffic
              spikes are reduced.

              Note: Some operating systems (notably Windows Vista and Windows
              7) will not respond to ICMPv6 echo request messages sent to a
              multicast address. However, such systems can still be detected
              by means of probe packets that include an unsupported option of
              type 10xxxxxx.


       McastUnrecProbeInterval
              This variable specifies the amount of time (in seconds) between
              ICMPv6 Echo Request probe packets (containing an unrecognized
              option in a Destination Options header) sent to the all-nodes
              on-link multicast address (ff02::1). Multicast Echo Request
              packets can easily detect newly attached devices and probe
              existing devices. However, because they are sent to a multicast
              address, the interval should be long enough such that
              unnecessary traffic spikes are reduced.



       ProbeType
              This variable specifies the type of probe packets that will be
              used for both unicast and multicast probes.  echo specifies that
              only regular ICMPv6 Echo Request messages should be used.  unrec
              specifies that only ICMPv6 Echo Request messages with an
              unsupported option should be used.  all specifies that both
              types of probe packets should be used. If left unspecified, this
              option defaults to all
