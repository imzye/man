PIXD(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                PIXD(1)

NAME
     pixd – colourful binary file visualizer

SYNOPSIS
     pixd [-r range] [-w width] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     pixd visualizes binary data by mapping each octet to a colour according
     to a palette, displaying the octet at a given number of columns per line.
     pixd will process the files specified as arguments, or standard input if
     none are provided.

     Note that pixd uses 24-bit colour SGR sequences and the U+2580 UPPER HALF
     BLOCK glyph for rendering.  This means that your terminal emulator needs
     to support both Unicode and 24-bit colour sequences.

     The default palette maps the high nibble into a hue, and the low nibble
     into a brightness value.  The hues used are black (0x00), red-orange
     (0x01..0x1F), yellow (0x20..0x3F), green (0x40..0x7F), cyan-blue
     (0x80..0xBF), purple-pink (0xC0..0xFE), and white (0xFF).

OPTIONS
     If no file operands are specified, standard input is read instead.
     Available options are listed below.

     -r range
             Range of octets to print from each file.  Specified as either
             start-end or start+count, where start and end/count are positive
             integers specified in either decimal, hexadecimal or octal (C-
             style notation).

             When the former syntax is used, both ends of the range are
             optional and default to the start or end of the file when
             omitted.

     -w width
             Number of octets per line, separated into groups (see -g).  Set
             to 64 by default.

ENVIRONMENT
     PIXD_COLORS can be used to override the colour palette.  If set, it
     should consist of 256 whitespace-separated hex colours; each colour has
     to be exactly 6 hexadecimal digits representing a 24-bit colour (e.g.
     FFFF00 for yellow).

EXAMPLES
     Here are some examples of useful uses of hexd's features.

     pixd -r0x1000+0x200 foo.bin
             Display the 512-byte range in 'foo.bin' starting at offset
             0x1000.  Useful when files contain other embedded files/formats
             at a certain location (e.g. archive files).

     pixd -r-0x400 *.bin
             Show the first 1024 bytes of each of the *.bin files, with a
             heading above each file (if more than one).  This is useful for
             example to compare headers of several samples of an unknown
             format.

     curl -s http://example.com | pixd | less -R
             pixd works as a filter, too.  For paging, less(1)'s -R flag is
             useful.
