Lingua::EN::Inflect::Number(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Lingua::EN::Inflect::Number - Force number of words to singular or
       plural

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::EN::Inflect::Number qw(
           number to_S to_PL # Or anything you want from Lingua::EN::Inflect
         );

         print number("goat");  # "s" - there's only one goat
         print number("goats"); # "p" - there's several goats
         print number("sheep"); # "ambig" - there could be one or many sheep

         print to_S("goats");   # "goat"
         print to_PL("goats");  # "goats" - it already is
         print to_S("goat");    # "goat" - it already is
         print to_S("sheep");   # "sheep"

DESCRIPTION
       This module extends the functionality of Lingua::EN::Inflect with three
       new functions available for export:

   number
       This takes a word, and determines its number. It returns "s" for
       singular, "p" for plural, and "ambig" for words that can be either
       singular or plural.

       Based on that:

   to_S / to_PL
       These take a word and convert it forcefully either to singular or to
       plural. "Lingua::EN::Inflect" does funny things if you try to pluralise
       an already-plural word, but this module does the right thing.

DISCLAIMER
       The whole concept is based on several undocumented features and
       idiosyncracies in the way Lingua::EN::Inflect works. Because of this,
       the module only works reliably on nouns. It's also possible that these
       idiosyncracies will be fixed at some point in the future and this
       module will need to be rethought. But it works at the moment.
       Additionally, any disclaimers on Lingua::EN::Inflect apply double here.
