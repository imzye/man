HOSTNAME(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            HOSTNAME(1)

NAME
     hostname – set or print name of current host system

SYNOPSIS
     hostname [-f] [-s | -d] [name-of-host]

DESCRIPTION
     The hostname utility prints the name of the current host.  The super-user
     can set the hostname by supplying an argument; this is usually done in
     the initialization script /etc/rc.d/hostname, normally run at boot time.
     This script uses the hostname variable in /etc/rc.conf.

     Options:

     -f    Include domain information in the printed name.  This is the
           default behavior.

     -s    Trim off any domain information from the printed name.

     -d    Only print domain information.
