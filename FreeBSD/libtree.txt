NAME
       libtree - print shared object dependencies as a tree

SYNOPSIS
       libtree [ option ]... [--] [ file ]...

DESCRIPTION
       libtree prints the shared libraries required by each program or shared
       library on the command line as a tree. By default certain common system
       libraries are hidden to prune the tree.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print usage

       --version
              Print version info

       -p, --path
              Show the path of libraries instead of their soname

       -v     Show libraries skipped by default

       -vv    Show dependencies of libraries skipped by default

       -vvv   Show dependencies of already encountered libraries

       --ldconf arg
              Path to custom ld.so.conf or ld-elf.so.conf file

       --max-depth n
              Limit library traversal to a depth of at most n . The value
              cannot be larger than 32.

       --     All arguments after '--' are interpreted as paths, not flags.

ENVIRONMENT
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH can be used to provide additional search paths.
