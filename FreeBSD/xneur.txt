XNEUR(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               XNEUR(1)

NAME
       XNeur - in-place conversion of text typed in with a wrong keyboard
       layout

SYNOPSIS
       xneur [options]

DESCRIPTION
       When users work in a multilingual environment (e.g., Russian+English),
       they sometimes type in a text with a wrong keyboard layout. In auto
       mode, XNeur can detect the language of the word the user tried to type,
       automatically switch keyboard layouts and convert that word into
       correct keyboard layout. In manual mode it allows the user to convert
       last typed word or some selected text into another keyboard layout with
       hotkeys. The main idea of this utility is similar to that of Punto
       Switcher for MS Windows. Currently XNeur supports Armenian, Belarusian,
       Bulgarian, Czech, Georgian, German, Greek, English, Estonian, French,
       Kazakh, Lithuanian, Latvian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish,
       Ukrainian and Uzbek languages. Stay tuned for more...
