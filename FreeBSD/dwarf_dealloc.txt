DESCRIPTION
     The function dwarf_dealloc() is used by applications to indicate that
     memory areas returned by DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf) may be
     safely disposed off.  Due to the way memory is managed in the current
     implementation, the use of dwarf_dealloc() is only necessary for a small
     set of DWARF types.

     Argument dbg should reference a valid debugging context allocated using
     dwarf_init(3).

     Argument ptr should point to an object or memory area obtained by a prior
     call to a DWARF(3) function.

     Argument type indicates the type of object being deallocated.  The
     indicated type must match that of the object being passed in argument
     ptr.  Valid values for the type argument are:

     DW_DLA_ABBREV           An object of type Dwarf_Abbrev, as returned by a
                             call to the function dwarf_get_abbrev(3).

     DW_DLA_DIE              An object of type Dwarf_Die, as returned by calls
                             to the functions dwarf_child(3), dwarf_offdie(3)
                             or dwarf_siblingof(3).

     DW_DLA_FRAME_BLOCK      An array of objects of type Dwarf_Frame_op, as
                             returned by a call to the function
                             dwarf_expand_frame_instructions(3).

     Calls to dwarf_dealloc() with other values for argument type are no-ops
     in this implementation.

     The functions dwarf_fde_cie_list_dealloc(), dwarf_funcs_dealloc(),
     dwarf_globals_dealloc(), dwarf_pubtypes_dealloc(),
     dwarf_ranges_dealloc(), dwarf_srclines_dealloc(), dwarf_types_dealloc(),
     dwarf_vars_dealloc() and dwarf_weaks_dealloc() are provided for
     compatibility with other implementations of the DWARF(3) API.  Due to the
     way memory is managed in the current implementation, these functions are
     effectively no-ops.

     See dwarf(3) for more information about the memory management scheme in
     this implementation of the DWARF(3) API.

RETURN VALUES
     Functions dwarf_dealloc(), dwarf_fde_cie_list_dealloc(),
     dwarf_funcs_dealloc(), dwarf_globals_dealloc(), dwarf_pubtypes_dealloc(),
     dwarf_ranges_dealloc(), dwarf_srclines_dealloc(), dwarf_types_dealloc(),
     dwarf_vars_dealloc() and dwarf_weaks_dealloc() have no return value.
