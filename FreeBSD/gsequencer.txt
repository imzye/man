NAME
       gsequencer - Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer is an audio sequencer and
       composition editor

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/bin/gsequencer [--help] [--version] [--no-builtin-theme]
                           [--non-unique] [--menu-bar] [--filename file]
                           [--no-config]

DESCRIPTION
       Advanced GTK+ Sequencer is intended to use for music composition. It
       features a piano roll, as well a synth, matrix editor, drum machine,
       soundfont2 player, mixer and an output panel. It’s designed to be
       highly configurable. You may add effects to its effect chain; and add
       or remove audio channels/pads. You may set up a fully functional
       network of engines, thus there is a link editor for linking audio
       lines.

       As version 1.0.0 it supports LADSPA, DSSI and Lv2 plugin format. And
       provides the ability to export to WAV, FLAC and OGG audio files. It can
       run on various soundcard backends including ALSA, OSS4, JACK Audio
       Connection Kit, Pulseaudio Core-Audio, Audio-Unit and WASAPI.

       The binary looks for a configuration file in
       $HOME/.gsequencer/ags.conf.
