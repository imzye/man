NAME
       Math::Financial - Calculates figures relating to loans and annuities.

SYNOPSIS
       $calc = new Math::Financial(fv => 100000, pv => 1000); $calc->set->(pmt
       => 500, ir => 8);

       $calc->compound_interest(find => 'fv');

DESCRIPTION
       This package contains solves mathematical problems relating to loans
       and annuities.

       The attributes that are used in the equations may be set on a per-
       object basis, allowing you to run a set of different calculations using
       the same numbers, or they may be fed directly to the methods.

       The attribute types, accessed through the "get" and "set" methods are

       pv   =>   Present Value
       fv   =>   Future Value
       ir   =>  Yearly Interest Rate (in percent)
       pmt  =>   Payment Amount
       np   =>   Number of Payments/Loan Term
       tpy  =>   Terms Per Year (defaults to 12)
       pd   =>   Payments made so far (used only for loan/annuity balances)

       Attributes are case-insensitive.  The documentation for the individual
       methods indicates which attributes must be set for those methods.

       Calculations are based either on the attributes set with the "new" or
       "set" methods, or with arguments fed directly to the methods.  This
       seemed like the least confusing way to make the interface flexible for
       people who are using the module in different ways.

       Also, performing a calculation does not update the attribute of the
       solution.  In other words, if you solve an equation that returns fv,
       the solution is returned but the internal fv field is unaffected.

       Any attempted calculation which cannot be completed -- due to either
       missing or invalid attributes -- will return "undef".

       I am interested to hear from people using this module -- let me know
       what you think about the interface and how it can be improved.

METHODS
   new
       "$calc = new Math::Financial();"

       "$calc = new Math::Financial(pv => 10000, ir => 5, np =" 12)>

       Object constructor.  See above for a description of the available
       attributes.  You do not have to set attributes here, you can also do so
       using "set", or feed attributes directly to the methods.

       There are no default values for any of the attributes except "TPY"
       (Terms Per Year), which is 12 by default, and "PD" which defaults to
       zero.

       If you don't want to use the object-oriented interface, see the EXPORTS
       section below.

   set
       "$calc->set(fv => 100000, pmt => 500)"

       You can set any of the stored attributes using this method, which is is
       also called by <new>.  Returns the number of attributes set.

   get
       "$calc->get(field =" 'ir')>

       "$calc->get('ir','pmt','pv')"

       "$calc->get([qw(ir pmt pv)])"

       You can get one or several attributes using this method.  In the
       multiple attribute formats, it accepts either a list or a list
       reference as input.

       In single attribute context, returns a scalar.  In multiple attribute
       context, it returns a list or a reference to a list, depending on the
       calling context.

   compound_interest
       "$calc->compound_interest"

       "$calc->compound_interest->('fv')"

       "$calc->compound_interest->(find => 'fv')"

       Calculates compund interest for an annuity.  With any 3 of pv, fv, np,
       and ir, you can always solve the fourth.

       Without arguments, the method will attempt to figure out what you'd
       like to solve based on what attributes of the object are defined.
       Usually, you'll probably want to explicitly request what attribute
       you'd like returned, which you can do using the second or third method.

   funding_annuity
       "$calc->funding_annuity"

       "$calc->funding_annuity->(pmt => 2000, ir => 6.50, np => 40, tpy =" 4)>

       "funding_annuity" calculates how much money ( "fv" ) you will have at
       the end of "np" periods if you deposit "pmt" into the account each
       period and the account earns "ir" interest per year.

       You may want to set the "tpy" attribute here to something other than
       12, since, while loans usually compound monthly, annuities rarely do.

   loan_balance
       "$calc->loan_balance"

       "$calc->loan_balance->(pmt => 2000, ir => 6.50, np => 360, pd => 12)"

       "loan_balance" calculates the balance on a loan that is being made in
       "np" equal payments, given that "pd" payments have already been made.
       You can also use this method to determine the amount of money left in
       an annuity that you are drawing down.

   loan_payment
       "$calc->loan_payment"

       Return the payment amount, per period, of a loan.  This is also known
       as amortizing.  The ir, np, and pv fields must be set.

   loan_size
       "$calc->loan_term"

       "$calc->loan_size->(pmt => 2000, ir => 6.50, np => 360)"

       "loan_size" calculates the size of loan you can get based on the
       monthly payment you can afford.

   loan_term
       "$calc->loan_term"

       Return the number of payments (term) of a loan given the interest rate
       "ir", payment amount "pmt" and loan amount "pv".   The ir, pmt, and pv
       fields must be set.

   simple_interest
       "$calc->simple_interest"

       "$calc->simple_interest->('ir')"

       "$calc->simple_interest->(find => 'ir')"

       This works just like compound interest, but there is no consideration
       of "np".  With any 2 of pv, fv, and ir, you can always solve for the
       third.

       Without arguments, the method will attempt to figure out what you'd
       like to solve based on what attributes of the object have been defined.
       Usually, you'll probably want to explicitly request what attribute
       you'd like returned, which you can do using the second or third method.

REQUIRES
       POSIX -- c_type functions

       (c_types might work under Windows.  I really don't know.  I'd
       appreciate it if someome would let me know.  If they don't, in a future
       release, I'll provide a runtime replacement for the POSIX functions so
       it'll work on Win releases.  )

EXPORTS
       By default, nothing.

       If you'd like to use a procedural interface, you can "use
       Math::Financial qw(:standard)".

       Then you can call the methods as function, without an object reference,
       like

       "$term = loan_term(ir => 6.5, pmt => 1000, pv => 200000);"

       All of the methods are exported in this fashion, except for "set" and
       "get"; this just seemed too confusing.

       You can still use the facility of "set" and "get" with the procedural
       interface (i.e., you can set the attributes and them use them for many
       different calculations), but you must call them as
       "Math::Financial::set" and "Math::Financial::get".
