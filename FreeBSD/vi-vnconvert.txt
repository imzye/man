     vnconvert

DESCRIPTION
     vnconvert converts files encoded in one Vietnamese encoding format to
     another Vietnamese encoding.  When run, vnconvert prompts for the input

     DOS; and in fact, is based on the coding table provided by Vietnamese
     Professional Society (VPS).

     Supported Vietnamese encodings include: 8-bit VISCII (VIetnamese Standard
     Code for Information Interchange), VNCII (VPSWin), VPSedit (DOS), VNI,
     VNLab/VNU, VNU (Windows), VN Thin-Art (Mac), VN Thin-Art (PC), Viet-Toan,
     Plain Vietnamese, and Standard 7-bit VIQR (VIetnamese Quoted Readable).
