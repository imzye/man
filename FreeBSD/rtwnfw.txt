RTWNFW(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              RTWNFW(4)

NAME
     rtwnfw – Firmware Module for Realtek Wireless driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this module into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device rtwnfw

     This will include all firmware images inside the kernel.  If you want to
     pick only the firmware image for your network adapter choose one of the
     following:

           device rtwn-rtl8188eefw
           device rtwn-rtl8188eufw
           device rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_B
           device rtwn-rtl8192cfwE
           device rtwn-rtl8192cfwT
           device rtwn-rtl8192cfwU
           device rtwn-rtl8192eufw
           device rtwn-rtl8812aufw
           device rtwn-rtl8821aufw

     Alternatively, to load all firmware images as a module at boot time,
     place the following line in loader.conf(5):

           rtwn-rtl8188eefw_load="YES"
           rtwn-rtl8188eufw_load="YES"
           rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_B_load="YES"
           rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_load="YES"
           rtwn-rtl8192cfwT_load="YES"
           rtwn-rtl8192cfwU_load="YES"
           rtwn-rtl8192eufw_load="YES"
           rtwn-rtl8812aufw_load="YES"
           rtwn-rtl8821aufw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     rtwn-rtl8192cfwE and rtl8192cfwE_B modules provide access to firmware
     sets for the Realtek RTL8188CE chip based PCIe adapters.  rtwn-rtl8188ee
     module provides access to firmware sets for the Realtek RTL8188EE chip
     based PCIe adapters.  Other modules provide access to firmware sets for
     the Realtek RTL8188CUS, RTL8188CE-VAU, RTL8188EUS, RTL8188RU, RTL8192CU,
     RTL8192EU, RTL8812AU and RTL8821AU chip based USB WiFi adapters.  They
     may be statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a modules.

     For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
     /usr/share/doc/legal/realtek.LICENSE must be agreed to by adding the
     following line to loader.conf(5):

           legal.realtek.license_ack=1
