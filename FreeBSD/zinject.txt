NAME
     zinject – ZFS Fault Injector

DESCRIPTION
     zinject creates artificial problems in a ZFS pool by simulating data
     corruption or device failures.  This program is dangerous.

SYNOPSIS
     zinject
             List injection records.

     zinject -b objset:object:level:start:end
             [-f frequency]
             -amu
             [pool]
             Force an error into the pool at a bookmark.

     zinject -c id|all
             Cancel injection records.

     zinject -d vdev
             -A degrade|fault
             pool
             Force a vdev into the DEGRADED or FAULTED state.

     zinject -d vdev
             -D latency:lanes
             pool
             Add an artificial delay to IO requests on a particular device,
             such that the requests take a minimum of latency milliseconds to
             complete.  Each delay has an associated number of lanes which
             defines the number of concurrent IO requests that can be
             processed.

             For example, with a single lane delay of 10 ms (-D 10:1), the
             device will only be able to service a single IO request at a time
             with each request taking 10 ms to complete.  So, if only a single
             request is submitted every 10 ms, the average latency will be 10
             ms; but if more than one request is submitted every 10 ms, the
             average latency will be more than 10 ms.

             Similarly, if a delay of 10 ms is specified to have two lanes (-D
             10:2), then the device will be able to service two requests at a
             time, each with a minimum latency of 10 ms.  So, if two requests
             are submitted every 10 ms, then the average latency will be 10
             ms; but if more than two requests are submitted every 10 ms, the
             average latency will be more than 10 ms.

             Also note, these delays are additive.  So two invocations of -D
             10:1 are roughly equivalent to a single invocation of -D 10:2.
             This also means, that one can specify multiple lanes with
             differing target latencies.  For example, an invocation of -D
             10:1 followed by -D 25:2 will create 3 lanes on the device: one
             lane with a latency of 10 ms and two lanes with a 25 ms latency.

     zinject -d vdev
             [-e device_error]
             [-L label_error]
             [-T failure]
             [-f frequency]
             [-F]
             pool
             Force a vdev error.

     zinject -I
             [-s seconds|-g txgs]
             pool
             Simulate a hardware failure that fails to honor a cache flush.

     zinject -p function
             pool
             Panic inside the specified function.

     zinject -t data
             -C dvas
             [-e device_error]
             [-f frequency]
             [-l level]
             [-r range]
             [-amq]
             path
             Force an error into the contents of a file.

     zinject -t dnode
             -C dvas
             [-e device_error]
             [-f frequency]
             [-l level]
             [-amq]
             path
             Force an error into the metadnode for a file or directory.

     zinject -t mos_type
             -C dvas
             [-e device_error]
             [-f frequency]
             [-l level]
             [-r range]
             [-amqu]
             pool
             Force an error into the MOS of a pool.

OPTIONS
     -a       Flush the ARC before injection.

     -b objset:object:level:start:end
              Force an error into the pool at this bookmark tuple.  Each
              number is in hexadecimal, and only one block can be specified.

     -C dvas  Inject the given error only into specific DVAs.  The mask should
              be specified as a list of 0-indexed DVAs separated by commas
              (ex. 0,2). This option is not applicable to logical data errors
              such as decompress and decrypt.

     -d vdev  A vdev specified by path or GUID.

     -e device_error
              Specify
              checksum    for an ECKSUM error,
              decompress  for a data decompression error,
              decrypt     for a data decryption error,
              corrupt     to flip a bit in the data after a read,
              dtl         for an ECHILD error,
              io          for an EIO error where reopening the device will
                          succeed, or
              nxio        for an ENXIO error where reopening the device will
                          fail.

              For EIO and ENXIO, the "failed" reads or writes still occur.
              The probe simply sets the error value reported by the I/O
              pipeline so it appears the read or write failed.  Decryption
              errors only currently work with file data.

     -f frequency
              Only inject errors a fraction of the time.  Expressed as a real
              number percentage between 0.0001 and 100.

     -F       Fail faster.  Do fewer checks.

     -f txgs  Run for this many transaction groups before reporting failure.

     -h       Print the usage message.

     -l level
              Inject an error at a particular block level.  The default is 0.

     -L label_error
              Set the label error region to one of nvlist, pad1, pad2, or
              uber.

     -m       Automatically remount the underlying filesystem.

     -q       Quiet mode.  Only print the handler number added.

     -r range
              Inject an error over a particular logical range of an object,
              which will be translated to the appropriate blkid range
              according to the object's properties.

     -s seconds
              Run for this many seconds before reporting failure.

     -T failure
              Set the failure type to one of all, claim, free, read, or write.

     -t mos_type
              Set this to
              mos       for any data in the MOS,
              mosdir    for an object directory,
              config    for the pool configuration,
              bpobj     for the block pointer list,
              spacemap  for the space map,
              metaslab  for the metaslab, or
              errlog    for the persistent error log.

     -u       Unload the pool after injection.
