Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap - Automated site map for the Dancer web
       framework.

SYNOPSIS
           use Dancer;
           use Dancer::Plugin::SiteMap;

       Yup, its that simple. Optionally you can omit routes by passing a list
       of regex patterns to be filtered out.:

           sitemap_ignore( 'ignore/this/route', 'orthese/.*' );

           # you can make several calls to sitemap_ignore, the new patterns
           # will be added without removing the old ones.
           sitemap_ignore( '/other/route' );

       Note that your specified routes will be tied to the beginning of the
       route, so if you say sitemap_ignore('/path') then the sitemap will
       exclude routes like '/path', but not '/some/other/path'.

       You may also tell this plugin to omit all routes disallowed in
       robots.txt.  In the config.yml of the application:

           plugins:
               SiteMap:
                   robots_disallow: /local/path/to/robots.txt

       Should you require more HTML around the sitemap, for styling /
       structure purposes, you can define the config option html_template.  If
       this key is present the sitemap will try to render within the template
       view named. That view should be created in the location of your app's
       views setting as with any other template and contain at least a <%
       sitemap %> token.

           plugins:
               SiteMap:
                   html_template: 'mysitemap_template.t'

           ---
           <div class="extra_thing">
           <% sitemap %>
           </div>
           ---

       Finally, you can change the default route for the sitemap by adding
       fields to the plugin config. It's worth noting that this must be a full
       route path, ie. start with a slash. Having a route option in the config
       but with no value will disable that particular sitemap.

       eg, in the config.yml of the application:

           plugins:
               SiteMap:
                   xml_route: '/sitemap_static.xml'
                   html_route:                           # html sitemap is disabled.

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin now supports Dancer 1 and 2!

       Plugin module for the Dancer web framwork that automagically adds
       sitemap routes to the webapp. Currently adds /sitemap and /sitemap.xml
       where the former is a basic HTML list and the latter is an XML document
       of URLS.

       Currently it only adds staticly defined routes for the GET method.

       Using the module is literally that simple... 'use' it and your app will
       have a site map.

       The HTML site map list can be styled throught the CSS class 'sitemap'

       Added additional functionality in 0.06 as follows:

       Firstly, fixed the route selector so the sitemap doesn't show the "or
       not" operator ('?'), any route defined with a ':variable' in the path
       or a pure regexp as thats just dirty.

       More importantly, I came across the requirement to not have a few admin
       pages listed in the sitemap, so I've added the ability to tell the
       plugin to ignore certain routes via the sitemap_ignore keyword.
