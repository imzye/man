NAME
       astzclock - the AfterStep clock

SYNOPSIS
       astzclock [ -help] [-12 | -24] [-shape]
               [-position [+|-]x[+|-]y]
               [-exe program]
               [-led color]
               [-timezone zone]
               [-noblink] [-iconic]

DESCRIPTION
       The astzclock is a clock written to emulate the date/time application
       on the NEXTSTEP(tm) operating system.  astzclock supports multiple
       languages, military and AM/PM time formats, program execution, and the
       shape extention to X-Windows.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       -help
              prints the usage message:
                      usage:  astzclock [-options ...]
                      where options include:
                          -12                     12 hour format
                          -24                     24 hour format
                          -exe <program>          program to start on click
                          -led <color>            color of the led
                          -position [+|-]x[+|-]y  position of astzclock
                          -shape                  without groundplate
                          -noblink                don't blink
                          -iconic                 start up as icon
                       -timezone <zone>        use a different time zone

       -12 or -24
              sets the desired time format to either twelve hour with AM/PM (
              -12 ) or military time ( -24 ).  If no option is given military
              time is used.

       -shape
              turn on shaped window support for astzclock.  When this is
              turned on the astzclock windows will only appear to be the led
              and date pad.  By default shaped windows are turned off and the
              clock will appear on a 64 pixel by 64 pixel base.

       -led <color>
              specifies the color of the led. To find out what colors are
              available, try showrgb

       -position [+|-]x[+|-]y
              specifies the starting position of astzclock. The [+|-] works
              like the standard X-Windows x/y geometry option.

       -exe <program>
              specifies the application to start when the pointer is activated
              over astzclock. To invoke applications with parameters, you have
              to set quotes around the command. See example below...

       -noblink
              specifies if astzclock should blink.

       -iconic
              This gives weird output with AfterStep, so don't bother. It's
              for mwm and other wm's with no hint functionality.

       -timezone <zone>
              Display the time as it currently is in the given time zone
              rather than locally.

INVOCATION
       astzclock can be called from one of many ways.  The most common
       invocation is the command line:

            [user@host] ~% astzclock -12 -exe 'xlock -mode hop' &

       Another way to call astzclock is from the window manager:

            *Wharf - - MaxSwallow "astzclock"  astzclock -shape -12&



       This line, when placed in the .steprc file in the users home directory
       will cause astzclock to use the shape extensions so that it will be a
       button on the Wharf (1) button bar under the afterstep (1) window
       manager.

       we don't have bugs :)
