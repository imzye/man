DEVINFO(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             DEVINFO(8)

NAME
     devinfo – print information about system device configuration

SYNOPSIS
     devinfo [-rv]
     devinfo -u
     devinfo -p dev [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     The devinfo utility, without any arguments, shows the hierarchy of
     devices available in the system, starting from the “nexus” device.

     The following options are accepted.

     -r      Causes hardware resource information (such as IRQ, I/O ports, I/O
             memory addresses) to be also listed, under each device that has
             reserved those resources.

     -u      Displays the same information as with -r but sorts by resource
             type rather than by device, allowing to review the set of system
             resources by usage and available resources.  I.e., it lists all
             the IRQ consumers together.

     -v      Display all devices in the driver tree, not just those that are
             attached or busy.  Without this flag, only those devices that
             have attached are reported.  This flag also displays verbose
             information about each device.

     -p dev  Display the path of dev back to the root of the device tree.
