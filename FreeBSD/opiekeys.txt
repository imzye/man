OPIEKEYS(5)               FreeBSD File Formats Manual              OPIEKEYS(5)




NAME
       /etc/opiekeys - OPIE database of user key information


DESCRIPTION
       The opiekeys file contains user information used by
       the OPIE software to authenticate users. The opiekeys
       file is backwards compatible with the S/Key
       /etc/skeykeys database file, but only if the hashing
       algorithm (MD4 and MD5) is the same between S/Key and
       OPIE (i.e., MD5 OPIE cannot use MD4 S/Key keys). The
       opiekeys file consists of six fields separated by
       spaces (tabs are properly interpreted, but spaces
       should be used instead) as follows:

       Field         Description
       name          User's login name.
       sequence      User's sequence number.
       seed          User's seed.
       key           User's last response (hex).
       date          Last change date.
       time          Last change time.
