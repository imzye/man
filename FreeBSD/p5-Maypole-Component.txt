NAME
       Maypole::Component - Run Maypole sub-requests as components

SYNOPSIS
         package BeerDB;
         use base qw(Maypole::Component Apache::MVC);


           [% request.component("/beer/view_as_component/20") %]

DESCRIPTION
       This subclass of Maypole allows you to integrate the results of a
       Maypole request into an existing request. You'll need to set up actions
       and templates which return fragments of HTML rather than entire pages,
       but once you've done that, you can use the "component" method of the
       Maypole request object to call those actions. You may pass a query
       string in the usual URL style.  You should not fully qualify the
       Maypole URLs.
