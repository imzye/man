NAME
       Sys::Sendfile - Zero-copy data transfer

VERSION
       version 0.19

SYNOPSIS
        use Sys::Sendfile;
        sendfile $sink, $source, $count;

DESCRIPTION
       Sys::Sendfile provides access to your operating system's "sendfile"
       facility. It allows you to efficiently transfer data from one
       filehandle to another. Typically the source is a file on disk and the
       sink is a socket, and some operating systems may not even support other
       usage.

FUNCTIONS
   sendfile $out, $in, $count, $offset
       This function sends up to $count bytes starting from $offset from $in
       to $out. If $count isn't given, it will try send all remaining bytes in
       $in, but on some operating systems sending only part of the bytes is a
       possible result. If $offset isn't given, the function will get current
       offset of $in (by calling lseek) and pass this information to
       underlying sendfile syscall. $in and $out can be a bareword, constant,
       scalar expression, typeglob, or a reference to a typeglob. It returns
       the number of bytes actually sent. On error, $! is set appropriately
       and it returns undef. This function is exported by default.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Not all operating systems support sendfile(). Currently Linux, FreeBSD,
       Solaris, Mac OS X (version 10.5 and up) and Windows are supported.
