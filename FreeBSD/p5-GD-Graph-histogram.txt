GD::Graph::histogram(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       GD::Graph::histogram - Histogram plotting module for Perl5

SYNOPSIS
         use GD::Graph::histogram;

DESCRIPTION
       GD::Graph::histogram extends the GD::Graph module to create histograms.
       The module allow creation of count or percentage histograms.

USAGE
       Fill an array with all the data values that are to be plotted. Note
       that GD::Graph::histogram unlike the other GD::Graph modules can only
       plot one data set at a time.

               $data = [1,5,7,8,9,10,11,3,3,5,5,5,7,2,2];

       Create the graph

               my $graph = new GD::Graph::histogram(400,600);

       Set graph options

               $graph->set(
                       x_label         => 'X Label',
                       y_label         => 'Count',
                       title           => 'A Simple Count Histogram Chart',
                       x_labels_vertical => 1,
                       bar_spacing     => 0,
                       shadow_depth    => 1,
                       shadowclr       => 'dred',
                       transparent     => 0,
               )
               or warn $graph->error;

       plot the graph

               my $gd = $graph->plot($data) or die $graph->error;

       save the graph to a file

               open(IMG, '>histogram.png') or die $!;
               binmode IMG;
               print IMG $gd->png;

METHODS
       GD::Graph::histogram supports all the methods support by GD::Graph.
       Please refer to the GD::Graph documentation for more information.

       The only method that behaves differently is plot

       The plot method provided by GD::Graph::histogram expects a reference to
       an array of numbers.

       Based on the input data, GD::Graph::histogram will generate the
       appropriate labels for the X axis. The X axis label represent the
       center point of the range of each histogram bin.

OPTIONS
       GD::Graph::histogram supports all the options supported by
       GD::Graph::bars.  Please refer to the GD::Graph documentation for more
       information.

       The two additional options that are specific to GD::Graph::histogram
       are:

               histogram_bins
                       Specify the number of histogram bins to bucket the data into.
                       The default is for the module to automatically computed the
                       histogram bins based on the data.

               histogram_type
                       Can be set to either 'percentage' or 'count'. By default the module
                       will create 'count' histograms.

NOTES
       As with all Modules for Perl: Please stick to using the interface. If
       you try to fiddle too much with knowledge of the internals of this
       module, you could get burned. I may change them at any time.
