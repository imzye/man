ANGIE(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               ANGIE(8)

NAME
     Angie – HTTP and reverse proxy server, mail proxy server

SYNOPSIS
     angie [-?hqTtVvmM] [-c file] [-e file] [-g directives] [-p prefix]
           [-s signal] [--help] [--build-env] [--log-level=level]

DESCRIPTION
     Angie is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a
     generic TCP/UDP proxy server.  It is known for its high performance,
     stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource
     consumption.

     The options are as follows:

     -?, -h, --help   Print help.

     -c file          Use an alternative configuration file.

     -e file          Use an alternative error log file.  Special value stderr
                      indicates that the standard error output should be used.

     -g directives    Set global configuration directives.  See EXAMPLES for
                      details.

     -p prefix        Set the prefix path.  The default value is
                      /usr/local/etc/angie.

     -q               Suppress non-error messages during configuration
                      testing.

     -s signal        Send a signal to the master process.  The argument
                      signal can be one of: stop, quit, reopen, reload.  The
                      following table shows the corresponding system signals:

                      stop    SIGTERM
                      quit    SIGQUIT
                      reopen  SIGUSR1
                      reload  SIGHUP

     -m               Show built-in modules and exit.

     -M               Show built-in and loaded modules, then exit.

     -T               Same as -t, but additionally dump configuration files to
                      standard output.

     -t               Do not run, just test the configuration file.  Angie
                      checks the configuration file syntax and then tries to
                      open files referenced in the configuration file.

     -V               Print the Angie version, compiler version, and configure
                      script parameters.

     -v               Print the Angie version.

     --build-env      Show build environment and exit.

     --log-level=level
                      Set initial error log level.

SIGNALS
     The master process of Angie can handle the following signals:

     SIGINT, SIGTERM   Shut down quickly.
     SIGHUP            Reload configuration, start the new worker process with
                       a new configuration, and gracefully shut down old
                       worker processes.
     SIGQUIT           Shut down gracefully.
     SIGUSR1           Reopen log files.
     SIGUSR2           Upgrade the Angie executable on the fly.
     SIGWINCH          Shut down worker processes gracefully.

     While there is no need to explicitly control worker processes normally,
     they support some signals too:

     SIGTERM           Shut down quickly.
     SIGQUIT           Shut down gracefully.
     SIGUSR1           Reopen log files.

DEBUGGING LOG
     To enable a debugging log, reconfigure Angie to build with debugging:

           ./configure --with-debug ...

     and then set the debug level of the error_log:

           error_log /path/to/log debug;

     It is also possible to enable the debugging for a particular IP address:

           events {
                   debug_connection 127.0.0.1;
           }

ENVIRONMENT
     The ANGIE environment variable is used internally by Angie and should not
     be set directly by the user.

FILES
     /var/run/angie.pid
             Contains the process ID of Angie.  The contents of this file are
             not sensitive, so it can be world-readable.

     /usr/local/etc/angie/angie.conf
             The main configuration file.

     /var/log/angie/error.log
             Error log file.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, or 1 if the command fails.

EXAMPLES
     Test configuration file ~/myangie.conf with global directives for PID and
     quantity of worker processes:

           angie -t -c ~/myangie.conf \
                   -g "pid /var/run/myangie.pid; worker_processes 2;"
