NEWSSTAR(1)                     [FIXME: manual]                    NEWSSTAR(1)

NAME
       newsstar - NNTP news fetcher

SYNOPSIS
       newsstar [-A NUM] [-a] [-b] [-f] [-m] [-o SERVER] [--overview=PATH]
                [-q] [-r] [-s] [-sn | -snews] [--snstore=PATH] [-v] [-vv] [-w]
                [--preprocess] [--postprocess]

DESCRIPTION
       Newsstar(TM) fetches news from a number of remote NNTP servers and
       posts it to a local server (INN, s-news or sn), and also posts outgoing
       articles from the local server to the remote ones. It uses a
       configurable number of multiple processes or "threads" to maximise
       bandwidth utilisation. The threads are coordinated to avoid downloading
       multiple copies of the same article.

       This man page is just a summary. For more information see the README
       file and/or HTML documentation provided with the package.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -A [NUM]
           Scan the local server's active or .newsgroups file and ensure that
           newsstar's newsrc files contain the same groups. If the optional
           NUM parameter is specified, this is the number of the last article
           fetched to be inserted for any newly created groups. Usually it
           only makes sense to use a negative number to indicate the maximum
           number of articles to download when the group is new.

       -a
           In conjunction with -A this causes the newsrc files to be sorted by
           newsgroup order.

       -b
           Minimise the number of messages sent to STDOUT (brief).

       -f
           Use full-screen mode with the curses library.

       -m
           Articles that can't be posted are mailed back to the sender.

       -o SERVER
           Only the named server is processed, all other newsrc files are
           ignored.

       --overview PATH
           s-news' overview binary is at PATH.

       -q
           The running display of articles transferred etc is disabled if not
           in full-screen mode.

       -r
           If newsstar is maintaining its own history database, this option
           makes it reorganize the database to free up unused space whenever
           items are expired.

       -s
           Standard messages (on STDOUT) are separated from debugging messages
           on STDERR ie newsstar assumes each stream is sent to a separate
           file or device.

       -sn
           Use sn as server instead of INN.

       -snews
           Use s-news as server instead of INN.

       --snstore=PATH
           sn's snstore binary is at PATH.

       -v
           Prints extra information useful for debugging on STDERR.

       -vv
           Prints even more information on STDERR.

       -wWRAPPER
           Specify a wrapper program to run the binary in, for example a
           debugger. Note the lack of a space between -w and WRAPPER.

       --preprocess --postprocess
           For debugging, these instruct the perl script just to perform its
           functions prior to or after running the binary respectively,
           without actually running the binary.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/newsstar
           Directory where static configuration files are stored.

       /usr/local/etc/newsstar/main.cf
           Main configuration file.

       /usr/local/etc/newsstar/curses.cf
           Configuration file for full-screen options.

       /usr/local/etc/newsstar/master.ignore
           Perl regexps of newsgroups to ignore, common to every remote
           server.

       /usr/local/etc/newsstar/cf.SERVER
           Configuration file for each remote server.

       /usr/local/etc/newsstar/ignore.SERVER
           Perl regexps of newsgroups to ignore, specific to each remote
           server.

       /var/spool/newsstar/lib
           Directory where data updated by newsstar is stored.

       /var/spool/newsstar/lib/newsrc.SERVER
           List of newsgroups, with last article downloaded, for each remote
           server. The presence of these files also controls which servers
           newsstar connects to.

       /var/spool/newsstar/lib/history
           GDBM history database.

       /var/spool/newsstar/incoming
           Where downloaded articles are temporarily held.

       /var/spool/news/ /var/spool/sn/
           The usual, and therefore default for newsstar, spool directories
           used by INN and sn respectively.

SEE ALSO
       The program is documented fully by the HTML files starting at
       /usr/local/share/doc/newsstar/index.html. You should also read the
       README file in the same directory first.
