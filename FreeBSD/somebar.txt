somebar(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             somebar(1)

NAME
       somebar - dwm-like bar for dwl

SYNOPSIS
       somebar [-h] [-v] [-s path] [-c command arguments... ]

DESCRIPTION
       somebar is a status bar for dwl, visually and functionally resembling
       the dwm bar.

USAGE
       You must start somebar using dwl's `-s` flag, e.g. `dwl -s somebar`.

       Somebar can be controlled by writing to $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/somebar-0, or
       the path defined by the `-s` argument. The following commands are
       supported:

       status TEXT
              Updates the status bar

       hide MONITOR
              Hides somebar on the specified monitor

       show MONITOR
              Shows somebar on the specified monitor

       toggle MONITOR
              Toggles somebar on the specified monitor

       MONITOR is an zxdg_output_v1 name, which can be determined e.g. using
       `weston-info`.  Additionally, MONITOR can be `all` (all monitors) or
       `selected` (the monitor with focus).

       Commands can be sent either by writing to the file name above, or
       equivalently by calling somebar with the `-c` argument. For example:
       `somebar -c toggle all`. This is recommended for shell scripts, as
       there is no race-free way to write to a file only if it exists.

OPTIONS
       -h     Displays a short help text and exits

       -v     Displays version information and exits

       -s     Sets the path to the somebar control FIFO. The default value is
              $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/somebar-0

       -c     Sends a command to the control FIFO. See the USAGE section.
