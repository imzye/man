TARANTOOL(1)             Lua application server and database management system


NAME
       tarantool - a Lua application server and a database management system

SYNOPSIS
           tarantool [OPTIONS] --name NAME --config CONFIG
           tarantool [OPTIONS] [SCRIPT [ARGS]]

DESCRIPTION
       Tarantool is an in-memory computing platform consisting of a database
       and an application server.

       Key features of the application server:

       •   Heavily optimized Lua interpreter with an incredibly fast tracing
           JIT compiler based on LuaJIT 2.1.

       •   Cooperative multitasking, non-blocking IO.

       •   Persistent queues.

       •   Sharding.

       •   Cluster and application management framework.

       •   Access to external databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.

       •   A rich set of built-in and standalone modules.

       Key features of the database:

       •   MessagePack data format and MessagePack based client-server
           protocol.

       •   Two data engines: a 100% in-memory with complete WAL-based
           persistence, and an own implementation of LSM-tree for the large
           data sets.

       •   Multiple index types: HASH, TREE, RTREE, BITSET.

       •   Document oriented JSON path indexes.

       •   Asynchronous master-master replication.

       •   Synchronous quorum-based replication.

       •   RAFT-based automatic leader election for the single-leader
           configuration.

       •   Authentication and access control.

       •   ANSI SQL, including views, joins, referential and check
           constraints.

       •   Connectors for many programming languages.

       •   The database is a C extension of the application server and can be
           turned off.

OPTIONS
       All the options are separated into two groups: action options and
       modifier options.

       At least one action option should be specified.

       All the modifier options are optional.

   ACTION OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Print this help message.

       -v, -V, --version
           Print version and build information.

       --help-env-list
           Print environment variables list.

       -n <...> [-c <...>], --name <...> [--config <...>]
           Start an instance.

           The path to the configuration file can be omitted if a
           configuration is stored in etcd and "TT_CONFIG_ETCD_*" environment
           variables are set.

       <first positional argument> [<..more args..>]
           Run a Lua script file. All the arguments after the script name are
           stored in the `arg` global value.

           The file may be pointed as `-` to read the script from stdin.

       -e <..code..>
           Run a Lua code.

           It can be used on its own (as an action option) or together with
           another action option (as a modifier).

       -i  Run the interactive REPL.

       --failover
           Run a failover coordinator service.

           It is available in Tarantool Enterprise Edition.

   MODIFIER OPTIONS
       --force-recovery
           Enable force-recovery mode at database loading.

       -l <module>
           "require" Lua module <module> and set it the same named global
           variable.

       -j <cmd>
           Perform LuaJIT control command <cmd>.

       -b <...>
           Save or list bytecode.

       -d  Activate debugging session for a given script.

       --  End-of-options marker. All the arguments after the marker are
           interpreted as non-option ones.
