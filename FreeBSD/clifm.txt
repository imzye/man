1. GETTING HELP
       There are several ways to access help in clifm. Once you are in the
       program, enter `?` or `help` for some basic usage examples, or press F1
       to access this manpage, F2 to go to the COMMANDS section of this
       manpage, or F3 to jump to the KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS section.

       To get help about some specific topic, type `help <TAB>` to get a list
       of available help topics. Choose the topic you want and then press
       Enter.

       For a list of available commands along with brief descriptions, type
       `cmd<TAB>`.

       You can also access help for internal commands using the -h or --help
       flags. For example, to get help about the selection function, enter `s
       -h` or `s --help`.

       A convenient way to obtain comprehensive information about clifm
       commands is through the ih action, which is bound by default to the
       interactive help plugin (ihelp.sh). Enter `ih` to run the plugin (note
       that it requires fzf(1)) and select the command you wish to learn more
       about.

       For a quick introduction, please refer to the EXAMPLES section at the
       end of this document.


2. DESCRIPTION
       Clifm is a Command Line Interface File Manager. Its main feature and
       strength lie in the fact that all input and interacion are conducted
       through commands typed directly into a prompt. In other words, clifm
       operates as a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), following this basic
       structure: Read (user input via the command line), Evaluate/Execute the
       command, Print the results, Loop (repeat the process).

       Unlike most terminal file managers out there, indeed, clifm replaces
       the traditional Text User Interface (TUI), often referred to as curses
       or text-menu based interface, with a straightforward command-line
       interface (REPL). This design allows it to function not only as a file
       manager, but also as a shell extension. You can search for files, copy,
       rename, remove them, while also performing system tasks such as
       updating or upgrading your system, adding cron jobs, stopping services,
       and launching text editors like nano, vi, or emacs.

       In summary, clifm keeps the command line visible and accessible,
       enhancing it with functionalities specifically tailored for file
       management.


3. PARAMETERS
POSITIONAL PARAMETERS
       If you specify a directory as the first non-option parameter, clifm
       will start in that directory. Subsequent directory names are used to
       initialize subsequent workspaces. For example, the command `clifm /etc
       ~/Downloads` instructs clifm to start in the /etc directory (in the
       first workspace) and to set the second workspace to ~/Downloads. Up to
       8 positional parameters are supported (further parameters are ignored).

       If no workspace is specified, clifm will use the first workspace. To
       start in a specific workspace use the -w option followed by the
       workspace number. For instance, `clifm -w4 /etc ~/Downloads` will start
       clifm in the /etc directory within workspace 4, setting the workspace 5
       to ~/Downloads.

       If no positional parameter is provided and the -w option is not used,
       clifm will start in the last visited directory (and in the last active
       workspace). You can disable this behavior by using the
       --no-restore-last-path command line switch (or by setting the
       RestoreLastPath option to false in the configuration file), in which
       case the current directory will be used as starting path and all
       workspaces will be unset.

       To start always in a specific directory, disregarding the current
       directory, you can use the StartingPath option in the configuration
       file.


OPTIONS
       Note: If compiled in POSIX mode, the following list of options does not
       apply. In this case, run `clifm -h` to get the actual list of options.
       (To make sure run `clifm -v`: if compiled in POSIX mode the version
       number is followed by "-POSIX").

       -a, --show-hidden[=VAL]
              Show hidden files (filenames starting with '.'). Supported
              values are: first, last, true, and false. If no value is
              specified, it defaults to true.

       -A, --no-hidden
              Do not show hidden files.

       -b, --bookmarks-file=FILE
              Set an alternative bookmarks file.

       -c, --config-file=FILE
              Set an alternative configuration file.

       -D, --config-dir=DIR
              Set an alternative configuration directory (if configuration
              files do not already exist, they will be created in DIR).

       -e, --no-eln
              Do not display Entry List Numbers (ELNs) to the left of
              filenames (note that while ELNs are not printed, they remain
              accessible and can still be used as usual).

       -E, --eln-use-workspace-color
              Color ELNs using the current workspace color.

       -f, --dirs-first
              List directories first.

       -F, --no-dirs-first
              Do not list directories first.

       -g, --pager
              Enable Mas, the builtin pager for file listing.

       -G, --no-pager
              Disable the file pager.

       -h, --help
              Print this help and exit.

       -H, --horizontal-list
              List files horizontally (instead of vertically).

       -i, --no-case-sensitive
              Ignore case distinctions when listing files.

       -I, --case-sensitive
              Do not ignore case distinctions when listing files.

       -k, --keybindings-file=FILE
              Set an alternative keybindings file.

       -l, --long-view
              Print file extended metadata next to filenames (long view). The
              displayed fields can be customized using --prop-fields (or the
              PropFields option in the configuration file). Set a custom
              time/date format with --time-style (or the TimeStyle option in
              the configuration file).

       -L, --follow-symlinks-long
              When in long view, display information for the files referenced
              by symbolic links instead of the symbolic links themselves.

       -m, --dirhist-map
              Enable the directory history map to keep in view previous,
              current, and next entries in the directory history list.

       -o, --autols
              Automatically list files when changing the current directory
              with the cd command.

       -O, --no-autols
              Do not automatically list files when changing the current
              directory with the cd command.

       -P, --profile=PROFILE
              Use PROFILE as profile. If PROFILE does not exist, it will be
              created. The default profile is default.

       -r, --no-refresh-on-empty-line
              Do not refresh the current list of files when pressing Enter on
              an empty line.

       -s, --splash
              Display the splash screen at startup.

       -S, --stealth-mode
              In stealth mode (also known as incognito or private mode), no
              trace is left on the host system. No files are read or created,
              and all settings revert to their default values. However, most
              settings can still be controlled via command line options and
              dedicated environment variables (see the ENVIRONMENT section
              below). Additionally, refer to the history command and the --no-
              history command line switch for more options.

       -t, --disk-usage-analyzer
              Run in disk usage analyzer mode. This is equivalent to using
              --sort=size --long-view --full-dir-size --no-dirs-first. The
              recursive size of the current directory will be displayed after
              the list of files. You can toggle this mode in place by pressing
              Alt+Tab (or Ctrl+Alt+i).

       -T, --trash-dir=DIR
              Set an alternative trash directory.

       -v, --version
              Print version details and exit.

       -w, --workspace=NUM
              Start in workspace NUM. By default, clifm will recover the last
              visited directory for each workspace. You can override this
              behavior using positional parameters to start in workspace NUM
              and in the specified directory (e.g.: `clifm -w4 /etc`). Consult
              the POSITIONAL PARAMETERS section above for more information.

       -x, --no-ext-cmds
              Disallow the use of external (shell) commands.

       -y, --light-mode
              Enable the light mode to speed up clifm (see the NOTE ON SPEED
              section below).

       -z, --sort=METHOD
              Sort files by METHOD, where METHOD is one of: 0 = none, 1 =
              name, 2 = size, 3 = atime, 4 = btime, 5 = ctime, 6 = mtime, 7 =
              version, 8 =  extension, 9 = inode, 10 = owner, 11 = group, 12 =
              blocks, 13 = links, or 14 = type. Both numbers and names are
              accepted. For example, you can use --sort=9 or --sort=inode.

       --bell=TYPE
              Set the terminal bell type, where TYPE is one of: 0 = none, 1 =
              audible, 2 = visible (requires readline >= 8.1), and 3 = flash.
              Defaults to 2 (visible), and, if not available, 0 (none). Only
              numbers are allowed.

       --case-sens-dirjump
              Do not ignore case when consulting the jump database (via the j
              command).

       --case-sens-path-comp
              Enable case sensitive path completion.

       --cd-on-quit
              Write the last visited directory to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/.last
              for later access by the corresponding shell function at program
              exit. Consult the SHELL FUNCTIONS section below for more
              information.

       --color-scheme=NAME
              Use the color scheme specified by NAME.

       --color-links-as-target
              Color symbolic links using the color of the target file (an '@'
              character is prepended to the filename to mark it as a symbolic
              link).

       --cwd-in-title
              Print the current working directory in the terminal window title
              (otherwise, only the program name is printed).

       --data-dir=DIR
              Load data files, such as plugins, color schemes, and default
              configuration files, from DIR (this is by default the
              installation directory, usually /usr/share/clifm).

       --desktop-notifications[=STYLE]
              Enable desktop notifications. The notification style can be
              optionally specified: kitty (requires the Kitty terminal or a
              terminal supporting the Kitty Notifications Protocol), system,
              or false. If STYLE is omitted, it defaults to system. Enter
              `help desktop-notifications` in clifm for more information.

       --disk-usage
              Show disk usage of the filesystem where the current directory
              resides, in the format FREE/TOTAL (FREE %) TYPE DEVICE.

       --full-dir-size
              Display recursive directory sizes (long view only).

       --fuzzy-algo=VER
              Fuzzy matching algorithm, where VER is either 1 (faster, but not
              Unicode aware), or 2 (slower, Unicode aware). Bear in mind
              however that the second algorithm (default) will fallback to the
              first one (because it is faster) whenever the query string
              contains only ASCII characters, to minimize the performance
              penalty.

       --fuzzy-matching
              Enable fuzzy matching for filename/path completions and
              suggestions.

       --fzfpreview-hidden
              Enable file previews for tab completion (fzf mode only) with the
              preview window hidden (toggle it by pressing Alt+p).

       --fzftab
              Use fzf(1) to display completion matches.

       --fnftab
              Use fnf(1) to display completion matches.

       --icons
              Enable icons.

       --icons-use-file-color
              Instead of a specific color, icons use the color of the
              corresponding filename. Useful when building custom color
              schemes, this option implies --icons, and is effective only when
              compiled with support for icons-in-terminal or Nerdfonts. The
              default build is compiled with emoji-icons support, in which
              case this option is ignored, as Unicode icons have their own
              builtin colors.

       --int-vars
              Allow the use of internal variables (e.g.: `VAR=/bin; cd $VAR`).

       --list-and-quit
              List files and quit. Useful in conjunction with positional
              parameters (e.g.: `clifm --list-and-quit /etc`). If no
              positional parameter is provided, the current directory is used
              instead.

       --ls
              Short for --list-and-quit.

       --lscolors
              Read file colors from the LS_COLORS environment variable (the
              FreeBSD LSCOLORS format is also supported). Note that clifm-
              specific colors (like empty directories or inaccessible files)
              will be disabled. Note also that colors for specific filenames,
              as defined in LS_COLORS, are not supported. For more information
              about LS_COLORS, consult dircolors(1), or refer to the ls(1)
              FreeBSD manpage for LSCOLORS.

       --max-dirhist
              Maximum number of visited directories to remember.

       --max-files=NUM
              List only up to NUM files. Use -1 or unset to remove this limit
              (default). See the mf command for a more detailed description.

       --mimelist-file=FILE
              Set FILE as Lira´s configuration file (see the FILE OPENER
              section below for more information).

       --mnt-udisks2
              Use udisks2(1) instead of udevil(1) (default) for the media
              command.

       --no-bold
              Disable bold colors (applies to all color schemes).

       --no-cd-auto
              By default, clifm changes directories by just entering their
              filenames. This option forces the use of the cd command.

       --no-classify
              By default, clifm appends a file type indicator character to
              filenames when running without colors (see the --no-color option
              below) and a directory indicator (along with a file counter)
              when running with colors. Classification characters are as
              follows:

               /n: directory (n = file counter)
               @:  symbolic link
               !:  broken symbolic link
               |:  FIFO/pipe
               =:  socket
               *:  executable file
               +:  block device
               -:  character device
               ?:  unknown file type

              Use this option to disable file type classification. Note that
              this option also disables the file counter.

       --no-clear-screen
              Do not clear the screen before listing files.

       --no-color
              Disable colors.

       --no-columns
              Disable columned file listing (use a single column).

       --no-file-cap
              Do not check file capabilities when listing files (only
              meaningful for performance reasons).

       --no-file-ext
              Do not check file extensions (mostly used to colorize specific
              filenames) when listing files.

       --no-file-counter
              Disable the file counter for directories (speeding up the
              listing process: counting files in directories is particularly
              expensive).

       --no-follow-symlinks
              Do not follow symbolic links when listing files (overrides both
              --follow-symlinks-long and --color-links-as-target).

       --no-fzfpreview
              Disable file previews for tab completion (fzf mode only).

       --no-highlight
              Disable syntax highlighting (to customize highlighting colors,
              see the COLOR CODES section below).

       --no-history
              Do not write commands to the history file (see also the
              HistIgnore option in the configuration file).

       --no-open-auto
              By default, clifm opens files (using the default associated
              application) by just entering their filenames. Use this option
              to force the use of the open command. Consult the mime command
              and the FILE OPENER section for more information about default
              associated applications.

       --no-refresh-on-resize
              Do not attempt to refresh the list of files when the window is
              resized.

       --no-restore-last-path
              By default, clifm saves the last visited directory for each
              workspace to restore it in the next session. Use this option to
              disable this behavior.

       --no-suggestions
              Disable the auto-suggestions system.

       --no-tips
              Do not display startup tips.

       --no-truncate-names
              Do not truncate filenames (see the MaxFilenameLen option in the
              configuration file).

       --no-unicode
              Do not use Unicode decorations.

       --no-warning-prompt
              Disable the warning prompt (used to highlight invalid command
              names).

       --no-welcome-message
              Disable the welcome message.

       --only-dirs
              List directories only.

       --open=FILE
              Run as a standalone file opener: open FILE and exit, where FILE
              can be a regular file or a directory, using either standard
              notation (/dir/file), the file URI scheme (file:///dir/file), or
              a URL (www.domain or https://domain).

       --opener=APPLICATION
              Use APPLICATION (e.g.: rifle or xdg-open) as file
              opener/launcher (instead of Lira, clifm's default opener).

       --pager-view=MODE
              List files in the pager according to MODE. Supported values are:
              auto (use the current listing mode - this is the default), long
              (list files in long view), and short (list files in short view).

       --physical-size
              Display physical file sizes (device usage) instead of logical
              sizes (apparent size).

       --preview=FILE
              Display a preview of FILE (via Shotgun) and exit. Use
              --shotgun-file to set an alternative configuration file. Consult
              the SHOTGUN section below for more information.

       --print-sel
              Print the list of selected files after the file list. The
              maximum number of selected files to be printed can be specified
              using the MaxPrintSelfiles option in the configuration file (by
              default, this option is set to 0 (auto), meaning it will never
              exceed half the terminal height).

       --prop-fields=FORMAT
              Set fields to be displayed in long view. For information on how
              to construct this format string consult the PropFields option in
              the configuration file.

       --ptime-style=STYLE
              Time/date style used by the p/pp command and the
              --stat/--stat-full command line switches. Available styles:
              default, iso, long-iso, full-iso, full-iso-nano, and +FORMAT
              (FORMAT is interpreted like in strftime(3). Nano-second
              precision is available via the %N modifier, like in date(1)).

       --readonly
              Run in read-only mode (internal commands able to modify the
              filesystem are disabled). Disabled commands are: ac, ad, bb,
              bl/bleach, br/bulk, c, dup, l, le, m, md, n/new, oc, paste, pc,
              r, rr, t/trash, tag, te, u/untrash, and vv, plus the shell
              commands cp, rm, mv, ln, mkdir, rmdir, link, and unlink.

       --report-cwd
              Report the current directory to the underlying terminal (using
              the OSC-7 escape sequence, not supported by all terminals).

       --rl-vi-mode
              Set readline to vi editing mode (defaults to emacs editing
              mode).

       --secure-cmds
              Sanitize commands passed to the OS to mitigate command injection
              attacks (--secure-env is implied). Consult the SECURITY section
              below for more information.

       --secure-env
              Run clifm in a secure environment (regular mode). Consult the
              SECURITY section below.

       --secure-env-full
              Run clifm in a secure environment (full mode). Consult the
              SECURITY section below.

       --sel-file=FILE
              Set FILE as the selections file.

       --share-selbox
              By default, each user profile has a private Selection Box. Use
              this option to make the Selection Box common to all user
              profiles.

       --shotgun-file=FILE
              Set FILE as the shotgun configuration file. See the SHOTGUN
              section below for more information.

       --si
              Display file sizes in SI units (powers of 1000) instead of IEC
              units (powers of 1024).

       --smenutab
              Use smenu(1) to display completion matches.

       --sort-reverse
              Sort files in reverse order (e.g.: z-a instead of a-z).

       --stat FILE...
              Run the p command on FILE(s) and exit. This must be the last
              option on the command line. Use --ptime-style to set a custom
              date/time format.

       --stat-full FILE...
              Same as --stat, but it runs the pp command (instead of p) on
              FILE(s).

       --stdtab
              Use the standard mode (readline´s builtin) for tab completion.

       --time-style=STYLE
              Time/date style used in long view. Available styles: default,
              relative, iso, long-iso, full-iso, +FORMAT (FORMAT is
              interpreted like in strftime(3)).

       --trash-as-rm
              Make the r command move files to the trash instead of removing
              them.

       --unicode
              By default, Unicode decorations are used if Unicode support is
              detected for the running terminal. If no support is detected,
              you can use this option to force the use of Unicode decorations.

       --virtual-dir=PATH
              Use PATH as clifm´s virtual directory.

       --virtual-dir-full-paths
              Print filenames in virtual directories as absolute paths instead
              of just basenames.

       --vt100
              Run in VT100 compatibility mode (use this option if running on a
              really ancient terminal emulator).

       Options precedence order: 1) command line flags; 2) configuration file;
       3) default values.


4. COMMANDS
       Help for all commands listed here can be accessed via the -h or --help
       options. For example, use `p --help` to get help about the properties
       function.

       Note 1: ELN = Entry List Number. For example, in the line "12
       chocolatebox" (when listing files), 12 is the ELN corresponding to the
       file named "chocolatebox". The slash followed by a number (/xx) after
       directories and symbolic links to directories (the file counter)
       indicates the number of files in the corresponding directory, excluding
       self and parent directories ("." and ".." respectively).

       Note 2: In case of ELN-filename conflict, the backslash can be used to
       prevent ELN expansion. For example, if there are at least two files and
       one of them is named 2, clifm cannot determine in advance if the
       command refers to the ELN 2 or the filename 2. To specify the ELN,
       simply write the ELN number (e.g. `s 2`). To refer to the filename,
       escape it using the backlash character: `s \2`.

       Note 3: Clifm supports fused parameters for internal commands taking an
       ELN or range of ELNs as parameters. Much like short options for command
       line programs, you can omit the space between internal commands and the
       corresponding ELN passed as argument. For example, you can write CMDELN
       instead of CMD_ELN. Thus, `o12` or `s1-5` can be used instead of `o 12`
       and `s 1-5, respectively. Be aware that omitting the space character
       will disable tab completion and suggestions for ELNs. If there is a
       file named o12 (more generally, CMDELN), and if you want to refer to
       this file instead of a clifm command, escape the filename to prevent
       the split: `\o12`.

       FILE/DIR
              If the autocd and/or auto-open functions are enabled (default),
              open FILE or change directory to DIR. In other words, `FILE`
              amounts to `open FILE` (or `o FILE`), and `DIR` to `cd DIR`.
              ELNs, of course, are allowed. For example: `12`.

       /PATTERN [-FILETYPE] [-x] [DIR]
              This is the quick search function. Type `/` followed by a glob
              or (extended) regular expression, and clifm will list all
              matches in the current directory. For example, both `/*.pdf` and
              `/.pdf$` expressions will list all PDF files in the current
              directory, the former using wildcards, and the second a regular
              expression.

              You can list previously used search patterns using the TAB key:
              `/*<TAB>`.

              Note 1: By default, the search function attempts to resolve a
              pattern first as glob, and then, if no matches are found, as a
              regular expression. This behavior can be customizad in the
              configuration file, using the SearchStrategy option.

              Note 2: If no further parameter is provided, but only a glob
              pattern (wildcards), you can expand the pattern into the
              corresponding matches by hitting the TAB key. For example, to
              list all C files in the current directory: `/*.c<TAB>`.

              Note 3: Expressions containing no pattern metacharacter are
              automatically transformed into a glob/regular expression
              (depending on the value of the SearchStrategy option). For
              example, `/test` becomes `*test*` or `/.*test.*`.

              1. Case sensitivity

              By default, regular expressions are case insensitive (glob
              expressions, by contrast, are always case sensitive). However,
              you can enable case sensitive search by setting the
              CaseSensitiveSearch option to true in the configuration file.

              2. Destination directory

              To search for files in any directory other than the current
              directory, specify the directory name as a further parameter
              (DIR). For example, enter `/^A 7` to search for all files
              starting with ´A´ in the directory corresponding to the ELN 7.

              3. File type filter

              The result of the search can be further filtered by specifying a
              filter type: -b, -c, -d, -f, -l, -p, -s, -O, and -P (block
              device, character device, directory, regular file, symbolic
              link, FIFO/pipe, socket, door (Solaris), and port (Solaris)
              respectively. For example, `/[.-].*d$ -d Documents/` will list
              all directories containing a dot or a dash and ending with ´d´
              in the directory named Documents.

              4. Invert matching

              Prepend the exclamation mark (!) to invert the meaning of a
              given search pattern. For example: `!.*s$ -d /etc` will match
              all directories in /etc not ending with ´s´, just as `!D*` will
              match all files in the current directory not starting with ´D´.

              5. Recursive search

              To perform a recursive search use the -x parameter, and,
              optionally, a search path (DIR) (file type filter is not
              allowed). The search will be performed using find(1) as follows:
              find DIR_MODE PATTERN. If no search path is provided, the search
              is executed starting in the current directory. Otherwise, the
              search starts in DIR. MODE is one of:

               -name: if SearchStrategy is not regex-only and
              CaseSensitiveSearch is set to true

               -iname: if SearchStrategy is not regex-only and
              CaseSensitiveSearch is set to false

               -regex: if SearchStrategy is regex-only and CaseSensitiveSearch
              is set to true

               -iregex: if SearchStrategy is regex-only and
              CaseSensitiveSearch is set to false

       ;[CMD], :[CMD]
              If CMD is not specified, run the system shell in the current
              directory. If CMD is specified, skip all clifm expansions (see
              the BUILT-IN EXPANSIONS section below) and run the input string
              (CMD) as is via the default system shell (consult the
              MISCELLANEOUS NOTES section for information on how shell
              commands are executed).

       ac, ad FILE...
              Archive/compress and dearchive/decompress one or multiple files
              and/or directories.

              The archiver function brings two modes: ac, to generate archives
              or compressed files, and ad, to decompress or dearchive files,
              either just listing, extracting, recompressing, or mounting
              their content. In this latter case, the mountpoint used
              automatically is
              $HOME/.config/clifm/PROFILE/mounts/ARCHIVE_NAME.

              Example: `ac sel`, `ac 4-25 myfile`, or `ad *.tar.gz`.

              Multiple archive/compression formats are supported, including
              Zstandard. Note that when it comes to ISO 9660 files only a
              single file is supported.

              The archive mount function for non ISO files depends on
              archivemount, while the remaining functions depend on atool and
              other third-party utilities for achieve formats support, for
              example, p7zip. p7zip is also used to manage most decompressing
              options for ISO 9660 files, except for mount, in which case
              mount(8) is used. Creation of ISO files is done via
              genisoimage(1). For more information consult atool(1),
              archivemount(1), zstd(1), and 7z(1).

       acd, autocd [on | off | status]
              Toggle the autocd function. If set to on, `DIR` amounts to
              `cd DIR`.

       actions [list | edit [APP]]
              To list available actions (or plugins) use the list subcommand.
              Note that, since list is the default action, it can be omitted.

              Use the edit subcommand to add, remove or modify custom actions
              (using APP if specified or the default associated application
              for text files otherwise).

              The aim of this function is to allow the user to easily add
              custom commands and functions to clifm. In other words, the
              actions function is a plugins capability.

              This is the general procedure: a) edit the actions file (by
              running `actions edit`) and bind a custom action name to an
              executable file (written in any language you want, be it a shell
              or Python script, a C program or whatever you like). For
              example, "myaction=myscript.sh". b) Drop the corresponding
              script (in our example, myscript.sh) into the plugins directory,
              usually, ~/.config/clifm/plugins (see the FILES section below).
              3) Call the script using the custom action name defined before
              as if it were any other command: run `myaction`, and myscript.sh
              will be executed.

              Note that all arguments passed to the action command (myaction)
              will be passed to the script or program as well (myscript.sh),
              which is executed via the system shell (consult the
              MISCELLANEOUS NOTES section for information on how shell
              commands are executed).

              To assist the user when writing plugins, clifm's state
              information is exported via environment variables while running
              plugins. For example, CLIFM_LONG_VIEW is set to 1 if currently
              running in long view (see the ENVIRONMENT section for the
              complete list of exported values).

              The plugins bundled with clifm (take a look at the plugins
              directory) can be used as a starting point to create new
              plugins.

       alias [import FILE | ls, list | NAME]
              With no argument (or with ls,list parameters), it prints the
              list of available aliases. To get the description of a specific
              alias enter `alias` followed by the alias name. To write a new
              alias simply enter edit (or press F10) to open the configuration
              file and add a line like this: "alias name=´command args...´" or
              "alias name=´directory´".

              To import aliases from a file, provided it contains aliases in
              the specified form (i.e. the POSIX syntax for the alias shell
              command), use the import parameter. Aliases conflicting with
              some of the internal commands will not be imported.

              However, a neat usage for the alias function is not so much to
              bind short keys to commands, but to files and directories
              visited regularly. In this way, it is possible to bind as many
              files or directories, no matter how deep they are in the
              filesystem, to very short strings, even single characters. For
              example, "alias w=´/some/file/deep/in/the/filesystem´". Now, no
              matter where you are, you can enter `w`, provided autocd and/or
              auto-open function is enabled, to access the file or directory
              you want. Theoretically at least, this procedure can be repeated
              until the system memory is exhausted.

              To create multiple aliases for files at once, this is the
              recommended procedure: 1) Select all files you want to alias
              with the sel command: `s file1 file2 file3 ...`. 2) Export the
              selected files into a temporary file running `exp sel`; 3) Edit
              this file to contain only valid alias lines:

               alias a1=´file1´
               alias b1=´file2´
               alias c1=´file3´

              Note: Make sure alias names do not conflict with other commands,
              either internal or external. To bypass the conflicts check,
              performed automatically by the `alias import` command, you can
              edit the aliases file manually (F10).

              4) Finally, import this file with the alias command:
              `alias import tmp_file`. Now you can access any of these files
              by entering just a few characters: `a1`, `b1`, and `c1`.

       auto [list | none | unset | OPTION=VALUE...]
              Set a temporary autocommand for the current directory.

              Unlike permanent autocommands, defined in the configuration file
              via the autocmd keyword (see the AUTOCOMMANDS section below),
              options set via the auto command are temporary, i.e., valid only
              for the current directory and the current session.

              Options set via this command take precedence over both permament
              autocommands and regular options (set either via the command
              line or the configuration file).

              Examples

              List available autocommands
                auto list

              List files in the current directory in long view
                auto lv=1

              List only PDF files, set the color scheme to nord, and sort
              files by size
                auto ft=.*.pdf$,cs=nord,st=size

              The same list of options can be specified sequentially (i.e.,
              previous options are preserved)
                auto ft=.*.pdf$
                auto cs=nord
                auto st=size

              Unset the files filter and the color scheme, and change sort to
              blocks
                auto ft=,cs=,st=blocks

              Unset all temporary autocommands previously set for the current
              directory
                auto unset

              Reload the current directory ignoring all autocommands
              (including permanent autocommands)
                auto none

              For the list of available option codes consult the AUTOCOMMANDS
              section or enter `help autocommands`.

       ao, auto-open [on | off | status]
              Toggle the auto-open function. If set to on, `FILE` amounts to
              `open FILE`.

       b, back [h, hist | clear | !ELN]
              Unlike `cd ..`, which changes to the parent directory of the
              current directory, this command (with no argument) changes to
              the previously visited directory. You can also use Alt+j or
              Shift-Left.

              Clifm keeps a record of all visited directories (to prevent a
              directory from being added to the directory history list use the
              DirhistIgnore option in the main configuration file). You can
              see this list by typing `b hist` or `b h`, and you can access
              any element in this list by simply passing the corresponding ELN
              in this list (preceded by an exclamation mark) to the back
              command. Example:
                      :) > ~ $ bh
                      1 /home/user
                      2 /etc
                      3 /proc
                      :) > ~ $ b !3
                      :) > /proc $

              Note: The highlighted line (by default printed in bold cyan)
              indicates the current position of the back function in the
              directory history list.

              Finally, you can also clear this history list by entering
              `b clear`.

              The best way of navigating the directory history list, however,
              is using the directory jumper function (invoked by the j
              command). You can also take a look at the dh command.

              Use the f (or forth) command to move forward, instead of
              backward, in the directory history list.

       bb, bleach FILE...
              Bleach is a builtin filenames sanitizer (based on detox
              [https://github.com/dharple/detox]), whose aim is to rename
              filenames using only ASCII characters.

              Bleach sanitizes filenames either by removing
              extended-ASCII/Unicode characters without an ASCII
              alternative/similar character, or by translating these
              characters into an alternative ASCII character based on
              familiarity/similarity.

              These following simple rules are used to compose sanitized
              filenames:
                  - NUL (\0) and slash (/) characters are completely
              disallowed
                  - Only characters from the Portable Filename Characters Set
              (a-zA-Z0-9._-) are allowed
                  - { [ ( ) ] } are replaced by a dash (-). Everything else is
              replaced by an underscore (_)
                  - Unicode characters are translated, whenever possible, into
              an ASCII replacement. Otherwise, they are just ignored. For
              example, an upper case A with diacritic (accent, umlaut,
              diaresis, and so on) will be replaced by an ASCII A, but the
              smiley face emoji will be simply ignored. A few special signs
              will be translated into text, for instance, the pound sign will
              be replaced by "_pound_" and the Euro symbol by "EUR".
              Translations are made via a translation table (see the
              cleaner_table.h in the source code).
                  - Filenames never start with a dash (-)
                  - Files named . and .. are not allowed
                  - Append .bleach to single character filenames
                  - Do not let a replacement filename start with a dot
              (hidden) if the original does not
                  - Max filename length is NAME_MAX (usually 255)

              Modified filenames will be listed on the screen asking the user
              for confirmation, allowing besides to edit (by pressing 'e') the
              list of modified filenames via a text editor.

              If the replacement filename already exists, a dash and a number
              (starting from 1) will be appended. E.g.: file-3.

       bd [NAME]
              bd is the backdir function: it takes you back to the parent
              directory matching NAME.

              With no arguments, bd lists all parent directories relative to
              the current directory, allowing the user to select an entry.
              Otherwise, it checks the absolute current directory against the
              provided query string (NAME): if only one match is found, it
              automatically changes to this directory; if multiple matches are
              found, the list of matches is presented to the user in a
              selection menu. If NAME is a directory name, bd just changes to
              this directory, be it a parent of the current directory or not.

              Tab completion and suggestions are available for this function.

              Example:

              Provided the current directory is
              /home/user/git/repositories/lambda, entering `bd git` will take
              you immediately to /home/user/git.

              Note that there is no need to type the entire directory name; if
              the query is unambiguous, only a few characters, and even just
              one, suffices to match the appropriate directory. In our
              example, `bd g` is enough to take you to /home/user/git, just as
              `bd h` will take you to /home.

              The query string can match any part of a directory name: `bd
              er`, for instance, will take you to /home/user, since it is an
              unambiguous query.

       bl FILE...
              Create symbolic links (in the current directory) for each
              specified file. For example, to create symbolic links in the
              directory dir for all PNG files in the current directory, issue
              these commands: `s *.png`, `cd dir`, and then `bl sel`.

       bm, bookmarks [a, add FILENAME NAME [SHORTCUT] | d, del NAME | e, edit
       [APP] | NAME, SHORTCUT]
              Bookmarks can be managed either from the bookmark manager screen
              or from the command line.

              1. The bookmark manager screen

              To access the bookmark manager screen enter bm. Here you can cd
              to the desired bookmark by entering either ELN or filename
              (regular files can be bookmarked as well). In this screen you
              can also add, remove, or edit your bookmarks by entering 'e' to
              edit the bookmarks file (which is simply a list of lines with
              this format: NAME:PATH. E.g.: "docs:/home/user/documents"). Make
              your changes, save, and exit.

              2. The command line

              ┌────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │Command                 │ Description                                  │
              ├────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │bm add /media/mount mnt │ Bookmark the /media/mount directory as "mnt" │
              ├────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │bm mnt                  │ Change to/open the bookmark named "mnt"      │
              ├────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │bm del mnt              │ Delete the bookmark named "mnt"              │
              ├────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │bm edit                 │ Edit your bookmarks                          │
              └────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

              A handy use for the bookmarks function is to create bookmarks
              using short names, which will be later easily accessible via tab
              completion.

              The b: prefix

              The b: prefix is used as a way to quickly access/operate on
              bookmarks. A few examples:

              ┌──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │Command       │ Description                                                  │
              ├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │b:<TAB>       │ List available bookmarks                                     │
              ├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │b:net         │ Change to the bookmark named "net" (1)                       │
              ├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │p b:bm1 b:bm2 │ Print file properties of the bookmarks named "bm1" and "bm2" │
              ├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │s b:          │ Select all bookmarks at once                                 │
              └──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

               (1) If your are not sure about where a bookmark points to, type
              `b:NAME<TAB>`.

       br, bulk FILE... [:EDITOR]
              Bulk rename FILE(s).

              Each filename will be copied to a temporary file, which will be
              opened via EDITOR (default associated application for plain text
              files if omitted), letting the user modify it. Once the file has
              been modified and saved, the modified names are printed on the
              screen and the user is asked for confirmation.

              This builtin bulk rename function will not deal with deletions,
              replacements, filename conflicts and the like. For a smarter
              alternative use qmv(1).

       c, m, md, r
              Short for the following shell commands respectively: `cp -iRp`,
              `mv -i`, `mkdir -p`, and `rm` (for files) or `rm -r` (for
              directories).

              By default, the c, m, and r commands ask for confirmation before
              operations. Since this might sometimes be quite intrusive
              (specially when operating on large number of files), it is
              possible to turn interactivity off in two different ways:

                a) For the current command only: via the -f, --force switch.
              For example: `c -f sel`, `m -f sel`, or `r -f *`.

                b) Permanently. Use the cpCmd, mvCmd, and rmForce options in
              the configuration file to permanently set any of these commands
              to non-interactive mode.

              To use these commands without any of these options, or with any
              other option you want, use the appropriate shell command, for
              instance, cp instead of c. Of course, you can also create
              aliases to use your preferred commands, for example, "c=´cp
              -adp´". Consult the alias command above for more information.

              The l command allows the use of the e, edit option to modify the
              destination of a symbolic link. For example: `l edit 12` (or
              `le 12`)  to relink the symbolic link corresponding to the file
              whose ELN is 12.

              When using the sel keyword and no destination is provided, c and
              m will copy/move selected files to the current directory.

              Whenever sel is not used, but just a source filename (and no
              destination is provided), the m command behaves much like the
              imv(1) shell command (from the ´renameutils´ package), providing
              an interactive renaming function: it prompts the user to enter a
              new name using the source filename as base, so that it does not
              need to be typed twice. For this alternative prompt, only tab
              completion for filenames is available.

              Clifm supports advcp(1), wcp, and rsync(1) to copy files (they
              include a progress bar). To use them instead of cp(1) set the
              corresponding option (cpCmd) in the configuration file. If advcp
              is selected, the command used is `advcp -giRp` (or `advcp -gRp`,
              for non-interactive mode). If rsync, the command is
              `rsync -avP`. wcp takes no argument.

              advmv(1) is also supported to move files (to add a progress bar
              to the move command). Use the mvCmd option in the configuration
              file to choose this alternative implementation of mv. In this
              case, the command used is `advmv -gi` (or advmv -g` for non-
              interactive mode).


       cd [DIR]
              Change the current working directory.

              Directory check order:
                1. If no argument is provided, change to the home directory
              ($HOME, or, if not set, the sixth field of the entry
              corresponding to the current user in /etc/passwd)
                2. If the argument is an absolute path (begins with a slash
              character), or the first component is dot (.) or dot-dot (..),
              convert to canonical form (via realpath(3)) and, if a valid
              directory, change to this directory.
                3. Check the CDPATH environment variable and append /DIR to
              each of the paths specified here. If the result of the
              concatenation is a valid directory, change to it.
                4. Check directories in the current working directory. If a
              matching directory is found, change to it.

              You can use either ELNs or a string to indicate the directory
              you want. E.g.: `cd 12` or `cd ~/media`. If autocd is enabled
              (default), `cd 12` and `cd ~/media` can be written as `12` and
              `~/media` respectively as well.

              Unlike the shell cd command, clifm's builtin cd command not only
              changes the current directory, but also lists its content
              (provided the option AutoLs is enabled, which is the default)
              according to a comprehensive list of color codes. By default,
              the output of cd is much like this shell command:
              `cd DIR && ls --color=auto --group-directories-first`.

              Automatic file listing can be disabled by either setting AutoLs
              to false in the configuration file or running clifm with the -O
              or --no-autols option.

       cl, columns [on | off]
              Toggle columned file listing.

       cmd, commands
              Show this list of commands.

              An alternative way of getting information about clifm commands
              is via the interactive help plugin (depends on fzf), by default
              bound to the ih action name.

       colors
              Preview the current color scheme (same as `cs preview`).

       config [edit [APP] | reset | reload | dump]
              Manage the main configuration file.

              To edit the configuration file use the edit subcommand. If an
              application is specified (`config edit APP`), APP will be used
              to open the file (otherwise, the default associated program will
              be used). Edit settings to your liking, save, and quit the
              editor (changes are automatically applied). Note that, since
              edit is the default action, it can be omitted. Enter just
              `config` to open the configuration file, or `config APP` to open
              it using APP.

              Use the reload subcommand to reload the main configuration file
              and update settings accordingly.

              Use the reset subcommand to generate a fresh configuration file
              and create a backup copy of the old one (named
              clifmrc.YYYYMMDD@HH:MM:SS).

              The dump subcommand prints the list of settings (as defined in
              the main configuration file) with their current value. Those
              differing from the default values are highlighted, and the
              default value for the corresponding option is displayed in
              brackets.

       cs, colorschemes [edit [APP] | n, name | p, preview | check-ext | NAME]
              With no arguments, list available color schemes (use `cs name`
              to print the current color scheme name).

              To get a preview of the current color scheme use the preview
              subcommand: `cs preview`.

              Use the check-ext subcommand to check for file extension
              conflicts: `cs check-ext`.

              Use the edit subcommand to open/edit the configuration file of
              the current color scheme (open with APP if specified, or with
              the default associated application otherwise).

              To switch color schemes, specify the color scheme name: `cs
              NAME`. (Use the TAB key to list available color schemes: `cs
              <TAB>`).

       d, dup FILE...
              Duplicate files passed as parameters, either directories or
              regular files. The user will be asked for a destination
              directory. Duplicated filenames are generated by appending
              ".copy" to the basename of each source file. For example:
              `d /my/file` will copy /my/file to the directory selected by the
              user as file.copy. If file.copy already exists, an extra suffix
              will be added as follows: file.copy-N, where N is a positive
              integer (starting at 1).

              If rsync(1) is found, it will be used as follows:
              `rsync -aczvAXHS --progress`. Else, cp(1) will be used: `cp -a`.

       dh [STRING] [PATH] [!ELN]
              With no parameters, it prints the directory history list. To
              filter this list just pass a query string: only entries matching
              this query will be displayed. In both cases, tab completion is
              available. For example: `dh down<TAB>` will list only those
              entries matching down (fuzzily, if fuzzy-matching is enabled).

              To access a specific entry, you can pass the entry number
              preceded by an exclamation mark. For example, if you want the
              entry number 12, enter `dh !12` to change to the corresponding
              directory.

              Finally, if an absolute path is passed as first parameter, dh
              works just as the cd command.

              Note: Take a look at the j command as well. Both commands deal
              with the list of visited directories, but in slightly different
              ways: while dh deals with the list of the last MaxDirhist
              entries (see the configuration file), the j command deals with
              the ranked list of visited directories.

       ds, desel [*, a, all | FILE]...
              Deselect one or more files.

              If no parameter is passed, the user is prompted to either mark
              selected files to be deselected or to edit the selections file
              (entering ´e´) via a text editor to manually deselect files.

              Use *, a or all to deselect all selected entries at once. E.g.:
              `ds *`.

              You can also pass the filename(s) (or ELNs) to be deselected as
              a parameter. For example: `ds myfile 24`.

              Tab completion is available for this command: `ds <TAB>` will
              list all currently selected files.

       exp [FILE]...
              With no argument, export the list of files in the current
              directory to a temporary file. Otherwise, export only those
              specified as further arguments: they can be directories,
              filenames, ELNs or some search expression like "*.c".

       ext [on | off | status]
              Toggle the ability to execute external commands.

       f, forth [h, hist | clear | !ELN]
              This command works just like the back command, but it goes
              forward, instead of backward, in the history record.

              Run `f` to change to the next visited directory (you can also
              just press Alt+k or Shift+Right).

              Of course, you can use `f hist`, `f h`, and `f !ELN` (consult
              the back command for details).

       fc [on | off | status]
              By default, clifm prints the number of files contained by listed
              directories next to directory names. However, since this is an
              expensive feature, it might be desirable (for example, when
              listing files on a remote machine) to disable this feature. Use
              the off subcommand to disable it. To permanently disable it, use
              the FileCounter option in the configuration file.

       ff, dirs-first [on | off | status]
              Toggle list directories first.

       ft, filter [unset] [[!]REGEX,=FILE-TYPE-CHAR]
              Filter the current list of files, either by filename (via a
              regular expression) or file type (via a file type character).

              With no argument, ft prints the current filter. To remove the
              current filter use the unset option. To set a new filter enter
              `ft` followed by a filter expression (use the exclamation mark
              to reverse the meaning of a filter). Examples:

              Exclude hidden files:
               ft !^.

              List only files ending with .pdf:
               ft .*\.pdf$

              List only symbolic links:
               ft =l

              Exclude socket files:
               ft !=s

              The list of file type characters is included in the FILE FILTERS
              section below.

              The filter will be lost at program exit. To permanently set a
              filter use the Filter option (in the configuration file) or the
              CLIFM_FILTER environment variable (consult the ENVIRONMENT and
              the FILE FILTERS sections below).

       fz [on | off]
              Toggle recursive directory sizes (long view only).

       hf, hh, hidden [on | off | first | last | status]
              Turn hidden files on/off (use first/last to sort hidden files
              before/after non-hidden files respectively).

       history [edit [APP] | clear | -N | on | off | status | show-time]
              With no arguments, it prints the commands history list (use
              show-time to print timestamps as well). If clear is passed as
              argument, it will delete all entries in the history file. Use
              edit to open the history file and modify it as required (the
              file will be opened with APP, if specified, or with the default
              associated application otherwise). -N tells the history command
              to list only the last 'N' commands in the history list. Finally,
              you can disable history (subsequent entries will not be written
              into the history file) via `history off` (you can also use the
              HistIgnore option in the configuration file to prevent specific
              command lines from being added to the history list).

              You can use the exclamation mark (!) to perform some history
              commands:
                !<TAB>: List history entries
                !!: Execute the last command.
                !n: Execute the command number ´n´ in the history list.
                !-n: Execute the ´last - n´ command in the history list.
                !STRING: Execute the command starting with STRING. Tab
              completion is available in this case: !STRING<TAB>.

       icons [on | off]
              Toggle icons.

              Note: Depending on how the terminal renders icons, the apparent
              space between icons and filenames may not be the most
              appropriate. This space can be adjusted using the IconsGap
              option in the configuration file (valid values: 0, 1, 2).

       j [--purge [NUM] | --edit], jc, jl, jp [STR]..., je
              j is the fastest way of using Kangaroo, a directory jumper
              function used to quickly navigate through the jump database
              (i.e. a database of visited directories).

              With no argument, j just lists the entries in the jump database
              (1)(2), printing: a) order number of the corresponding entry, b)
              total sum of visits, c) days since the first visit, d) hours
              since the last visit, e) the rank value, and f) the directory
              name itself. An asterisk next to the rank value means that the
              corresponding directory will not be removed from the database,
              despite its rank, either because it has been visited in the last
              24 hours, or because it is bookmarked, pinned, or currently
              active in some workspace.

              (1) To prevent a directory from being added to the jump database
              use the DirhistIgnore option in the main configuration file.

              (2) To prevent a directory from being removed from the jump
              database, edit the database (`j edit`) and prepend a plus sign
              (+) to the corresponding line.

              Otherwise, if a query string is provided as parameter, B
              searches for this string in the database and cd to the best
              ranked matching entry. Example: `j Down` will probably take you
              to /home/user/Downloads, provided this directory has been
              already visited and is the best ranked match in the database.
              For a more detailed description of the matching algorithm see
              the KANGAROO FRECENCY ALGORITHM section below.

              Multiple query strings can be passed to the function. For
              example, `j et mo` will first check for "et" in the jump
              database and then will further filter the search using the
              second parameter: "mo". It will most probably take you (again,
              provided the directory has been already visited and is the best
              ranked match) to /etc/modprobe.d directory. Bear in mind that if
              STR is an actual directory, jump will just cd to it without
              performing any query.

              The backslash (\) and the slash (/) can be used to instruct
              Kangaroo to search for the string query only in the first or
              last path segment of each entry in the database respectively.
              Let´s suppose we have two entries matching src in the database:
              /media/src/images and /home/user/Downloads/clifm/src. If the
              first entry is better ranked than the second, `j src` will match
              this first entry. However, if what we really want is the second
              entry, appending a slash to the query string instructs Kangaroo
              to only match entries having src in the last path segment, here
              /home/user/Downloads/clifm/src.

              Since it is not always obvious or easy to know where exactly a
              query string will take you, clifm (if the suggestions system is
              enabled) will print, at the right of the cursor, the path
              matched by Kangaroo. If that is the actually intended path,
              press the Right arrow key to accept the suggestion. Otherwise,
              it will be ignored. You can also use tab completion to print the
              list of matches for the current query string. For example: `j -
              c<TAB>` to list all entries in the directory history list
              containing a dash (-) and a ´c´.

              The j command accepts four modifiers: e, p, c, and l, the first
              standing for "edit", the second for "parent", the third for
              "child", and the last one for "list". Thus, `je` (or `j --edit`)
              will open the jump database to be edited as required; `jc` will
              search for files querying only child directories relative to the
              current working directory, while `jp` will do the same, but for
              parent directories. Finally, `jl` just prints the matches for
              the given query string(s), but without changing the current
              directory. Examples:


              ┌────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │Command     │ Description                                                                      │
              ├────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │jp foo      │ Change to the best ranked parent directory containing the string "foo".          │
              ├────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │jc bar test │ Change to the best ranked child directory containing the string "bar" and "test" │
              ├────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
              │jl foo      │ Print all entries in the database containing the word "foo"                      │
              └────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

              Use the --purge option to shrink the database. Without further
              parameters, --purge removes all non-existent (un-stat´able)
              directories from the database. If a numeric parameter is passed,
              by contrast, all entries ranked below this number will be
              removed from the database. For example, `j --purge 100` will
              remove all entries ranked below 100.

              You can also manually edit the database file using the `je` (or
              `j --edit`) command: edit whatever needs to be edited, save
              changes, and close the editor. This is useful, for example, to
              remove a specific entry/directory from the database (however,
              bear in mind that if the directory is in the directory history,
              it will not be removed from the jump database).

              To mark an entry as permanent (prevent it from being removed
              from the database), follow any of these procedures:
               a. Bookmark it.
               b. Edit the jump database (`je` or `j --edit`) and prepend a
              plus sign (+) to the corresponding entry.

              An alternative way of navigating the jump database is using the
              jumper plugin (located in the plugins directory and bound by
              default to the ++ action name), which uses fzf to enable fuzzy
              searches. Enter `++` to perform a fuzzy search over the jump
              database.

              Take a look at the dh command as well.

       k
              If running in long view, toggle follow-links (Alt++ is also
              available). See the -L,--follow-symlinks-long command line
              switch.

       kk
              Toggle max-filename-len (Ctrl+Alt+l is also available)

       kb, keybinds [list | bind FUNCTION | edit [APP] | conflict | reset |
       readline]
              With no argument (or if the argument is list), prints the
              current keybindings and their associated functions.

              To change a keybinding use the bind subcommand.

              Type `kb bind <TAB>` to get the list of bindable functions.

              Enter `kb bind FUNCTION` to set a new keybinding for FUNCTION.
              For example, to bind the function previous-dir to a new key,
              enter `kb bind previous-dir`. You'll see a little prompt: press
              the key combination you want to associate to the specified
              function and then press Enter (while in this prompt, press
              Ctrl+d to abort or Ctrl+c to clear the current line).

              To manually edit your keybindings use the edit option (the
              keybindings file will be opened with APP, if specified, or with
              the default associated application otherwise).

              If you somehow messed up your keybindings, you can check for
              keybinding conflicts with the conflict option, or use the reset
              option to create a fresh keybindings file with the default
              values.

              To unbind a function run `kb edit` and comment out the
              corresponding entry. Note that some functions may have several
              entries, associating them to multiple keybindings: comment them
              out all if required.

              To list readline keybindings (defined in
              ~/.config/clifm/readline.clifm), use the readline option. The
              syntax is the same as the one used by readline's .inputrc file
              (consult
              http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#SEC9 for
              more information.)

       l, le
              Create (l) or edit (le) symbolic links.

              The syntax for the l command is: l TARGET [LINK_NAME]. Note that
              if LINK_NAME is omitted, the symbolic link is created as
              TARGET_BASENAME.link in the current directory.

              By default, the link target is created literally (like `ln -s`
              would). The link creation mode can be set using the
              LinkCreationMode option in the configuration file. Available
              modes are: absolute, literal, and relative (like `ln -rs`
              would).

              To edit the target of a symbolic link use the le command
              followed by the desired link name. The user will be prompted to
              enter a new link target, using the current target as template.

       ll, lv [on | off]
              Toggle the long view.

       lm [on | off]
              Toggle the light mode. This option, aimed at making file listing
              faster than the default mode, is especially useful for really
              old hardware or when working on remote machines (for more
              information see the NOTE ON SPEED section below).

       log [cmd | msg] [list | on | off | status | clear]
              Enable, disable, clear, list or check the status of the program
              logs, either message (errors and warnings) or command logs.
              Example: `log cmd on`, to enable command logs, or `log msg
              clear`, to clear/remove message logs.

              Consult the FILES section below for information about how logs
              are written to the logs file.

       media
              Note: This command is Linux-specific

              List available storage devices and mount/unmount the selected
              one using either udevil or udisks2 (at least one of these must
              be installed. udevil will be preferred over udisks2). If the
              device is unmounted, it will be automatically mounted, and if
              mounted, it will be automatically unmounted.

              Though mountpoints are determined by the mounting application
              itself (udevil or udisks2), clifm will automatically cd to the
              corresponding mountpoint whenever the mount operation was
              successful.

              When unmounting, and if the current directory is inside the
              mountpoint, clifm will attempt to cd to the previous visited
              directory, and, if none, to the home directory, before
              unmounting the device.

              To get information about a device, enter `iELN`, for example,
              `i12`, provided ´12´ is the ELN of the device you want.

       mf [NUM | unset]
              List only up to NUM files (valid range: >= 0). Use unset to list
              all files (default). An indicator (listed_files/total_files)
              will be printed below the list of files whenever some file is
              excluded from the current list (e.g. 20/310). Note, however,
              that though some files are excluded, all of them are loaded
              anyway, so that you can still perform any valid operation on
              them. For example, even if only 10 files are listed, you can
              still search for all symbolic links in the corresponding
              directory using the appropriate command: `/* -l`.

       mm, mime [open FILE | info FILE | edit [APP] | import]
              This is Lira, clifm's file opener.

              Use the open subcommand to open a file with the default
              associated application. Note that, since open is the default
              action, it can be omitted. For example: `mm file.pdf`. The same
              can be achieved more easily using the open command: `open
              file.pdf` (or using the short command, `o file.pdf`). Or, even
              shorter, just `file.pdf`.

              The info option prints MIME information about FILE: its MIME
              type, and, if any, the application (for both opening and
              previewing) associated with this filename or with the file's
              MIME type. If the application is associated with the file's
              name, [FILENAME] is printed after the associated application,
              otherwise, if associated with the file's MIME type, [MIME] is
              printed.

              The edit option allows you to edit and customize the MIME list
              file. So, if a file has no default associated application, first
              get its MIME info or its file extension (running
              `mm info FILE`), and then add a value for it to the MIME list
              file using the edit option (`mm edit` or F6). Check the FILE
              OPENER section below for information about the mimelist file
              syntax.

              Finally, via the import option clifm will try to import MIME
              associations from the system looking for mimeapps.list files in
              those paths specified by the Freedesktop specification (see
              https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mime-apps-spec/mime-apps-spec-latest.html).
              If at least one MIME association is successfully imported, it
              will be stored as mimelist.clifm.XXXXXX (where XXXXXX is a
              random six digits alphanumerical string). You can add these new
              associations to your mimelist file using the `mime edit`
              command.

       mp, mountpoints
              List available mountpoints and change the current working
              directory to the selected mountpoint.

       msg, messages [clear]
              With no arguments, prints the list of messages in the current
              session. The clear option tells clifm to empty the messages
              list.

       n, new [FILE[@TEMPLATE]]... [DIR/]...
              Create new regular files and/or directories.

              If a filename ends with a slash (/), it will be taken as a
              directory name. Else, it will be created as a regular file.
              E.g.: `n myfile mydir/`, to create a file named myfile and a
              directory named mydir. If no filename is provided, the user will
              be prompted to enter one.

              Automatic templates

              New regular files will be created from a template file if:

               1. The file to be created has a filename extension (e.g.,
              file.html).
               2. A file named like this extension, here html, exists in the
              templates directory (1).

              If both conditions are met, running `n file.html` will create a
              new file named file.html which is a copy of the html file in the
              templates directory.

              Note that template names are not limited to actual file
              extensions: you can name your templates whatever you like (with
              any content you want) provided new files are created using the
              template name as extension. E.g.: `n
              file.my_super_cool_template`.

              Explicit templates

              If a filename is followed by the expression @TEMPLATE, where
              TEMPLATE is any regular file found in the templates
              directory(1), the file will be created as a copy of the
              corresponding file template. E.g., `n file.sh@my_script.sh`.

              Tab completion is available for explicit templates: `n
              file@<TAB>`.

              (1) The templates directory is $CLIFM_TEMPLATES_DIR,
              $XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR, or ~/Templates, in this precedence order.

              Filename validation is performed over names before creation. In
              case of an unsafe name, the user is warned and asked for
              confirmation.

              A name (namely, any component of a path) is considered unsafe
              if:
                1. Starts with a dash (-): command option flags collision
                2. Is a reserved keyword/expression (internal): fastback
              (...), ELN/range (12, 1-45), and MIME/file type expansion
              (@query, =x)
                3. Is a reserved system/shell keyword (´~´, ´.´ ,´..´)
                4. Contains embedded control characters (0x00-0x1f in the
              ASCII table)
                5. Contains embedded shell meta-characters
              (*?:[]"<>|(){}&'!\;$)
                6. It is too long (larger than NAME_MAX, usually 255 bytes)

       net [NAME | list | edit | m, mount NAME | u, unmount NAME]
              1. The configuration file

              The net command manages connections to remote systems via a
              simple samba-like configuration file
              ($HOME/.config/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/nets.clifm). Here you can
              specify multiple remotes and options for each of these remotes.
              Syntax example for this file:

               [remote_name]
               Comment=A nice descriptive comment
               Mountpoint=/path/to/mountpoint
               MountCmd=sudo mount.cifs //192.168.0.12/share %m -o OPTIONS
               UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
               AutoUnmount=true (Auto-unmount this remote at exit)
               AutoMount=false (Auto-mount this remote at startup)

              Note: %m can be used as a placeholder for Mountpoint. %m will be
              replaced by the value of Mountpoint.

              1.a. Mounting remote filesystems

              A Samba share:
                [samba_share]
                Comment=My samba share
                Mountpoint="~/.config/clifm/mounts/smb_share"
                MountCmd=sudo mount.cifs //192.168.0.26/samba_share %m -o
              mapchars,credentials=/etc/samba/credentials/samba_share
                UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
                AutoUnmount=false
                AutoMount=false

              A SSH filesystem (sshfs):
                [ssh_share]
                Comment=My ssh share
                Mountpoint="/media/ssh"
                MountCmd=sshfs user@192.168.0.26: %m -C -p 22
                UnmountCmd=fusermount3 -u %m
                AutoUnmount=true
                AutoMount=false

              1.b. Mounting local filesystems

              Though originally intended to manage remote filesystems, net can
              also manage local filesystems. Just provide the appropriate
              mount and unmount commands. Since the device name assigned by
              the kernel might change across reboots (specially when it comes
              to removable drives), it is recommended to mount using the
              device´s UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) instead of the drive
              name. For example:

                MountCmd=sudo mount -U c98d91g4-6781... %m

              Here´s an example of how to set up net to mount USB devices, one
              with a FAT filesystem, and another with an ISO9660 filesystem:

                [Sandisk USB]
                Comment=Sandisk USB drive
                Mountpoint="/media/usb"
                MountCmd=sudo mount -o gid=1000,fmask=113,dmask=002 -U
              5847-xxxx %m
                UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
                AutoUnmount=false
                AutoMount=false

                [Kingston USB]
                Comment=Kingston USB drive
                Mountpoint="/media/usb2"
                MountCmd=sudo mount -t iso9660 -U 2020-10-01-15-xx-yy-zz %m
                UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
                AutoUnmount=false
                AutoMount=false

              Note: The gid, fmask, and dmask options are used to allow the
              user to access the mountpoint without elevated privileges.

              If the device data is unknown, as it often happens when it comes
              to removable devices, you should use the media command instead.

              2. Command syntax

              Without arguments (or via the list subcommand), net lists the
              configuration for each remote available in the configuration
              file.

              Use the edit option to edit the remotes configuration file. If
              no further argument is specified, the file will be opened with
              the current file opener. However, you can pass an application as
              second parameter to open to configuration file. For example:
              `net edit nano`.

              If not already mounted, the m, mount option mounts the specified
              remote using the mount command and the mounpoint specified in
              the configuration file and automatically cd to the corresponding
              mountpoint. For example: `net mount smb_work`. Since mount is
              the default action, it can be omitted: `net smb_work`.

              The u, unmount option unmounts the specified remote using the
              unmount command specified in the configuration file. For
              example: `net unmount smb_work`. Tab completion is also
              available for this function.

              Note: If you only need to copy some files to a remote location
              (including mobile phones) without the need to mount the
              resource, you can make use of the cprm.sh plugin, bound by
              default to the cr action. Set up your remotes (`cr --edit`) and
              then send the file you want (`cr FILE`).

       o, open FILE [APPLICATION]
              Open FILE, which can be either a directory (in which case it
              works just like the cd command), a regular file, or a symbolic
              link to either of the two. For example: `o 12`, `o filename`,
              `o /path/to/filename`.

              By default, the open command will open files with the default
              application associated to them via Lira, the builtin file opener
              (see the mime command above). However, if you want to open a
              file with a different application, add the application name as
              second argument, e.g. `o 12 leafpad` or `o12 leafpad`.

              If you want to run the program in the background, simply add the
              ampersand character, as usual: `o 12 &`, `o 12&`, `o12&` or (if
              auto-open is enabled) just `12&`.

              If the file to be opened is an archive/compressed file, the
              archive function (see the ad command above) will be executed
              instead.

       oc FILE...
              Interactively change file ownership.

              A new prompt is displayed using user and primary group common to
              all files passed as parameters as ownership template.

              Ownership (both user and primary group, if specified) is changed
              for all files passed as parameters. If the file is a symbolic
              link, the operation is performed on the target file, and not on
              the symbolic link itself. Bear in mind that recursion is not
              supported: use chown(1) (with the -R option) instead.

              Both names and ID numbers are allowed (Tab completion for names
              is available).

              If only a name/number is entered, it is taken as the user who
              owns the file(s).

              Use the pc command to edit files permissions.

       opener [default | APPLICATION]
              With no argument, prints the currently used file opener (by
              default, Lira, clifm´s builtin opener). Otherwise, set
              APPLICATION (say rifle or xdg-open) as opener or, if default is
              passed instead, use Lira.

       ow FILE [APPLICATION]
              If APPLICATION is specified, open FILE with APPLICATION. In case
              you need to add parameters to APPLICATION, it is recommended to
              quote the expression: `ow FILE "APP ARG..."`.

              If APPLICATION is not specified, the list of available
              applications associated to FILE (either via its MIME type or its
              file extension) is printed, allowing the user to choose one of
              these applications, and then open the file with the selected
              application.

              This command supports tab completion. Type `ow FILE <TAB>` and
              the list of applications able to open FILE will be displayed
                   .

       p, pp, prop FILE...
              Print file properties for FILE. The output of this function is
              much like the combined output of the shell commands`ls -l` and
              `stat`.

              By default, directory sizes are not displayed. Use pp instead of
              just p to print directory sizes as well (it could take longer
              depending on the directory's content). On the other side, and
              unlike p, pp provides information about the dereferenced
              symlinks (namely, the symlink target) instead of the symlink
              itself. However, note that, in case of symbolic links to
              directories, p provides information about the link target if the
              provided filename ends with a slash. Otherwise, information
              about the link itself is displayed.

              The time format used to display time information can be
              customized via the PTimeStyle option in the configuration file
              (defaults to "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N %z", where %N stands for
              nano-second precision).

              If you need to list the properties of all files in the current
              directory, try the long view (ll or Alt+l). Fields displayed in
              this mode can be customized using the PropFields option in the
              configuration file. For custom timestamp formats use the
              TimeStyle option.

              For more information about file details consult the file-details
              help topic: `help file-details`.

       pc FILE...
              Interactively change file permissions (only traditional Unix
              permissions are supported).

              A new prompt is displayed using actual permissions (in symbolic
              notation) of the file to be edited as template. If editing
              multiple files with different sets of permissions, only shared
              permission bits are set in the permissions template.

              Bear in mind that, if editing multiple files at once, say `pc
              sel` or `pc *.c`, the new permissions set will be applied to all
              of them.

              Both symbolic and octal notation for the new permissions set are
              allowed.

              Recursively setting file permissions is not supported. Use
              chmod(1) with the -R flag instead.

              If you just need to toggle the executable permission bit on a
              file, you can use the te command.

              Use the oc command to edit files ownership.

       pf, profile [ls, list | set, add, del PROFILE | rename PROFILE
       NEW_NAME]
              With no arguments, prints the name of the currently used
              profile. Use the ls or list option to list available profiles.
              To switch, add, delete, or rename a profile, use the set, add,
              del, and rename options respectively.

       pg, pager [on | off | once | status | NUM]
              Run or set Mas, clifm's builtin files pager.

              With no parameter, just run the pager (Alt+0 is also available).

              If set to on, run the pager whenever the list of files does not
              fit on the screen.

              Set it to any positive integer greater than 1 to run the pager
              whenever the number of files in the current directory is greater
              than or equal to this value, say 1000 (0 amounts to off and 1 to
              on).

              Set to once to run the pager only a single time (overwriting
              whatever was its previous value).

              While paging, the following keys are available:

               ?, h: Help
               Down arrow, Enter, Space: Advance one line
               Page down: Advance one page
               q: Stop paging (without printing remaining files)
               c: Stop paging (printing remaining files)

              Note: To scroll lines up, use whatever your terminal emulator
              has to offer (e.g.: mouse scrolling or some keybinding).

              By default, the pager lists files using the current listing mode
              (long or short). Use PagerView in the configuration file (or
              --pager-view in the command line) to force the use of a specific
              mode. Possibles values:

               auto: Use the current listing mode (default)
               long: List files in long view
               short: List files in short view

       pin [FILE/DIR]
              Pin a file or directory to be accessed later via the comma (,)
              keyword. For example, run `pin mydir` and then access mydir as
              follows: `cd ,` where the comma is automatically expanded to the
              pinned file, in this case mydir. The comma keyword could be used
              with any command, either internal or external, e.g, `ls ,`.

              With no arguments, the pin command prints the current pinned
              file, if any. If an argument is given, it will be taken as a
              filename to be pinned. Running this command again, frees the
              previous pinned file and sets a new one. In other words, only
              one pin is supported at a time.

              An easy alternative to create as many pins or shortcuts as you
              want, and how you want, is to use the alias function. Bookmarks
              could also be used to achieve a very similar result.

              At program exit, the pinned file is written to a file in the
              configuration directory (as .pin) to be loaded in the next
              session.

       prompt [set NAME | list | edit [APP] | unset | reload]
              Manage clifm's prompts. Use the set subcommand to temporarily
              change the current prompt to the prompt named NAME (use the
              unset subcommand to unset the current prompt and set the default
              one). Available prompts (which can be listed using `prompt list`
              or `prompt set <TAB>`) are defined in the prompts file
              ($HOME/.config/clifm/prompts.clifm). To permanently set a
              prompt, edit your color scheme file (via the `cs edit` command)
              and set Prompt to either a prompt code or a prompt name (as
              defined in the prompts file).

       q, quit, exit
              Quit clifm.

       rf, refresh
              Refresh the screen, that is, reprint files in the current
              directory and update the prompt. If the current directory is not
              accessible for any reason, rf will go up until it finds an
              accessible one and then will change to this directory.

       rl, reload
              Reload all settings, except those passed as command line
              arguments, from the configuration file.

       rr [DIR] [EDITOR]
              Remove files and/or directories in bulk using a text editor.

              rr writes all filenames in DIR (or in the current directory if
              DIR is omitted) to a temporary file and opens it using EDITOR
              (or the default associated application for text/plain MIME type,
              if EDITOR is omitted).

              Once in the editor, remove the lines corresponding to the files
              you want to delete. Save changes and close the editor. Removed
              files will be listed and the user asked for confirmation.

       s, sel FILE... [[!]PATTERN] [-FILETYPE] [:PATH]
              Mark one or more files (either regular files or directories) as
              selected (send to the Selection Box). sel accepts individual
              elements, range of elements, say 1-6, filenames and paths, just
              as wildcards (globbing) and regular expressions. For example: `s
              1 4-10 ^r file* filename /path/to/filename`.

              If not in light mode, once a file is selected, and if the file
              is in the current directory, the corresponding filename will be
              highlighted with a mark (colored according to the value of li in
              the color scheme file (by default bold green)) at the left of
              the filename (and at the right of its ELN).

              Just as in the search function, it is also possible to further
              filter the list of matches indicating the desired file type. For
              instance, `s ^ -d` will select all directories in the current
              directory. For available file type filters see the search
              function above.

              By default, the selection function operates on the current
              working directory. To select files in any other directory use
              the ":PATH" expression. For example, to select all regular files
              with a .conf extension in the /etc directory, the command would
              be: `s .*\.conf$ -f :/etc`, or using wildcards: `s *.conf
              -f :/etc`. Of course, you can also do just `s -f /etc/*.conf`.

              Just as in the case of the search function, inverse matching is
              supported for patterns, either wildcards or regular expressions.
              To invert the meaning and action of a pattern, prepend an
              exclamation mark (!). E.g., to select all non-hidden regular
              files in the Documents directory, issue this command: `s !^. -f
              :Documents`, or, to select all directories in /etc, except those
              ending with ".d": `s !*.d -d :/etc`.

              Glob and regular expressions can be used together. For example:
              `s ^[r|R].*d$ /etc/*.conf` will select all files starting with
              either 'r' or 'R' and ending with 'd' in the current directory,
              plus all .conf files in the /etc directory. However, this use is
              discouraged if both patterns refer to the same directory, since
              the second one will probably override the result of the first
              one.

              It is important to note that glob expressions are evaluated
              before regular expressions, in such a way that any pattern that
              could be understood by both kinds of pattern matching mechanisms
              will be evaluated first according to the former, that is, as a
              glob expression. For example, '.*', as regular expression,
              should match all files. However, since glob expressions are
              evaluated first, it will only match hidden files. To select all
              files using a glob expression, try ´.* *´, or, with a regular
              expression: ´^´ or ´(.*?)´. The keyboard shortcut Alt+a is also
              available to perform the same operation.

              The Selection Box is accessible from different instances of the
              program, provided they use the same profile (see the profile
              command below). By default, indeed, each profile keeps a private
              Selection Box, being thus not accessible to other profiles. You
              can nonetheless modify this behavior via the ShareSelbox option
              in the configuration file. If ShareSelbox is enabled, selected
              files are stored in /tmp/clifm/username/.selbox.clifm.
              Otherwise, /tmp/clifm/username/.selbox_profilename.clifm is used
              (this is the default).

              Operating on selected files

              To operate on one or more selected files use the sel keyword (s:
              can be used as well). For example, to print the file properties
              of all selected files: `p sel` (or `p s:)`. Use `s:<TAB>` to
              list selected files (multi-selection is available if running in
              fzf mode).

              Listing selected files

              To list selected files use the sb command (standing for
              Selection Box). You can also type `s:<TAB>`.

              Deselecting files

              To deselect files use the ds command (see above). You can also
              press Alt+d to deselect all files at once.

              Note:  If there is a file named sel in the current directory,
              use ./sel to distinguish it from the sel keyword. For example,
              enter `p ./sel` to tell clifm that you want to get the
              properties of the file named sel rather than the properties of
              the currently selected files.

              For more information consult the BUILT-IN EXPANSIONS section
              below.

       sb, selbox
              Print the elements currently contained in the Selection Box.

       st, sort [METHOD] [rev]
              With no argument, print the current sort order. Else, sort files
              by METHOD, where METHOD is one of: 0=none, 1=name, 2=size,
              3=atime, 4=btime, 5=ctime, 6=mtime, 7=version, 8=extension,
              9=inode, 10=owner, 11=group, 12=blocks, 13=links, or 14=type
              (e.g.: st atime or st 3). Methods 10 and 11 sort by owner and
              group ID names if using ID names in long view (see the
              PropFields option in the configuration file). Else, ID numbers
              are used. The default order is version.

              By default, files are sorted from less to more (e.g.: from ´a´
              to ´z´ if sorting by name). Use the rev subcommand to invert
              this order. E.g.: `st rev` or `st inode rev`. Switch back to the
              previous state by running `st rev` again.

              Take a look at the configuration file for extra sort options
              (ListDirsFirst, PrioritySortChar, ShowHiddenFiles).

       stats
              Print file statistics for files in the current directory (not
              available in light mode).

       t, trash [FILE... | ls, list | clear, empty | del [FILE]...]
              Move specified files to the trash can (e.g. `t file1 file2`).

              With no argument (or by passing the ls option), it prints the
              list of currently trashed files. The clear (or empty) sucommand
              removes all files from the trash can, while the del subcommand
              lists trashed files allowing the user to permanently remove one
              or more trashed files. If using del, tab completion to
              list/select currently trashed files is available.

              The trash directory is $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash, falling back to
              $HOME/.local/share/Trash. To set an alternative trash directory
              use the -T,--trash-dir command line option.

              Since this trash system follows the Freedesktop specification,
              it is able to handle files trashed by different Trash
              implementations.

              To restore trashed files (to their original location) see the
              untrash command below.

       tag [add | del | list | list-full | new | merge | rename | untag]
       [FILE]... [[:]TAG]
              tag is the main Etiqueta command, clifm's builtin files tagging
              system. See the FILE TAGS section for a complete description of
              this command.

       te FILE...
              Toggle the executable bit (on user, group, and others) on
              FILE(s). It is equivalent to the -x and +x options for the
              chmod(1) command.

       tips
              Print the list of clifm tips.

       u, untrash [*, a, all | FILE]...
              If filenames are passed as parameters, restore them to their
              original location. Otherwise, this function prints a list of
              currently trashed files allowing the user to choose one or more
              of these files to be restored. Use the *, a or all parameters to
              restore all trashed files at once. Tab completion to list/select
              currently trashed files is available.

       unpin
              This command takes no argument. It just frees the current pin
              and, if it exists, deletes the .pin file generated by the pin
              command.

       vv FILE... DIR
              Copy FILE(s) to DIR and bulk rename them at once.

       ver, version
              Show clifm version details.

       view [edit [APP] | purge]
              preview files in the current directory (full screen). Requires
              fzf(1). Alt+- is also available.

              By pressing Enter or Right, the currently highlighted file will
              be selected and view closed. To select multiple files, mark them
              with the TAB key and then press Enter or Right to confirm. To
              quit view press Escape or the Left arrow key.

              Run `view purge` to purge the thumbnails directory
              ($XDG_CACHE_HOME/clifm/thumbnails) of dangling thumbnails.

              To edit the previewer configuration file enter `view edit`, or
              `view edit vi` to open it with a specific application, in this
              case, vi(1).

              For image previews consult the Wiki
              (https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/tree/master/misc/tools/imgprev)
              or enter `help image-previews`.

              For further information consult the SHOTGUN section below.

       ws [NUM/NAME | unset | + | -]
              Clifm offers up to eight workspaces, each with its own
              independent path.

              With no argument, the ws command prints the list of workspaces
              and its corresponding paths, highlighting the current workspace.

              Use NUM to switch to the workspace number NUM, NAME to switch to
              the workspace named NAME, the plus sign (+) to switch to the
              next workspace, and the minus sign (-) to switch to the previous
              workspace.

              To unset a workspace use the unset subcommand preceded by the
              workspace (either number or name) to be unset. For example: `ws
              2 unset`.

              Four keyboard shortcuts are available to easily switch to any of
              the first four workspaces: Alt+[1-4].

              Every time an empty workspace is created, it starts in the
              current working directory.

              Though by default workspaces are unnamed, you can name them
              however you like using the WorkspaceNames option in the
              configuration file.

              Use autocommands to persistenly set options per workspace, for
              example, to always list files in the third workspace in long
              view. See the AUTOCOMMANDS section below for more information.

              Make local settings private to the current workspace by setting
              the PrivateWorkspaceSettings option to true in the configuration
              file: settings changed via either the command line or keyboard
              shortcuts (say Alt+l, to toggle the long view) will apply only
              to the current workspace and will be remembered even when
              switching workspaces.

              To directly operate on a workspace (namely, the path it points
              to) you can use the w: prefix followed by a workspace number or
              name. For example, to copy all .png files in the current
              directory to the third workspace, enter `c *.png w:3`. Press TAB
              immediately after w: to get the list of available workspaces.

       x, X [DIR]
              Open DIR, or the current working directory if DIR is not
              specified, in a new instance of clifm (as root if X, as the
              current unprivileged user if x) using the value of TerminalCmd
              (from the configuration file) as terminal emulator. If this
              value is not set, xterm will be used as fallback terminal
              emulator. This function is only available for graphical
              environments.

       Shell-builtins implementations

              pwd [-LP]

                Print the current working directory

              export NAME=VALUE...

                Export variables to the environment

              umask [VALUE]

                Print/set the current umask value

              unset NAME

                Remove a variable from the environment


5. FILE FILTERS
       Clifm provides multiple ways to filter the current list of files:

       a) Hidden files: via the -A and -a command line flags, the hh command,
       and the Alt+. keybinding.

       Files listed in a file named .hidden in the current directory will be
       hidden as well whenever hidden files are not shown (wildcards are
       supported).

       b) Directories: via the --only-dirs command line switch and the Alt+,
       keybinding.

       c) Filenames and file types: either via a regular expression or a file
       type character (see below) using the ft command (the Filter option in
       the configuration file and the CLIFM_FILTER environment variable are
       also available). For example, to exclude backup files (ending with a
       tilde):

        CLIFM_FILTER=´!.*~$´ clifm

       or (in the configuration file):

        Filter="!.*~$"

       or (via the ft command):

        ft !.*~$

       See the ft command for a few more examples.

       d) Filtering files via the TAB key:

       You can filter files by name using wildcards. For example: `p
       *.mp3<TAB>` (or `/*.mp3<TAB>`) to get a list of MP3 files in the
       current directory.

       Files can also be filtered by MIME-type using the  @ prefix. Type
       `@<TAB>` to list all MIME-types found in the current directory, or
       `@query<TAB>` to list all files whose MIME-type includes the string
       "query". For example, `@image<TAB>` will list all files in the current
       directory whose MIME type includes the string "image".

       Finally, files can be filtered as well by file type using the = prefix
       followed by a file type character (see below). For example, `=l<TAB>`
       to get a list of symbolic links in the current directory.

       Note: If using tab completion in fzf mode, multi-selection is allowed
       (except in the case of `@<TAB>`).

       Available file type characters:

        b: Block devices
        c: Character devices
        C: Files with capabilities (1)(2)
        d: Directories
        D: Empty directories
        f: Regular files
        F: Empty regular files
        g: SGID files (2)
        h: Multi-hardlink files (directories excluded)
        l: Symbolic links
        L: Broken symbolic links
        o: Other-writable files (2)
        p: FIFO/pipes (2)
        s: Sockets (2)
        O: Doors (Solaris only)
        P: Event ports (Solaris only)
        t: Files with the sticky bit set (2)
        u: SUID files (2)
        x: Executable files (2)

       (1) Only for tab completion
       (2) Not available in light mode

       e) Grouping files (via automatic expansion):

       By means of the above features, you can easily group and operate on
       groups of files. For example, this command:

        vt b: @image =x sel t:work *.txt

       opens a virtual directory (see the VIRTUAL DIRECTORIES section below)
       automatically expanding the above expressions as follows:


       ┌────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
       │Expression  │  Description                │
       ├────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
       │b:          │  All your bookmarks (paths) │
       ├────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
       │@image      │  All image files (CWD)      │
       ├────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
       │=x          │  All executable files (CWD) │
       ├────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
       │sel         │  All selected files         │
       ├────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
       │t:work      │  All files tagged as work   │
       ├────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
       │*.txt       │  All .txt files (CWD)       │
       └────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘

       (1) This shortcut is bound to the xclip plugin. See the PLUGINS section
       below for more information.

       Customizing keybindings

       The above are the default keyboard shortcuts. However, they can be
       customized using the `kb bind` command (for more information consult
       the description for the kb command above).

       The keybindings configuration file can also be manually edited using
       the `kb edit` command (for more details take a look at the description
       provided by this file itself).

       Readline keybindings

       Readline keybindings for command line editing, such as Ctrl+a, to move
       the cursor to the beginning of the line, or Ctrl+e, to move it to the
       end, should work out of the box. Of course, you can modify these
       keybindings by editing the ~/.config/clifm/readline.clifm file,
       following the same rules used by readline itself for the ~/.inputrc
       file. For more information consult the readline documentation
       (readline(3)).

       Keybindings for plugins

       clifm provides sixteen customizable keybindings for custom plugins. The
       procedure for setting a keybinding for a plugin is the following:

       1. Copy your plugin to the plugins directory (or use any of the plugins
       already in there)

       2. Link pluginx (where ´x´ is the plugin number [1-16]) to your plugin
       using the `actions edit` command. E.g.: "plugin1=myplugin.sh"

       3. Set a keybinding for pluginx using the `kb edit` command. E.g.:
       "plugin1:\M-7"

       Kitty keyboard protocol support

       The Kitty Keyboard Protocol offers a significant improvement over the
       current handling of keyboard events in terminals. This protocol
       utilizes CSI u escape sequences and introduces several enhancements,
       including the ability to use extra modifier keys such as Super, Meta,
       and Hyper.

       To enable the Kitty Keyboard Protocol, follow these steps:

       1. Download the specially crafted keybindings configuration file
       designed to handle CSI u escape sequences (https://github.com/leo-
       arch/clifm/blob/master/misc/kitty/keybindings.clifm).

       2. Configure clifm to use this new file instead of the default one
       (~/.config/clifm/keybindings.clifm) by using the -k command line
       switch. Alternatively, you can replace the default file with the new
       one.

       3. If your terminal is not already set up to send CSI u sequences, use
       the --kitty-keys command line switch.

       Summarizing, and once you have the replacement keybindings file in
       place, run the following command:

               clifm -k /path/to/keybindings/file --kitty-keys

       Important

       When using the Kitty Keyboard Protocol, the Ctrl+d shortcut (used to
       quit secondary prompts) will no longer work. To resolve this issue, add
       the following line to your kitty.conf file:

               map control+d send_text kitty \x04

       This will force the terminal to emit the old value for this specific
       key binding, providing a workaround for the issue.

       Troubleshooting

       Some of these default keybindings may not work on your console/terminal
       emulator, depending on your system. Some useful tips on this regard:

       Haiku terminal: Most of these keybindings will not work on the Haiku
       terminal, since Alt plays here the role Ctrl usually plays in most
       other systems (see the Haiku documentation). To fix this, set your
       custom keybindings.

       Kernel builtin console: Key sequences involving the Shift key
       (Shift-Up, Shift-Left, and Shift-Right in our case) will just not work.
       Use the alternative key sequences instead: Alt+u, Alt+j, and Alt+k
       respectively.

       NetBSD (wsvt25) and OpenBSD (vt220) kernel consoles: Key sequences
       involving the Alt key will not work out of the box. Here´s how to make
       them work:

               On OpenBSD:
               1) Copy /etc/examples/wsconsctl.conf to /etc (if it does not
              already exist)
               2) Add the metaesc flag to your current keyboard encoding. For
              example: keyboard.encoding=us.metaesc
               You may need to reboot the machine for changes to take effect.

               On NetBSD:
               Add the metaesc flag to your current encoding in
              /etc/wscons.conf. For example: encoding us.metaesc
               You may need to reboot the machine for changes to take effect.

       Konsole: If Shift+left and Shift+right are not already bound to any
       function, you need to bind them manually. Go to Settings -> Edit
       current profile -> Keyboard -> Default (Xfree4), and add these values:
               Left+Shift    \E[1;2D
               Right+Shift   \E[1;2C

              If they are already bound, by contrast, you only need to unbound
              them. Go to "Settings -> Configure keyboard shortcuts", click on
              the corresponding keybinding, and set it to "Custom (none)").

       Terminology/Yakuake: Shift+left and Shift+right are already bound to
       other functions, so that you only need to unbind them or rebind the
       corresponding functions to different key sequences.

       Of course, the above two procedures should be similar in case of
       keybinding issues in other terminal emulators.

       In case some of these keybindings are already used by your Window
       Manager, you only need to unbind the key or rebind the corresponding
       function to another key. Since each Window Manager uses its own
       mechanisms to set/unset keybindings, you should consult the appropriate
       manual.

7. THEMING
       All customization settings (theming) are made from a single
       configuration file (the color scheme file), installed by default in
       $XDG_DATA_DIRS/clifm/colors (usually /usr/local/share/clifm/colors or
       /usr/share/clifm/colors), though color scheme files found in
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/colors (usually $HOME/.config/clifm/colors) take
       precedence.

       Note: Color scheme files are copied automatically to the local colors
       directory when running the `cs edit` command.

       Each color scheme may include any (or all) of the below options:

        FiletypeColors = Colors for different file types, such as directory,
       regular files, and so on. See the COLORS section below.

        InterfaceColors = Colors for clifm's interface, such as ELNs, file
       properties bits, suggestions, syntax highlighting, etc. See the COLORS
       section below.

        ExtColors = Colors for files based on filename extensions. See the
       COLORS section below.

        DateShades = A comma delimited list of colors used to print timestamps
       (long view). Consult the default color scheme file for more
       information.

        SizeShades = A comma delimited list of colors used to print file sizes
       (long view). Consult the default color scheme file for more
       information.

        DirIconColor = Color for the directory icon (when icons are enabled).
       See the COLORS section below. Only when using icons-in-terminal or
       Nerfonts. If using rather emoji-icons (default build), this option is
       ignored.

        Prompt = Define clifm´s prompt. See the THE PROMPT section below.

        DividingLine = The line dividing the current list of files and the
       prompt. See the THE DIVIDING LINE below.

        FzfTabOptions = Options to be passed to fzf when using the fzf mode
       for tab completion, including colors. See the TAB COMPLETION section
       below.

       The color scheme (or just theme) can be set either via the command line
       (--color-scheme=NAME), via the ColorScheme option in the main
       configuration file, or using the cs command, for instance, `cs
       mytheme`. Enter just `cs` to list available color schemes (tab
       completion is available). To edit the current color scheme enter `cs
       edit`.

       1. COLORS

       If 256 colors support is detected for the current terminal, and not set
       in any other way (either via the ColorScheme option in the
       configuration file or the --color-scheme command line switch), clifm
       will attempt to load the 256 colors version of the default color
       scheme: default-256. Otherwise, it falls back to the 16 colors version.

       All color codes are specified in the corresponding color scheme file
       (by default ~/.config/clifm/colors/default.clifm). You can edit this
       file pressing F8 or entering `cs edit`.

       a. Color codes

       Colors are specified using the same format used by dircolors(1) and the
       LS_COLORS environment variable, namely, a colon separated list of codes
       with this general format: NAME=VALUE, where NAME refers to an interface
       element, and VALUE to the color to be used by this element.

       This is the list of file type codes (you will find them in the
       FiletypeColors section of the current color scheme file):

               di = directory
               ed = empty directory
               nd = directory with no read/exec permission (1)
               fi = regular file
               ef = empty regular file
               nf = file with no read permission (1)
               ln = symlink
               mh = multi-hardlink file
               or = orphaned or broken symlink
               bd = block device
               cd = character device
               pi = FIFO, pipe
               so = socket
               su = SUID file
               sg = SGID file
               tw = sticky and other writable directory
               st = sticky and not other writable directory
               ow = other writable directory
               ex = executable file
               ee = empty executable file
               ca = file with capabilities
               oo = door/port (Solaris only)
               no = unknown file type
               uf = unaccessible files (fstatat(3) error)

              (1) If unset, the corresponding file type color is used and an
              exclamation mark is printed before the filename in the file list
              (provided icons are disabled -otherwise the lock icon is used-
              and clifm is not running in light mode -in light mode access
              checks are not performed). The color used for the exclamation
              mark is xf (see below).

       The following codes are used for different interface elements (in the
       InterfaceColors section of the current color scheme file):

               Suggestions
               sb = shell builtins
               sc = aliases and shell command names
               sd = internal commands description
               sf = ELNs, bookmarks, tag, and filenames
               sh = commands history entries
               sx = suggestions for clifm's internal commands and parameters
               sp = suggestions pointer (e.g.: 56 > filename, where '>' is the
              suggestion pointer)
               sz = filenames (fuzzy)

               Syntax highlighting
               hb = brackets ´()[]{}´
               hc = comments (lines starting with '#')
               hd = slashes
               he = expansion chars ´~*´
               hn = numbers
               hp = option parameters (starting with ´-´)
               hq = quoted strings (both single and double quotes)
               hr = process redirection (>)
               hs = process separators (; & |)
               hv = variable names (starting with ´$´)
               hw = Backslash (aka whack)

               Prompt elements
               li = selected files
               ti = trash indicator
               ac = autocommand indicator
               em = error message indicator
               wm = warning message indicator

               ro = read-only mode indicator
               si = stealth mode indicator
               tx = command line text (regular prompt)

               File properties
               db  = file allocated blocks
               dd  = last access/change/modification time (1)
               de  = file inode number (long view only)
               dg  = group ID (provided the user has access to the file)
               dk  = number of links (long view only)
               dn  = dash (unset property)
               do  = octal value for file properties
               dp  = SUID, SGID, sticky bit
               dr  = read permission bit
               dt  = timestamp identification mark (2)

               dxr = executable permission bit (regular files)
               dz  = size (1)

               (1) If unset (default), gradient colors are used (based on file
              size and file age).
               (2) If unset (default), a dimmed version of the current
              timestamp color is used.

               Note: For a better graphical representation of file properties,
              256 colors are used if possible (otherwise, clifm falls back to
              16 colors).

               Miscellaneous interface elements
               fc  = file counter

               lc  = symbolic link indicator (ColorLinksAsTarget only)
               mi  = misc indicators (disk usage, sort method, bulk rename,
              jump database list)
               ts  = matching suffix for possible tab completed entries
               tt  = tilde for truncated filenames
               wc  = welcome message
               wsN = color for workspace N (1-8)
               xs  = exit code: success
               xf  = exit code: failure

       b. Supported colors

       4-bit, 8-bit (256-colors), and 24-bit (true colors) colors are
       supported.

       Colors are defined basically as SGR sequences (excluding the initial
       escape character and the ending 'm'), the same sequences used by the
       LS_COLORS environment variable. However, shortcuts for 8-bit
       (256-colors) and 24-bit (true color) colors are available. For example:

               31            4-bit
               38;5;160      8-bit
               @160          8-bit  (short)
               38;2;255;0;0  24-bit
               #ff0000       24-bit (short, HEX) (1)

       (1) Both three and six digits hexadecimal colors (lower or uppercase)
       are supported. For example, #f00 amounts to #ff0000.

       A single attribute can be added to hex colors and 256 colors (in the
       form @NUM) using a dash and an attribute number (#RRGGBB-[1-9] or
       @NUM-[1-9]), where 1-9 is:

               1: Bold or increased intensity
               2: Faint, decreased intensity or dim
               3: Italic (Not widely supported)
               4: Underline
               5: Slow blink
               6: Rapid blink
               7: Reverse video or invert
               8: Conceal or hide (Not widely supported)
               9: Crossed-out or strike

       Note: Some attributes may not be supported by all terminal emulators.

       For example, for bold red the hex code is #ff0000-1, while the
       256-colors code is @160-1. (for more information about SGR sequences
       consult https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).

       c. Color names

       Xterm-like color names are also supported. For example: ex=DodgerBlue2.

               85 SeaGreen1_2           171 MediumOrchid1

       Just as with hex colors, a single attribute can be appended to color
       names. For example, SteelBlue1-1 to get the bold version of this color.

       d. Color variables

       Up to 128 custom color variables can be used via the define keyword to
       make it easier to build and read theme files. Example:

               define FTYPE_DIR=31
               define IFACE_ELN=4;38;2;255;255;0;48;2;0;14;191

               FiletpeColors="di=FTPYE_DIR:"
               InterfaceColors="el=IFACE_ELN:"

       These variables can only be used for FiletypeColors, InterfaceColors,
       ExtColors, and DirIconColor. The Prompt line (if using a prompt code)
       uses full SGR sequences or prompt-specific color codes instead.

       e. Examples

       A few examples to put all this together:

               fi=4;31    (regular files are 4-bit underlined red)
               di=@33-1   (directories are 8-bit bold light-blue)
               ln=#5fd7ff (symbolic links are 24-bit light cyan)
               so=Yellow3 (socket files are Yellow3)

       More complex combinations can be achieved using complete SGR sequences
       (for example, to add a background color). E.g.:

               fi=4;38;2;245;76;48;2;0;0;255

       will print regular files underlined and using a bold orange color on a
       blue background. In this case, just make sure to use a terminal
       emulator supporting true colors. To test your terminal color
       capabilities use the colors.sh script (in the plugins directory).

       Note: It may happen that, for some reason, you need to force clifm to
       use colors despite the value of the TERM variable. The OpenBSD console,
       for example, sets TERM to vt220 by default, which, according to the
       terminfo database, does not support color. However, the OpenBSD console
       does actually support color. In this case, you can set the
       CLIFM_FORCE_COLOR a specific value even if the value of TERM says
       otherwise. Supported values are: 8, 16, 256, truecolor (or 24bit).

       To see a colored list of the currently used colors run the `cs preview`
       command.

       To run without colors use the --no-color command line option or set
       either CLIFM_NO_COLOR or NO_COLOR environment variables to any value.
       For more information about the no-color initiative see
       https://no-color.org/

       For a full no-color experience recall to edit your prompt removing all
       color codes.

       2. THE PROMPT

       2.a. Description

       Clifm's prompt is taken from the Prompt line in the color scheme file
       using a prompt name as defined in the prompts file, for example,
       Prompt="security-scanner".

       Each prompt is built following almost the same escape codes and rules
       used by the Bash prompt, except that it does not accept shell functions
       (like conditionals and loops). Command substitution (in the form
       $(cmd)), prompt modules (in the form ${module}), color codes (in the
       form %{color}), string literals, and escape sequences can be used to
       build the prompt.

       Consult the prompts file (using the `prompt edit` command) for detailed
       information and examples on how to build a prompt.

       By default, for intstance, clifm's prompt line is this:

              "%{reset}\I[\S%{reset}]\l \A \u:\H
              %{cyan}\w%{reset}\n<\z%{reset}> %{blue}\$%{reset} "


       which once decoded should look something like this:

               [1] 13:45 user:hostname /my/path
               <0> $

       with the workspace number printed in blue, the path in cyan, the last
       exit status in green (or red in case of error), and the dollar sign in
       blue.

       A more "classic" prompt can be generated as follows:

               "\u@\U \w> "

       or, using now command substitution:

               "$(whoami)@$(hostname) $(pwd)> "

       2.b. Prompt notifications

       A bold red ´R´ at the left of the prompt reminds the user that the
       program is running as root. A bold green ´S´ indicates that there are
       elements in the Selection Box. In the same way, a cyan ´T´ means that
       there are currently files in the trash can, just as a bold blue ´S´
       means that the program is running in stealth mode. Finally, clifm makes
       use of three kind of messages: errors (a red ´E´ at the left of the
       prompt), warnings (a yellow ´W´), and simple notices (a green ´N´).

       If Notifications is set to false in the prompts file, the above
       notifications won´t be printed by the prompt, but are still available
       to the user as escape codes (see above) and environment variables (see
       the ENVIRONMENT section below) to build custom prompts.

       2.c. The Warning Prompt

       The suggestions system includes a secondary, warning prompt, used to
       highlight wrong/invalid/non-existent command names. Once an invalid
       command is entered, the regular prompt will be switched to the warning
       prompt.

       The wrong command name check is omitted if the input string:

               Is quoted (e.g.: "string" or ´string´)
               Is bracketed (e.g.: (string), [string], or {string})
               It starts with a stream redirection character (e.g.: <string or
              >string)
               Is a comment (e.g.: #string)
               It starts with one or more spaces
               Is an assignment (e.g.: foo=var)
               It is escaped (e.g.: \string)

       The warning prompt can be customized by means of the same rules used by
       the regular prompt. To use a custom warning prompt, modify the
       WarningPrompt line in the prompts file (via the `prompt edit` command).
       It defaults to

              "%{reset}%{b:red}(!)%{n:dim} > "


       the last line of the regular prompt will become "(!) > ", with "(!)"
       printed in bold red.

       To disable this feature use the --no-warning-prompt command line switch
       or set the EnableWarningPrompt option to false in the prompts file.

       Note: Bear in mind that the warning prompt depends on the suggestions
       system, so that it will not be available if this system is disabled.

       2.d. The Right Prompt

       The right prompt is just like the regular prompt, but printed on the
       right side of the screen.

       Use the RightPrompt option in the prompts file to set a right prompt.
       For a concrete usage example see the info prompt in the prompts file.

       A few caveats:

               a. Right prompts only work with multiline regular prompts (in
              the case of a single line regular prompt, the right prompt is
              not printed).
               b. Multiple lines are not supported by right prompts (only the
              first line will be printed).
               c. If the decoded right prompt exceeds the number of available
              terminal columns, the prompt is not printed.

       3. THE DIVIDING LINE

       The line dividing the current list of files and the prompt. It can be
       customized using the DividingLine option in the color scheme file to
       fit your prompt design and/or color scheme.

       DividingLine accepts one or more ASCII or Unicode characters (in both
       cases you only need to type/paste here the chosen character(s)). If
       only one character is specified (by default, "-"), it will be
       repeatedly printed to fulfill the current line up to the right edge of
       the screen or terminal window. If you don't want to cover the whole
       line, specify two or more characters, in which case only these
       characters (and no more) will be used as dividing line. For example:
       "------->". To use an empty line, set DividingLineChar to "0" (that is,
       as a character, not as a number). Finally, if this value is not set, a
       special line drawn with box-drawing characters will be used
       (box-drawing characters are not supported by all terminal emulators).

       The color of this line is set via the dl color code in the color scheme
       file. Consult the COLOR CODE section above for more information.

       4. FZF WINDOW

       Refer to the TAB COMPLETION section below.


8. BUILT-IN EXPANSIONS
       1. ELNs

              A number representing the Entry List Number (ELN) of a listed
              file is expanded to its corresponding filename. You can type
              `ELN<TAB>` to convert the ELN into the filename. ELN ranges are
              also supported. For example, `t 1-3 10 24` will move the files
              with ELNs 1 through 3, 10 and 24 to the trash.

              Bear in mind that ELNs will only be expanded provided some
              filename is listed on the screen under the corresponding
              numbers. For example: `diff 1 118` will only expand '1', but not
              '118', if there is no ELN 118. In the same way, the range 1-118
              will only be expanded provided there are 118 or more filenames
              listed on the screen. Note that the second field of a range can
              be omitted, in which case the ELN of the last listed file is
              assumed (e.g.: provided there are 100 listed files, 12- is
              equivalent to 12-100).

              Since ranges can be a bit tricky, tab completion is available to
              make sure this range actually includes the desired filenames.

              If this feature somehow conflicts with the command you want to
              run, say, `chmod 644 ...`, because the current number of files
              is equal or larger than 644 (in which case clifm will expand
              that number), then you can simply run the command as external:
              `;chmod 644 ...`

       2. Selected files

              The s: prefix expands to all selected files (as absolute paths).
              To get the list of selected files type `s:<TAB>`. The sel
              keyword can be used as well, but, unlike s:, it can only be used
              after the first word, i.e., as a command parameter. For example,
              `m sel` (or `m s:`) will move all selected files to the current
              directory. To trash or remove selected files, simply run `t sel`
              or `r sel` respectively.

       3. Bookmarks

              The b: prefix expands to all bookmarked files (as absolute
              paths). Enter `b:` followed by a bookmark name to expand to the
              absolute path referred to by that bookmark. To get the list of
              available bookmarks, type `b:<TAB>`. For example, `p b:work`
              will print the file properties of the bookmark named work.

       4. Tagged files

              The t: prefix is used to access tagged files. Type `t:<TAB>` to
              get the list of available tags. Type `t:TAG<TAB>` to get the
              list of files tagged as TAG. t:TAG expands to all files tagged
              as TAG (as absolute paths). For example, `s t:old` will select
              all files tagged as "old".

       5. Workspaces

              The w: prefix expands to a specific workspace (as absolute
              path). For example, `c sel w:3` will copy all selected files to
              the third workspace.

       6. File types

              The = (equal) prefix is used to filter files according to their
              type. Type `=<TAB>` to get the list of available file types in
              the current directory. Also, type `=x<TAB>` to get the list of
              executable files in the current directory. For example, `r =D =F
              =L` will remove all empty directories, empty regular files, and
              broken symbolic links in the current directory.

       7. MIME types

              The @ (at sign) prefix is used to filter files according to
              their MIME type. Type `@<TAB>` to get the list of MIME types
              available in the current directory. For example, `br @image`
              will bulk rename all files in the current directory whose MIME
              type includes the word "image".

       8. Pinned directory

              A single comma (,) expands to the currently pinned directory
              (see the pin command for more information). For example, the
              command `c =o ,` will copy all other-writable files in the
              current directory to the pinned directory.

       9. Parent directories

              Via the fastback function, you can quickly change to any parent
              directory using a series of dots. A single dot (.) refers to the
              current directory, and two dots (..) refer to the parent
              directory. This pattern continues, so three dots (...) refer to
              the parent of the parent directory, four dots (....) refer to
              the parent of the parent of the parent directory, and so on. In
              general, n dots refer to the nth level of parent directories.

       Needless to say, combinations are possible. For example, the command `c
       sel b:work @image =L 1-3 ,` will copy all selected files, the bookmark
       named work, all images, broken symbolic links in the current directory,
       and files with ELNs 1 through 3 to the pinned directory.

       Note: If using the fzf mode for Tab completion (default), you can
       operate on some files of any of these groups of files using the TAB key
       to mark files in the list. For example, you can type `CMD sel<TAB>` to
       get the list of selected files, then use the TAB key to mark the
       desired files. Press Enter or Right to insert the marked files into the
       current command line.


9. TAB COMPLETION
       There are four modes for tab completion: standard (interface provided
       by readline), fzf, which depends on fzf
       (https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (version 0.18.0 or later), fnf
       (https://github.com/leo-arch/fnf), and smenu
       (https://github.com/p-gen/smenu). By default, if the fzf binary is
       found in $PATH, clifm will attempt to use fzf to display completions.
       You can force the use of the remaining modes via the --stdtab,
       --fnftab, and --smenutab command line switches. The TabCompletionMode
       option in the configuration file can be used to permanently set the tab
       completion mode.

       If using the fzf mode, the completions interface can be customized
       using the FzfTabOptions option in the color scheme file. --height,
       --margin, +i/-i, --read0, --query, and --ansi will be appended to set
       up some details of the completions interface. Set this value to none to
       pass no option, to the empty string to load the default values, or to
       any other custom value. Unless set to none, any option specified here
       will override FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS.

       Default values for this option are:
               --color=16,prompt:6,fg+:-1,pointer:4,hl:5,hl+:5,gutter:-1,marker:2,border:7:dim
              --bind tab:accept,right:accept,left:abort,alt-p:toggle-preview
              --inline-info --layout=reverse-list
              --preview-window=wrap,border-left

       Consult fzf(1) for more information.

       If set neither in FzfTabOptions nor in FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS (in this
       order), the height of the fzf window is set to the default value: 40%
       of the current terminal number of line/rows.

       To use fzf global values (defined in FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS), set
       FzfTabOptions to none.

       File previews are available in fzf mode via shotgun. See the SHOTGUN
       section above.

       Image previews are available via the clifmimg plugin. Run `help
       image-previews` for more information.

       If using the smenu mode, the interface can be customized using the
       CLIFM_SMENU_OPTIONS environment variable. For example:

               export CLIFM_SMENU_OPTIONS="-a t:2,b b:4 c:r ct:2,r sf:6,r
              st:5,r mt:5,b"

       Consult smenu(1) for more information.

       For information about how to customize fnf consult fnf(1).

       Clifm can perform fuzzy tab completion (just as suggestions) for
       filenames and paths (e.g. "dwn" is completed/suggested as "Downloads").
       To enable this feature use the --fuzzy-matching command line switch or
       set FuzzyMatching to true in the configuration file.


10. FILE OPENER
       As clifm´s builtin file opener, Lira takes care of opening files when
       no opening application has been specified in the command line (or when
       running as a standalone file opener, via the --open command line
       switch). It does this by automatically parsing a MIME list file (see
       the FILES section below): it looks first for a matching pattern (either
       a MIME type or a filename), then checks the existence of the command
       associated to this pattern, and finally executes it.

       Lira is controlled using the mime command. File associations are stored
       in the MIME list file and can be edited using the `mime edit` command.

       When running for the first time, or whenever the MIME list file cannot
       be found, clifm will copy the MIME definitions file from the DATADIR
       directory (usually /usr/share/clifm/mimelist.clifm) to the local
       configuration directory.

       Lira will check the file line by line, and if a matching line is found,
       and if at least one of the specified applications exists, this
       application will be used to open the corresponding associated file.
       Else, the next line will be checked. In other words, the precedence
       order is top to bottom (for lines) and left to right (for
       applications).

       Note: In case of directories (whose MIME type is inode/directory), the
       entry will be used only for the open-with command (ow).

       A note about MIME types

       File MIME types are determined using libmagic –the same library used by
       file(1)–, which, though highly reliable, is not bullet-proof. Sometimes
       it fails, either because the appropriate MIME type is not in its
       database, or because the database is just wrong. In either case, you
       can manually map file extensions to MIME types using a specific file
       (by default, ~/.mime.types).(1)

       By way of example, libmagic knows nothing about ILBM image files, and
       returns application/zip for OpenRaster images. Create ~/.mime.types
       with the following content:

               image/x-ilbm       iff lbm
               image/openraster   ora

       Restart clifm and these MIME types will be immediately associated to
       all files having the specified extensions (to test it, run `mm info` on
       any of these files).(2)

       If required, edit the mimelist and the preview files (`mm edit` and
       `view edit`, to specify how files are opened and previewed
       respectively), and add a new line handling the corresponding MIME types
       (say, "image/x-ilbm=APP" and "image/openraster=APP"). See below for
       more information.

       (1) To use a different file, set $CLIFM_MIMETYPES_FILE to the desired
       file, for example, `CLIFM_MIMETYPES_FILE=/etc/mime.types clifm`.

       (2) In case of issues, bear in mind that the mime.types file is read
       top to bottom, and that, in case of conclicts (mostly duplicate
       extensions), only the last entry is effective.

       Important: Though sometimes convenient, determining file types by means
       of filename extensions alone is unreliable: a file, no matter its type,
       can bear any file extension, without restriction. Because of this, you
       might end up executing a command that was not intended due to wrong
       file identification. Be extra careful when doing this.

       1. Syntax

       In its most basic form, each line in the MIME list file consists of:

       a) A left value: this is just a regular expression indicating what we
       are trying to match (it can be a filename, a file extension, or a MIME
       type).

       b) A right value: a semicolon separated list of commands to be used as
       the opening application (the first existing program found in this list
       will be used).

       For example:

               ^text/.*=leafpad

       which is to be read as follows: Open text files (in this case we are
       partially matching a MIME type) using leafpad.

       As explained below, this basic rule can be modified to get much more
       control on what we are matching and how we execute the opening
       application.

       The syntax is this:

               [!][X:][N:]REGEX=CMD [ARGS] [%[f,x]] [![E,O]] [&]; ...

       Note that this syntax departs from the Freedesktop specification in
       that we do not rely on desktop files (mostly used by desktop
       environments), but rather on commands and parameters.

       2. The left value (REGEX)

       2.1. The X prefix

       Without any prefixes, the rule will attempt to match MIME types,
       disregarding if we are running on a graphical or non-graphical
       environment. For example,

               ^text/.*=leafpad

       instructs lira to open all text files using leafpad, no matter if we
       are running on a graphical or non-graphical environment.

       However, we usually do not want to use leafpad if we are not running on
       a graphical environment. In this case, we can write a double rule as
       follows:

               X:^text/.*=leafpad
               !X:^text/.*=nano

       where the first rule (via the X prefix) is intended for use on
       graphical environments, where we can use leafpad, and the second one
       (via the !X prefix) for non-graphical environments, where we rather
       prefer to use nano.

       2.2. The N prefix

       Sometimes MIME types are not enough to identify a file, or we just want
       to match a specific filename. In this case, we can use the N prefix to
       tell Lira that we want to match a filename instead of a MIME type. For
       example:

               X:N:^filename.txt$=leafpad

       in which case we want to match exactly the filename filename.txt (no
       matter its MIME type).

       If we want to match file extensions, instead of entire filenames, we
       can use a regular expression, as follows:

               X:N:.*.txt$=leafpad

       Here, we are not matching a specific filename, but a specific file
       extension, so that the rule reads as follows: open all files ending
       with .txt using leafpad.

       3. The right value (CMD)

       The right value is a semicolon separated list of commands, each of
       which contains a command, and optionally, command arguments and
       modifiers. For example:

               X:N:.*.txt$=leafpad --sync,geany,mousepad,nano

       which means: Open .txt files (graphical environments only) using
       `leafpad --sync`, or, if not found, geany`, mousepad, or nano, in this
       order. The file to be opened will be appended to the command string,
       say `leafpad --sync FILE`.

       3.1. The %f placeholder

       Use the %f placeholder to specify the position of the file to be opened
       in the command, for example:

               mpv %f --terminal=no

       will be translated into: `mpv FILE --terminal=no`

       If the placeholder is not specified, the file to be opened will be
       appended to the command string. Thus, this: `mpv --terminal=no` amounts
       to this: `mpv --terminal=no FILE`.

       3.2. STDERR and STDOUT

       Sometimes we might need to silence either standard error (STDERR),
       standard output (STDOUT), or both. Use !E and !O to silence them
       respectively. Both can be used together: !EO. Example: `leafpad %f
       !EO`, or, to silence only STDERR: `leafpad %f !E`.

       3.3. Run in the background

       The ampersand character (&) can be used, as usual, to run the opening
       application in the background. Example: `leafpad %f &`.

       3.4. The %x flag

       The %x flag is a shortcut for "%f !EO &": the command will be executed
       in the background and both STDOUT and STDERR will be silenced. As a
       plus, the command is executed in a new session, i.e. detached from the
       running terminal (via setsid(3). This flag is recommended to open files
       via graphical applications. Examples:

       For GUI applications:

               APP %x

       For terminal applications:

               TERM -e APP %x

       Replace TERM and APP by the appropriate values (say, xterm and vi
       respectively). The -e option might vary depending on the terminal
       emulator used.

       Note: In case of archives, the builtin ad command can be used as
       opening application.

       3.5. Environment variables

       Environment variables (e.g. $EDITOR, $VISUAL, $BROWSER, and even
       $PAGER) are also recognized by Lira. You can even set custom
       environment variables to be used exclusively by clifm. For example, you
       can set CLIFM_TERM, CLIFM_EDITOR, and CLIFM_PDF, and then use them to
       define some associations:

               X:text/plain=$CLIFM_TERM -e $CLIFM_EDITOR %f &
               X:N:.*\.pdf$=$CLIFM_PDF %f &

       3.6. Using shell scripts
              Bear in mind that commands will be executed directly without
              shell intervention, so that no shell goodies (like pipes,
              conditions, loops, etc) are available. In case you need
              something more complex than a single command (including shell
              capabilities) write your own script and place the path to the
              script in place of the command. For example:

               X:^text/.*:~/scripts/my_cool_script.sh

       4. Examples:

       Match a complete filename:

               X:N:some_filename=nano;vim;vi;emacs

       Note: If the filename contains a dot, quote it like this:
       some_filename\.ext (to prevent the REGEX parser from interpreting the
       dot).

       Open video files with mpv in the foreground and silence STDERR:

               ^video/.*=mpv %f !E

       Open video files with gmplayer in the background and silence both
       STDERR and STDOUT:

               ^video/.*=gmplayer %f !EO & (or 'gmplayer %x')

       Match multiple filenames (starting with "str"):

               X:N:^str.*=leafpad %x;mousepad %x;kate %x;gedit %x

       Match a single extension:

               X:N:.*\.txt$=leafpad %x;mousepad %x;kate %x;gedit %x
               !X:N:.*\.^txt$=nano;vim;vi;emacs

       Match multiple extensions:

               X:N:.*\.(sh|c|py|pl)$:geany %x;leafpad %x;nano

       Match a single mimetype:

               !X:^audio/mp3$=mpv %f --terminal=no;ffplay -nodisp
              -autoexit;mpv;mplayer

       Match multiple mimetypes:

               X:^audio/.*=mplayer;mplayer2;vlc %x;gmplayer %x;smplayer
              %x;totem %x

       In case of MIME types, you can also write the entire expression without
       relying on any regular expression. For example:

               !X:text/plain=$TERM -e $EDITOR %x

       For more information take a look at the mimelist file itself (F6 or `mm
       edit`).

       5. Using a third-party opener

       This can be done in two ways:

       a. Set Opener in the configuration file to the name of the desired
       opener. For example, to use Ranger's rifle(1):

               Opener=rifle

       or, if you prefer xdg-open(1):

               Opener=xdg-open

       b. Tell Lira to open all files, no matter the MIME type or filename,
       via the desired opener. For example:

               .*=rifle

       6. Using Clifm as a standalone file opener

       Though clifm is a file manager, it can be used as a simple file opener
       via the --open command line option. For example:

               clifm --open /path/to/my_file.jpg
               clifm --open /path/to/my_dir
               clifm --open https://some_domain

       Note: When opening web resources clifm will query the mimelist file
       using text/html as MIME type. Whatever association it finds for this
       specific MIME type will be used to open the web resource.


11. SHOTGUN
       1. Tab completion with file previews

       Shotgun is clifm´s builtin files previewer. Though, as described below,
       it may be used as a standalone and general purpose file previewer
       (similar in this regard to pistol(1)), it is mainly intended to be used
       by clifm's tab completion function running in fzf mode: every time tab
       completion is invoked for files, shotgun will be executed with the
       currently highlighted file as argument (as shown below) to generate the
       preview. Set the FzfPreview option in the configuration file to false
       (or run with --no-fzfpreview) to disable this feature.

       Shotgun is also used by the view command to display file previews in
       full screen.

       2. Running as a standalone files previewer

       Executed via the --preview command line switch, shotgun performs file
       preview for any file passed as argument. For example:

               clifm --preview myfile.txt

       This command generates a preview of the file myfile.txt and then quits
       clifm.

       3. Customization

       Previewing applications (based on either MIME type or filename) are
       defined in a configuration file
       ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/preview.clifm) using the same
       syntax used by Lira (the builtin file opener). See the FILE OPENER
       section above.

       You can set an alternative configuration file using the --shotgun-file
       command line switch:

               clifm --shotgun-file=/path/to/shotgun/config/file
              --preview=myfile.txt

       To customize the appearance of the preview window, use the
       --preview-window option in the FzfTabOptions line in the current color
       scheme file. For example, if you want the preview window down the file
       list (instead of to the right):

               --preview-window=down

       Default keybindings for the preview window:

               Alt+p: Toggle the preview window
               Ctrl+Up / Shift+Up: Scroll the preview window up one line
               Ctrl+Down / Shift+Down: Scroll the preview window down one line
               Alt+Up: Scroll the preview window up one page
               Alt+Down: Scroll the preview window down one page

       Keybindings can be customized using the --bind option in the
       FzfTabOptions field in the color scheme file.

       Consult fzf(1) for more information.

       4. Image previews

       Image previews are available via the clifmimg plugin. Run `help image-
       previews` or consult the Wiki for more information:
       https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/tree/master/misc/tools/imgprev.


12. AUTO-SUGGESTIONS
       Gemini is a builtin suggestions system (similar to that provided by the
       Fish shell). As you type, Gemini will suggest possible completions
       right after the current cursor position.

       The following checks are available (the order can be customized, see
       below):

       a. ELNs

       b. clifm commands and parameters

       c. Entries in the command history list (already used commands)

       d. Filenames in the current working directory and paths (1)

       e. Entries in the jump database

       f. Aliases names

       g. Bookmarks names

       h. Program names in PATH

       i. Shell builtins (2)

       (1) Fuzzy suggestions are supported. For example: dwn > Downloads.
       Enable this feature using the --fuzzy-marching command line switch or
       setting FuzzyMatching to true in the configuration file.

       (2) The shell name is taken from /bin/sh. The following shells are
       supported: bash, dash, fish, ksh, tcsh, and zsh. Command names are
       checked in the following order: clifm internal commands, commands in
       PATH, and shell builtins.

       Note: By default, a brief description for internal commands is
       suggested. You can disable this feature via the SuggestCmdDesc option
       in the configuration file.

       To accept the entire suggestion press Right or Ctrl+f: the cursor will
       move to the end of the suggested command and the suggestion color will
       change to that of the typed text; next, you can press Enter to execute
       the command as usual. Otherwise, if the suggestion is not accepted, it
       will be simply ignored and you can continue editing the current command
       line however you want.

       To accept the first suggested word only (up to first slash or space),
       press rather Alt+Right or Alt+f. Not available for ELNs, aliases and
       bookmarks names.

       Bear in mind that suggestions for ELNs, aliases, bookmarks names, the
       jump function (invoked by the j command), just as filenames and paths
       (if fuzzy-suggestions are enabled) do not work as the remaining
       suggestions: they do not suggest possible completions for the current
       input, but rather the value pointed to by it. For example, if you type
       "12" and the current list of files includes a filename whose ELN is
       '12', the filename corresponding to this ELN will be printed next to
       "12" as follows: 12_ > filename (where the underscore is the current
       cursor position). Press Right or Ctrl+f to accept the suggestion, in
       which case the text typed so far will be replaced by the suggestion.

       The order of the suggestion checks can be customized using the
       SuggestionStrategy option in the configuration file. Each check is
       assigned a lowercase character:

        a = Aliases names
        c = Possible completions
        e = ELNs
        f = Files in the current directory
        h = Entries in the commands history
        j = Entries in the jump database

       The value taken by SuggestionStrategy is a string containing one or
       more of the above characters. The characters order in this string
       specifies the order in which the suggestion checks will be performed.
       For example, to perform all checks in the same order above, the value
       of the string should be acefhj (without quotes). Or, if you prefer to
       run the history check first: hacefj. Finally, you can ignore one or
       more checks by just omitting the corresponding character (to skip all
       checks, set the option value to a single dash (-)). So, to ignore the
       aliases and the ELN checks, set SuggestionStrategy to hcfj. The default
       value for this option is ehfjac.

       Note: The check for program names in PATH is always executed at last,
       except when the ExternalCommands option is disabled, in which case
       suggestions for them are simply not displayed.

       Suggestions will be printed using one of the following color codes (see
       the COLOR CODES section above):

       sf: Used for file and directory names. This includes suggestions for
       ELNs, bookmarks names, files in the current directory, and possible
       completions. Default value: 2;4;36 (dimmed underlined cyan)

       sh: Used for entries in the commands history.

       sc: Used for aliases and program names in PATH.

       sx: Used for clifm internal commands and parameters.

       sp: Greater-than sign (>) used when suggesting ELNs, bookmarks, and
       aliases names.

       You can set SuggestFiletypeColor to true in the configuration file to
       use the color of the file type of the current filename (as set in the
       color scheme file) instead of the value of sf. For example, if a
       suggestion is printed for a file that is a symbolic link, ln or or (if
       it's a broken link) will be used instead of sf.


13. SHELL FUNCTIONS
       Clifm includes a few shell functions to perform specific actions
       (cd-on-quit, and subshell-notice). Take a look at the corresponding
       files, in /usr/share/clifm/functions, and follow the instructions.
       Needles to say, you can write your own functions.


14. PLUGINS
       Plugins are just scripts or programs (written in any language) intended
       to add, extend or improve clifm´s functionalities. They are linked to
       actions names defined in a dedicated configuration file
       ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/actions.clifm).

       Note: In stealth mode, since access to configuration files is not
       allowed, plugins are disabled.

       To list available actions and the plugins they are linked to, run
       `actions`.

       To execute a given plugin, enter the corresponding action name (plus
       parameters if required).

       To get information about a specific plugin, enter the action name
       followed by `--help`.

       Though several plugins are provided at installation time (in the
       plugins directory), you can write your owns as you like, with any
       language you like, and for whatever purpose you want. Writing plugins
       is generally quite easy; but your mileage may vary depending on what
       you are trying to achieve. A good place to start is examining the
       provided plugins and reading the actions command description, just as
       the ENVIRONMENT and FILES sections below.

       A convenient helper script is provided to get a consistent look across
       all plugins, specially those running fzf. This helper script is located
       in DATADIR/clifm/plugins/plugins-helper, but it will be overridden by
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/plugins/plugins-helper if found. The location of
       this file is set by clifm itself in the CLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER
       environment variable to be used by plugins. Source the file and use any
       of the functions and variables provided by it to write a new fzf
       plugin:

           # Source our plugins helper
           if [ -z "$CLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER" ] || ! [ -f "$CLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER"
       ]; then
               printf "clifm: Unable to find plugins-helper file\n" >&2
               exit 1
           fi
           # shellcheck source=/dev/null
           . "$CLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER"

       Plugins can talk to clifm via a dedicated pipe created for this purpose
       and exposed via an environment variable (CLIFM_BUS). Write to the pipe
       and clifm will hear and handle the message immediately after the
       plugin's execution. If the message is a path, clifm will run the open
       function, changing the current directory to the new path, if a
       directory, or opening it with the default associated application if a
       file. Otherwise, if the message is not a path, it will be taken and
       executed as a command. Examples:

           ´echo "/tmp" > "$CLIFM_BUS"´ tells clifm to change the current
       directory to /tmp

           ´echo "s *.png" > "$CLIFM_BUS"´ makes clifm select all files in the
       current directory ending with ".png"

       The pipe (CLIFM_BUS) is deleted immediately after the execution of its
       content and recreated before running any other plugin.

       This is a list of available plugins:

       To run the pager.sh plugin, for example, you only need to enter the
       corresponding action name, in this case gg. In case of need, all
       plugins provide a -h,--help switch for a brief usage description.

       Note: The fzfnav plugin uses fzf(1) to navigate the filesystem and BFG
       (a script located in the plugins directory) to show previews (to
       display image previews BFG requires ueberzug(1) or the Kitty protocol
       via the Kitty terminal). A configuration file (BFG.cfg, in the plugins
       directory itself) is provided to customize the previewer's behavior.

       Note 2: An alternative files previewing function (builtin, and thereby
       faster than BFG) is provided by shotgun. See the SHOTGUN section above
       for more information.

       In addition to the builtin BFG previewer, fzfnav supports the use of
       both Ranger´s scope.sh script and pistol(1). To use scope, edit the BFG
       configuration file and set USE_SCOPE to 1 and SCOPE_FILE to the correct
       path to the scope.sh file (normally $HOME/.config/ranger/scope.sh). To
       use pistol instead, set USE_PISTOL to 1.

       Take a look at the Wiki for more information:

15. AUTOCOMMANDS
       Heavily inspired by Vifm, the autocommands function allows the user a
       fine-grained control over clifm settings. It is mostly devised as a way
       to improve performance for remote filesystems (usually slower than
       local ones) by allowing you to turn off some features (like the file
       counter) that might greatly affect performance under some circumstances
       (like remote connections). However, the autocommands function is not
       restricted to this specific use case: use it for whatever purpose you
       find useful.

       Note: We describe here permanent autocommands, which need to be defined
       in the configuration file. Temporary autocommands (set via the command
       line and valid only for the current directory and the current session)
       are also available via the auto command. See above.

       Add a line preceded by the autocmd keyword to the main configuration
       file. The general syntax is:
        autocmd TARGET cmd,cmd,cmd

       TARGET specifies the object to which subsequent commands will apply. It
       can match either directory names (paths) or workspaces.

       1. To match directory names use a glob pattern (as specified by
       glob(7)). If no glob metacharacter is provided, the string will be
       compared as is to the current working directory. To invert the meaning
       of a pattern, prepend an exclamation mark. To match all directories
       under a specific directory (including this directory itself) use the
       double asterisk (**). A few examples:

        ~/Downloads      Match exactly the Downloads directory (and only this
       directory) in your home directory
        ~/Downloads/*    Recursively match all subdirectories in ~/Downloads
       (excluding the Downloads directory itself)
        /~/Downloads/**  Recursively match all subdirectories in ~/Downloads
       (including the Downloads directory itself)
        ~/Downloads/*.d  Match all subdirectories in ~/Downloads ending with
       ".d" (excluding the Downloads directory itself)
        !~/Downloads     Match everything except the ~/Downloads directory

       2. You can match workspaces using the ampersand character (@) followed
       by the ws keyword and then the workspace number. For example, to match
       the third workspace: @ws3, or, to match the first workspace, @ws1. To
       match instead all workspaces except the second one: !@ws2.

       TARGET is followed by a comma separated list of commands:

       !CMD: The exclamation mark allows you to run shell commands, custom
       binaries or scripts

       The following codes are used to control clifm's file list:

        Code   Description           Example
        cs     Color scheme          cs=zenburn
        fc     File counter          fc=0
        ft     Files filter          ft=.*\.pdf$
        fz     Recursive dir sizes   fz=1
        hf,hh  Hidden files          hf=0
        lm     Light mode            lm=1
        lv,ll  Long view             lv=0
        mf     Max files             mf=100 (1)
        mn     Max filename length   mn=20 (1)
        od     Only directories      od=1
        pg     Pager                 pg=0
        st     Sort method           st=5
        sr     Reverse sort          sr=1

       To remove a value, set the option to an empty value. For example, to
       remove the files filter and the color scheme: ft=,cs=

       (1) This option supports the unset keyword to remove the corresponding
       limit. E.g.: mf=unset,mn=unset

       Examples

        1. Run in light mode and disable the file counter for the remotes
       directory:(1)
           autocmd /media/remotes/** lm=1,fc=0

        2. Just a friendly reminder:
           autcomd ~/important !printf "Important: keep your fingers outta
       here!\n" && read -n1

        3. This directory has thousands of files. Show only the first hundred
       and enable the pager:
           autocmd /usr/bin mf=100,pg=1

        4. Lots of media files (with large filenames). Truncate filenames to
       20 chars max and run the files previewer:(2)
           autocmd ~/Downloads mn=20,!~/.config/clifm/plugins/fzfnav.sh

        5. I want the second workspace, no matter what the current directory
       is, to list files in long view:
           autocmd @ws2 lv=1

        6. Mmm, just because I can. Be creative!
           autocmd /home/user hf=0,cs=nord,lv=1
           autocmd / lv=1,fc=0,cs=solarized,st=5

       (1) This is the recommended configuration for remote filesystems.

       (2) As seen here, plugins can be used as well: in this case, we want to
       run fzfnav (to make use of the files preview capability) whenever we
       enter the Downloads directory, usually containing videos, music, and
       images.  NOTE: If you decide to use a plugin, bear in mind that it will
       not be able to communicate with clifm, because the autocommand function
       always executes commands as external applications using the system
       shell.

       Bear in mind that autocmd directives are evaluated from top to bottom,
       so that subsequent matching entries will overwrite options set by
       previous entries.

       Autocommand notifications

       By default, a gray 'A' is printed to the left of the prompt whenever an
       autocommand is active for the current directory.

       The behavior of this indicator can be customized via the InformAutocmd
       option in the configuration file.

       The color code used to colorize this indicator is ac (see the COLORS
       section above).

       Autocommand files: .cfm.in and .cfm.out

       To use this feature, you must first set ReadAutocmdFiles to true in the
       main configuration file. However, bear in mind that autocommand files
       will never be read if running on an untrusted environment (i.e. if
       running with --secure-cmds, --secure-env, or --secure-env-full).

       Two files are specifically checked by the autocommands function:
       .cfm.in and .cfm.out (they must be non-empty regular files of at most
       PATH_MAX (usually 4096) bytes, and no NUL byte must be contained in
       them).

       The content of these files is a single instruction, either a shell
       command or, if you need more elaborated stuff, a script (or custom
       binary). Note that codes to modify clifm's settings (as described
       above) are not available here.

       If a directory contains a file named .cfm.in, clifm will execute (via
       the system shell) its content when entering this directory (before
       listing files). If the file is named rather .cfm.out, its content will
       be executed immediately after leaving this directory (and before
       listing the new directory's content).

       For example, if you want a simple notification whenever you enter or
       leave your home directory, create both .cfm.in and .cfm.out files in
       the home directory with the following content:

       For .cfm.in:
          printf "Entering %s ..." "$PWD" && read -n1 && clear

       For .cfm.out:
          printf "Leaving %s ..." "$OLDPWD" && read -n1


16. FILE TAGS
       Etiqueta is clifm's builtin files tagging system

       1. How does Etiqueta work?

       File tags are created via symlinks using a specific directory under the
       user's profile:
       ${XDG_CONFIG_DIR:-/home/USER/.config}/clifm/profiles/USER/tags

       Every time a new tag is created, a new directory named as the tag
       itself is created in the tags directory. Tagged files are just symbolic
       links to the actual files created in the appropriate directory. For
       example, if you tag ~/myfile.txt as work, a symbolic link to
       ~/myfile.txt, named myfile.txt will be created in tags/work.

       2. Handling file tags

       tag is the main Etiqueta command and is used to handle file tags. Its
       syntax is as follows:

        tag [add, del, list, list-full, new, merge, rename, untag] [FILE]...
       [[:]TAG]

       Note: The :TAG notation is used for commands taking both file and tag
       names: `tag add FILES(s) :TAG ...`, to tag files, and `tag untag :TAG
       file1 file2`, to untag files. Otherwise, TAG is used (without the
       leading colon). For example: `tag new docs`, to create a new tag named
       docs, or `tag del png`, to delete the tag named png.

       Both short and long command format can be used:



       ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
       │Short format │ Long format │ Description               │

       (1) Tags are created if they do not exist
       (2) Since add is the default action, it can be omitted: `tag *.png
       :images :png`.
       (3) All files tagged as png will be now tagged as images, and the png
       tag will be removed.
       (4) Untag all files tagged as images and remove the tag itself
       (5) Tab completion is available to complete tagged files. If using the
       fzf mode, multiple files can be selected using the the TAB key.

       4. Operating on tagged files

       The t:TAG expression is used to operate on tagged files via any
       command, be it internal or external. A few examples:



       ┌───────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
       │Command            │ Description                                                            │
       ├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │p t:docs           │ Print properties of files tagged as docs                               │
       ├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │r t:images         │ Remove all files tagged as images                                      │
       ├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │stat t:docs t:work │ Run stat(1) over all files tagged as docs and all files tagged as work │
       └───────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

       4.1 Operating on specific tagged files

       Note: This feature, as always when multi-selection is involved, is only
       available when tab completion mode is set to fzf. See the TAB
       COMPLETION section above.

       You may not want to operate on all files tagged as some specific tag,
       say work, but rather on some files tagged as work. Tab completion is
       used to achieve this aim.

       Let's suppose you have a tag named work which contains ten tagged
       files, but you need to operate (say, print the file properties) only on
       two of them, say, work1.odt and work2.odt:

        p t:work<TAB>

       The list of files tagged as work will be displayed via fzf. Now mark
       the two files you need using the TAB key, press Enter or Right, and the
       absolute path to both files will be inserted into the command line. So,
       `p t:work` will be replaced by `p /path/to/work1.odt
       /path/to/work2.odt`.


17. VIRTUAL DIRECTORIES
       Clifm is able to read and list files from the standard input stream
       (STDIN). Each file in the list should be an absolute path, terminated
       with a new line character (\n) and stripped from extra characters not
       belonging to the path itself. The size of the input stream buffer is
       262MiB (65536 paths, provided each path takes PATH_MAX bytes (usually
       4096)).

       Each file passed via standard input is stored as a symbolic link
       pointing to the original file in a temporary directory (called here
       virtual directory) with read-only (0500) permissions. This directory,
       and all its contents, will be deleted at program exit. Use the
       --virtual-dir command line flag to specify a custom directory (it if
       does not exist, it will be created) instead of the default one, created
       in the system temporary directory (usually /tmp/clifm/USER/vdir.XXXXXX,
       where XXXXXX is a random six digits string).

       The user can operate on these files as if they were any other regular
       file, since all operations performed on these symbolic links (provided
       the current working directory is the virtual directory where all these
       files are stored) are performed on the target files and NOT on the
       symbolic links themselves.

       Once in the virtual directory, files are listed by default using only
       the base name of the target file. For example, if the target file is
       /home/user/Downloads/myfile.tar.gz, this file will be listed as
       myfile.tar.gz. If this file already exists in the virtual directory
       (because there is another target file with the same base name, say,
       /home/user/Documents/tars/myfile.tar.gz), a random six digits suffix
       will be appended to the file (for instance, myfile.tar.gz.12Rgj6).

       Since this listing mode does not allow the user to get a clear idea of
       the actual location of each listed file, a keybinding (by default
       Alt+w) is available to toggle short (base names only) and long
       filenames: in this latter case, filenames are listed using the absolute
       path to the target file, replacing slashes by colons (:). For example,
       if the target file is /home/user/Downloads/myfile.tar.gz, it will be
       listed in the virtual directory as home:user:Downloads:myfile.tar.gz.

       If you prefer the long names approach, you can use the
       --virtual-dir-full-paths command line flag.

       Note: Bear in mind that the restore last path function is disabled when
       listing in this way.

       Clifm provides to ways of using virtual directories:

       1. Reading files from the standard input

       2. Listing sets of files via the virtualize.sh plugin (which is in fact
       a special use case of point 1)

       1. Standard input

       Examples:

        ls -Ad /var/* | clifm

       This command will pass all files in the directory /var to clifm

       If you need to perform more specific queries, you can use find(1) as
       follows:

        find -maxdepth 1 -size +500k -print0 | tr ´\0´ ´\n´ | sed ´s/.//g´ |
       clifm

       The above command will pass all files in the current directory bigger
       than 500KiB to clifm.

       You can also use stream redirection:

        ls -Ad $PWD/* > list.txt
        clifm < list.txt

       2. The virtualization plugin

       The virtualize.sh plugin, bound by default to the vt action name, is
       intended to provide an easy way of listing sets or collections of
       files, such as selected, tagged, or bookmarked files. For example, to
       send all selected files to a virtual directory, you can issue this
       command:

        vt sel

       and, if you want rather files tagged as PDF:

        vt t:PDF

       Of course, individual files can also be used:

        vt file1 file2 file3

       Once executed, the vt plugin will launch a new instance of clifm (on a
       new terminal emulator window) where you can operate on the specified
       files as if they were just normal files. Once done, quit this new
       instance (via the q command) to return to the primary instance of
       clifm.

       Note: By default, the terminal emulator used is xterm(1), but it can be
       changed by editing the plugin script (virtualize.sh).

       When navigating the filesystem, you can quickly go back to the virtual
       directory using the -d option: `vt -d`. The navigation keys (see the
       KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS section above) and the CLIFM_VIRTUAL_DIR environment
       variable are also available (Shift+Left/Shift+Right or `cd
       $CLIFM_VIRTUAL_DIR`).

       Tip: Write an alias to make this even easier:

        alias vtd=´cd $CLIFM_VIRTUAL_DIR´


18. NOTE ON SPEED
       Clifm is by itself quite fast by default, but if speed is still an
       issue, it is possible to get some extra performance.

       The two most time consuming features are:

        1) The file counter, used to print the number of files contained by
       listed directories. Disabling this option produces a nice performance
       boost.

        2) In normal mode, fstatat(3) is used to gather information about
       listed files. Since this function, especially when executed hundreds
       (and even thousands) of times, is quite time consuming, the light mode
       was implemented as an alternative listing process omitting all calls to
       this function (this does not apply, however, to the long view: since we
       need to display files information, fstatat(3) is required).

       When running in light mode, however, a few features are lost:

        1. Only basic file classification is performed, namely, that provided
       by the d_type field of a dirent struct (see readdir(3)). Bear in mind,
       nonetheless, that whenever _DIRENT_HAVE_D_TYPE was not set at compile
       time, or in case of a DT_UNKNOWN value for a given entry (we may be
       facing a filesystem not returning the d_type value, for example, loop
       devices), clifm will fall back to stat(3) to get basic files
       classification.

        2. Color per file extension is disabled for performance reasons.

        3. The marker for selected files (*) is lost as well: to keep track of
       selected files and thus recognize them in the current list of files, we
       make use of files device and inode number, which is provided by
       fstatat(3).

       Besides these two features, a few more things can be disabled to get
       some extra speed (though perhaps unnoticeable): icons (if enabled),
       columns, colors, and, if already running without colors, file type
       indicators. Because listing lots of files could be expensive and time
       consuming, you can also try to limit the number of files printed for
       each visited directory (see the mf command above).

       Despite the above, however, it is important to bear in mind that
       listing speed does not only depend on the program´s code and enabled
       features, but also on the terminal emulator used. Old, basic terminal
       emulators like Xterm, Aterm, and the kernel builtin console are really
       slow compared to more modern ones like Urxvt, Lxterminal, ST, and
       Terminator, to name just a few.

       If using Xterm, a nice speed boost is provided by the fast scroll
       option: set fastScroll to true in your ~/.Xresources file. See
       xterm(1).


19. KANGAROO FRECENCY ALGORITHM
       The directory jumper function is designed to learn the navigation
       habits of the user. The information is stored in a database (see the
       FILES section below) used to get the best match for a given string
       provided by the user. In this sense, Kangaroo is like a quick, smart,
       and evolved cd function.

       The information stored in the database, always per directory, is:
        a) Permanent entry ('+'): this directory will not be removed from the
       database, no matter its rank
        b) Number of visits
        c) Date of first visit (seconds since the Unix epoch)
        d) Date of the last visit (seconds since Unix epoch)
        e) The absolute path to each visited directory

       With this information it is possible to build a ranking of directories
       to offer the user the most accurate matches for each query string. The
       matching algorithm takes into account mainly two factors: frequency and
       recency (which is why this kind of algorithm is often called a frecency
       algorithm).

       After getting an initial list of matches based on the query string(s)
       entered by the user, the frequency algorithm is applied on each entry
       in the list. The algorithm is quite simple: (visits * VISIT-CREDIT) /
       days-since-first-visit. As a result, we get the average of visits per
       day since the day of the first visit (what we call the directory rank).

       Note: VISIT-CREDIT is a hardcoded value: 200.

       There are however some further steps in the ranking process: Bonus
       points.

       Extra credits or penalties are assigned based on the directories last
       access time according to the following simple algorithms:
        Within last hour:  rank * 4
        Within last day:   rank * 2
        Within last week:  rank / 2
        More than a week:  rank / 4

       If the last query string matches the basename of a directory, the entry
       for this directory has 300 extra credits. This is done simply because
       users normally use directory basenames as query strings: they are
       easier to remember.

       In the same way, pinned directories get 1000 extra credits, bookmarked
       directories 500 credits, directories active in a workspace 300 credits,
       and directories marked as permanent 300 credits.

       For example: if the query string is "test", /media/data/test will be
       matched. Now, if this directory was accessed within the last hour, and
       its rank was 200, it becomes 800. But, because the search string
       matches its basename, it gets 300 extra credits, and, if this directory
       is in addition bookmarked, pinned, and marked as permanent, it gets
       1800 extra credits. In this way the total rank of this directory in the
       matching process is 2900. In doing so, we have more chances of matching
       what the user actually wanted to match.

       Once all entries in the initial list of matches have been filtered via
       the above procedure and ranked, we can return the best ranked entry.
       The higher rank a directory has, the more priority it has over the
       remaining entries in the initial list of matches.

       Automatic maintenance is done on the database applying a few simple
       procedures:

        a) If PurgeJumpDB is set to true (see the main configuration file),
       each entry in the database is checked at startup to remove non-existent
       directories. This option is set to false by default to avoid removing
       paths pointing to unmounted filesystems (like removable devices or
       remote locations) which you still might want to keep. Non-existent
       directories, however, will be removed soon or later anyway due to their
       low rank value (see below).

        b) Once the rank of a directory falls below MinJumpRank (by default
       10), it is forgotten and deleted from the database. The MinJumpRank
       value can be customized in the configuration file. To make
       non-frequently visited directories disappear quicker from the database,
       increase this value. If set to 0, by contrast, directories will never
       be removed from the database.

        c) Once the sum total of ranks reaches MaxJumpTotalRank (by default
       100000), each individual rank is divided by a dynamic factor so that
       the total rank becomes less than or equal to MaxJumpTotalRank. If some
       rank falls in the process below MinJumpRank (and provided this latter
       is not 0), it is removed from the database. MaxJumpTotalRank can be
       modified in the configuration file. The higher the value of
       MaxJumpTotalRank, the more time directories will be kept in the
       database.

       Note: Directories visited in the last 24 hours, just as pinned,
       bookmarked directories, and directories currently used in some
       workspace, will not be removed from the database, no matter what their
       rank is. In other words, if you want to indefinitely keep a given
       directory in the jump database, bookmark it, or mark it as permanent
       (edit the database, via `je` or `j --edit`, and prepend a plus sign (+)
       to the corresponding entry).

       The idea of 'frecency' was, as far as I know, first devised and
       designed by Mozilla. See
       https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Mconnor/Past/PlacesFrecency. However, it
       is also implemented, though using different algorithms, by different
       projects like autojump, z.lua, and zoxide.


20. ENVIRONMENT
       The following variables are read at initialization time:

       NO_COLOR
              If set to any value, clifm will run without colors.

       CLIFM_NO_COLOR
              Same as NO_COLOR, but specific to clifm.

       CLICOLOR_FORCE
              Force the use of colors, even if the terminal does not report
              color support.

       CLIFM_FORCE_COLOR
              Same as CLICOLOR_FORCE, but accepts a specific color value (8,
              16, 256, truecolor or 24bit).

       COLORTERM
              If set to either truecolor or 24bit, clifm assumes the terminal
              emulator to be capable of displaying true colors (and thereby
              also 256 colors), despite what the terminfo(5) database reports.

       CLIFM_FILE_COLORS
              A colon separated list of file type color codes in the same form
              specified above in the COLOR CODES section.

       CLIFM_EXT_COLORS
              Same as above, but for file extensions.

       CLIFM_IFACE_COLORS
              Same as above, but for different elements of clifm's interface.

       CLIFM_DATE_SHADES
              A comma separated list of colors used to print timestamps based
              on age.

       CLIFM_SIZE_SHADES
              Same as CLIFM_DATE_SHADES, but for file sizes.

       CLIFM_PREVIEW_MAX_SIZE
              If running with --preview, or PreviewMaxSize is not set in the
              configuration file, no preview is generated for files larger
              that this value. The value must be specified in KiB: for
              example, 2048 is read as 2 MiB.

       CLIFM_TEMPLATES_DIR
              A custom file templates directory.

       CLIFM_HISTFILE
              A custom commands history file.

       CLIFM_FILTER
              Define a file filter. If set, this variable overrides the Filter
              option in the configuration file.

       CLIFM_SUDO_CMD
              Name of the authenticator program. Used by the X command (to
              launch a new instance of clifm as root), the Alt+v keybinding
              (to prepend the authenticator program name to the current
              command line), and for some operations on archives (ISO files).
              Defaults to sudo (or doas if compiled on OpenBSD). Example:
              `CLIFM_SUDO_CMD=doas clifm`.

       SHELL
              An absolute path to the shell to be used by clifm to run
              external commands. Only values found in /etc/shells are allowed.

       CLIFM_SHELL
              Same as SHELL, but specific to clifm (takes precedence over
              SHELL).

       TMPDIR
              Path to a directory where temporary files will be created.

       CLIFM_TMPDIR
              Same as TMPDIR, but specific to clifm (takes precedence over
              TMPDIR).

       TERM
              Terminal type for which output is to be prepared.

       FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
              A quoted list of options to be passed to fzf (if used for tab
              completion).

       TIME_STYLE
              If set from neither --time-style nor TimeStyle (in the
              configuration file), use this time style for the long view.

       CLIFM_TIME_STYLE
              Same as TIME_STYLE, but specific to clifm (takes precedence over
              TIME_STYLE).

       PTIME_STYLE
              If set from neither --ptime-style nor PTimeStyle (in the
              configuration file), use this time style for the p/pp command
              and the --stat/--stat-full command line switches.

       CLIFM_COLUMNS
              The number of terminal columns.

       CLIFM_LINES
              The number of terminal lines.

       CLIFM_MIMETYPES_FILE
              Set a custom mime.types file (instead of the default,
              ~/.mime.types). Consult the FILE OPENER section form more
              information.

       Except when running in stealth mode, clifm sets the following
       environment variables:

       CLIFM
              Path to the configuration directory. By inspecting this variable
              other programs can find out if they were spawned by clifm. It
              can also be used to quickly jump to the configuration directory:
              `cd $CLIFM` or just `$CLIFM`.

       CLIFMRC
              Path to the main configuration file (by default
              ~/.config/clifm/profiles/default/clifmrc).

       CLIFM_PID
              PID number of clifm's running instance.

       CLIFM_VERSION
              Version number of clifm's running instance.

       CLIFM_VIRTUAL_DIR
              Path to the currently used virtual directory only if (and while)
              the virtual directory function is exectued. See the VIRTUAL
              DIRECTORIES section above.

       SHLVL
              Incremented by one each time a new shell is started.

       CLIFMLVL
              Same as SHLVL, but specific to clifm.

       If Notifications is set to false for the current prompt, the following
       variables are exported to the environment to be used, if needed, by
       your custom prompt:

       CLIFM_STAT_SEL
              Current number of selected files.

       CLIFM_STAT_TRASH
              Current number of trashed files.

       CLIFM_STAT_ERROR_MSGS
              Current number of error messages.

       CLIFM_STAT_WARNING_MSGS
              Current number of warning messages.

       CLIFM_STAT_NOTICE_MSGS
              Current number of notice messages.

       CLIFM_STAT_WS
              Current workspace number.

       CLIFM_STAT_EXIT
              Exit code of the last executed command.

       CLIFM_STAT_ROOT
              1 if user is root (UID = 0), 0 otherwise.

       CLIFM_STAT_STEALTH
              1 if running in stealth mode, 0 otherwise.

       When running a plugin, the following environment variables are set:

       CLIFM_BUS
              The path to a pipe by means of which plugins can talk to clifm.
              See the PLUGINS section for more information.

       CLIFM_COLOR_SCHEME
              Set to the name of the current color scheme.

       CLIFM_COLORLESS
              Set to 1 if running without colors.

       CLIFM_CUR_WS
              Set to the current workspace number.

       CLIFM_DIRS_FIRST
              Set to 1 if list-dirs-first is enabled. Otherwise it is set to
              0.

       CLIFM_FILES_COUNTER
              Set to 1 if files-counter is enabled. Otherwise it is set to 0.

       CLIFM_FILES_FILTER
              Set to the files filter string. Unset if no files filter is set.

       CLIFM_FILTER_REVERSE
              Set to 1 if filter-reverse is set or to 0 otherwise (unset if no
              files filter is set).

       CLIFM_FOLLOW_LINKS
              Set to 1 if follow-symlinks is enabled. Otherwise it is set to
              0.

       CLIFM_LIGHT_MODE
              Set to 1 if light-mode is enabled. Otherwise it is set to 0.

       CLIFM_LINE
              When running a plugin via a keybinding, this variable holds the
              content of the current line buffer. For a usage example see the
              xclip.sh plugin.

       CLIFM_LONG_VIEW
              Set to 1 if long-view is enabled. Otherwise it is set to 0.

       CLIFM_MAX_FILES
              Set to MAX_FILES if max-files is set. Unset otherwise.

       CLIFM_ONLY_DIRS
              Set to 1 if only-dirs is enabled. Otherwise it is set to 0.

       CLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER
              Set to the absolute path to the plugins-helper script used by
              several plugins.

       CLIFM_PROFILE
              Set to the name of the current profile.

       CLIFM_SEL_FILES
              Set to the number of currently selected files (unset if there
              are no selected files).

       CLIFM_SELFILE
              Set to the path to the current selection file.

       CLIFM_SHOW_HIDDEN
              Set to 1-3 if show-hidden is enabled (true, first, last, in this
              order). Otherwise it is set to 0.

       CLIFM_SORT_REVERSE
              Set to 1 if sort-reverse is enabled. Otherwise it is set to 0.

       CLIFM_SORT_STYLE
              Set to the current sort method.

       CLIFM_TRASH_FILES
              Set to the number of currently trashed files (unset if there are
              no trashed files).

       CLIFM_TRUNCATE_NAMES
              Set to 1 if truncate-names is enabled. Otherwise it is set to 0.


21. SECURITY
       Since clifm executes OS commands, it needs to provide a way to securely
       run these commands, specially when it comes to untrusted environments.
       Two features are provided to achieve this aim: secure environment and
       secure commands.

       Both features are aimed at protecting the program and the system as
       such from malicious input, either coming from environment variables or
       from indirect input, that is to say, input coming not from the command
       line (in which is assumed that it is the user herself who is executing
       the given command), but from files: this is the case of default
       associated applications (the mime command), autocommands, aliases,
       plugins, (un)mount commands (using the net command), just as profile
       and prompt commands.

       In an untrusted environment, an attacker could cause unexpected and
       insecure behavior (even command injection) using environment variables,
       or inject malicious commands via indirect input, commands which will be
       later executed by clifm without the user's consent (i.e.
       automatically). This is why we provide a mechanism to minimize this
       danger: if running in an untrusted environment, the secure environment
       and secure commands features are there to prevent (at least as far as
       possible) this kind of attacks.

       A) Secure environment

       Programs inherit the environment from the parent process. However, if
       this inherited environment is not trusted, not secure, it is always a
       good idea to sanitize it using only sane values, preventing thus
       undesired and uncontrolled input that might endanger the program and
       the system itself.

       The secure-environment function forces clifm to run on a such a
       sanitized environment.

       There are two secure-environment modes, the regular, and the full one.
       To enable the regular mode, run clifm with the --secure-env command
       line option. Otherwise, enable the full mode using --secure-env-full.

       a) Regular: in this mode, the inherited environment is cleared, though
       a few variables are preserved to keep clifm running as stable as
       possible. These preserved variables are: TERM, DISPLAY, LANG, TZ, and,
       if fzf tab completion mode is enabled, FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS.

       The following variables are set in an environment agnostic way (that
       is, securely):
                - HOME, SHELL, and USER are retrieved using getpwuid(3)
                - PATH is set consulting _PATH_STDPATH (or _CS_PATH if the
              former is not available)
                - IFS is set to a sane, hard-coded value: " \n\t" (space, new
              line char, and horizontal TAB)

       As a plus, 1) core dumps are disabled, 2) the umask value is set to
       0077 at startup and the creation mode (when using the new command) is
       forced to 0700 for directories and 0600 for files, 3) non-standard file
       descriptors (>2) are closed, 4) SUID/SGID privileges, if any, are
       dropped, and 5) autocommand files are not read at all (even if
       ReadAutocmdFiles is set to true).

       b) Full: this mode is just like the regular mode, except that nothing
       is imported from the environment at all and only PATH, HOME, USER,
       SHELL, and IFS are set (as described above). Everything else remains
       unset, and is the user's responsibility to set environment variables
       (via the export function), as needed. In this case, you might want to
       set, at least, TERM, and, if running in a graphical environment,
       DISPLAY.

       Be aware that enabling secure-environment might break some functions,
       depending on the system configuration.

       B) Secure commands

       Some commands are automatically executed by clifm: (un)mount commands
       (via the net command), opening applications (via Lira), aliases, and
       plugins, just as prompt, profile, and autocommands. These commands are
       read from a configuration file and then executed. Now, if an attacker
       has access to any of these files, she might force clifm to run any
       arbitrary command, and thereby possibly exposing the whole system.

       Every time a command is thus automatically executed via the system
       shell (i.e. without the user's direct consent), the secure commands
       function performs four different, though intrinsically related tasks
       aimed to mitigate command injection and/or unexpected behavior:

       a) Plugins are disabled.

       b) Only command base names are allowed: nano, for instance, is allowed,
       while /usr/bin/nano is not. In this way we can guarantee that only
       commands found in a sanitized PATH (see the point d below) will be
       executed. This is done in order to prevent the execution of custom
       binaries/scripts, for example: /tmp/exec_file.

       c) Commands are validated using a whitelist of safe characters (mostly
       to prevent stream redirection, conditional execution, and so on, for
       example, 'your_command;some_injected_command'). This set of safe
       characters slightly vary depending on the command being executed
       (because they use different syntaxes):

               Net command:                   a-zA-Z -_.,/=
               Prompt, profile, autocommands: a-zA-Z -_.,/"'
               Mime command:                  a-zA-Z -_.,%&

       Commands containing at least one unsafe character will be rejected. Of
       course, we cannot (and should not) prevent what looks like legitimate,
       benign commands from being executed. But we can stop commands that, in
       an untrusted environment, look suspicious. This is specially the case
       of stream redirection (>), pipes (|), sequential (;) and conditional
       execution (&&, ||), command substitution ($(cmd)), and environment
       variables ($VAR).

       d) A secure environment is set (--secure-env is implied; to run on a
       fully sanitized environment run as follows: --secure-cmds
       --secure-env-full.


22. MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
       Sequential and conditional execution of commands:

       For each of the internal commands (see the COMMANDS section above) you
       can use the semicolon to execute them sequentially and/or the double
       ampersand to execute them conditionally. For example:
       `cmd1; cmd2 && cmd3`.

       Though you can use here external commands as well, bear in mind that,
       whenever at least one internal command is involved in a chained list of
       commands, clifm will take care of executing this list (simply because
       the system shell is not able to understand any of these commands), so
       that no shell inter-process function (like pipes), nor any stream
       redirection or shell expression (like IF blocks or FOR loops) will be
       available. However, the shell is still used to run single external
       commands found in the chained list, but in isolation from the remaining
       commands in this list.

       As a rule of thumb, when using chained commands make sure to always
       expand ELNs to avoid undesired consequences. If, for instance, you
       issue this command: `touch aaa && r 3`, you will end up deleting a file
       you were not intended to delete, simple because after the successful
       execution of the first command, the ELN 3 corresponds now to a
       different file.


       External commands:

       Clifm is not limited to its own set of internal commands, like open,
       sel, trash, etc. It can run external commands as well, provided
       external commands are allowed (see the -x option, the ext command, and
       the ExternalCommands option in the configuration file).

       External commands are executed using the system shell (say, /bin/sh),
       which is specified by clifm as follows:
         1. If the CLIFM_SHELL environment variable is set, this value is
       used.
         2. If the SHELL environment variable is set, this value is used.
         3. If none of the above, the value is taken from the passwd database
       (via getpwuid(3)).

       The shell is invoked as follows: SHELL -c 'CMD ARG...', for example,
       `/bin/sh -c 'ls -l'`.

       By beginning the external command by a colon or a semicolon (':', ';')
       you tell clifm not to parse the input string, but instead letting this
       task to the system shell.

       Bear in mind that clifm is not intended to be used as a shell, but as
       the file manager it is.


       Terminal emulators and non-ASCII characters:

       It depends on the terminal emulator you use to correctly display
       non-ASCII characters and characters from the extended ASCII charset.
       If, for example, you create a filenamed "ñandú" (the Spanish word for
       ´rhea´), it will be correctly displayed by the Linux console,
       Lxterminal, and Urxvt, but not thus by more basic terminal emulators
       like Aterm.


       Spaces and filenames:

       When dealing with filenames containing spaces, you can use both single
       and double quotes (e.g.: "this file" or 'this file') plus the backslash
       character (e.g.: this\ file).


       Default profile:

       Clifm's default profile is default. To create alternative profiles use
       the -P command line option or the `pf add` command (see above).


23. FILES
       CONFIGURATION FILE
              The main configuration file is looked up in these places (and in
              this order):

               1. -c,--config-file switch
               2. $CLIFMRC variable
               3. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/clifmrc directory

              If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, $HOME/.config is used instead.
              If running with secure-environment (using either --secure-cmds,
              --secure-env, or --secure-env-full) no environment variable is
              read, so that the home directory is taken instead from the
              password database (via getpwuid(3)).

              PROFILE is by default default (unless set via -P,--profile).

              You can access the configuration file either via the config
              command or pressing F10.

              A description for each option in the configuration file can be
              found in the configuration file itself.

       PROFILE FILE
              The profile file is
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/profile.clifm.  In this
              file you can add those commands you want to be executed at
              startup. You can also permanently set here some custom
              variables, e.g.: 'dir="/path/to/dir"'. This variable may be used
              as a shortcut to that directory, for instance: `cd $dir`. Custom
              variables can also be temporarily defined in the command prompt:
              E.g.: user@hostname ~ $ var="This is a test". Temporary
              variables will be removed at program exit. Internal variables
              are disabled by default; enable them using the --int-vars
              command line switch.

       PROMPTS FILE
              This file contains prompts definitions and is located in
              DATADIR/clifm/prompts.clifm. It will be copied automatically to
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/prompts.clifm if it doesn't exist. The
              Prompt line in the color scheme file should point to one of the
              prompt names defined in this file. See the PROMPT section for
              more information.

       KEYBINDINGS FILE
              The keybindings file is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/keybindings,cfm.
              It will be copied from DATADIR/clifm (usually /usr/share/clifm),
              and if not found, it will be created anew with default values.
              This file is used to specify the keyboard shortcuts used for
              some ClifM's functions. The format for each keybinding is always
              "keyseq:function", where 'keyseq' is an escape sequence in GNU
              emacs style. A more detailed explanation can be found in the
              keybindings file itself.

       PLUGINS DIRECTORY
              The directory used to store programs or scripts pointed to by
              actions (in other words, plugins) is DATADIR/clifm/plugins
              (usually /usr/share/clifm/plugins). To edit these plugins copy
              them to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/plugins and edit them to your
              liking. Plugins in this local directory take precedence over
              those in the system one.

       COLORS DIRECTORY
              This directory, $DATADIR/clifm/colors, contains available color
              schemes (or just themes) as files with a .clifm extension. You
              can copy these themes to the local colors directory
              ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/colors) and edit them to your liking (or
              create new themes from the ground up). Themes in the local
              colors directory take precedence over those in the system
              directory. You can create as many themes as you want by dropping
              them into the local colors directory. The default color scheme
              file (default.clifm) can be used as a guide.

       ACTIONS FILE
              The file used to define custom actions is
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/actions.clifm. It will
              be copied from DATADIR/clifm (usually /usr/share/clifm), and if
              not found, it will be created anew with default values.

       MIMELIST FILE
              The mimelist file is
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/mimelist.clifm. It is a
              list of file types and name/extensions and their associated
              applications used by lira. It will be copied from DATADIR/clifm
              (usually /usr/share/clifm).

       PREVIEW FILE
              The preview file is
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/preview.clifm and is
              shotgun's configuration file. It makes use of the same syntax
              used by the mimelist file. It will be copied from DATADIR/clifm
              (usually /usr/share/clifm).

       BOOKMARKS FILE
              The bookmarks file is
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/bookmarks.clifm Just the
              list of the user's bookmarks used by the bookmarks function.

HISTORY FILE
       The history file is ~/.config/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/history.clifm.  A
       list of commands entered by the user and used by the history function.

       COMMANDS LOG FILE
              The commands log file is
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/cmdlogs.clifm. Command
              logs keep track of commands entered in the command line. These
              logs have this form: "[date] current_working_directory:command".

       MESSAGES LOG FILE
              The messages log file is
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/msglogs.clifm. Message
              logs are a record of errors and warnings and have the following
              form: "[date] message".

       KANGAROO DATABASE
              The directory jumper database is stored in
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/jump.clifm.

       Note: If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, $HOME/.config/ is used instead.

        (1) Use the ow command to select the opening application from a menu:
       `ow myfile.txt` or `ow myfile.txt <TAB>`
        (2) Note the ending slash in the directory name
        (3) Since clifm is integrated to the system shell, you can also use
       any of the shell commands you usually use to create new files. E.g.:
       `touch myfile` or `nano myfile`
        (4) Only for non-standard tab completion: fzf, fnf, smenu
        (5) You can also TAB expand the sel keyword: `p sel<TAB>` to list
       selected files (and optionally mark multiple selected files to operate
       on)
        (6) Type `bm <TAB>` to get the list of available bookmark names
        (7) To remove files in bulk use the rr command

       There is a lot more you can do, but this should be enough to get you
       started.


EXIT STATUS
       Clifm returns the exit status of the last executed command


CONFORMING TO
       Clifm is C99 compliant, and, if compiled with the _BE_POSIX flag, it is
       POSIX.1-2008 compliant as well. If not, just a single non-POSIX
       function is used: statx(2) (Linux specific), to get files birth time.
