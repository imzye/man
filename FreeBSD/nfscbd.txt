NFSCBD(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              NFSCBD(8)

NAME
     nfscbd – NFSv4 client side callback daemon

SYNOPSIS
     nfscbd [-p port_number] [-P client_principal]

DESCRIPTION
     nfscbd runs on a client using NFSv4 to handle callback requests from the
     NFSv4 server.  If no nfscbd is running, NFSv4 mounts will still work, but
     the server will never issue Open Delegations to the client.

     One callback server and one master server are always started.

     The following options are available:

     -p port_number
             Specifies what port# the callback server should use.

     -P client_principal
             Specifies the host based principal name to be used as the target
             for callbacks over RPCSEC_GSS. For KerberosV, it must be in the
             client's default keytab file.  This client_principal should be
             the same one specified by the gssname argument being used by
             nfsv4 mounts.  If you do not specify this argument, callbacks
             will still work over AUTH_SYS, which is what many extant servers
             use even for RPCSEC_GSS mounts, as of 2009.

     For example, “nfscbd -p 7654 -P root” starts the daemon to handle
     callbacks on port# 7654 and is using the host based principal
     root@<client-host>.<dns-domain> as the callback target.

     nfscbd listens for service requests at the port defined by NFSV4_CBPORT
     in /usr/include/fs/nfs/nfs.h, unless -p has been specified.  For more
     information on what callbacks and Open Delegations do, see Network File
     System (NFS) Version 4 Protocol, RFC3530.

EXIT STATUS
     The nfscbd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
