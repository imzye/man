NAME
       whowatch - watch logged in users and processes in real time

DESCRIPTION
       Whowatch is an interactive ncurses who-like utility that displays
       information about the users currently logged on to the machine, in
       real-time.  Besides standard informations (login name, tty, host,
       user's process), the type of the connection (ie. telnet or ssh) is
       shown.  Display of users command line can be switch to tty idle time.
       Certain user can be selected and his processes tree may be viewed as
       well as tree of all system processes. Tree may be displayed with
       additional column that shows owner of each process.  In the process
       tree mode SIGINT and SIGKILL signals can be sent to the selected
       process. Killing processes is just as simple and fun as deleting lines
       on the screen.

       Whowatch has no command line options or configuration file.  All
       actions are performed in real time by pressing following keys:

       Users list mode:

       'up' 'down'
              cursor movement

       'i'    toggle between user command line and idle time

       'c'    full command line on/off. Disabling full command line can save
              CPU time.  It can give you also some additional information
              about process executable.

       'enter'
              view selected user's processes tree.

       't'    all system processes (init tree)

       Tree mode:

       'up' 'down'
              cursor movement

       'enter'
              go back to users list

       'o'    show processes owners

       'c'    full command line on/off. Disabling full command line can save
              CPU time.  It can give you also some additional information
              about process executable.

       'Ctrl-I'
              send INT signal to selected process

       'Ctrl-K'
              send KILL signal to selected process


FILES
       Program reads /var/log/wtmp, /var/run/utmp. Under Linux program also
       reads files from /proc directory. Without read access to these files
       whowatch funcionality will be limited or program will not even start.


SEE ALSO
       finger(1) ps(1), pstree(1), top(1), w(1),


BUGS
       Because lack of ut_pid in utmp and wtmp structures in *BSD systems,
       program tries to obtain pid of a login shell by analizing processes
       controlling terminal and processes names. Under some conditions it may
       lead to incorrect results ie. there will be incorrect processes tree
       associated with user's session.
