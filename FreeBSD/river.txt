RIVER(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               RIVER(1)

NAME
       river - dynamic tiling Wayland compositor

SYNOPSIS
       river [options]

DESCRIPTION
       river is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor. Window management is
       based on a stack of views laid out dynamically by an external layout
       generator. Tags are used instead of workspaces allowing for increased
       flexibility.

       All configuration and control happens at runtime through Wayland
       protocols, including several river-specific protocol extensions. The
       riverctl(1) utility may be used to communicate with river over these
       protocols.

OPTIONS
       -h
           Print a help message and exit.

       -version
           Print the version number and exit.

       -c shell_command
           Override the default search paths for an init executable: instead
           shell_command will be run with /bin/sh -c. See the CONFIGURATION
           section for more details.

       -log-level [error|warning|info|debug]
           Set the log level of river. At the error log level, only errors are
           logged.  At the debug log level, everything is logged including
           verbose debug messages.

       -no-xwayland
           Disable xwayland at runtime even if river has been built with
           support.

CONFIGURATION
       On startup river will run an executable file at
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/river/init if such an executable exists. If
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, ~/.config/river/init will be used instead.

       The executable init file will be run as a process group leader after
       river's Wayland server is initialized but before entering the main
       loop. On exit, river will send SIGTERM to this process group.

       Usually this executable is a shell script invoking riverctl(1) to
       create mappings, start programs such as a layout generator or status
       bar, and perform other configuration.
