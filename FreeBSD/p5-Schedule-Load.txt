DESCRIPTION
       rschedule will report or set status for load distribution using the
       Perl Schedule::Load package.

       If symbolically linked to the name "rtop" rschedule will by default
       produce a listing of each host and the top loads on those hosts.
       Similarly, a link to "rhosts" will show the host report by default, and
       a link to "rloads" will show the load report.

COMMANDS
       allow_class <class>
           Sets the hostname to allow the specified class of jobs.  This
           sticks across reboots.

       best
           Returns the best host for a new job.

       best_or_none
           Returns the best host if there are free CPUs laying around, else
           fails.

       classes
           Displays a listing of the classes of jobs each host can run.

       cmnd_comment <pid>
           Sets the command comment for the given process ID.  In rschedule
           top (rtop) displays, this will be shown rather than the name of the
           command.  Command comments are inherited by children of commented
           parents.

       deny_class <class>
           Sets the hostname to deny the specified class of jobs.

       fixed_load <pid>
           Sets the given process ID to have that process count as one host
           load, even if it is using less CPU time than that due to high disk
           activity or other sleeps.

       holds
           Displays a listing of jobs that are blocked waiting for resources.

       hosts
           Displays a listing of each host being monitored along with its load
           and system type.

       hostnames
           Displays list of each hostname.  Multi-CPU hosts appear once.

       idle_host_names
           Displays list of each idle CPU.  Multi-CPU hosts appear multiple
           times.

       loads
           Displays a longer command line of top jobs, along with any
           fixed_load jobs.

       release
           Releases a host from dedicated use.  Use --host to specify which
           host.

           Any person may release a host, not just the original user
           requesting the reservation.  You may also use "release reserve"
           together to change an existing reservation.

       reserve
           Reserves a host for dedicated use.  To be reservable the
           "reservable" flag must be set when that host's slreportd is
           invocated.  This is indicated on the top report by a "R" in the
           column next to the command.  To override a existing reservation you
           need to release the reservation first.  Use --host to specify which
           host.  A optional --comment specifies the reservation comment; the
           default time and user will be prepended unless a leading - is used.

       set_const var=value
           Sets a constant reporter parameter to the specified value.
           Slreportd will loose the information when rebooted, so this should
           only be used to avoid restarting the daemon after changing the
           slreportd's boot flags.

       set_stored var=value
           Sets a stored reporter parameter to the specified value.  Slreportd
           will keep the information when rebooted, and override any set_const
           setting.

       sleep secs
           For debugging only, sleep the specified number of seconds.

       status
           Displays a listing of each host and its daemon's status.  Intended
           only for debugging problems with the scheduler.

       top Displays a listing of top processes across all hosts being
           monitored.

ARGUMENTS
       --allow-reserved
       --no-allow-reserved
           Specifies if reserved hosts may be returned by the best,
           best_or_none, hostnames, idle_host_names, and jobs commands.

       --class <class>
           Specifies the job class for the best, best_or_none, hostnames,
           idle_host_names, and jobs commands.

       --comment <comment>
           Specifies the command comment for the cmnd_comment command.

       --dhost <hostname>
           Specifies the host name that slchoosed uses.  May be specified
           multiple times to specify backup hosts.  Defaults to SLCHOOSED_HOST
           environment variable, which contains colon separated host names.

       --help
           Displays this message and program version and exits.

       --kill <signal>
           With the "loads" command, convert the listing to a form that will
           login to the host and kill the processes.  With a argument, use the
           argument as the signal name.

       --load <load>
           Specifies the load value for the fixed_load command, defaults to 1.

       --port <portnumber>
           Specifies the port number that slchoosed uses.

       --similar
           Specifies only machines with the same OS version as the current
           host should be returned for the best, best_or_none, hostnames,
           idle_host_names, and jobs commands.

       --version
           Displays program version and exits.
