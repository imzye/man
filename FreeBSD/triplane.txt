TRIPLANE(6)                  FreeBSD Games Manual                  TRIPLANE(6)

NAME
       Triplane - a side-scrolling dogfighting game.

SYNOPSIS
       triplane [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Triplane Classic is a side-scrolling dogfighting game featuring solo
       missions and multiplayer mode with up to four players. It is a port of
       the original Triplane Turmoil game for DOS and aims to match the
       original game exactly so that high scores remain comparable to the
       original.

OPTIONS
       -fullscreen
              Start the game in fullscreen mode (this is the default).

       -nofullscreen
              Start the game in windowed mode.

       -nosound
              Start the game without sounds.  Note: This option also disables
              sounds in the configuration file so sounds will be disabled also
              the next time you start triplane.  To enable sounds set Physical
              Examination->Hearing->Sounds on in the game menus.

       -2, -3, -4
              Scale the 320x200-pixel game window 2x, 3x or 4x using software
              scaling.  This helps you play Triplane on displays that cannot
              switch to such low resolutions.

       -2svga Scale the 800x600-pixel window 2x using software scaling, to
              produce a 1600x1200-pixel window.  This resolution is used only
              in multiplayer mode.

       Note that triplane does not warn about unknown options.

GETTING STARTED
       After starting the game, click through the splash screens to see the
       main menu.  Then click ROSTER and click the pen on the right to create
       a new pilot entry.  Type your name and press enter.  Click the keys on
       the left to get back to main menu.  Click ASSIGN PILOTS and check the
       SOLO check box beside the red plane (top left) to select the German
       plane for solo game.  Click on the background to get back to the main
       menu.

       Click TAKEOFF TIMES and MISSION I.  Read your assignment carefully and
       click on the arrows to look around the map.  Your objective is to
       destroy the buildings identified by red boxes around them.  When you
       are ready click FLY and use the following controls:

       • press S (roll) to get out of hangar

       • hold TAB (power) down to accelerate

       • use X and W to steer the plane

       • use 1 to drop a bomb

       • use S to roll the plane upside down

       When you have destroyed all the targets try to land by releasing power
       and gliding to the runway.  Holding up and down simultaneously
       activates the air brake system.  When the plane is stopped on the
       runway, press S to re-enter the hangar and resupply bombs and fuel.

       N.B.: If you have a new computer you may encounter serious keyboard
       errors.  This is due to the cost savings of the keyboard manufacturers.
       The current keyboards cannot handle more than 3-6 keys simultaneously.
       If you encounter keyboard problems, see the "on/off power" option
       below.


SOLO GAME MODE
       See the "ASSIGN PLAYERS MENU" chapter on how to select the solo game
       country.

       Winning a solo game requires that:

       • all mission targets have been destroyed

       • all protection objectives are met

       • all enemy airplanes are destroyed, and

       • at least one plane is left and stopped on a runway.

       Scoring is mostly based on how many planes you have shot down.  Extra
       points are awarded from destroyed enemy ground installations and
       infantry without regard to who destroyed them.  You will get penalty
       points for shooting down allied planes and for destroyed allied ground
       targets and infantry.


MULTIPLAYER MODE
       See the "ASSIGN PLAYERS MENU" chapter on how to select players for
       multiplayer mode and visit the "REQUEST TRANSFER" menu to select the
       multiplayer level.

       To configure plane controls for multiplayer mode, visit the "PLANE
       MECHANICS" menu.  Choose a country and then configure either the
       keyboard or a joystick (a game pad is also OK).

       If you want to change the keyboard layout for the chosen country, click
       the keyboard and you will be prompted to press buttons for all six
       controls needed to fly.  The order is Up, Down, Roll, Engine power,
       Bombs and Guns.  Remember that brake is always Up+Down simultaneously.

       Joystick configuration is still a bit experimental and it is not easy
       to play the game with a joystick.  Start by clicking Joystick 1 or
       Joystick 2 and follow the on-screen instructions.  There are two types
       of joystick actions.  You can hold down a joystick button and press
       Space on the keyboard.  Alternatively you can move a joystick to a
       different position (left, right, up or down) and press Space.  Finally,
       by pressing "D" you can disable a control completely.  You can use this
       for example if you have configured up and down actions to be buttons so
       that you can hold them together and thus do not need a separate brake
       control.  Disabling the roll control enables autoroll, which keeps the
       plane upright.


HANGAR MENU
       This is a special menu.  This appears when the actual game is in
       progress.  There are three columns: Bombs, ammo and fuel.  Use the Bomb
       and Guns buttons to select one of the columns, and adjust the value
       using the Up and Down buttons.  Press Roll or Power to exit, and a
       mechanic will push your plane onto the runway.  If you want to return
       to the hangar, just press Roll or Bomb, and the mechanic will push your
       plane into the hangar.


ASSIGN PLAYERS MENU
       This menu is used to select players for solo and multiplayer modes.
       There are four boxes, one for each country.

       Inside each box there are four radio buttons and two text fields:


       first radio button (red circle)
           This country is disabled.

       second radio button (SOLO)
           This country is used to play a solo mission.  Other countries are
           automatically disabled.  Remember to set pilot name in the text box
           to the right of this radio button.

       third radio button (computer)
           This country is played by a computer pilot in multiplayer mode.
           The text box to the right is not implemented.

       fourth radio button (human)
           This country is played by a human pilot in multiplayer game.
           Remember to set pilot name in the first text box.

       If you activate the solo mode the computer will automatically adjust
       the other countries to NO-PLAYER mode.  (If you want to play the solo
       missions, now just exit and click the take-off times flyer in the main
       menu.) For example, assume that you want to be the German player, your
       friend wants to be the Japanese player and computer wants(?) to be the
       Finnish player.  Choose "Human pilot" in the German and Japanese boxes,
       "No player" in the English box, and "Computer pilot" in the Finnish
       box.

       Note: If you select the last multiplayer level (CAVERN) and you set the
       computer to be the Finnish or the English plane, these planes will be
       disabled when game begins.  (Computers cannot handle takeoffs in
       caves.)


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION MENU
       This is the options menu, where you can define game-related parameters.
       On the right side you can see four tabs:

       VISION


       Shots visible?
              If deactivated, no flying ammunition will be seen (planes &
              infantry).


       AAA shots visible?
              If deactivated, no ammunition of flak battery will be seen.


       AA-Mg shots visible?
              If deactivated, no ammunition of ground machine gun will be
              seen.


       Flags? If deactivated, all flags will disappear.


       Structure flames?
              If deactivated, the bombed structures will not burn.


       Use 800*600 window (in MULTIPLAYER)?
              Activate this option to play multiplayer games in a 800*600
              window.


       HEARING


       Sounds on?
              Activate this to enable or disable all sound.  Note that the
              -nosound command line option turns this off.


       Musics on?
              Play music in the menus, if the "Sounds on?" option is also
              activated.


       SFX on?
              Enable various sound effects in the game, if the "Sounds on?"
              option is also activated.


       Explosion sounds?
              If deactivated, a sound will be not heard when a bomb collides
              with ground.


       Gunfire sounds?
              If deactivated, a sound will be not heard when a plane fires its
              guns.


       AAA fire sounds?
              If deactivated, a sound will be not heard when ground defenses
              fire (machine guns & flaks).


       Water splash sound?
              If deactivated, a sound will be not heard when a bomb collides
              with water.


       Infantry death sounds?
              If deactivated, infantry soldiers will not scream when they die.


       Do you want on/off power?
              When activated, the behavior of the engine power button will be
              dramatically changed.  On/off power allows toggling the engine
              on or off by pressing the Power button, instead of having to
              hold it down.  Use this option if you encounter keyboard
              problems, because this decreases the number of keys pressed down
              simultaneously.


       Do you want a reversed power switch?
              Turns the behavior of the engine power button upside-down: when
              you are not holding the power key down, the plane accelerates.
              When held down, the engine will be deactivated.  This is not the
              same as braking, you still need to use Up+Down to brake.


       The following options are for multiplayer only.


       Are all the planes the same?
              Sets all planes' attributes to a specific country.  For example:
              Choose the German plane on the left, and every plane has 4 bombs
              etc.  This affects all plane abilities.


       Collisions on?
              If active, a collision of two planes results in an immediate
              destruction of both planes.  Both players lose one point in
              collision.


       Flying parts?
              If enabled the parts which appear when a plane crashes cause
              damage to other planes.


       Battle ends after n points
              End the game after one of the players has this number of points.
              The number can be increased by pressing it with the left mouse
              button and decreased with the right mouse button.  UnLtd means
              unlimited, where the multiplayer game will not end before you
              press Esc.


       Alliances enabled?
              Enables alliances.  The sides are selected at the box in the
              lower left corner.


       AA-MGs?
              If deactivated, all ground machine gun batteries will disappear.


       AAAs?  If deactivated, all flak batteries will disappear.


       Infantry?
              If deactivated, all infantry will disappear.


       Unlimited ammo?
              If activated, you can shoot even when you have no gun rounds
              left, but you cannot adjust your ammo load.


       Unlimited fuel?
              If activated, the plane will still fly even when you have run
              out of fuel, but you always have to take the full load of fuel
              when leaving the hangar.

       The German plane is very deadly in dogfight because it is designed for
       it.  It does not have any particular strengths or weaknesses.

       The Finnish plane is the fastest and the toughest but it has a poor
       bomb capacity and great skill is needed to pilot it because of its low
       turning rate.

       The English plane never runs out of anything (except bombs).  Its only
       disadvantage is the low maneuverability.

       The Japanese plane has the biggest bomb capacity and it is even more
       agile than the German plane.  Too bad it always runs out of fuel.


MEDALS, RIBBONS AND RANKS
       Like in a real Air Force, you will be awarded with higher ranks and
       medals when you have served your country well.  The medals are shown on
       top of your pilot in the roster menu.  Every rank has its own ribbon
       which is located beside your pilot in the roster menu.  When you start
       a new pilot you have no medals and you have only one ribbon, 2nd
       Lieutenant.  When you advance ranks you do not lose your previous
       ribbons like you would in real life.

       Best pilot in the country - Medals

       When you complete a sequence of solo missions (six of them) you will be
       awarded the "Best pilot in the country" medal.  Every country has its
       unique medal, but the main color of the medal depends on the country so
       it will be very easy to see which country has awarded you with it.

       Special medals

       There are two special medals.  The first is the veteran medal, Golden
       Star.  It will be awarded to you when you have flown 1000 missions.
       The second is the hero medal, Silver Eagle.  It will be awarded to the
       pilot who has killed the most and died the least.  There is only one
       Silver Eagle medal in the world, so be careful, it will change its
       owner very quickly.

       Ranks and their abbreviations

       Here is a list of ranks appearing in Triplane.  In the roster an
       abbreviation of the rank will be automatically added to your name (for
       example: 2nd Lt. Dragst).  Both solo and multiplayer games will affect
       it so you probably will not gain a lot of promotions by just playing
       one of them.

       The ranks are:


       Second Lieutenant (2nd Lt.)
              A simple blue ribbon with one golden column


       First Lieutenant (1st Lt.)
              A blue ribbon with 1 golden column and 2 stars


       Captain (Capt.)
              A blue ribbon with 2 golden columns and 2 stars


       Major (Major)
              A blue ribbon with 2 golden columns and 4 stars


       Lieutenant Colonel (Lt Col.)
              A blue ribbon with a Golden Shield of the Air Force


       Colonel (Colonel)
              A blue ribbon with a Golden Eagle of the Air Force


       If you are ever promoted to Colonel, you have probably played for some
       time.  But remember, it is not impossible to gain it, you just need
       play a little longer.


TIPS AND TRICKS
       • Remember that stalling is a VERY good way to brake fast, but do not
       even think about it unless you can handle the plane very well.

       • When flying the Finnish plane remember to deactivate the power when
       turning.

       • There are several Ace missions which are quite easy to complete, but
       great effort is needed for receiving a higher score.  Patriot Flight is
       a very good example of this, it is possible to get at least 169 points
       in it.

       • The Japanese plane can even outmaneuver the German plane, but only
       with an empty bomb load.  The German plane is still a bit better in
       dogfight.

       • Remember to use hit and run techniques when playing the Finnish
       plane.

       • There is no need to leave any bombs behind if you are playing with
       the Finnish plane, because it does not make any difference.

       • In the missions with a lots of enemy air activity, try protect your
       AAAs.

       • In solo missions you should learn to use the Radar markers, because
       that makes it easier to avoid enemy airplanes.

       • Avoid shooting too many bullets at the enemy plane, because it will
       probably explode.  In the solo game you cannot deactivate the part
       collision, so this is quite vital.

       • Remember that Japanese plane will always run out of fuel,
       particularly with six bombs.


FILES
       Triplane finds its configuration directory by searching the following
       directories in this order:

       • 1) $TRIPLANE_HOME

       • 2) $HOME/.triplane (created if missing)

       • 3) the current directory (if step 2 fails for some reason).

       The configuration directory contains the following files:

       • triplane.cfg
           Main configuration file.

       • roster.dta
           High score file.

       • keyset.dta
           Keyboard configuration file.


       Triplane tries to locate its data directory by looking at which of the
       following directories exist, in the following order:

       • 1) $TRIPLANE_DATA

       • 2) TRIPLANE_DATA set at compilation time (if step 2 fails)

       • 3) current directory.

       The data directory contains only one file:

       • fokker.dks
           Game data file containing levels, graphics and sounds.


HISTORY
       The original Triplane Turmoil was developed by Markku Rankala, Teemu J.
       Takanen and Henrikki Merikallio. Some work was also contributed by
       Risto Puhakka, Antti Lehtoranta and Mikko Kinnunen.

       The portable SDL version, Triplane Classic, was created from the
       original source by Timo Juhani Lindfors (timo.lindfors@iki.fi), Teemu
       J. Takanen (tjt@users.sourceforge.net), and Riku Saikkonen. We also
       thank Timo Lilja for his earlier Xlib porting efforts and Sami Liedes
       for spellchecking and optimization ideas.
