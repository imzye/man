NAME
       lm-solve - A Computerized Solver for Logic Mazes

VERSION
       version 0.14.2

SYNOPSIS
       lm-solve [options] Input File

DESCRIPTION
       This program is a front end for the LM-Solve Perl modules that can be
       used to solve any of the number of Logic Mazes present on the Logic
       Mazes site (http://www.logicmazes.com/) and similar sites.

       To use this program you should create a text file describing the layout
       of the game and your current position (most probably the initial one).
       Then invoke lm-solve with its path as input. Alternatively, by
       specifiying - as the filename, then lm-solve will read the layout from
       the standard input.

       One can find an archive containing some written-down layouts for some
       of the puzzles on the web on the LM-Solve homepage. The format of the
       layouts for the various puzzle types is described below.

OPTIONS
       --help -h -?
               Display a help message on the screen.

       --man   Invoke the UNIX man command to display the man-page of this
               program.

       -g variant | --game variant
               Specify the variant to use for the game. Currently available
               variants are:

               alice - Alice Mazes

               minotaur - Theseus and the Minotaur Mazes

               numbers - Number Mazes

               plank - Planks in the Swamp Puzzles

               tilt_single - Tilt Mazes with one goal

               tilt_multi - Tilt Mazes with multiple goals

               tilt_rb - A Red-Blue Tilt Puzzle

       --rle --norle
               This options toggle run-length encoding of the moves displayed
               on and off.  What it means is that several identical
               consecutive moves will be displayed as "move * number".

               The default is --rle.

       --output-states --nooutput-states
               --output-states will precede each line with the state of the
               game up to the move displayed on it. The default is
               --nooutput-states

       --method scan
               Specifies the scan to use for solving the game:

               brfs - Breadth-First Search. Finds minimal solutions, but
               possibly slower than other scans.

               dfs - Depth-First Search.

       --rtd --nortd
               --rtd stands for "Run-Time Display". This option will print the
               states of the scan that were arrived to, as the scan encounters
               them. The default is --nortd.

Generic Board Format
       The format of the board is that of a file containing keys and values on
       each line, in the format "key=value". A value can be an integer (e.g:
       "x=6"), an (x,y) integral pair (e.g: "dims=(3,6)"), an array of pairs
       (e.g: "goals="[(5,6), (3,8), (0, 3)]"), an array of start and end pairs
       (e.g: "Planks = [ ((0,2) -> (3,2)) , ((6,5) -> (7,5)) ]") or a layout
       specification. The latter begins with "<<EOF" where EOF is a terminator
       and extends from the next line down to the first line containing the
       terminator.

       Whitespace and newlines are generally ignored and the keys are case-
       insensitive.

Alice Mazes Board Format
       Dims is an (x,y) value that specifies the dimensions of the board.
       layout is the layout of the board. The cells are specified row by row,
       from top to bottom and from left to right. Newlines and whitespace
       between each cell are ignored as well as lines beginning with a sharp-
       sign ("#").

       Each cell is surrounded by square brackets and contains several flags
       separated by commas. The flags are:

       N,S,E,W Specifies North, South, East and West arrows respectively.

       NE,NW,SE,SW
               Likewise for North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West

       ADD     Specifies that this cell increases the step by 1.

       SUB     Specifies that this cell decreases the step by 1.

       GOAL    The goal cell.

       START   The start cell.

       BLANK   A blank cell that may not be stepped on.

       Examples can be found in the layouts archive.

Theseus and the Minotaur Mazes Board Format
       The keys and values required for this format are:

       Dims    An (x,y) pair that specifies the (x,y) dimensions of the board.

       Exit    An (x,y) pair that specifies the (x,y) coordinates of the exit.
               (starting at (0,0) for the top-left corner.)

       Thes    (x,y) - The initial coordinates of Theseus.

       Mino    (x,y) - The initial coordinates of the Minotaur.

       layout  This is a layout in the following format: The first line
               contains width characters that are either whitespace (" ") or a
               "-" or a "_" depending if there is a horizontal wall at that
               position. The second line contains width+1 characters that are
               either whitespace or a "|" sign depending if there is a
               vertical wall at that position.

               The horizontal-walls and vertical-wall lines intermingle this
               way until the bottom line which specifies horizontal walls.

       Examples can be found in the layouts archive.

Number Mazes Board Format
       Dims is an (x,y) key that specifies the dimensions of the board. Start
       is an (x,y) key that specifies the starting position (starting from
       (0,0) at the top-left corner). The key layout is a layout key that
       contains the layout of the board.

       The layout contains a line for every row, and every cell is represented
       as a character. It contains a digit for its number or an asterisk ("*")
       if it is the goal cell.

       Examples can be found in the layouts archive.

Single Goal Tilt Mazes
       Dims is an (x,y) key that speciifes the dimensions of the board. Start
       is an (x,y) pair that specifies the coordinates of the start (starting
       from 0). Goal is an (x,y) pair that determines the location of the
       single goal.

       layout contains a scheme of horizontal and vertical walls similar to
       the Minotaur's mazes.

Multiple Goals Tilt Mazes
       Dims is an (x,y) key that speciifes the dimensions of the board. Start
       is an (x,y) pair that specifies the coordinates of the start (starting
       from 0). Goals is an (x,y) array that determines the locations of the
       goals.

       layout contains a scheme of horizontal and vertical walls similar to
       the Minotaur's mazes.

Red-Blue Tilt Puzzles
       Dims is an (x,y) key that specifies the dimensions of the board.
       Blue_Start and Red_Start are two (x,y) keys which specify the starting
       positiones of the red and blue markers. Red_Goal and Blue_Goal are
       their respective goals.

       layout contains a scheme of horizontal and vertical walls similar to
       the Minotaur's mazes.

Planks in the Swamp Puzzles
       Dims is an (x,y) key that specifies the dimensions of the board. Planks
       is an array of start and end pairs specifying the start and end
       coordinates of the planks. layout is a layout that matches the size
       specified by Dims that has an X where a stump is present, G where the
       goal is and any other character (preferably a whitespace) where nothing
       is present.

       The first plank in "Planks" is the active plank.
