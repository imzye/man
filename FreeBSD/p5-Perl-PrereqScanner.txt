NAME
       Perl::PrereqScanner::App - scan your working dir for likely prereqs

VERSION
       version 1.023

SYNOPSIS
           scan-perl-prereqs [--by-file] [--pretty] [DIRS | FILES]

       Directories are traversed with File::Find to collect all ".pl", ".pm",
       ".psgi" and ".t" files. If no directories or files are specified, the
       current working directory is scanned.

       The default is to print a single combined list suitable for piping to
       "cpanm" or similar tools.

       The "--by-file" switch will print results grouped by the files in which
       they were found.

       The "--pretty" swith will print results in a more human-friendly
       format, with names and versions vertically aligned.
