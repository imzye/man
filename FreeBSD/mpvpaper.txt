NAME
       mpvpaper - video wallpaper player using mpv for wlroots

SYNOPSIS
       mpvpaper [options] <output> <url|path filename>


DESCRIPTION
       mpvpaper is a wallpaper program for wlroots based Wayland compositors,
       such as Sway.  That allows you to play videos with mpv as your
       wallpaper.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays usage options

       -d, --help-output
              Displays all available outputs and quits

       -v, --verbose
              Be more verbose  (-vv for higher verbosity)

       -f, --fork
              Forks mpvpaper so you can close the terminal

       -p, --auto-pause
              Automagically pause mpv when the wallpaper is hidden*

              This saves CPU usage, more or less, seamlessly

       -s, --auto-stop
              Automagically stop mpv when the wallpaper is hidden*

              This saves CPU/RAM usage, although more abruptly

       -n, --slideshow <seconds>
              Slideshow mode plays the next video in a playlist every
              <seconds>

              And passes mpv options "loop loop-playlist" for convenience

       -l, --layer <layer>
              Specifies shell surface <layer> to run on (background by
              default)

       -o, --mpv-options <"options">
              Forwards mpv <"options">

              Must be within quotes if multiple options are passed


EXAMPLES
       Simple example:
              mpvpaper DP-2 /path/to/video

       You can select the output with either a connection or identifier names:
              mpvpaper 'DP-2 DP-1 HDMI-A-1' /path/to/video
              mpvpaper 'Acer Technologies Acer H236HL LX1AA12341234'
              /path/to/video

       To play the same video on all outputs:
              mpvpaper ALL /path/to/video

       Forward mpv options by passing "--mpv-options" or "-o" like so:
              mpvpaper -o "no-audio --loop-playlist shuffle" HDMI-A-1
              www.url/to/playlist

       You can also control mpvpaper just like mpv in the terminal with
       keyboard bindings.  But if you would like to control mpvpaper while
       it´s forked, you could use a mpv input-ipc-server like this:
              mpvpaper -o "input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpv-socket-DP-1" DP-1
              /path/to/video

       Then input commands with socat. For example, toggle pause:
              echo 'cycle pause' | socat - /tmp/mpv-socket-DP-1

       For more mpv commands read:

FILES
       These files(watch lists) contain lists of program names that, if found
       running with pidof, will cause mpvpaper to pause/stop and must be
       created manually**

              ~/.config/mpvpaper/pauselist
                     List of program names that will cause mpvpaper to pause

              ~/.config/mpvpaper/stoplist
                     List of program names that will cause mpvpaper to stop

       Add programs that can be found with the pidof command into the list and
       separate by spaces or newlines.
       For example: "firefox steam obs" or:
               "firefox
                steam
                obs"


NOTES
       *Limitations of automagic:

              mpvpaper manipulates a feature of Wayland called a "surface
              frame callback"

              This feature of Wayland allows mpvpaper to draw/render only when
              it makes sense to do so.  And one reason mpvpaper might not
              draw/render is if it´s "hidden".  This is the magic behind the
              automagic pause/stop options.

              Whatever "hidden" means is up to compositor. As for Sway,
              "hidden" is if there is a fullscreen window in the way of the
              wallpaper. mpvpaper will still draw/render even if there is a
              normal window blocking the wallpaper view entirely.

              This feature is at best a hack that works on some compositors.
              Usability of these auto options will vary and may not work as
              intended or at all.  In such a case, other features like the
              "watch lists" mentioned above should be used instead.


       **More on lists:
              • mpvpaper will automatically resume only after all the programs
              in the watch lists are no longer running

              • If there are programs running from both lists, stopping will
              always win out

              • Programs added into a list at runtime will be ignored, unless
              restarted or "stopped"

       Extra notes:
              • When mpvpaper is resuming after "stopping", mpvpaper should
              begin where it left off.  Both in terms of time position and
              playlist position(if not shuffled)

              • There is a small time delay(1-2 secs.) with the automagic
              options as it uses time to calculate when to act

              • mpv user configs are loaded by default
