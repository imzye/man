NAME
         trayer-srg - a lightweight GTK2-based systray for UNIX desktop

SYNOPSYS
       trayer [ OPTIONS ]

DESCRIPTION
       trayer is small program designed to provide systray functionality
       present in GNOME/KDE desktop enviroments for window managers which
       doesn't support that function. It's similar to other applications such
       as 'peksystray' and 'docker'.

       trayer code was extracted from fbpanel application, you can find more
       about it on it's homepage: http://fbpanel.sourceforge.net/

       You can find new versions of trayer and support on FVWM-Crystal project
       homepage: http://fvwm-crystal.berlios.de/

       trayer-srg was forked from trayer in january 2010 to add some fancy
       features and clean up code.  It contains all changes from above
       versions as far as known.  Code of trayer-srg can be found on github:
       http://github.com/sargon/trayer-srg
