DESCRIPTION
       neomagic is an Xorg driver for the Neomagic graphics chipsets found in
       many laptop computers.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       neomagic supports the following chipsets:

       MagicGraph 128    (NM2070)

       MagicGraph 128V   (NM2090)

       MagicGraph 128ZV  (NM2093)

       MagicGraph 128ZV+ (NM2097)

       MagicGraph 128XD  (NM2160)

       MagicGraph 256AV  (NM2200)

       MagicGraph 256AV+ (NM2230)

       MagicGraph 256ZX  (NM2360)

       MagicGraph 256XL+ (NM2380)

       The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24 for all chipsets except the
       NM2070 which does not support depth 24.  All depths are accelerated
       except for depth 24 which is only accelerated on NM2200 and newer
       models.  All visuals are supported in depth 8.  TrueColor and
       DirectColor visuals are supported in the other depths.


CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported

       Option "NoAccel" "boolean"
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
              enabled.

       Option "SWCursor" "boolean"
              Disable or enable software cursor.  Default: software cursor is
              disable and a hardware cursor is used.

       Option "PCIBurst" "boolean"
              Disable or enable PCI burst modes.  Default: enabled.

       Option "Rotate" "CW"

       Option "Rotate" "CCW"
              Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.  This mode is
              unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation.

       Option "ShadowFB" "boolean"
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
              off.

       Option "OverlayMem" "integer"
              Reserve the given amount of memory (in bytes) for the XVideo
              overlay.  On boards with limited memory, display of large XVideo
              buffers might fail due to insufficient available memory.  Using
              this option solves the problem at the expense of reducing the
              memory available for other operations.  For full-resolution
              DVDs, 829440 bytes (720x576x2) are necessary.

       Note
       On some laptops using the 2160 chipset (MagicGraph 128XD) the following
       options are needed to avoid a lock-up of the graphic engine:
           Option "XaaNoScanlineImageWriteRect"
           Option "XaaNoScanlineCPUToScreenColorExpandFill"
