NAME
       Test::Unit - the PerlUnit testing framework

SYNOPSIS
       This package provides only the project version number, copyright texts,
       and a framework overview in POD format.

DESCRIPTION
       This framework is intended to support unit testing in an object-
       oriented development paradigm (with support for inheritance of tests
       etc.) and is derived from the JUnit testing framework for Java by Kent
       Beck and Erich Gamma.  To start learning how to use this framework, see
       Test::Unit::TestCase and Test::Unit::TestSuite.  (There will also
       eventually be a tutorial in Test::Unit::Tutorial.

       However "Test::Unit::Procedural" is the procedural style interface to a
       sophisticated unit testing framework for Perl that .  Test::Unit is
       intended to provide a simpler interface to the framework that is more
       suitable for use in a scripting style environment.  Therefore,
       Test::Unit does not provide much support for an object-oriented
       approach to unit testing.

FEEDBACK
       The Perl Unit development team are humans. In part we develop stuff
       because it scratches our collective itch but we'd also really like to
       know if it scratches yours.

       Please subscribe to the perlunit-users mailing list at
       <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/perlunit-users> and let us
       know what you love and hate about PerlUnit and what else you want to do
       with it.
