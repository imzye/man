UMCS(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                UMCS(4)

NAME
     umcs – USB support for serial adapters based on the MCS7820 and MCS7840
     chips

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device umcs

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           umcs_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The umcs driver provides support for various multiport serial adapters
     based on the MosCom MCS7820 and MCS7840 chips.  They are 2- or 4-port
     adapters with full-featured 16550-compatible UARTs and very flexible baud
     generators.  Also, these chips support RS422/RS485 and IrDA operations.

     The device is accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
     like a tty(4).

     Different ports on device are presented as sub-units, like /dev/ttyU0.1
     and /dev/ttyU0.2.

HARDWARE
     The umcs driver was tested on the following adapters:

     •   ST Lab U-360 two-port serial USB adapter
     •   ST Lab U-400 four-port serial USB adapter

FILES
     /dev/ttyU*.*       for callin ports
     /dev/ttyU*.*.init
     /dev/ttyU*.*.lock  corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state
                        devices

     /dev/cuaU*.*       for callout ports
     /dev/cuaU*.*.init
     /dev/cuaU*.*.lock  corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state
                        devices

SEE ALSO
     tty(4), ucom(4), usb(4)

HISTORY
     The umcs driver appeared in ports since December of 2010.

AUTHORS
     The umcs driver was written by Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS
     This driver doesn't support access to any fine tunes of chip, like
     RS522/RS485 mode, non-standard baudrates, etc.
