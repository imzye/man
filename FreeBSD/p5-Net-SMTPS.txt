       Net::SMTP. You may use all the friendly options that came bundled with
       Net::SMTP.  You can control the SSL usage with the options of new()
       constructor method.  'doSSL' option is the switch, and, If you would
       like to control detailed SSL settings, you can set SSL_* options that
       are brought from IO::Socket::SSL. Please see the document of
       IO::Socket::SSL about these options detail.

       Just one method difference from the Net::SMTP, you may select SMTP AUTH
       mechanism as the third option of auth() method.
