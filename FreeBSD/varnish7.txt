VARNISHADM(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          VARNISHADM(1)

NAME
       varnishadm - Control a running Varnish instance

SYNOPSIS
       varnishadm [-h] [-n workdir] [-p] [-S secretfile] [-T [address]:port]
       [-t timeout] [command [...]]

DESCRIPTION
       The varnishadm utility establishes a CLI connection to varnishd either
       using -n workdir or using the -T and -S arguments. If -n workdir is
       given, the location of the secret file and the address:port are looked
       up in shared memory. If neither is given, varnishadm uses the -n
       defaults documented for varnishd(1).

       If a command is given, the command and arguments are sent over the CLI
       connection and the result returned on stdout.

       If no command argument is given varnishadm will pass commands and
       replies between the CLI socket and stdin/stdout.

OPTIONS

       -h     Print program usage and exit.

       -n_workdir
              Specify the varnish working directory of the instance to attach
              to. See varnishd(1) -n option documentation for additional
              information and defaults.

       -p     Force pass mode and make the output follow the VCLI protocol.
              This disables command-history/command-completion and makes it
              easier for programs to parse the response(s).

       -S_secretfile
              Specify the authentication secret file. This should be the same
              -S argument as was given to varnishd. Only processes which can
              read the contents of this file, will be able to authenticate the
              CLI connection.

       -T_<address:port>
              Connect to the management interface at the specified address and
              port.

       -t_timeout
              Wait no longer than this many seconds for an operation to
              finish.

       The syntax and operation of the actual CLI interface is described in
       the varnish-cli(7) manual page. Parameters are described in varnishd(1)
       manual page.

       Additionally, a summary of commands can be obtained by issuing the help
       command, and a summary of parameters can be obtained by issuing the
       param.show command.

EXIT STATUS
       If a command is given, the exit status of the varnishadm utility is
       zero if the command succeeded, and non-zero otherwise.

EXAMPLES
       Some ways you can use varnishadm:

          varnishadm -T localhost:999 -S /var/db/secret vcl.use foo
          echo vcl.use foo | varnishadm -T localhost:999 -S /var/db/secret
          echo vcl.use foo | ssh vhost varnishadm -T localhost:999 -S /var/db/secret
