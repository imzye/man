UUIDGEN(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             UUIDGEN(1)

NAME
     uuidgen – generate universally unique identifiers

SYNOPSIS
     uuidgen [-1] [-n count] [-o filename]

DESCRIPTION
     The uuidgen utility by default generates a single DCE version 1
     universally unique identifier (UUID), also known as a globally unique
     identifier (GUID).  The UUID is written to stdout by default.  The
     following options can be used to change the behaviour of uuidgen:

     -1      This option only has effect if multiple identifiers are to be
             generated and instructs uuidgen to not generate them in batch,
             but one at a time.

     -n      This option controls the number of identifiers generated.  By
             default, multiple identifiers are generated in batch.  The upper
             hard limit is 2048 (see uuidgen(2)).

     -o      Redirect output to filename instead of stdout.

     Batched generation yields a dense set of identifiers in such a way that
     there is no identifier that is larger than the smallest identifier in the
     set and smaller than the largest identifier in the set and that is not
     already in the set.

     When generating the identifiers one at a time, the identifiers will be
     close to each other, but operating system latency and processing time
     will be reflected in the distance between two successive identifiers.

EXIT STATUS
     The uuidgen utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
