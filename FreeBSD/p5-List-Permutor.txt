NAME
       List::Permutor - Process all possible permutations of a list

SYNOPSIS
         use List::Permutor;
         my $perm = new List::Permutor qw/ fred barney betty /;
         while (my @set = $perm->next) {
             print "One order is @set.\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Make the object by passing a list of the objects to be permuted. Each
       time that next() is called, another permutation will be returned. When
       there are no more, it returns the empty list.

METHODS
       new LIST
           Returns a permutor for the given items.

       next
           Returns a list of the items in the next permutation. Permutations
           are returned "in order". That is, the permutations of (1..5) will
           be sorted numerically: The first is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and the last is
           (5, 4, 3, 2, 1).

       peek
           Returns the list of items which would be returned by next(), but
           doesn't advance the sequence. Could be useful if you wished to skip
           over just a few unwanted permutations.

       reset
           Resets the iterator to the start. May be used at any time, whether
           the entire set has been produced or not. Has no useful return
           value.
