NAME
       Type::Nano - simple type constraint library for testing

SYNOPSIS
         use Type::Nano qw(Int);

         Int->check("42");  # true

RATIONALE
       This is a really basic implementation of Type::API::Constraint for
       testing modules that make use of type constraints, such as Type::Tie.

       I'll stress that this module is only intended for use in testing. It
       was created to eliminate Type::Tie's testing dependency on
       Types::Standard.  If your code supports Type::Nano, then your code
       should also automatically support Type::Tiny, Specio, MooseX::Types,
       and MouseX::Types with no extra effort. (Of course, some of those
       libraries do have some more features you may want to make extra effort
       to use! Inlining, for example.)

       Type::Nano is not recommended for use in regular application code.
       Type::Tiny while bigger than Type::Nano, will be much faster at
       runtime, and offers better integration with Moo, Moose, Mouse, and a
       wide variety of other tools. Use that instead.

       All that having been said, Type::Nano is compatible with: Type::Tie,
       Moo, Type::Tiny (e.g. you can use Type::Tiny's implementation of
       "ArrayRef" and Type::Nano's implementation of "Int", and combine them
       as "ArrayRef[Int]"), Class::XSConstructor, and Variable::Declaration.

DESCRIPTION
   Object-Oriented Interface
       Constructor

       "Type::Nano->new(%parameters)"
           The constructor supports named parameters called "name" (a string),
           "constraint" (a coderef expected to return a boolean), and "parent"
           (a blessed Type::Nano object). Any other parameters passed to the
           constructor will be stored in the blessed hashred returned, but are
           ignored by Type::Nano.

       Methods

       Types support the following methods:

       "$type->check($value)"
           Checks the value against the constraint; returns a boolean.

       "$type->get_message($failing_value)"
           Returns an error message. Does not check the value.

       Types overload "&{}" to do something like:

         $type->check($value) or croak($type->get_message($value))

   Exports
       This module optionally exports the following type constraints:

       •   Any

       •   Defined

       •   Undef

       •   Ref

       •   ArrayRef

       •   HashRef

       •   CodeRef

       •   Object

       •   Str

       •   Bool

       •   Num

       •   Int

       It also optionally exports the following functions for creating new
       type constraints:

       •   "type $name, $coderef" or "type $coderef"

       •   "class_type $class"

       •   "role_type $role"

       •   "duck_type $name, \@methods" or "duck_type \@methods"

       •   "enum $name, \@values" or "enum \@values"

       •   "union $name, \@types" or "union \@types"

       •   "intersection $name, \@types" or "intersection \@types"
