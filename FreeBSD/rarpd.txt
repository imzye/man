RARPD(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               RARPD(8)

NAME
     rarpd – reverse ARP daemon

SYNOPSIS
     rarpd -a [-dfsv] [-t directory] [-P pidfile]
     rarpd [-dfsv] [-t directory] [-P pidfile] interface

DESCRIPTION
     The rarpd utility services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected
     to interface.  Upon receiving a request, rarpd maps the target hardware
     address to an IP address via its name, which must be present in both the
     ethers(5) and hosts(5) databases.  If a host does not exist in both
     databases, the translation cannot proceed and a reply will not be sent.

     By default, a request is honored only if the server (i.e., the host that
     rarpd is running on) can "boot" the target; that is, a file or directory
     matching the glob /tftpboot/ipaddr* exists, where ipaddr is the target IP
     address in hex.  For example, the IP address 204.216.27.18 will be
     replied to if any of /tftpboot/CCD81B12, /tftpboot/CCD81B12.SUN3, or
     /tftpboot/CCD81B12-boot exist.  This requirement can be overridden with
     the -s flag (see below).

     In normal operation, rarpd forks a copy of itself and runs in the
     background.  Anomalies and errors are reported via syslog(3).

     The following options are available:

     -a      Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.  If -a is
             omitted, an interface must be specified.

     -d      If -f is also specified, rarpd logs messages to stdout and stderr
             instead of via syslog(3).

     -f      Run in the foreground.

     -P      Specify the pathname of the PID file.  If not specified,
             /var/run/rarpd.pid or /var/run/rarpd.ifname.pid will be used
             depending on the -a flag or the specified interface name.

     -s      Supply a response to any RARP request for which an ethernet to IP
             address mapping exists; do not depend on the existence of
             /tftpboot/ipaddr*.

     -t      Supply an alternate tftp root directory to /tftpboot, similar to
             the -s option of tftpd(8).  This permits rarpd to selectively
             respond to RARP requests, but use an alternate directory for IP
             checking.

     -v      Enable verbose syslogging.

BUGS
     The rarpd utility can depend on the DNS to resolve the name discovered
     from /etc/ethers.  If this name is not in the DNS but is in /etc/hosts,
     the DNS lookup can cause a delayed RARP response, so in this situation it
     is recommended to configure nsswitch.conf(5) to read /etc/hosts first.
