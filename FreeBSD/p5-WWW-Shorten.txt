NAME
       shorten - CLI program to demonstrate use of WWW::Shorten

SYNOPSIS
           # Default shortening service is Metamark
           $ shorten books.perl.org/book/171
           http://xrl.us/dv8

           # Change with an environment variable
           $ SHORTEN_SERVICE=TinyURL shorten books.perl.org/book/171
           http://tinyurl.com/ye7gjf4

           # Change with command line option
           $ shorten --service=TinyURL books.perl.org/book/171
           http://tinyurl.com/ye7gjf4

           # Change using config file
           $ cat ~/.shortenrc
           service = TinyURL
           $ shorten books.perl.org/book/171
           http://tinyurl.com/ye7gjf4

           # Lengthen a URL
           $ shorten -l http://tinyurl.com/ye7gjf4

CONFIGURATION
       The service used can be controlled in various ways. The program will
       use the first of the following values that it finds:

       •   The value of the "--service" command line option.

       •   The value of the "SHORTEN_SERVICE" environment variable.

       •   The value of the "service" option from the configuration file (see
           below).

       •   If none of the above options is found, the program defaults to
           using Metamark.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       As we use the "Config::Auto" module for configuration, shorten's fairly
       flexible when it comes to format.

       Configuration will be found in whichever of the following files comes
       first.

           shortenconfig
           ~/shortenconfig
           /etc/shortenconfig
           shorten.config
           ~/shorten.config
           /etc/shorten.config
           shortenrc
           ~/shortenrc
           /etc/shortenrc
           .shortenrc
           ~/.shortenrc
           /etc/.shortenrc

       Generally, I use the format:

           service = MakeAShorterLink

       which is simple and works. "service" is the only configuration keyword
       at present. Its value should be a correctly capitalized service name as
       per WWW::Shorten's documentation.
