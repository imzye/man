SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hptnr_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The hptnr driver provides support for HighPoint's DC Series Data Center
     HBA card.

     •   HighPoint's DC7280 series
     •   HighPoint's Rocket R750 series

NOTES
     The hptnr driver only works on the i386 and amd64 platforms as it
     requires a binary blob object from the manufacturer which they only
     supply for these platforms.  The hptnr driver does not work on i386 with
