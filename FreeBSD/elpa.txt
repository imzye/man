elpa2_print_kernels(1)  FreeBSD General Commands Manual elpa2_print_kernels(1)

NAME
       elpa2_print_kernels - Provide information which ELPA2 kernels are
       available on this system.


SYNOPSIS
       elpa2_print_kernels


Description
       Provide information which ELPA2 kernels are available on this system.
       It is possible to configure ELPA2 such, that different compute
       intensive 'ELPA2 kernels' can be choosen at runtime. The service binary
       elpa2_print_kernels will query the library and tell whether ELPA2 has
       been configured in this way, and if this is the case which kernels can
       be choosen at runtime. It will furthermore detail whether ELPA has been
       configured with OpenMP support.

Options
       none
