MKNETID(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             MKNETID(8)

NAME
     mknetid – generate netid map data

SYNOPSIS
     mknetid [-q] [-g group_file] [-p passwd_file] [-h hosts_file]
             [-n netid_file] [-d domain]

DESCRIPTION
     The mknetid utility processes the contents of the group(5), passwd(5),
     hosts(5) and netid(5) files into the format used to generate the
     netid.byname NIS map.  This map is used to hold credential information
     for both users and hosts in an operating system independent format.

     The mknetid utility checks for duplicate occurrences of netids and
     filters them out.

     The mknetid utility prints its results on the standard output.  It is
     usually called only by /var/yp/Makefile when rebuilding the NIS maps.

OPTIONS
     The mknetid utility supports the following options:

     -q      Normally, mknetid prints a warning message when it encounters a
             duplicate netid.  This flag turns on 'quiet' mode, allowing the
             warnings to be suppressed.  Other error messages may still be
             generated.

     -g group_file
             Specify the location of the group information file.  The
             compiled-in default is /etc/group.

     -p passwd_file
             Specify the location of the passwd information file.  The
             compiled-in default is /etc/passwd.

     -h hosts_file
             Specify the location of the hosts database file.  The compiled-in
             default is /etc/hosts.

     -n netid_file
             Specify the location of the netid information file.  The
             compiled-in default is /etc/netid.  Note that no error is
             generated if the netid database cannot be found.  The netid
             database is not likely to be present on most systems until Secure
             RPC support is added to FreeBSD.

     -d domain
             By default, the mknetid utility uses the system domainname when
             generating netid records.  If the system domainname is not set,
             the domain must be specified on the command line with the -d
             flag.  If the domainname is set, the -d flag may be used to
             override it.

FILES
     /var/yp/Makefile  the Makefile that calls yp_mkdb and mknetid to build
                       the NIS databases
     /etc/group        the default group database file
     /etc/passwd       the default passwd database file
     /etc/hosts        the default hosts database file
     /etc/netid        the default netid database file
