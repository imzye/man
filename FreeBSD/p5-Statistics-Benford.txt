Statistics::Benford(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Statistics::Benford - calculate the deviation from Benford's Law

SYNOPSIS
           my $stats = Statistics::Benford->new;
           my $diff = $stats->diff(%freq);
           my %diff = $stats->diff(%freq);
           my $signif = $stats->signif(%freq);
           my %signif = $stats->signif(%freq);

DESCRIPTION
       The "Statistics::Benford" module calculates the deviation from
       Benford's law, also known as the first-digit law. The law states that
       for many sources of real-life data, the leading digit follows a
       logarithmic, not uniform, distribution. This fact can be used to audit
       data for signs of fraud by comparing the expected frequency of the
       digits to the actual frequency in the data.

METHODS
       $stats = Statistics::Benford->new
       $stats = Statistics::Benford->new($base, $pos, $len)
           Creates a new Statistics::Benford object. The constructor will
           accept the number base, the position of the significant digit in
           the number to examine, and the number of digits starting from that
           position.

           The default values are: (10, 0, 1).

       %dist = $stats->dist($bool)
       %dist = $stats->distribution($bool)
           Returns a hash of the expected percentages.

       $diff = $stats->diff(%freq)
       $diff = $stats->difference(%freq)
       %diff = $stats->diff(%freq);
       %diff = $stats->difference(%freq)
           Given a hash representing the frequency count of the digits in the
           data to examine, returns the percentage differences of each digit
           in list context, and the sum of the differences in scalar context.

       $diff = $stats->signif(%freq)
       $diff = $stats->z(%freq)
       %diff = $stats->signif(%freq);
       %diff = $stats->z(%freq)
           Given a hash representing the frequency count of the digits in the
           data to examine, returns the z-statistic of each digit in list
           context, and the average of the z-statistics for all the digits in
           scalar context.

           The z-statistic shows the statistical significance of the
           difference between the two proportions. Significance takes into
           account the size of the difference, the expected proportion, and
           the sample size.  Scores above 1.96 are significant at the 0.05
           level, and above 2.57 are significant at the 0.01 level.

EXAMPLE
           # Generate a list of numbers approximating a Benford distribution.
           my $max = 10;  # numbers range from 0 to 10
           my @nums = map { ($max / rand($max)) - 1 } (1 .. 1_000);
           my %freq;
           for my $num (@nums) {
               my ($digit) = $num =~ /([1-9])/;  # find first non-zero digit
               $freq{$digit}++;
           }
           my $stats = Statistics::Benford->new(10, 0, 1);
           my $diff = $stats->diff(%freq);
           my $signif = $stats->signif(%freq);

NOTES
       When counting the first digit, make sure it is non-zero. For example
       the first non-zero digit of 0.038 is 3.

       Convert non-decimal base digits to decimal representations. For
       example, to examine the first two digits of a hexadecimal number, like
       A1B2, take the first two digits 'A1', and convert them to decimal- 161.

       The law becomes less accurate when the data set is small.

       The law does not apply to data sets which have imposed limitations
       (e.g.  max or min values) or where the numbers are assigned (e.g. ids
       and phone numbers).

       The distribution becomes uniform at the 5th significant digit, i.e. all
       digits will have the same expected frequency.

       It can help to partition the data into subsets for testing, e.g.
       testing negative and positive values separately.
