DESCRIPTION
       kst is a graphical data plotting tool, which includes the ability to
       plot live data (contiuously update the plot as new data becomes
       available).

       kst may be run entirely from within its GUI, in which case no command
       line arguments are needed.  kst has a powerful wizard for easily
       setting up new plots.

       In the second invocation, kst loads pre-saved plot specifications from
       the file kstfile and optionally may override some of the settings in
       that file.

       In the third invocation, kst displays plots of the data as directed in
       the default manner.  Additional datasources may be specified on the
       command line with options for that datasource following it.  Command
       line options generally apply to all subsequent options unless later
       overridden.

OPTIONS
       -A     plot all curves in separate plots

       -a     average frames (simple mean) when plotting with -s.

       --A4   use A4 sized paper for printing.  Requires --print.

       -b     plot as bargraphs.

       -d     use points when plotting curves.

       -e FIELD
              use FIELD as the magnitude of error bars applied to the next
              plot.

       -F datasource
              override the datasource indicated in the kstfile and instead use
              datasource.

       -f STARTFRAME
              begin plotting at STARTFRAME frames into the data.  Set to -1 to
              start at NUMFRAMES from the end of the data.

       -h FIELD
              plot FIELD as a histogram.

       -l     use lines when plotting curves.

       --landscape
              use landscape orientation for printing.  Requires --print.
              --Letter use US Letter sized paper for printing.  Requires
              --print.

       -n NUMFRAMES
              plot at most NUMFRAMES frames of data.  Set to -1 to indicate
              all of the data.

       -P PLOTNAME
              plot all plots in the plot named PLOTNAME.

       -p FIELD
              plot FIELD as a power spectrum plot.

       --png filename
              render to a portable network graphics (png) image with file name
              filename and quit.

       --portrait
              use portrait orientation for printing.  Requires --print.

       --print filename
              print the plot to file filename and quit.

       -s FRAMESPERSAMPLE
              plot every FRAMESPERSAMPLE frames when plotting.

       -x FIELD
              use FIELD as the X-axis vector.

       -y FIELD
              plot FIELD as an XY plot.

       -z FIELD
              plot FIELD as an image.

EXAMPLES
       Plot all data in column 2 from data.dat.
              kst data.dat -y 2

       Same as above, except only read 20 lines, starting at line 10.
              kst data.dat -f 10 -n 20 -y 2

       also read col 1. One plot per curve.
              kst data.dat -f 10 -n 20 -y 1 -y 2

       Read col 1 from data2.dat and col 1 from data.dat
              kst data.dat -f 10 -n 20 -y 2 data2.dat -y 1

       Same as above, except read 40 lines starting at 30 in data2.dat
              kst data.dat -f 10 -n 20 -y 2 data2.dat -f 30 -n 40 -y 1

       Specify the X vector and error bars: Plot x = col 1 and Y = col 2 and
       error flags = col 3 from data.dat
              kst data.dat -x 1 -e 3 -y 2

       Get the X vector from data1.dat, and the Y vector from data2.dat.
              kst data1.dat -x 1 data2.dat -y 1

       Placement: Plot column 2 and column 3 in plot P1 and column 4 in plot
       P2
              kst data.dat -P P1 -y 2 -y 3 -P P2 -y 4

BUGS
       Please report bugs to either the kst mailing list at kst@kde.org or to
       the kde bugzilla under the kst product at http://bugs.kde.org/.  If you
       can run kst, you can easily report bugs by selecting Bug Report Wizard
       from the Help menu.
