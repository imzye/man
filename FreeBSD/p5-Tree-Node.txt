NAME
       Tree::Node - Memory-efficient tree nodes in Perl

SYNOPSIS
         use Tree::Node;

         $node = Tree::Node->new(2);

         $node->set_child(0, $left);
         $node->set_child(1, $right);

         while ($node->key_cmp($key) < 0) {
           $node = $node->get_child(0);
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a memory-efficient node type (for trees, skip
       lists and similar data structures) for Perl.

       You may ask "Why bother implementing an ordered structure such as a
       tree when Perl has hashes built-in?"  Since Perl is optimized for speed
       over memory usage, hashes (and lists) use a lot of memory.

       Using Devel::Size for a reference, a list with four elements
       (corresponding to a key, value, and two child node pointers) will use
       at least 120 bytes.  A hash with four key/value pairs will use at least
       228 bytes.  But an equivalent Tree::Node object will use at least 68
       bytes.  (However, see the "KNOWN ISSUES" section below for caveats
       regarding memory usage.)

       So the purpose of this package is to provide a simple low-level Node
       class which can be used as a base class to implement various kinds of
       tree structures.  Each node has a key/value pair and a variable number
       of "children" pointers.

       How nodes are organized or the algorithm used to organize them is for
       you to implement.

   Object Oritented Interface
       new
             $node = Tree::Node->new( $child_count );

           Creates a new node with $child_count children.  Only as much space
           as is needed is allocated, and the number of children cannot be
           expanded later on.

           $child_count cannot exceed "MAX_LEVEL".

       child_count
             $child_count = $node->child_count;

           Returns the number of childen allocated.

       set_key
             $node->set_key($key);

           Sets the key. Once it is set, it cannot be changed.

       force_set_key
             $node->force_set_key($key);

           Sets the key, irregardless of whether it is already set. (Note that
           many data structures assume that the key is never changed, so you
           should only use this for cases where it is safe to do so.)

       key
             $key = $node->key;

           Returns the node key.

       key_cmp
             if ($node->key_cmp($key) < 0) { ... }

           Compares the node key with a key using the Perl string comparison
           function "cmp".  Returns -1 if the node key is less than the
           argument, 0 if it is equal, and 1 if it is greater.

           If the key is undefined, then it will always return -1 (even if the
           argument is undefined).

           This method can be overriden if you need a different comparison
           routine.  To use numeric keys, for example:

             package Tree::Node::Numeric;

             use base 'Tree::Node';

             sub key_cmp {
               my $self = shift;
               my $key  = shift;
               return ($self->key <=> $key);
             }

           Warning: if you are also using the "Procedural Interface", then you
           should be aware that "p_key_cmp" will not be inherited.  Instead,
           you should use something like the following:

             {
               no warnings 'redefine';

               sub p_key_cmp {
                 my $ptr  = shift;
                 my $key  = shift;
                 return (p_key_key($ptr) <=> $key);
               }

               sub key_cmp {
                 my $self = shift;
                 my $key  = shift;
                 return (p_key_cmp($self->to_p_node), $key);
               }
             }

       set_value
             $node->set_value($value);

           Sets the value of the node.  The value can be changed.

       value
             $value = $node->value;

           Returns the value of the node.

       set_child
             $node->set_child($index, $child);

           Sets the child node.  $index must be between 0 and "child_count"-1.
           Dues when the $index is out of bounds.

       get_child
             $child = $node->get_child($index);

           Returns the child node.  Dies when the $index is out of bounds.

       get_child_or_undef
             $child = $node->get_child_or_undef($index);

           Like "get_child", but returns "undef" rather than dying when the
           $index is out of bounds.

       get_children
             @children = $node->get_children;

       add_children
             $node->add_children(@children)

           Increases the "child_count" and allocates space for the child nodes
           specified.  (The child nodes can be "undef".)

       add_children_left
           Same as "add_children", except that the new nodes are added to the
           beginning rather than end of the node list.

       MAX_LEVEL
             use Tree::Node ':utility';

             ...

             $max = MAX_LEVEL;

           Returns the maximum number of children. Defaults to the C constant
           "UCHAR_MAX", which is usually 255.

       _allocated
             $size = $node->_allocated;

           This is a utility routine which says how much space is allocated
           for a node.  It does not include the Perl overhead (see "KNOWN
           ISSUES" below).

       _allocated_by_child_count
             use Tree::Node ':utility';

             ...

             $size = _allocated_by_child_count( $child_count );

           This is a utility routine which returns the amount of space that
           would be allocated for a node with $child_count children.

       to_p_node
             $ptr = $node->to_p_node;

           This returns the pointer to the raw node data, which can be used in
           the "Procedural Interface".

           Warning: do not mix and match object-oriented and procedural
           interface calls when reading child nodes!  Child node pointers are
           stored in an incompatible format.

   Procedural Inferface
       The experimental procedural interface was added in version 0.06.  The
       advantage of this interface is that there is much less overhead than
       the object-oriented interface (16 bytes instead of 45 bytes).  A
       disadvantage is that the node cannot be simply subclassed to change the
       "p_key_cmp" function.

       To use the procedural interface, you must import the procedure names:

         use Tree::Node ':p_node';

       Aside from working with pointers rather than blessed objects, the
       procedures listed below are analagous to their object-oriented
       counterparts.

       However, you must manually call "p_destroy" when you are done with the
       node, since Perl will not automatically destroy it when done.

       p_new
             $ptr = p_new( $child_count );

       p_child_count
             $child_count = p_child_count( $ptr );

       p_set_child
             p_set_child( $mother_ptr, $index, $daughter_ptr );

       p_get_child
             $daughter_ptr = p_get_child( $mother_ptr, $index );

       p_get_child_or_null
             $daughter_ptr = p_get_child_or_null( $mother_ptr, $index );

       p_set_key
             p_set_key( $ptr, $key );

           See "to_p_node" for caveats about mixing interfaces.

       p_force_set_key
             p_force_set_key( $ptr, $key );

           See "to_p_node" for caveats about mixing interfaces.

       p_get_key
             $key = p_get_key( $ptr );

           See "to_p_node" for caveats about mixing interfaces.

       p_key_cmp
             if (p_key_cmp( $ptr, $key ) < 0) { ... }

           See "key_cmp" for caveats about mixing interfaces.

       p_set_value
             p_set_value( $ptr, $value );

       p_get_value
             $value = p_get_value( $ptr );

       p_allocated
             $size = p_allocated($ptr);

       p_destroy
             p_destroy($ptr);

           This unallocates the memory.  Perl will not call this
           automatically, so you must remember to manually destroy each
           pointer!

KNOWN ISSUES
       This module implements a Perl wrapper around a C struct, which for the
       object-oriented inferface involves a blessed reference to a pointer to
       the struct.  This overhead of about 45 bytes may make up for any memory
       savings that the C-based struct provided!

       So if you what you are doing is implementing a simple key/value lookup,
       then you may be better off sticking with hashes.  If what you are doing
       requires a special structure that cannot be satisfied with hashes (even
       sorted hashes), or requires a very large number of nodes, then this
       module may be useful to you.

       Another alternative is to use the "Procedural Interface".

       Packages such as Clone and Storable cannot properly handle Tree::Node
       objects.

       Devel::Size may not properly determine the size of a node. Use the
       "_allocated" method to determine how much space is allocated for the
       node in C.  This does not include the overhead for Perl to maintain a
       reference to the C struct.

SEE ALSO
       Tree::DAG_Node is written in pure Perl, but it offers a more flexible
       interface.
