NAME
     pam_rhosts – Rhosts PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_rhosts [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The rhosts authentication service module for PAM, pam_rhosts provides
     functionality for only one PAM category: authentication.  In terms of the
     module-type parameter, this is the “auth” feature.

   Rhosts Authentication Module
     The Rhosts authentication component (pam_sm_authenticate()), returns
     success if and only if the target user's UID is not 0 and the remote host
     and user are listed in /etc/hosts.equiv or in the target user's
     ~/.rhosts.

     The following options may be passed to the authentication module:

     debug           syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

     no_warn         suppress warning messages to the user.  These messages
                     include reasons why the user's authentication attempt was
                     declined.

     allow_root      do not automatically fail if the target user's UID is 0.
