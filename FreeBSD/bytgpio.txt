NAME
     bytgpio – Intel Bay Trail SoC GPIO controller

SYNOPSIS
     device gpio
     device bytgpio

DESCRIPTION
     The bytgpio is a driver for GPIO controller that can be found in Intel's
     Bay Trail SoC family.

     Bay Trail SoC has three banks of GPIO pins exposed to userland as
     /dev/gpiocN, where N is 0, 1, and 2. Pins in each bank are pre-named to
     match names on boards schematics: GPIO_S0_SCnn, GPIO_S0_NCnn, and
     GPIO_S5_nn.

SEE ALSO
     gpio(3), gpio(4), gpioctl(8)
