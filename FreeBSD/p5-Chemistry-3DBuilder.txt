Chemistry::3DBuilder(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Chemistry::3DBuilder - Generate 3D coordinates from a connection table

SYNOPSIS
           # example: convert SMILES to MDL molfile
           use Chemistry::3DBuilder qw(build_3d);
           use Chemistry::File::SMILES;
           use Chemistry::File::MDLMol;

           my $s = '[O-]C(=O)C(N)C(C)CC';
           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->parse($s, format => 'smiles');

           build_3d($mol);

           print $mol->print(format => 'mdl');

DESCRIPTION
       This module generates a three-dimensional molecular structure from a
       connection table, such as that obtained by a 2D representation of the
       molecule or from a SMILES string.

       NOTE: this module is still at a very early stage of development so it
       has important limitations. 1) It doesn't handle rings or
       stereochemistry yet!  2) The bond lengths and atoms are very
       approximate as they don't really account for different elements. 3)
       Only the sp3, sp2, and sp hybridizations are supported.

SUBROUTINES
       These subroutines may be exported; to export all, use the ':all' tag.

       build_3d($mol)
           Add internal and cartesian coordinates to the molecule $mol.
