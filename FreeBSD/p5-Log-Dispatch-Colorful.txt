         $screen->log( level => 'debug', message => $data );

DESCRIPTION
       Log::Dispatch::Colorful is provides an object for logging to the
       screen.

ATTENTION
       this module is rewrite Log::Dispatch method for Dumper.  if you don't
       need Dumper, you think about using Log::Dispatch::Screen::Color.

METHODS
   new
       This method takes a hash of parameters.

   log
       Sends a message if the level is greater than or equal to the object's
       minimum level.  This method applies any message formatting callbacks
       that the object may have.  (in Log::Dispatch::Output).

   log_message
       Sends a message to the appropriate output.  Generally this shouldn't be
       called directly but should be called through the log() method (in
       Log::Dispatch::Output).
