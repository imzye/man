XL(4)                  FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                  XL(4)

NAME
     xl – 3Com Etherlink XL and Fast Etherlink XL Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device xl

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_xl_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The xl driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
     controllers based on the 3Com "boomerang," "cyclone," "hurricane" and
     "tornado" bus-master Etherlink XL chips.

     The Etherlink XL chips support built-in 10baseT, 10base2 and 10base5
     transceivers as well as an MII bus for externally attached PHY
     transceivers.  The 3c905 series typically uses a National Semiconductor
     NS 83840A 10/100 PHY for 10/100 Mbps support in full or half-duplex.  The
     3c905B adapters have built-in autonegotiation logic mapped onto the MII
     for compatibility with previous drivers.  Fast Etherlink XL adapters such
     as the 3c905-TX and 3c905B-TX are capable of 10 or 100Mbps data rates in
     either full or half duplex and can be manually configured for any
     supported mode or automatically negotiate the highest possible mode with
     a link partner.

     The xl driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect            Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
                           Note that this option is only available with the
                           3c905 and 3c905B adapters with external PHYs or
                           built-in autonegotiation logic.  For 3c900
                           adapters, the driver will choose the mode specified
                           in the EEPROM.  The user can change this by adding
                           media options to the /etc/rc.conf file.

     10baseT/UTP           Set 10Mbps operation.  The mediaopt option can also
                           be used to select either full-duplex or half-duplex
                           modes.

     100baseTX             Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The
                           mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                           full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     10base5/AUI           Enable AUI transceiver (available only on COMBO
                           cards).

     10base2/BNC           Enable BNC coax transceiver (available only on
                           COMBO cards).

     The xl driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex           Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex           Force half duplex operation.

     Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported by the
     adapter.  For more information on configuring this device, see
     ifconfig(8).

     Both the 3C656 family of CardBus cards and the 3C556 family of MiniPCI
     cards have a built-in proprietary modem.  Neither the xl driver nor any
     other FreeBSD driver supports this modem.

DIAGNOSTICS
     xl%d: couldn't map memory  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     xl%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     xl%d: device timeout  The device has stopped responding to the network,
     or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).

     xl%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.

     xl%d: no memory for tx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the transmitter ring when allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf
     chain into a cluster.

     xl%d: command never completed!  Some commands issued to the 3c90x ASIC
     take time to complete: the driver is supposed to wait until the 'command
     in progress' bit in the status register clears before continuing.  In
     rare instances, this bit may not clear.  To avoid getting caught in an
     infinite wait loop, the driver only polls the bit for a finite number of
     times before giving up, at which point it issues this message.  This
     message may be printed during driver initialization on slower machines.
     If you see this message but the driver continues to function normally,
     the message can probably be ignored.

     xl%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0  This message applies
     only to 3c905B adapters, which support power management.  Some operating
     systems place the 3c905B in low power mode when shutting down, and some
     PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip out of this state before configuring
     it.  The 3c905B loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if
     the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time, it will not be
     able to configure it correctly.  The driver tries to detect this
     condition and bring the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but
     this may not be enough to return the driver to a fully operational
     condition.  If you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to
     attach the device as a network interface, you will have to perform second
     warm boot to have the device properly configured.

     Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
     operating system.  If you power down your system prior to booting
     FreeBSD, the card should be configured correctly.

     xl%d: WARNING: no media options bits set in the media options
     register!  This warning may appear when using the driver on some Dell
     Latitude docking stations with built-in 3c905-TX adapters.  For whatever
     the reason, the 'MII available' bit in the media options register on this
     particular equipment is not set, even though it should be (the 3c905-TX
     always uses an external PHY transceiver).  The driver will attempt to
     guess the proper media type based on the PCI device ID word.  The driver
     makes a lot of noise about this condition because the author considers it
     a manufacturing defect.

     xl%d: transmission error: %d
     xl%d: tx underrun, increasing tx start threshold to %d bytes  This
     message may appear while the adapter tunes its transmission buffers under
     various load amounts and are mostly harmless.  It is probably safe to
     ignore them.
