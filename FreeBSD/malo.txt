MALO(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                MALO(4)

NAME
     malo – Marvell Libertas IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device malo
           device pci
           device wlan
           device firmware

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_malo_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The malo driver provides support for Marvell Libertas 88W8335 based PCI
     and Cardbus network adapters.  malo supports station and monitor mode
     operation.  Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

     This driver requires firmware to be loaded before it will work.  The
     ports/net/malo-firmware-kmod port needs to be installed before
     ifconfig(8) will work.

HARDWARE
     The following cards are among those supported by the malo driver:

     Card               Chip       Bus    Standard
     Netgear WG311v3    88W8335    PCI    b/g
     Tenda TWL542P      88W8335    PCI    b/g
     U-Khan UW-2054i    88W8335    PCI    b/g

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
