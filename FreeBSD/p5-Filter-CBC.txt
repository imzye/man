NAME
       Filter::CBC - Source filter for Cipher Block Chaining

SYNOPSIS
         # Please don't encrypt me!

         use Filter::CBC "Rijndael","my secret key";

         # This file will be encrypted and overwritten.
         # Make backups, damnit!
         # Autofilter example
         print "Don't try this at home, kids !";

         -or-

         # Please don't encrypt me!

         use Filter::CBC "","";

         # This file will be encrypted and overwritten.
         # Make backups, damnit!
         # Autofilter example
         # Defaults will be used
         # Rijndael is default encryption algorithm
         # Default keyphrase is : This space is left blank intentionally
         print "Don't try this at home, kids !";

         -or-

         BEGIN { use LWP::Simple; my $key = get("http://www.somesite.com/key.txt"); }

         use Filter::CBC "Rijndael",$key;

         secretstuff();

DESCRIPTION
       Filter::CBC is a Source filter that uses Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) to
       encrypt your code. The tricky part is that most CBC Algorithms have
       binary output. The textmode bypasses this obstacle, by converting the
       data to less scary data.

DOWNSIDES
       •  Source filters are slow. VERY Slow. Filter::CBC is not an exception.
          Well uhm kinda. Filter::CBC is even slower. Be warned, be VERY VERY
          warned.

       •  You're source file is overwrittten when you're using the autoefilter
          feature.

PARAMETERS
       The two parameters that can be passed along are :

       CBC Handler
         This parameter indicates what CBC encryption routine to use. Possible
         values are described in the next section.

       Keyphrase
         This parameter is the keyphrase for the encryption routine described
         as previous parameter.

INTERNAL CBC HANDLERS
       The following parameters can be passed as part of the CBC encryption
       routine

       Rijndael
         This is the AES (Advanced Encryption Scheme) routine. You need
         Crypt::Rijndael for this.

       DES
         This is the DES routine. You need Crypt::DES for this.

       IDEA
         This is the IDEA routine. You need Crypt::IDEA for this.

       Blowfish
         This is the Blowfish routine. You need Crypt::Blowfish for this.

       GOST
         This is the GOST routine. You need Crypt::GOST for this.

       DES_EDE3
         This is the Triple DES routine. You need Crypt::DES_EDE3 for this.

       Twofish
         This is the Twofish routine. You need Crypt::Twofish for this.

       NULL
         This is the NULL routine. You need Crypt::NULL for this.

       TEA
         This is the TEA routine. You need Crypt::TEA for this.

       RC6
         This is the RC6 routine. You need Crypt::RC6 for this.

       Serpent
         This is the Serpent routine. You need Crypt::Serpent for this.
         (Untested)

       But any CBC Compatible routine will work.

TEXT HANDLERS
       As Paul Marquess noted, Filter has no problems with binary data. The
       text handlers are totally unnecesary. I therefor removed them. You can
       still use hex encoding by using the Filter::Hex module provided in the
       obsolete directory. If you have code that used the older version of
       Filter::CBC, I recommend stacking the HEX filter. Edit the use
       statement as follows :

         use Filter::Hex; use Filter::CBC "Rijndael","my secret key";

AUTOFILTERING
       Since Filter::CBC 0.04, using code2cbc isn't required anymore.
       Filter::CBC can encrypt your code on the fly if it's not yet encrypted.
       Be warned that your source file is overwritten. You can use cbc2code.pl
       to decrypt your encrypted code. BACKUP!

         use Filter::CBC "Rijndael","my secret key";

         # This file will be encrypted and overwritten.
         # Make backups, damnit!
         # Autofilter example
         print "Don't try this at home, kids !";

       This code will be encrypted the first time you run it. Everything
       before the 'use Filter::CBC' line is kept intact. Filter::CBC sets a
       'marker' so that double encryption doesn't occur.  If you see a comment
       stating 'This space is left blank intentionally', ignore it.

DEFAULTS
       Encryption routine
          Filter::CBC will use Rijndael when no encryption algorithm is
          defined.

       Keyphrase
          Filter::CBC will use the following line when no keyphrase is defined
          :

       This space is left blank intentionally

REQUIREMENTS
       Filter::CBC requires the following modules (depending on your needs)

       Filter::Util::Call
       Crypt::CBC
       Crypt::Rijndael
       Crypt::DES
       Crypt::IDEA
       Crypt::Blowfish
       Crypt::GOST
       Crypt::DES_EDE3
       Crypt::Twofish
       Crypt::NULL
       Crypt::TEA
       Crypt::RC6
       Crypt::Serpent

THANKS A MILLION
       Alot of thanks to Ray Brinzer (Petruchio on Perlmonks) for giving an
       example on how to handle parameters with use.

       Paul Marquess for writing Filter and pointing out that Filter does what
       it should and not what I expect it to.

       A bunch of monks at Perlmonks for giving some excellent and well
       appreciated feedback on detecting code. Thank you Blakem, Petral,
       Chipmunk, Tilly, Jepri and Zaxo.

TODO
       A bit less then first release but still plenty.
