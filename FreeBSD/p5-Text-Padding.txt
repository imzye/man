NAME
       Text::Padding - simple way of formatting a text

VERSION
       version 1.110170

SYNOPSIS
           my $pad = Text::Padding->new;
           my $string   = 'foo bar baz';
           my $left     = $pad->left  ( $string, 20 );
           my $centered = $pad->center( $string, 20 );
           my $right    = $pad->right ( $string, 20 );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple way to align a text on the left, right or
       center. If left & right are easy to achieve (see sprintf()), i found no
       cpan module that achieved a simple text centering. Well, of course,
       Perl6::Form provides it, but it's incredibly slow during startup /
       destroy time. And Text::Reform was segfaulting during destroy time.

       Hence this module, which aims to provide only those 3 methods.

ATTRIBUTES
   ellipsis
       When a string is too long to fit the wanted length, the methods are
       truncating it. To indicate that the string has been choped, the last
       character is replaced by an ellipsis (\x{2026} by default). However,
       it's possible to change this character by whatever ones wants: empty
       string to disable this behaviour, multi-char string is supported, etc.
       See Text::Truncate for more information.

METHODS
   center
           my $centered = $pad->center( $str, $length );

       Return a $length-long string where $str is centered, using white spaces
       on left & right. $str is truncated if too long to fit (see the
       "ellipsis" attribute).

   left
           my $left = $pad->left( $str, $length );

       Return a $length-long string where $str is left-aligned, right being
       padded with white spaces. $str is truncated if too long to fit (see the
       "ellipsis" attribute).

   right
           my $right = $pad->right( $str, $length );

       Return a $length-long string where $str is right-aligned, left being
       padded with white spaces. $str is truncated if too long to fit (see the
       "ellipsis" attribute).
