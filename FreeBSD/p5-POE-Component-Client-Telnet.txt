NAME
       POE::Component::Client::Telnet - A POE component that provides
       non-blocking access to Net::Telnet and other subclasses of Net::Telnet.

SYNOPSIS
               use POE::Component::Client::Telnet;

               my $poco = POE::Component::Client::Telnet->new(
                       alias => 'telnet',                # optional; You can use $poco->session_id() instead
                       debug => 1,                       # optional; 1 to turn on debugging
                       options => { trace => 1 },        # optional; Options passed to the internal session
                       package => 'Net::Telnet::Cisco',  # optional; Allows use of other Net::Telnet
                       telnet_options => [ ],            # optional; Options passed to Net::Telnet->new()
               );

               # Start your POE session, then...

               $kernel->post('telnet' => open => { event => 'result' },"rainmaker.wunderground.com");

               sub result {
                       my ($kernel,$ref) = @_[KERNEL,ARG0];

                       if ( $ref->{result} ) {
                               print "connected: $ref->{result}\n";
                       } else {
                               print STDERR join(' ', @{ $ref->{error} ) . "\n";
                       }
               }

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Component::Client::Telnet is a POE component that provides a non-
       blocking wrapper around Net::Telnet, or any other module based on
       Net::Telnet.

       Consult the Net::Telnet documentation for more details.

METHODS
       new Takes a number of arguments, all of which are optional. 'alias',
           the kernel alias to bless the component with; 'debug', set this to
           1 to see component debug information; 'options', a hashref of
           POE::Session options that are passed to the component's session
           creator; 'telnet_options', an optional array ref of options that
           will be passed to Net::Telnet->new(); 'package', an optional
           package name that is a base of Net::Telnet, like
           Net::Telnet::Cisco.

       session_id
           Takes no arguments, returns the POE::Session ID of the component.
           Useful if you don't want to use aliases.

       yield
           This method provides an alternative object based means of posting
           events to the component. First argument is the event to post,
           following arguments are sent as arguments to the resultant post.

             $poco->yield( open => { event => 'result' }, "localhost" );

       call
           This method provides an alternative object based means of calling
           events to the component. First argument is the event to call,
           following arguments are sent as arguments to the resultant call.

             $poco->call( open => { event => 'result' }, "localhost" );

       (all other Net::Telnet methods
           All Net::Telnet methods can be called, but the first param must be
           the options hash as noted below in the INPUT section below.

           For example:

                   $poco->open( { event => 'opened' },"localhost" );

           One exception, the 'option_callback' method accepts an event name
           instead of a code ref.  If called with no params, 'result' will be
           the event currently set.  Also, when the callback is fired,
           'result' will be an array ref of $option, $is_remote, $is_enabled,
           $was_enabled, $buf_position.  See the 'option_callback' method of
           Net::Telnet for details.

INPUT
       These are the events that the component will accept. Each event
       requires a hashref as an argument with the following keys: 'event', the
       name of the event handler in *your* session that you want the result of
       the requested operation to go to. 'event' is needed for all requests
       that you want a response to.

       It is possible to pass arbitary data in the request hashref that could
       be used in the resultant event handler. Simply define additional
       key/value pairs of your own. It is recommended that one prefixes keys
       with '_' to avoid future clashes.

OUTPUT
       For each requested operation an event handler is required. ARG0 of this
       event handler contains a hashref.

       The hashref will contain keys for 'state', and 'result'. 'state' is the
       operation that was requested, 'result' is what the function returned.

       result
           This is data returned from the function you called.  Usually a
           scalar, but can be an array ref when using 'option_callback'.

       error
           In the event of an error occurring this will be defined. It is an
           scalar which contains the error.
