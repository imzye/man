NAME
     kue – Kawasaki LSI KL5KUSB101B USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device kue

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_kue_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The kue driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the
     Kawasaki LSI KL5KLUSB101B chipset.

     The KL5KLUSB101B supports a 128-entry multicast filter, single perfect
     filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.  Packets are
     received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.

     The Kawasaki chipset supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there
     are no ifmedia() modes to select.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The kue driver supports Kawasaki LSI KL5KLUSB101B based USB Ethernet
     adapters including:

     •   Psion Gold Port USB Ethernet adapter
     •   SMC 2102USB, 2104USB

DIAGNOSTICS
     kue%d: watchdog timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
     transmit command was issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the
     transmission before a timeout expired.

     kue%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.

HISTORY
     The kue device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.0.

AUTHORS
     The kue driver was written by Bill Paul <wpaul@ee.columbia.edu>.

BUGS
     The kue driver does not accumulate Ethernet collisions statistics because
     the Kawasaki firmware does not appear to maintain any internal
     statistics.
