NAME
       Excel::Template - Excel::Template

SYNOPSIS
       First, make a template. This is an XML file, describing the layout of
       the spreadsheet.

       For example, test.xml:

         <workbook>
             <worksheet name="tester">
                 <cell text="$HOME" />
                 <cell text="$PATH" />
             </worksheet>
         </workbook>

       Now, create a small program to use it:

         #!/usr/bin/perl -w

         use strict;

         use Excel::Template;

         # Create the Excel template
         my $template = Excel::Template->new(
             filename => 'test.xml',
         );

         # Add a few parameters
         $template->param(
             HOME => $ENV{HOME},
             PATH => $ENV{PATH},
         );

         $template->write_file('test.xls');

       If everything worked, then you should have a spreadsheet called
       text.xls in your working directory that looks something like:

                    A                B                C
           +----------------+----------------+----------------
         1 | /home/me       | /bin:/usr/bin  |
           +----------------+----------------+----------------
         2 |                |                |
           +----------------+----------------+----------------

DESCRIPTION
       This is a module used for templating Excel files. Its genesis came from
       the need to use the same datastructure as HTML::Template, but provide
       Excel files instead. The existing modules don't do the trick, as they
       require replication of logic that's already been done within
       HTML::Template.

MOTIVATION
       I do a lot of Perl/CGI for reporting purposes. In nearly every place
       I've been, I've been asked for HTML, PDF, and Excel. HTML::Template
       provides the first, and PDF::Template does the second pretty well. But,
       generating Excel was the sticking point. I already had the data
       structure for the other templating modules, but I just didn't have an
       easy mechanism to get that data structure into an XLS file.

USAGE
   new()
       This creates a Excel::Template object.

       Parameters

       •   FILE / FILENAME

           Excel::Template will parse the template in the given file or
           filehandle automatically. (You can also use the parse() method,
           described below.)

           If you want to use the __DATA__ section, you can do so by passing

             FILE => \*DATA

       •   RENDERER

           The default rendering engine is Spreadsheet::WriteExcel. You may,
           if you choose, change that to another choice. The legal values are:

           •   Excel::Template->RENDER_NML

               This is the default of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.

           •   Excel::Template->RENDER_BIG

               This attempts to load Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Big.

           •   Excel::Template->RENDER_XML

               This attempts to load Spreadsheet::WriteExcelXML.

       •   USE_UNICODE

           This will use Unicode::String to represent strings instead of
           Perl's internal string handling. You must already have
           Unicode::String installed on your system.

           The USE_UNICODE parameter will be ignored if you are using Perl 5.8
           or higher as Perl's internal string handling is unicode-aware.

           NOTE: Certain older versions of OLE::Storage_Lite and mod_perl
           clash for some reason. Upgrading to the latest version of
           OLE::Storage_Lite should fix the problem.

       Deprecated

       •   BIG_FILE

           Instead, use RENDERER => Excel::Template->RENDER_BIG

   param()
       This method is exactly like HTML::Template's param() method.

   parse() / parse_xml()
       This method actually parses the template file. It can either be called
       separately or through the new() call. It will die() if it runs into a
       situation it cannot handle.

       If a filename is passed in (vs. a filehandle), the directory name will
       be passed in to XML::Parser as the Base parameter. This will allow for
       XML directives to work as expected.

   write_file()
       Create the Excel file and write it to the specified filename, if
       possible. (This is when the actual merging of the template and the
       parameters occurs.)

   output()
       It will act just like HTML::Template's output() method, returning the
       resultant file as a stream, usually for output to the web. (This is
       when the actual merging of the template and the parameters occurs.)

   register()
       This allows you to register a class as handling a node. q.v.
       Excel::Template::Factory for more info.

SUPPORTED NODES
       This is a partial list of nodes. See the other classes in this distro
       for more details on specific parameters and the like.

       Every node can set the ROW and COL parameters. These are the actual
       ROW/COL values that the next CELL-type tag will write into.

       •   WORKBOOK

           This is the node representing the workbook. It is the parent for
           all other nodes.

       •   WORKSHEET

           This is the node representing a given worksheet.

       •   IF

           This node represents a conditional expression. Its children may or
           may not be rendered. It behaves just like HTML::Template's TMPL_IF.

       •   LOOP

           This node represents a loop. It behaves just like HTML::Template's
           TMPL_LOOP.

       •   ROW

           This node represents a row of data. This is the 1 in A1. There is
           no COLUMN node, as of yet.

       •   FORMAT

           This node varies the format for its children. All formatting
           options supported in Spreadsheet::WriteExcel are supported here.
           There are also a number of formatting shortcuts, such as BOLD and
           ITALIC.

       •   BACKREF

           This refers back to a cell previously named.

       •   CELL

           This is the actual cell in a spreadsheet.

       •   FORMULA

           This is a formula in a spreadsheet.

       •   RANGE

           This is a BACKREF for a number of identically-named cells.

       •   VAR

           This is a variable. It is generally used when the 'text' attribute
           isn't sufficient.

BUGS
       None, that I know of.

SUPPORT
       This is production quality software, used in several production web
       applications.
