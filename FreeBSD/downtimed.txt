DOWNTIMES(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           DOWNTIMES(1)

NAME
       downtimes - display system downtime records made by downtimed(8)

SYNOPSIS
       downtimes [-d downtimedbfile] [-f timefmt] [-n num] [-s sleep] [-u]
       downtimes -v
       downtime [-d downtimedbfile] [-f timefmt] [-n num] [-s sleep] [-u]
       downtime -v

DESCRIPTION
       The downtimes command displays the contents of the downtime database in
       human readable format. The downtime database is maintained by
       downtimed(8).

       The singular form downtime displays details only about the last time
       the system was down, whereas the plural form downtimes displays all
       records in the database.  The -n option can be used to specify the
       number of downtime records to display.

OPTIONS
       -d downtimedbfile
              Use the specified downtime database file instead of the system
              default.

       -f timefmt
              Specify the time and date format to use when reporting using
              strftime(3) syntax. The default is "%F %T".

       -n num Define how many latest downtime records to output. Default is
              all.

       -s sleep
              Calculate the approximate crash time by specifying what was the
              sleep value of downtimed(8).

       -u     Display times in UTC.

       -v     Display the program version number, copyright message and the
              default settings.

EXIT STATUS
       The program exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
       The reporting accuracy in case of a system crash depends on how often
       the time stamp is updated.
