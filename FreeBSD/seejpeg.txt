SYNOPSIS
       seejpeg [options] <image> [ <image> ... ]

COPYRIGHT
       Seejpeg is Copyright (C) 1993-1999 by Evan Harris.

       This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
       Group.

DESCRIPTION
       Seejpeg is an image displayer which uses svgalib.  It currently
       understands the JPEG, GIF, PPM, BMP and TARGA formats.

       Seejpeg automatically decides the best video mode to use, based on the
       modes supported by the video hardware.  This decision can be influenced
       by various program options.

       A slideshow option is provided.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
       Once an image is being displayed, the following keyboard commands are
       availble:

       q  Q   Quit.

              This quits immediately.  If multiple images were specified, the
              remainder are not displayed.

       up-arrow
              Scroll image up.

              This does not do anything if the image is smaller the video mode
              or the top of the image is already displayed.

       down-arrow
              Scroll image down.

              This does not do anything if the image is smaller the video mode
              or the bottom of the image is already displayed.

       left-arrow
              Scroll image left.

              This does not do anything if the image is smaller the video mode
              or the left extremity of the image is already displayed.

       right-arrow
              Scroll image right.

              This does not do anything if the image is smaller the video mode
              or the right extremity of the image is already displayed.

       backspace
              Show the previous image.

              If there is no previous image, this reloads the current image.

       r  R   Reload the current image.

       any-other-key
              Show the next image.

              If there is no next image, seejpeg exits.

OPTIONS
       -1  --one-pass
              Quantize image in one pass (implies -q).  JPEG only.

              This is faster than using -q, but the resulting image quality is
              not as high.

       -c  --centre  --center
              Centre the image on the screen, if its width or height is
              smaller than that of the video mode.

       -C  --cycle
              Cycle through all images repeatedly.

              To exit immediately, press Q.

       -dx  --double=x
              Double the width of the image by duplicating each pixel.

       -f F  --fuzz=F
              Set the video mode choosing fuzz factor.  0.5 <= F <= 1.0.

              A video mode is selected if it is the same size or larger than
              the image.  The fuzz factor allows a video mode to be selected
              if the video mode is equal to or larger than F * image_width and
              F * image_height.

       -F string  --mode=string
              Force the use of the given video mode.  The string must be an
              svgalib video mode string, such as G640x480x256, or a
              corresponding video mode number.

              If this is a 256 colour mode, quantization (-q) is automatically
              chosen.  If quantization is not possible, the video mode is
              disallowed.  The allowable video modes may be affected by the
              image type as well as the video card and svgalib configuration
              file.

       -g  --grey  --gray
              Display image as greyscale (implies -1).  JPEG only.

              Display the image in greyscale.  This is not necessary for an
              image compressed using the greyscale option on cjpeg as this
              mode will be set automatically.  It can be used for images
              compressed without the greyscale flag, or for displaying colour
              images in greyscale.

       -G F  --gamma=F
              Set the gamma correction value.  0.1 <= F <= 5.0.

              The default gamma value is 1.0.  If an image is too dark,
              increase the gamma correction value.  1.5 and 2.0 are often good
              values to try.  If it is too light, decrease it.

       -h  --help
              Print a usage message.

       -m W  --min-mode-width=W
              Do not select a video mode with width less than W.

              This can be useful on larger monitors to avoid the smaller video
              modes, such as 320x200.

       -M W  --max-mode-width=W
              Do not select a video mode with width greater than W.

              This can be useful if a video card supports a given mode, but
              the monitor doesn't.

       -q  --quantize  --quantise
              Quantize image into 256 colours.  The resulting image will be
              displayed using a 256 colour mode.  JPEG only.

              The default quantization algorithm uses two passes and is memory
              intensive.  This can be a problem on small-memory machines.  A
              one pass algorithm that does not use much memory can be
              specified using -1, but the resulting image quality is not as
              high.

       -r  --randomize  --randomise
              Randomize the order of the images to be displayed.

              If cycling through the images is also requested, a new random
              order is chosen for each cycle.

       -s T  --slideshow-delay=T
              Show the images in a slideshow, waiting T seconds between each
              image.

              The scrolling keyboard commands behave normally in a slideshow.
              Other keyboard commands are acted upon normally, but not until
              the end of the delay time.

       -v  --verbose
              Be verbose.

              Prints information such as the image size and video mode being
              used.  Without this option, seejpeg operates silently.

       -w  --width-only
              Only use the image width to choose the video mode.

              By default, the video mode chosen is the smallest one possible
              which is not smaller than the image.  This may not be desirable
              for long, thin images.  This options allows the video mode to be
              chosen based on the width only, rather than the width and
              height.

       --enable-5x4
              Enable video modes with a 5x4 aspect ratio to be used.  5x4
              modes are enabled by default.

              As of seejpeg 1.10, 1280x1024 is the only mode of this type.

       --disable-5x4
              Do not allow video modes with a 5x4 aspect ratio to be used.
              5x4 modes are enabled by default.

       --enable-4x3
              Enable video modes with a 4x3 aspect ratio to be used.  4x3
              modes are enabled by default.

              This is the same aspect ratio as a normal monitor and the vast
              bulk of standard video modes are of this type.

       --disable-4x3
              Do not allow video modes with a 4x3 aspect ratio to be used.
              4x3 modes are enabled by default.

       --enable-8x5
              Enable video modes with a 8x5 aspect ratio to be used.  8x5
              modes are disabled by default.

              As of seejpeg 1.10, 640x400 and 320x200 are the only modes of
              this type.

       --disable-8x5
              Do not allow video modes with a 8x5 aspect ratio to be used.
              8x5 modes are disabled by default.

       --enable-16x9
              Enable video modes with a 16x9 aspect ratio to be used.  16x9
              modes are disabled by default.

              16x9 is the widescreen aspect ratio format used by, for example,
              HDTV.  As of svgalib 1.4.0, only one modeline, for 1072x600, is
              provided by default and it distorts images produced for a 4x3
              screen when used on 4x3 screens.

       --disable-16x9
              Do not allow video modes with a 16x9 aspect ratio to be used.
              16x9 modes are disabled by default.

NOTES
       For optimum performance, use svidtune from the svgalib (source)
       distribution to create a mode line for each video mode that is tuned to
       your video card and monitor and placed them in the libvga.config file.

LIMITATIONS
       Video modes are limited to 2048x1536, 2048x1152, 1920x1440, 1800x1012,
       1600x1200, 1360x768, 1280x1024, 1280x720, 1152x864, 1072x600, 1024x768,
       960x720, 848x480, 800x600, 720x540, 640x480, 640x400, 512x384, 400x300,
       320x240 and 320x200 in 256, 32K, 16M or 16M32 colours.  Each mode can
       only be used if it is supported by the video card, svgalib, and the
       svgalib configuration (libvga.config).

       Images that cannot be completely contained within video memory are
       clipped.

       No horizontal scrolling is permitted on Trident cards in 800x600x256
       mode, due to an svgalib or chipset bug.

       Seejpeg has had limited testing, none at all for the TARGA format.
