FELIS(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               FELIS(1)

NAME
     felis – File Contents Display (v1.0)

SYNOPSIS
     felis [inputfile ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The felis utility sends the contents of text files to stdout.  Unlike
     cat, felis combines any number of white space (including new lines) into
     a single blank, displaying the entire contents on a single line.

     It strips any leading and trailing blanks, but inserts a blank space
     between files.

     With some files the effect of felis could be emulated by something like

           echo `cat inputfile ...`

     Alas, that does not always work. Hence the need for felis as a separate
     program.

     The felis utility exits 0 on success. Otherwise, the exit value equals
     the number of files felis could not open.

USAGE
   Displaying Files
           felis inputfile ...

     Inputfile is one or more text files.

     If no inputfile is listed, felis reads its input from stdin.

     The input contents can be in plain ASCII, in any of the ISO-8859
     encodings, as well as in UTF-8.

   Examples
           sendmail `felis customers friends` < message

     This will send the contents of message to addresses listed in customers
     and friends.

     Here is an example of a CGI shell script:

           #!/bin/sh
           echo Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
           echo
           script.cgi | felis

     This will combine the HTML output of script.cgi into a single line, which
     can save bandwidth.

     Note that the HTTP header is sent out separately because it must end with
     two new lines, which felis would strip otherwise.

HISTORY
     Both felis and this manual page were written by G. Adam Stanislav
     <adam@whizkidtech.net>.

     The word felis is Latin for cat.
