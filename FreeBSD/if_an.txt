NAME
     an – Aironet Communications 4500/4800 wireless network adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device an
           device wlan

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_an_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The an driver provides support for Aironet Communications 4500 and 4800
     wireless network adapters and variants, including the following:

           •   Aironet Communications 4500 and 4800 series
           •   Cisco Aironet 340 and 350 series

     Support for these devices include the ISA and PCI varieties.  The Aironet
     4500 series adapters operate at 1 and 2Mbps while the Aironet 4800 series
     and Cisco adapters can operate at 1, 2, 5.5 and 11Mbps.  The ISA and PCI
     devices are all based on the same core PCMCIA hardware and all have the
     same programming interface.  The ISA and PCI cards appear to the host as
     normal ISA and PCI devices.

     ISA cards can either be configured to use ISA Plug and Play or to use a
     particular I/O address and IRQ by properly setting the DIP switches on
     the board.  (The default switch setting is for Plug and Play.)  The an
     driver has Plug and Play support and will work in either configuration,
     however when using a hard-wired I/O address and IRQ, the driver
     configuration and the NIC's switch settings must agree.  PCI cards
     require no switch settings of any kind and will be automatically probed
     and attached.

     All host/device interaction with the Aironet cards is via programmed I/O.
     The Aironet devices support 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management,
     BSS (infrastructure) and IBSS (ad-hoc) operation modes.  The an driver
     encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however it can
     receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.  Transmit speed is selectable
     between 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5Mbps, 11Mbps or "auto" (the NIC automatically
     chooses the best speed).

     By default, the an driver configures the Aironet card for infrastructure
     operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS
     an%d: init failed  The Aironet card failed to become ready after an
     initialization command was issued.

     an%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC  The driver was unable to
     allocate memory for transmit frames in the NIC's on-board RAM.

     an%d: device timeout  The Aironet card failed to generate an interrupt to
     acknowledge a transmit command.
