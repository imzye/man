NAME
       font-manager - Simple font management for GTK+ desktop environments

SYNOPSIS
       font-manager [-a] [-v] [-l] [--list-full] [-e family] [-d family]
                    [-i filepath] [-u] [--keep family]

DESCRIPTION
       font-manager is intended to provide a way for average users to easily
       manage desktop fonts, without having to resort to command line tools or
       editing configuration files by hand. While designed primarily with the
       Gnome Desktop Environment in mind, it should work well with other Gtk+
       desktop environments.

OPTIONS
       -a, --about
              About the application

       -v, --version
              Show application version

       -l, --list
              List available font families

       --list-full
              Full listing including face information (JSON)

       -e, --enable family ...
              Space separated list of font families to enable

       -d, --disable family ...
              Space separated list of font families to disable

       -i, --install filepath ...
              Space separated list of files to install

       -u, --update
              Update application database

       --keep family ...
              Space separated list of font families to keep while disabling
              all others. This option is case insensitive and allows for
              partial matches.

              Caution:

              While the --keep option will require at least one font family to
              remain enabled it makes no attempt to ensure that it is a
              suitable replacement for required system fonts.

              The --enable option with no arguments should enable all
              available fonts.

              Default user font directory.

LIMITATIONS
       font-manager is a user level application, it will not allow
       installation to, or removal of fonts from, anywhere other than the
       default user font directory.  However, the application does allow users
       to disable system fonts and also makes it easy to add font directories.
