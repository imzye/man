NAME
       gb2jis - convert GuoBiao Hanzi to JIS Kanji

SYNOPSYS
       gb2jis [ -hjespi ] [ filename...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       gb2jis converts GB2312-80 and GB8565-88 characters to JISX0208-1983 and
       JISX0212-1990 characters.  GB2312-80 (^[$A), GB2312-80 + GB8565-88
       (^[$(E), and Chinese-EUC (8-bit GuoBiao) are available for Hanzi code.

OPTIONS
       -h      Translate HZ-encoding.  Regard ~{ as ^[$A and ~} as ^[(B for
               input.

       -j      Do not use JISX0212-1990.

       -e      Use Japanese-EUC for output.  (include -j)

       -s      Use Shift-JIS for output.  (include -j)

       -p      Use UZPJ for unprintable characters in output.

       -i      Force to flush output characters one by one.  This is the
               default when output is a tty.

UZPJ
       UZPJ is a description method of Chinese syllables.  Any syllable is
       described by two letters.  First letter represents its consonant and
       second letter its vowel.  Tones are represented by four combinations of
       big and small letters, where big ones are considered as high-tone.

       We can translate UZPJ letters into ordinary Pinyin.  The first letter
       is equal to the same Pinyin letter except I, U, and V for ch, sh, and
       zh, respectively.  The second letter is translated by the table below:

       |A a   |B an  |C ang |D ai  |E e   |F en  |G eng |H ei  |I i   |
       |J in  |K ing |L ie  |M iao |N iu  |O o   |P ou  |Q ong |R ao  |
       |S uo  |T uan |U u   |V un  |W ui  |X ia  |Y ian |Z iang|^ ^   |

       except the following combinations (":" means dieresis).

       |AA a     |AG ang   |AN an    |EE e     |EG eng   |EN en    |
       |ER er    |GX gua   |GY guai  |GZ guang |HK hng   |HM hm    |
       |HX hua   |HY huai  |HZ huang |IX chua  |IY chuai |IZ chuang|
       |JQ jiong |JW jue   |KX kua   |KY kuai  |KZ kuang |LF lu:   |
       |LW lu:e  |NO nu:   |NW nu:e  |NX n     |OG ng    |OO o     |
       |QQ qiong |QW que   |RX rua   |UX shua  |UY shuai |UZ shuang|
       |VX zhua  |VY zhuai |VZ zhuang|XQ xiong |XW xue   |YW yue   |

       Tone mark is decided by the rule below.

              macron
                          when both letters are big
              acute       when first letter is small and second big
              caron       when both letters are small
              grave       when first letter is big and second small
              circumflex  when second letter is "^"

BUGS
       A few mistakes may be left on the conversion table.
