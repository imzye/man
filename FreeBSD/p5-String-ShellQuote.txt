NAME
       String::ShellQuote - quote strings for passing through the shell

SYNOPSIS
           $string = shell_quote @list;
           $string = shell_quote_best_effort @list;
           $string = shell_comment_quote $string;

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains some functions which are useful for quoting
       strings which are going to pass through the shell or a shell-like
       object.

       shell_quote [string]...
           shell_quote quotes strings so they can be passed through the shell.
           Each string is quoted so that the shell will pass it along as a
           single argument and without further interpretation.  If no strings
           are given an empty string is returned.

           If any string can't be safely quoted shell_quote will croak.

       shell_quote_best_effort [string]...
           This is like shell_quote, excpet if the string can't be safely
           quoted it does the best it can and returns the result, instead of
           dying.

       shell_comment_quote [string]
           shell_comment_quote quotes the string so that it can safely be
           included in a shell-style comment (the current algorithm is that a
           sharp character is placed after any newlines in the string).

           This routine might be changed to accept multiple string arguments
           in the future.  I haven't done this yet because I'm not sure if the
           strings should be joined with blanks ($") or nothing ($,).  Cast
           your vote today!  Be sure to justify your answer.

EXAMPLES
           $cmd = 'fuser 2>/dev/null ' . shell_quote @files;
           @pids = split ' ', `$cmd`;

           print CFG "# Configured by: ",
                       shell_comment_quote($ENV{LOGNAME}), "\n";

BUGS
       Only Bourne shell quoting is supported.  I'd like to add other shells
       (particularly cmd.exe), but I'm not familiar with them.  It would be a
       big help if somebody supplied the details.
