BSDISKS.CONF(5)           FreeBSD File Formats Manual          BSDISKS.CONF(5)

NAME
     bsdisks.conf – configuration file for the bsdisks utility

SYNOPSIS
     bsdisks.conf

DESCRIPTION
     Lines in bsdisks.conf are limited to 1024 characters.  Lines where the
     first non-blank character is a # are comments and are ignored.  Non-
     comment lines are of the form name = value, where name can be:

     mount_msdosfs_flags
             Space-separated arguments to be passed to mount_msdosfs(8).

     prefer_native_ext2
             Set this to true to make bsdisks use FreeBSD native extfs
             implementation rather than FUSE one.

     handle_zfs_filesystems
             Set this to false to prevent bsdisks from treating ZFS datasets
             with canmount=noauto as mountable filesystems.
