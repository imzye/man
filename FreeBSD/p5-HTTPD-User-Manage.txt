NAME
       HTTPD::Authen - HTTP server authentication class

SYNOPSIS
           use HTTPD::Authen ();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides methods for authenticating a user.  It uses
       HTTPD::UserAdmin to lookup passwords in a database.  Subclasses provide
       methods specific to the authentication mechanism.

       Currently, under HTTP/1.0 the only supported authentication mechanism
       is Basic Authentication.  NCSA Mosaic and NCSA HTTPd understand the
       proposed Message Digest Authentication, which should make it into the
       HTTP spec someday.  This module supports both.

METHODS
   new ()
       Since HTTPD::Authen uses HTTPD::UserAdmin for database lookups it needs
       many of the same attributes.  Or, if the first argument passed to the
       new() object constructor is a reference to an HTTPD::UserAdmin, the
       attributes are inherited.

       The following attributes are recognized from HTTPD::UserAdmin:

       DBType, DB, Server, Path, DBMF, Encrypt

       And if you wish to query an SQL server: Host, User, Auth, Driver,
       UserTable, NameField, PasswordField

       The same defaults are assumed for these attributes, as in
       HTTPD::UserAdmin.  See HTTPD::UserAdmin for details.

           $authen = new HTTPD::Authen (DB => "www-users");

   basic()
       Short-cut to return an HTTPD::Authen::Basic object.

           $basic = $authen->basic;

   digest()
       Short-cut to return an HTTPD::Authen::Digest object.

           $digest = $authen->digest;

   type($authorization_header_value)
       This method will guess the authorization scheme based on the
       'Authorization' header value, and return an object bless into that
       scheme's class.

       By using this method, it is simple to authenticate a user without even
       knowing what scheme is being used:

            $authtype = HTTPD::Authen->type($authinfo);
            @info = $authtype->parse($authinfo)
            if( $authtype->check(@info) ) {
                #response 200 OK, etc.
            }

SUBCLASSES
       HTTPD::Authen::Basic methods

   new([$hashref])
       $hashref should be an HTTPD::Authen object, it must be present when
       looking up users.  Optionally, you can pass the attribute USER with the
       value of an HTTPD::UserAdmin object.

       Normally, this method is not called directly, but rather by
       HTTPD::Authen->basic method.

   parse ($authorization_header_value)
       This method expects the value of the HTTP 'Authorization' header of
       type Basic.  This should look something like:

        'Basic ZG91Z206anN0NG1l'

       This string will be parsed and decoded, returning the username and
       password.  Note that the MIME::Base64 module is required for decoding.

           ($username,$password) = HTTPD::Authen::Basic->parse($authinfo)

           #or, assuming $authen is an HTTPD::Authen object
           ($username,$password) = $authen->basic->parse($authinfo)

           #or check the info at the same time
           $OK = $authen->check($authen->basic->parse($authinfo))

   check($username,$password)
       This method expects a username and *clear text* password as arguments.
       Returns true if the username was found, and passwords match, otherwise
       returns false.

           if($authen->check("JoeUser", "his_clear_text_password")) {
               print "Well, the passwords match at least\n";
           }
           else {
               print "Password mismatch! Intruder alert! Intruder alert!\n";
           }

       HTTPD::Authen::Digest methods
           NOTE: The MD5 module is required to use these methods.

   new([$hashref])
       $hashref should be an HTTPD::Authen object.  Normally, this method is
       not called directly, but rather by HTTPD::Authen->digest method.

   parse ($authorization_header_value)
       This method expects the value of the HTTP 'Authorization' header of
       type Basic.  This should look something like:

         Digest username="JoeUser", realm="SomePlace", nonce="826407380", uri="/test/blah.html", response="0306f29f88690fb9203451556c376ae9", opaque="5e09061a062a271c8fcc686c5be90c2a"

       This method returns a hash ref containing all Name = Value pairs from
       the header.

            $mda = HTTPD::Authen::Digest->parse($authinfo);

            #or, assuming $authen is an HTTPD::Authen object
            $mda = $authen->digest->parse($authinfo)

            #or check the info at the same time
            $OK = $authen->check($authen->digest->parse($authinfo))

   check ($hashref[, $request [, $seconds [, $client_ip ]]])
       This method expects a hashref of Name Value pairs normally found in the
       'Authorization' header.  With this argument alone, the method will
       return true without checking nonce or the opaque string if the client
       'response' checksum matches ours.

       If $request is present, it must be a hashref or an HTTP::Request
       method.  From here, we fetch the request uri and request method.
       Otherwise, we default to the value of 'uri' present in $hashref, and
       'GET' for the method.

       If $seconds is present, the value of 'nonce' will be checked, returning
       false if it is stale.

       If $client_ip is present, the value of the 'opaque' string will be
       checked, returning false if the string is not valid.

       This implementation is based on the Digest Access Authentication
       internet-draft http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/digestauth/draft.rfc and NCSA's
       implementation http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/howto/md5_auth.html
