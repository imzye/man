Module::Install::AuthorTests(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Module::Install::AuthorTests - designate tests only run by module
       authors

VERSION
       0.002

COMMANDS
       This plugin adds the following Module::Install commands:

   author_tests
         author_tests('xt');

       This declares that the test files found in the directory ./xt should be
       run only if the module is being built by an author.  For an
       explanation, see below.

       You may declare multiple test directories by passing a list of tests.
       Since tests are not recursive by default, it should be safe to use a
       subdirectory of ./t for author tests, like:

         author_tests('t/author');

   recursive_author_tests
         recursive_author_tests('xt');

       This acts like "author_tests", but will look for tests in directories
       below ./xt as well as in the directory itself.

HOW IT WORKS
       "Is this being run by an author?" is determined internally by
       Module::Install, but at the time of the writing of this version it's
       determined by the existence of a directory called .author in ./inc.
       (On VMS, it's _author.)  This directory is created when
       Module::Install's Makefile.PL is run in a directory where no ./inc
       directory exists.
