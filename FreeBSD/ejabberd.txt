EJABBERD.YML(5)                                                EJABBERD.YML(5)

NAME
       ejabberd.yml - main configuration file for ejabberd.

SYNOPSIS
       ejabberd.yml

DESCRIPTION
       The configuration file is written in YAML language.

           Warning

           YAML is indentation sensitive, so make sure you respect
           indentation, or otherwise you will get pretty cryptic configuration
           errors.

       Logically, configuration options are split into 3 main categories:
       Modules, Listeners and everything else called Top Level options. Thus
       this document is split into 3 main chapters describing each category
       separately. So, the contents of ejabberd.yml will typically look like
       this:

           hosts:
             - example.com
             - domain.tld
           loglevel: info
           ...
           listen:
             -
               port: 5222
               module: ejabberd_c2s
             ...
           modules:
             mod_roster: {}
             ...

       Any configuration error (such as syntax error, unknown option or
       invalid option value) is fatal in the sense that ejabberd will refuse
       to load the whole configuration file and will not start or will abort
       configuration reload.

       All options can be changed in runtime by running ejabberdctl
       reload-config command. Configuration reload is atomic: either all
       options are accepted and applied simultaneously or the new
       configuration is refused without any impact on currently running
       configuration.

       Some options can be specified for particular virtual host(s) only using
       host_config or append_host_config options. Such options are called
       local. Examples are modules, auth_method and default_db. The options
       that cannot be defined per virtual host are called global. Examples are
       loglevel, certfiles and listen. It is a configuration mistake to put
       global options under host_config or append_host_config section -
       ejabberd will refuse to load such configuration.

       It is not recommended to write ejabberd.yml from scratch. Instead it is
       better to start from "default" configuration file available at
       https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/blob/25.04/ejabberd.yml.example.
       Once you get ejabberd running you can start changing configuration
       options to meet your requirements.

       Note that this document is intended to provide comprehensive
       description of all configuration options that can be consulted to
       understand the meaning of a particular option, its format and possible
       values. It will be quite hard to understand how to configure ejabberd
       by reading this document only - for this purpose the reader is
       recommended to read online Configuration Guide available at
       https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/configuration.

TOP LEVEL OPTIONS
       This section describes top level options of ejabberd 25.04. The options
       that changed in this version are marked with 🟤.

       access_rules: {AccessName: {allow|deny: ACLName|ACLDefinition}}
           This option defines basic.md#access-rules|Access Rules. Each access
           rule is assigned a name that can be referenced from other parts of
           the configuration file (mostly from access options of ejabberd
           modules). Each rule definition may contain arbitrary number of
           allow or deny sections, and each section may contain any number of
           ACL rules (see acl option). There are no access rules defined by
           default.

           Example:

               access_rules:
                 configure:
                   allow: admin
                 something:
                   deny: someone
                   allow: all
                 s2s_banned:
                   deny: problematic_hosts
                   deny: banned_forever
                   deny:
                     ip: 222.111.222.111/32
                   deny:
                     ip: 111.222.111.222/32
                   allow: all
                 xmlrpc_access:
                   allow:
                     user: peter@example.com
                   allow:
                     user: ivone@example.com
                   allow:
                     user: bot@example.com
                     ip: 10.0.0.0/24

       acl: {ACLName: {ACLType: ACLValue}}
           This option defines ../configuration/basic.md#acl|access control
           lists: named sets of rules which are used to match against
           different targets (such as a JID or an IP address). Every set of
           rules has name ACLName: it can be any string except all or none
           (those are predefined names for the rules that match all or nothing
           respectively). The name ACLName can be referenced from other parts
           of the configuration file, for example in access_rules option. The
           rules of ACLName are represented by mapping {ACLType: ACLValue}.
           These can be one of the following:

           ip: Network
               The rule matches any IP address from the Network.

           node_glob: Pattern
               Same as node_regexp, but matching is performed on a specified
               Pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell.

           node_regexp: user_regexp@server_regexp
               The rule matches any JID with node part matching regular
               expression user_regexp and server part matching regular
               expression server_regexp.

           resource: Resource
               The rule matches any JID with a resource Resource.

           resource_glob: Pattern
               Same as resource_regexp, but matching is performed on a
               specified Pattern according to the rules used by the Unix
               shell.

           resource_regexp: Regexp
               The rule matches any JID with a resource that matches regular
               expression Regexp.

           server: Server
               The rule matches any JID from server Server. The value of
               Server must be a valid hostname or an IP address.

           server_glob: Pattern
               Same as server_regexp, but matching is performed on a specified
               Pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell.

           server_regexp: Regexp
               The rule matches any JID from the server that matches regular
               expression Regexp.

           user: Username
               If Username is in the form of "user@server", the rule matches a
               JID against this value. Otherwise, if Username is in the form
               of "user", the rule matches any JID that has Username in the
               node part as long as the server part of this JID is any virtual
               host served by ejabberd.

           user_glob: Pattern
               Same as user_regexp, but matching is performed on a specified
               Pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell.

           user_regexp: Regexp
               If Regexp is in the form of "regexp@server", the rule matches
               any JID with node part matching regular expression "regexp" as
               long as the server part of this JID is equal to "server". If
               Regexp is in the form of "regexp", the rule matches any JID
               with node part matching regular expression "regexp" as long as
               the server part of this JID is any virtual host served by
               ejabberd.

       acme: Options
           basic.md#acme|ACME configuration, to automatically obtain SSL
           certificates for the domains served by ejabberd, which means that
           certificate requests and renewals are performed to some CA server
           (aka "ACME server") in a fully automated mode. The Options are:

           auto: true | false
               Whether to automatically request certificates for all
               configured domains (that yet have no a certificate) on server
               start or configuration reload. The default is true.

           ca_url: URL
               The ACME directory URL used as an entry point for the ACME
               server. The default value is
               https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory - the directory
               URL of Let’s Encrypt authority.

           cert_type: rsa | ec
               A type of a certificate key. Available values are ec and rsa
               for EC and RSA certificates respectively. It’s better to have
               RSA certificates for the purpose of backward compatibility with
               legacy clients and servers, thus the default is rsa.

           contact: [Contact, ...]
               A list of contact addresses (typically emails) where an ACME
               server will send notifications when problems occur. The value
               of Contact must be in the form of "scheme:address" (e.g.
               "mailto:user@domain.tld"). The default is an empty list which
               means an ACME server will send no notices.

           Example:

               acme:
                 ca_url: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
                 contact:
                   - mailto:admin@domain.tld
                   - mailto:bot@domain.tld
                 auto: true
                 cert_type: rsa

       allow_contrib_modules: true | false
           Whether to allow installation of third-party modules or not. See
           ../../admin/guide/modules.md#ejabberd-contrib|ejabberd-contrib
           documentation section. The default value is true.

       allow_multiple_connections: true | false
           This option is only used when the anonymous mode is enabled.
           Setting it to true means that the same username can be taken
           multiple times in anonymous login mode if different resource are
           used to connect. This option is only useful in very special
           occasions. The default value is false.

       anonymous_protocol: login_anon | sasl_anon | both
           Define what
           authentication.md#anonymous-login-and-sasl-anonymous|anonymous
           protocol will be used:

           •   login_anon means that the anonymous login method will be used.

           •   sasl_anon means that the SASL Anonymous method will be used.

           •   both means that SASL Anonymous and login anonymous are both
               enabled.

       The default value is sasl_anon.

       api_permissions: [Permission, ...]
           Define the permissions for API access. Please consult the ejabberd
           Docs web → For Developers → ejabberd ReST API →
           ../../developer/ejabberd-api/permissions.md|API Permissions.

       append_host_config: {Host: Options}
           Add a few specific options to a certain
           ../configuration/basic.md#virtual-hosting|virtual host.

       auth_cache_life_time: timeout()
           Same as cache_life_time, but applied to authentication cache only.
           If not set, the value from cache_life_time will be used.

       auth_cache_missed: true | false
           Same as cache_missed, but applied to authentication cache only. If
           not set, the value from cache_missed will be used.

       auth_cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
           Same as cache_size, but applied to authentication cache only. If
           not set, the value from cache_size will be used.

       auth_external_user_exists_check: true | false
           Note about this option: added in 23.10. Supplement check for user
           existence based on mod_last data, for authentication methods that
           don’t have a way to reliably tell if a user exists (like is the
           case for jwt and certificate based authentication). This helps with
           processing offline message for those users. The default value is
           true.

       auth_method: [mnesia | sql | anonymous | external | jwt | ldap | pam,
       ...]
           A list of authentication.md|authentication methods to use. If
           several methods are defined, authentication is considered
           successful as long as authentication of at least one of the methods
           succeeds. The default value is [mnesia].

       auth_opts: [Option, ...]
           This is used by the contributed module ejabberd_auth_http that can
           be installed from the
           ../../admin/guide/modules.md#ejabberd-contrib|ejabberd-contrib Git
           repository. Please refer to that module’s README file for details.

       auth_password_format: plain | scram
           Note about this option: improved in 20.01. The option defines in
           what format the users passwords are stored, plain text or in
           authentication.md#scram|SCRAM format:

           •   plain: The password is stored as plain text in the database.
               This is risky because the passwords can be read if your
               database gets compromised. This is the default value. This
               format allows clients to authenticate using: the old Jabber
               Non-SASL (XEP-0078), SASL PLAIN, SASL DIGEST-MD5, and SASL
               SCRAM-SHA-1/256/512(-PLUS).

           •   scram: The password is not stored, only some information
               required to verify the hash provided by the client. It is
               impossible to obtain the original plain password from the
               stored information; for this reason, when this value is
               configured it cannot be changed to plain anymore. This format
               allows clients to authenticate using: SASL PLAIN and SASL
               SCRAM-SHA-1/256/512(-PLUS). The SCRAM variant depends on the
               auth_scram_hash option.

       The default value is plain.

       auth_scram_hash: sha | sha256 | sha512
           Hash algorithm that should be used to store password in
           authentication.md#scram|SCRAM format. You shouldn’t change this if
           you already have passwords generated with a different algorithm -
           users that have such passwords will not be able to authenticate.
           The default value is sha.

       auth_stored_password_types: [plain | scram_sha1 | scram_sha256 |
       scram_sha512]
           Note about this option: added in 25.03. List of password types that
           should be stored simultaneously for each user in database. When the
           user sets the account password, database will be updated to store
           the password in formats compatible with each type listed here. This
           can be used to migrate user passwords to a more secure format. If
           this option if set, it will override values set in auth_scram_hash
           and auth_password_format options. The default value is [].

       auth_use_cache: true | false
           Same as use_cache, but applied to authentication cache only. If not
           set, the value from use_cache will be used.

       c2s_cafile: Path
           Full path to a file containing one or more CA certificates in PEM
           format. All client certificates should be signed by one of these
           root CA certificates and should contain the corresponding JID(s) in
           subjectAltName field. There is no default value.

       You can use host_config to specify this option per-vhost.

       To set a specific file per listener, use the listener’s
       listen-options.md#cafile|cafile option. Please notice that c2s_cafile
       overrides the listener’s cafile option.

       c2s_ciphers: [Cipher, ...]
           A list of OpenSSL ciphers to use for c2s connections. The default
           value is shown in the example below:

           Example:

               c2s_ciphers:
                 - HIGH
                 - "!aNULL"
                 - "!eNULL"
                 - "!3DES"
                 - "@STRENGTH"

       c2s_dhfile: Path
           Full path to a file containing custom DH parameters to use for c2s
           connections. Such a file could be created with the command "openssl
           dhparam -out dh.pem 2048". If this option is not specified,
           2048-bit MODP Group with 256-bit Prime Order Subgroup will be used
           as defined in RFC5114 Section 2.3.

       c2s_protocol_options: [Option, ...]
           List of general SSL options to use for c2s connections. These map
           to OpenSSL’s set_options(). The default value is shown in the
           example below:

           Example:

               c2s_protocol_options:
                 - no_sslv3
                 - cipher_server_preference
                 - no_compression

       c2s_tls_compression: true | false
           Whether to enable or disable TLS compression for c2s connections.
           The default value is false.

       ca_file: Path
           Path to a file of CA root certificates. The default is to use
           system defined file if possible.

       For server connections, this ca_file option is overridden by the
       s2s_cafile option.

       cache_life_time: timeout()
           The time of a cached item to keep in cache. Once it’s expired, the
           corresponding item is erased from cache. The default value is 1
           hour. Several modules have a similar option; and some core ejabberd
           parts support similar options too, see auth_cache_life_time,
           oauth_cache_life_time, router_cache_life_time, and
           sm_cache_life_time.

       cache_missed: true | false
           Whether or not to cache missed lookups. When there is an attempt to
           lookup for a value in a database and this value is not found and
           the option is set to true, this attempt will be cached and no
           attempts will be performed until the cache expires (see
           cache_life_time). Usually you don’t want to change it. Default is
           true. Several modules have a similar option; and some core ejabberd
           parts support similar options too, see auth_cache_missed,
           oauth_cache_missed, router_cache_missed, and sm_cache_missed.

       cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
           A maximum number of items (not memory!) in cache. The rule of
           thumb, for all tables except rosters, you should set it to the
           number of maximum online users you expect. For roster multiply this
           number by 20 or so. If the cache size reaches this threshold, it’s
           fully cleared, i.e. all items are deleted, and the corresponding
           warning is logged. You should avoid frequent cache clearance,
           because this degrades performance. The default value is 1000.
           Several modules have a similar option; and some core ejabberd parts
           support similar options too, see auth_cache_size, oauth_cache_size,
           router_cache_size, and sm_cache_size.

       captcha_cmd: Path | ModuleName
           Note about this option: improved in 23.01. Full path to a script
           that generates basic.md#captcha|CAPTCHA images. The keyword
           @VERSION@ is replaced with ejabberd version number in XX.YY format.
           The keyword @SEMVER@ is replaced with ejabberd version number in
           semver format when compiled with Elixir’s mix, or XX.YY format
           otherwise. Alternatively, it can be the name of a module that
           implements ejabberd CAPTCHA support. There is no default value:
           when this option is not set, CAPTCHA functionality is completely
           disabled.

           Examples:

           When using the ejabberd installers or container image, the example
           captcha scripts can be used like this:

               captcha_cmd: /opt/ejabberd-@VERSION@/lib/ejabberd-@SEMVER@/priv/bin/captcha.sh

       captcha_host: String
           Deprecated. Use captcha_url instead.

       captcha_limit: pos_integer() | infinity
           Maximum number of basic.md#captcha|CAPTCHA generated images per
           minute for any given JID. The option is intended to protect the
           server from CAPTCHA DoS. The default value is infinity.

       captcha_url: URL | auto | undefined
           Note about this option: improved in 23.04. An URL where
           basic.md#captcha|CAPTCHA requests should be sent. NOTE: you need to
           configure request_handlers for ejabberd_http listener as well. If
           set to auto, it builds the URL using a request_handler already
           enabled, with encryption if available. If set to undefined, it
           builds the URL using the deprecated captcha_host + /captcha. The
           default value is auto.

       certfiles: [Path, ...]
           The option accepts a list of file paths (optionally with wildcards)
           containing either PEM certificates or PEM private keys. At startup
           or configuration reload, ejabberd reads all certificates from these
           files, sorts them, removes duplicates, finds matching private keys
           and then rebuilds full certificate chains for the use in TLS
           connections. Use this option when TLS is enabled in either of
           ejabberd listeners: ejabberd_c2s, ejabberd_http and so on. NOTE: if
           you modify the certificate files or change the value of the option,
           run ejabberdctl reload-config in order to rebuild and reload the
           certificate chains.

           Examples:

           If you use Let’s Encrypt certificates for your domain "domain.tld",
           the configuration will look like this:

               certfiles:
                 - /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.tld/fullchain.pem
                 - /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.tld/privkey.pem

       cluster_backend: Backend
           A database backend to use for storing information about cluster.
           The only available value so far is mnesia.

       cluster_nodes: [Node, ...]
           A list of Erlang nodes to connect on ejabberd startup. This option
           is mostly intended for ejabberd customization and sophisticated
           setups. The default value is an empty list.

       default_db: mnesia | sql
           database.md#default-database|Default database to store persistent
           data in ejabberd. Modules and other components (e.g.
           authentication) may have its own value. The default value is
           mnesia.

       default_ram_db: mnesia | redis | sql
           Default volatile (in-memory) storage for ejabberd. Modules and
           other components (e.g. session management) may have its own value.
           The default value is mnesia.

       define_keyword: {NAME: Value}
           Note about this option: added in 25.03. Allows to define
           configuration
           ../configuration/file-format.md#macros-and-keywords|keywords.

           Example:

               define_keyword:
                 SQL_USERNAME: "eja.global"

               host_config:
                 localhost:
                   define_keyword:
                     SQL_USERNAME: "eja.localhost"

               sql_username: "prefix.@SQL_USERNAME@"

       define_macro: {NAME: Value}
           Note about this option: improved in 25.03. Allows to define
           configuration
           ../configuration/file-format.md#macros-and-keywords|macros.

           Example:

               define_macro:
                 DEBUG: debug
                 LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG
                 USERBOB:
                   user: bob@localhost

               loglevel: LOG_LEVEL

               acl:
                 admin: USERBOB

       disable_sasl_mechanisms: [Mechanism, ...]
           Specify a list of SASL mechanisms (such as DIGEST-MD5 or
           SCRAM-SHA1) that should not be offered to the client. For
           convenience, the value of Mechanism is case-insensitive. The
           default value is an empty list, i.e. no mechanisms are disabled by
           default.

       disable_sasl_scram_downgrade_protection: true | false
           Allows to disable sending data required by XEP-0474: SASL SCRAM
           Downgrade Protection. There are known buggy clients (like those
           that use strophejs 1.6.2) which will not be able to authenticatate
           when servers sends data from that specification. This options
           allows server to disable it to allow even buggy clients connects,
           but in exchange decrease MITM protection. The default value of this
           option is false which enables this extension.

       domain_balancing: {Domain: Options}
           An algorithm to
           ../guide/clustering.md#service-load-balancing|load-balance the
           components that are plugged on an ejabberd cluster. It means that
           you can plug one or several instances of the same component on each
           ejabberd node and that the traffic will be automatically
           distributed. The algorithm to deliver messages to the component(s)
           can be specified by this option. For any component connected as
           Domain, available Options are:

           component_number: 2..1000
               The number of components to balance.

           type: Value
               How to deliver stanzas to connected components. The default
               value is random. Possible values:

           - bare_destination
               by the bare JID (without resource) of the packet’s to attribute

           - bare_source
               by the bare JID (without resource) of the packet’s from
               attribute is used

           - destination
               an instance is chosen by the full JID of the packet’s to
               attribute

           - random
               an instance is chosen at random

           - source
               by the full JID of the packet’s from attribute

           Example:

               domain_balancing:
                 component.domain.tld:
                   type: destination
                   component_number: 5
                 transport.example.org:
                   type: bare_source

       ext_api_headers: Headers
           String of headers (separated with commas ,) that will be provided
           by ejabberd when sending ReST requests. The default value is an
           empty string of headers: "".

       ext_api_http_pool_size: pos_integer()
           Define the size of the HTTP pool, that is, the maximum number of
           sessions that the ejabberd ReST service will handle simultaneously.
           The default value is: 100.

       ext_api_path_oauth: Path
           Define the base URI path when performing OAUTH ReST requests. The
           default value is: "/oauth".

       ext_api_url: URL
           Define the base URI when performing ReST requests. The default
           value is: "http://localhost/api".

       extauth_pool_name: Name
           Define the pool name appendix in
           authentication.md#external-script|external auth, so the full pool
           name will be extauth_pool_Name. The default value is the hostname.

       extauth_pool_size: Size
           The option defines the number of instances of the same
           authentication.md#external-script|external auth program to start
           for better load balancing. The default is the number of available
           CPU cores.

       extauth_program: Path
           Indicate in this option the full path to the
           authentication.md#external-script|external authentication script.
           The script must be executable by ejabberd.

       fqdn: Domain
           A fully qualified domain name that will be used in SASL DIGEST-MD5
           authentication. The default is detected automatically.

       hide_sensitive_log_data: true | false
           A privacy option to not log sensitive data (mostly IP addresses).
           The default value is false for backward compatibility.

       host_config: {Host: Options}
           The option is used to redefine Options for
           ../configuration/basic.md#virtual-hosting|virtual host Host. In the
           example below LDAP authentication method will be used on virtual
           host domain.tld and SQL method will be used on virtual host
           example.org.

           Example:

               hosts:
                 - domain.tld
                 - example.org

               auth_method:
                 - sql

               host_config:
                 domain.tld:
                   auth_method:
                     - ldap

       hosts: [Domain1, Domain2, ...]
           List of one or more ../configuration/basic.md#host-names|host names
           (or domains) that ejabberd will serve. This is a mandatory option.

       include_config_file: [Filename, ...] | {Filename: Options}
           Read and
           ../configuration/file-format.md#include-additional-files|include
           additional file from Filename. If the value is provided in
           {Filename: Options} format, the Options must be one of the
           following:

           allow_only: [OptionName, ...]
               Allows only the usage of those options in the included file
               Filename. The options that do not match this criteria are not
               accepted. The default value is to include all options.

           disallow: [OptionName, ...]
               Disallows the usage of those options in the included file
               Filename. The options that match this criteria are not
               accepted. The default value is an empty list.

       install_contrib_modules: [Module, ...]
           Note about this option: added in 23.10. Modules to install from
           ../../admin/guide/modules.md#ejabberd-contrib|ejabberd-contrib at
           start time. The default value is an empty list of modules: [].

       jwt_auth_only_rule: AccessName
           This ACL rule defines accounts that can use only the
           authentication.md#jwt-authentication|JWT auth method, even if
           others are also defined in the ejabberd configuration file. In
           other words: if there are several auth methods enabled for this
           host (JWT, SQL, ...), users that match this rule can only use JWT.
           The default value is none.

       jwt_jid_field: FieldName
           By default, the JID is defined in the "jid" JWT field. In this
           option you can specify other
           authentication.md#jwt-authentication|JWT field name where the JID
           is defined.

       jwt_key: FilePath
           Path to the file that contains the
           authentication.md#jwt-authentication|JWT key. The default value is
           undefined.

       language: Language
           Define the ../configuration/basic.md#default-language|default
           language of server strings that can be seen by XMPP clients. If an
           XMPP client does not possess xml:lang attribute, the specified
           language is used. The default value is "en".

       ldap_backups: [Host, ...]
           A list of IP addresses or DNS names of LDAP backup servers (see
           ../configuration/ldap.md#ldap-connection|LDAP connection). When no
           servers listed in ldap_servers option are reachable, ejabberd
           connects to these backup servers. The default is an empty list,
           i.e. no backup servers specified. Please notice that ejabberd only
           connects to the next server when the existing connection is lost;
           it doesn’t detect when a previously-attempted server becomes
           available again.

       ldap_base: Base
           LDAP base directory which stores users accounts. There is no
           default value: you must set the option in order for LDAP
           connections to work properly.

       ldap_deref_aliases: never | always | finding | searching
           Whether to dereference aliases or not. The default value is never.

       ldap_dn_filter: {Filter: FilterAttrs}
           This filter is applied on the results returned by the main filter.
           The filter performs an additional LDAP lookup to make the complete
           result. This is useful when you are unable to define all filter
           rules in ldap_filter. You can define "%u", "%d", "%s" and "%D"
           pattern variables in Filter: "%u" is replaced by a user’s part of
           the JID, "%d" is replaced by the corresponding domain (virtual
           host), all "%s" variables are consecutively replaced by values from
           the attributes in FilterAttrs and "%D" is replaced by Distinguished
           Name from the result set. There is no default value, which means
           the result is not filtered. WARNING: Since this filter makes
           additional LDAP lookups, use it only as the last resort: try to
           define all filter rules in ldap_filter option if possible.

           Example:

               ldap_dn_filter:
                 "(&(name=%s)(owner=%D)(user=%u@%d))": [sn]

       ldap_encrypt: tls | none
           Whether to encrypt LDAP connection using TLS or not. The default
           value is none. NOTE: STARTTLS encryption is not supported.

       ldap_filter: Filter
           An LDAP filter as defined in RFC4515. There is no default value.
           Example: "(&(objectClass=shadowAccount)(memberOf=XMPP Users))".
           NOTE: don’t forget to close brackets and don’t use superfluous
           whitespaces. Also you must not use "uid" attribute in the filter
           because this attribute will be appended to the filter
           automatically.

       ldap_password: Password
           Bind password. The default value is an empty string.

       ldap_port: 1..65535
           Port to connect to your LDAP server. The default port is 389 if
           encryption is disabled and 636 if encryption is enabled.

       ldap_rootdn: RootDN
           Bind Distinguished Name. The default value is an empty string,
           which means "anonymous connection".

       ldap_servers: [Host, ...]
           A list of IP addresses or DNS names of your LDAP servers (see
           ../configuration/ldap.md#ldap-connection|LDAP connection). ejabberd
           connects immediately to all of them, and reconnects infinitely if
           connection is lost. The default value is [localhost].

       ldap_tls_cacertfile: Path
           A path to a file containing PEM encoded CA certificates. This
           option is required when TLS verification is enabled.

       ldap_tls_certfile: Path
           A path to a file containing PEM encoded certificate along with PEM
           encoded private key. This certificate will be provided by ejabberd
           when TLS enabled for LDAP connections. There is no default value,
           which means no client certificate will be sent.

       ldap_tls_depth: Number
           Specifies the maximum verification depth when TLS verification is
           enabled, i.e. how far in a chain of certificates the verification
           process can proceed before the verification is considered to be
           failed. Peer certificate = 0, CA certificate = 1, higher level CA
           certificate = 2, etc. The value 2 thus means that a chain can at
           most contain peer cert, CA cert, next CA cert, and an additional CA
           cert. The default value is 1.

       ldap_tls_verify: false | soft | hard
           This option specifies whether to verify LDAP server certificate or
           not when TLS is enabled. When hard is set, ejabberd doesn’t proceed
           if the certificate is invalid. When soft is set, ejabberd proceeds
           even if the check has failed. The default is false, which means no
           checks are performed.

       ldap_uids: [Attr] | {Attr: AttrFormat}
           LDAP attributes which hold a list of attributes to use as
           alternatives for getting the JID, where Attr is an LDAP attribute
           which holds the user’s part of the JID and AttrFormat must contain
           one and only one pattern variable "%u" which will be replaced by
           the user’s part of the JID. For example, "%u@example.org". If the
           value is in the form of [Attr] then AttrFormat is assumed to be
           "%u".

       listen: [Options, ...]
           The option for listeners configuration. See the listen.md|Listen
           Modules section for details.

       log_burst_limit_count: Number
           Note about this option: added in 22.10. The number of messages to
           accept in log_burst_limit_window_time period before starting to
           drop them. Default 500

       log_burst_limit_window_time: Number
           Note about this option: added in 22.10. The time period to
           rate-limit log messages by. Defaults to 1 second.

       log_modules_fully: [Module, ...]
           Note about this option: added in 23.01. List of modules that will
           log everything independently from the general loglevel option.

       log_rotate_count: Number
           The number of rotated log files to keep. The default value is 1,
           which means that only keeps ejabberd.log.0, error.log.0 and
           crash.log.0.

       log_rotate_size: pos_integer() | infinity
           The size (in bytes) of a log file to trigger rotation. If set to
           infinity, log rotation is disabled. The default value is 10 Mb
           expressed in bytes: 10485760.

       loglevel: none | emergency | alert | critical | error | warning |
       notice | info | debug
           Verbosity of ejabberd ../configuration/basic.md#logging|logging.
           The default value is info. NOTE: previous versions of ejabberd had
           log levels defined in numeric format (0..5). The numeric values are
           still accepted for backward compatibility, but are not recommended.

       max_fsm_queue: Size
           This option specifies the maximum number of elements in the queue
           of the FSM (Finite State Machine). Roughly speaking, each message
           in such queues represents one XML stanza queued to be sent into its
           relevant outgoing stream. If queue size reaches the limit (because,
           for example, the receiver of stanzas is too slow), the FSM and the
           corresponding connection (if any) will be terminated and error
           message will be logged. The reasonable value for this option
           depends on your hardware configuration. The allowed values are
           positive integers. The default value is 10000.

       modules: {Module: Options}
           Set all the modules.md|modules configuration options.

       negotiation_timeout: timeout()
           Time to wait for an XMPP stream negotiation to complete. When
           timeout occurs, the corresponding XMPP stream is closed. The
           default value is 120 seconds.

       net_ticktime: timeout()
           This option can be used to tune tick time parameter of net_kernel.
           It tells Erlang VM how often nodes should check if intra-node
           communication was not interrupted. This option must have identical
           value on all nodes, or it will lead to subtle bugs. Usually leaving
           default value of this is option is best, tweak it only if you know
           what you are doing. The default value is 1 minute.

       new_sql_schema: true | false
           Whether to use the database.md#default-and-new-schemas|new SQL
           schema. All schemas are located at
           https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/tree/25.04/sql. There are
           two schemas available. The default legacy schema stores one XMPP
           domain into one ejabberd database. The new schema can handle
           several XMPP domains in a single ejabberd database. Using this new
           schema is best when serving several XMPP domains and/or changing
           domains from time to time. This avoid need to manage several
           databases and handle complex configuration changes. The default
           depends on configuration flag --enable-new-sql-schema which is set
           at compile time.

       oauth_access: AccessName
           By default creating OAuth tokens is not allowed. To define which
           users can create OAuth tokens, you can refer to an ejabberd access
           rule in the oauth_access option. Use all to allow everyone to
           create tokens.

       oauth_cache_life_time: timeout()
           Same as cache_life_time, but applied to OAuth cache only. If not
           set, the value from cache_life_time will be used.

       oauth_cache_missed: true | false
           Same as cache_missed, but applied to OAuth cache only. If not set,
           the value from cache_missed will be used.

       oauth_cache_rest_failure_life_time: timeout()
           Note about this option: added in 21.01. The time that a failure in
           OAuth ReST is cached. The default value is infinity.

       oauth_cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
           Same as cache_size, but applied to OAuth cache only. If not set,
           the value from cache_size will be used.

       oauth_client_id_check: allow | db | deny
           Define whether the client authentication is always allowed, denied,
           or it will depend if the client ID is present in the database. The
           default value is allow.

       oauth_db_type: mnesia | sql
           Database backend to use for OAuth authentication. The default value
           is picked from default_db option, or if it’s not set, mnesia will
           be used.

       oauth_expire: timeout()
           Time during which the OAuth token is valid, in seconds. After that
           amount of time, the token expires and the delegated credential
           cannot be used and is removed from the database. The default is
           4294967 seconds.

       oauth_use_cache: true | false
           Same as use_cache, but applied to OAuth cache only. If not set, the
           value from use_cache will be used.

       oom_killer: true | false
           Enable or disable OOM (out-of-memory) killer. When system memory
           raises above the limit defined in oom_watermark option, ejabberd
           triggers OOM killer to terminate most memory consuming Erlang
           processes. Note that in order to maintain functionality, ejabberd
           only attempts to kill transient processes, such as those managing
           client sessions, s2s or database connections. The default value is
           true.

       oom_queue: Size
           Trigger OOM killer when some of the running Erlang processes have
           messages queue above this Size. Note that such processes won’t be
           killed if oom_killer option is set to false or if oom_watermark is
           not reached yet.

       oom_watermark: Percent
           A percent of total system memory consumed at which OOM killer
           should be activated with some of the processes possibly be killed
           (see oom_killer option). Later, when memory drops below this
           Percent, OOM killer is deactivated. The default value is 80
           percents.

       outgoing_s2s_families: [ipv6 | ipv4, ...]
           Note about this option: changed in 23.01. Specify which address
           families to try, in what order. The default is [ipv6, ipv4] which
           means it first tries connecting with IPv6, if that fails it tries
           using IPv4. This option is obsolete and irrelevant when using
           ejabberd 23.01 and Erlang/OTP 22, or newer versions of them.

       outgoing_s2s_ipv4_address: Address
           Note about this option: added in 20.12. Specify the IPv4 address
           that will be used when establishing an outgoing S2S IPv4
           connection, for example "127.0.0.1". The default value is
           undefined.

       outgoing_s2s_ipv6_address: Address
           Note about this option: added in 20.12. Specify the IPv6 address
           that will be used when establishing an outgoing S2S IPv6
           connection, for example "::FFFF:127.0.0.1". The default value is
           undefined.

       outgoing_s2s_port: 1..65535
           A port number to use for outgoing s2s connections when the target
           server doesn’t have an SRV record. The default value is 5269.

       outgoing_s2s_timeout: timeout()
           The timeout in seconds for outgoing S2S connection attempts. The
           default value is 10 seconds.

       pam_service: Name
           This option defines the authentication.md#pam-authentication|PAM
           service name. Refer to the PAM documentation of your operation
           system for more information. The default value is ejabberd.

       pam_userinfotype: username | jid
           This option defines what type of information about the user
           ejabberd provides to the authentication.md#pam-authentication|PAM
           service: only the username, or the user’s JID. Default is username.

       pgsql_users_number_estimate: true | false
           Whether to use PostgreSQL estimation when counting registered
           users. The default value is false.

       queue_dir: Directory
           If queue_type option is set to file, use this Directory to store
           file queues. The default is to keep queues inside Mnesia directory.

       queue_type: ram | file
           Default type of queues in ejabberd. Modules may have its own value
           of the option. The value of ram means that queues will be kept in
           memory. If value file is set, you may also specify directory in
           queue_dir option where file queues will be placed. The default
           value is ram.

       redis_connect_timeout: timeout()
           A timeout to wait for the connection to be re-established to the
           database.md#redis|Redis server. The default is 1 second.

       redis_db: Number
           database.md#redis|Redis database number. The default is 0.

       redis_password: Password
           The password to the database.md#redis|Redis server. The default is
           an empty string, i.e. no password.

       redis_pool_size: Number
           The number of simultaneous connections to the
           database.md#redis|Redis server. The default value is 10.

           connections. The default is 6379.

       redis_queue_type: ram | file
           The type of request queue for the database.md#redis|Redis server.
           See description of queue_type option for the explanation. The
           default value is the value defined in queue_type or ram if the
           latter is not set.

       redis_server: Host | IP Address | Unix Socket Path
           Note about this option: improved in 24.12. A hostname, IP address
           or unix domain socket file of the database.md#redis|Redis server.
           Setup the path to unix domain socket like: "unix:/path/to/socket".
           The default value is localhost.

       registration_timeout: timeout()
           This is a global option for module mod_register. It limits the
           frequency of registrations from a given IP or username. So, a user
           that tries to register a new account from the same IP address or
           JID during this time after their previous registration will receive
           an error with the corresponding explanation. To disable this
           limitation, set the value to infinity. The default value is 600
           seconds.

       resource_conflict: setresource | closeold | closenew
           NOTE: this option is deprecated and may be removed anytime in the
           future versions. The possible values match exactly the three
           possibilities described in XMPP Core: section 7.7.2.2. The default
           value is closeold. If the client uses old Jabber Non-SASL
           authentication (XEP-0078), then this option is not respected, and
           the action performed is closeold.

       router_cache_life_time: timeout()
           Same as cache_life_time, but applied to routing table cache only.
           If not set, the value from cache_life_time will be used.

       router_cache_missed: true | false
           Same as cache_missed, but applied to routing table cache only. If
           not set, the value from cache_missed will be used.

       router_cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
           Same as cache_size, but applied to routing table cache only. If not
           set, the value from cache_size will be used.

       router_db_type: mnesia | redis | sql
           Database backend to use for routing information. The default value
           is picked from default_ram_db option, or if it’s not set, mnesia
           will be used.

       router_use_cache: true | false
           Same as use_cache, but applied to routing table cache only. If not
           set, the value from use_cache will be used.

       rpc_timeout: timeout()
           A timeout for remote function calls between nodes in an ejabberd
           cluster. You should probably never change this value since those
           calls are used for internal needs only. The default value is 5
           seconds.

       s2s_access: Access
           This basic.md#access-rules|Access Rule defines to what remote
           servers can s2s connections be established. The default value is
           all; no restrictions are applied, it is allowed to connect s2s
           to/from all remote servers.

       s2s_cafile: Path
           A path to a file with CA root certificates that will be used to
           authenticate s2s connections. If not set, the value of ca_file will
           be used.

       You can use host_config to specify this option per-vhost.

       s2s_ciphers: [Cipher, ...]
           A list of OpenSSL ciphers to use for s2s connections. The default
           value is shown in the example below:

           Example:

               s2s_ciphers:
                 - HIGH
                 - "!aNULL"
                 - "!eNULL"
                 - "!3DES"
                 - "@STRENGTH"

       s2s_dhfile: Path
           Full path to a file containing custom DH parameters to use for s2s
           connections. Such a file could be created with the command "openssl
           dhparam -out dh.pem 2048". If this option is not specified,
           2048-bit MODP Group with 256-bit Prime Order Subgroup will be used
           as defined in RFC5114 Section 2.3.

       s2s_dns_retries: Number
           DNS resolving retries. The default value is 2.

           The timeout for DNS resolving. The default value is 10 seconds.

       s2s_max_retry_delay: timeout()
           The maximum allowed delay for s2s connection retry to connect after
           a failed connection attempt. The default value is 300 seconds (5
           minutes).

       s2s_protocol_options: [Option, ...]
           List of general SSL options to use for s2s connections. These map
           to OpenSSL’s set_options(). The default value is shown in the
           example below:

           Example:

               s2s_protocol_options:
                 - no_sslv3
                 - cipher_server_preference
                 - no_compression

       s2s_queue_type: ram | file
           The type of a queue for s2s packets. See description of queue_type
           option for the explanation. The default value is the value defined
           in queue_type or ram if the latter is not set.

       s2s_timeout: timeout()
           A time to wait before closing an idle s2s connection. The default
           value is 1 hour.

       s2s_tls_compression: true | false
           Whether to enable or disable TLS compression for s2s connections.
           The default value is false.

       s2s_use_starttls: true | false | optional | required
           Whether to use STARTTLS for s2s connections. The value of false
           means STARTTLS is prohibited. The value of true or optional means
           STARTTLS is enabled but plain connections are still allowed. And
           the value of required means that only STARTTLS connections are
           allowed. The default value is false (for historical reasons).

       s2s_zlib: true | false
           Whether to use zlib compression (as defined in XEP-0138) or not.
           The default value is false. WARNING: this type of compression is
           nowadays considered insecure.

       shaper: {ShaperName: Rate}
           The option defines a set of
           ../configuration/basic.md#shapers|shapers. Every shaper is assigned
           a name ShaperName that can be used in other parts of the
           configuration file, such as shaper_rules option. The shaper itself
           is defined by its Rate, where Rate stands for the maximum allowed
           incoming rate in bytes per second. When a connection exceeds this
           limit, ejabberd stops reading from the socket until the average
           rate is again below the allowed maximum. In the example below
           shaper normal limits the traffic speed to 1,000 bytes/sec and
           shaper fast limits the traffic speed to 50,000 bytes/sec:

           Example:

               shaper:
                 normal: 1000
                 fast: 50000

       shaper_rules: {ShaperRuleName: {Number|ShaperName:
       ACLName|ACLDefinition}}
           This option defines ../configuration/basic.md#shaper-rules|shaper
           rules to use for matching user/hosts. Semantics is similar to
           access_rules option, the only difference is that instead using
           allow or deny, a name of a shaper (defined in shaper option) or a
           positive number should be used.

           Example:

               shaper_rules:
                 connections_limit:
                   10:
                     user: peter@example.com
                   100: admin
                   5: all
                 download_speed:
                   fast: admin
                   slow: anonymous_users
                   normal: all
                 log_days: 30

           Same as cache_size, but applied to client sessions table cache
           only. If not set, the value from cache_size will be used.

       sm_db_type: mnesia | redis | sql
           Database backend to use for client sessions information. The
           default value is picked from default_ram_db option, or if it’s not
           set, mnesia will be used.

       sm_use_cache: true | false
           Same as use_cache, but applied to client sessions table cache only.
           If not set, the value from use_cache will be used.

           each virtual host. The default value is 10. WARNING: for SQLite
           this value is 1 by default and it’s not recommended to change it
           due to potential race conditions.

       sql_port: 1..65535
           The port where the SQL server is accepting connections. The default
           is 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL and 1433 for MS SQL. The
           option has no effect for SQLite.

       sql_prepared_statements: true | false
           Note about this option: added in 20.01. This option is true by
           default, and is useful to disable prepared statements. The option
           is valid for PostgreSQL and MySQL.

       sql_query_timeout: timeout()
           A time to wait for an SQL query response. The default value is 60
           seconds.

       sql_queue_type: ram | file
           The type of a request queue for the SQL server. See description of
           queue_type option for the explanation. The default value is the
           value defined in queue_type or ram if the latter is not set.

       sql_server: Host | IP Address | ODBC Connection String | Unix Socket
       Path
           Note about this option: improved in 24.06. The hostname or IP
           address of the SQL server. For sql_type mssql or odbc this can also
           be an ODBC connection string. When sql_type is mysql or pgsql, this
           can be the path to a unix domain socket expressed like:
           "unix:/path/to/socket".The default value is localhost.

       sql_ssl: true | false
           Note about this option: improved in 20.03. Whether to use SSL
           encrypted connections to the SQL server. The option is only
           available for MySQL, MS SQL and PostgreSQL. The default value is
           false.

       sql_ssl_cafile: Path
           A path to a file with CA root certificates that will be used to
           verify SQL connections. Implies sql_ssl and sql_ssl_verify options

           or specify a list of IPs, possibly with masks. The default value is
           an empty list. Using this option you can know the real IP of the
           request, for admin purpose, or security configuration (for example
           using mod_fail2ban). IMPORTANT: The proxy MUST be configured to set
           the X-Forwarded-For header if you enable this option as, otherwise,
           the client can set it itself and as a result the IP value cannot be
           trusted for security rules in ejabberd.

       update_sql_schema: true | false
           Note about this option: updated in 24.06. Allow ejabberd to update
           SQL schema in MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite databases. This option
           was added in ejabberd 23.10, and enabled by default since 24.06.
           The default value is true.

       update_sql_schema_timeout: timeout()
           Note about this option: added in 24.07. Time allocated to SQL
           schema update queries. The default value is set to 5 minutes.

       use_cache: true | false
           Enable or disable cache. The default is true. Several modules have
           a similar option; and some core ejabberd parts support similar
           options too, see auth_use_cache, oauth_use_cache, router_use_cache,
           and sm_use_cache.

       validate_stream: true | false
           Whether to validate any incoming XML packet according to the
           schemas of supported XMPP extensions. WARNING: the validation is
           only intended for the use by client developers - don’t enable it in
           production environment. The default value is false.

       version: string()
           The option can be used to set custom ejabberd version, that will be
           used by different parts of ejabberd, for example by mod_version
           module. The default value is obtained at compile time from the
           underlying version control system.

       websocket_origin: ignore | URL
           This option enables validation for Origin header to protect against
           connections from other domains than given in the configuration
           file. In this way, the lower layer load balancer can be chosen for
           a specific ejabberd implementation while still providing a secure
           WebSocket connection. The default value is ignore. An example value
           of the URL is "https://test.example.org:8081".

       websocket_ping_interval: timeout()
           Defines time between pings sent by the server to a client
           (WebSocket level protocol pings are used for this) to keep a
           connection active. If the client doesn’t respond to two consecutive
           pings, the connection will be assumed as closed. The value of 0 can
           be used to disable the feature. This option makes the server
           sending pings only for connections using the RFC compliant
           protocol. For older style connections the server expects that
           whitespace pings would be used for this purpose. The default value
           is 60 seconds.

       websocket_timeout: timeout()
           Amount of time without any communication after which the connection
           would be closed. The default value is 300 seconds.

MODULES
       This section describes modules options of ejabberd 25.04. The modules
       that changed in this version are marked with 🟤.

   mod_adhoc
       This module implements XEP-0050: Ad-Hoc Commands. It’s an auxiliary
       module and is only needed by some of the other modules.

       Available options:

           report_commands_node: true | false
               Provide the Commands item in the Service Discovery. Default
               value: false.

   mod_adhoc_api
       Note about this option: added in 25.03.

       Execute API Commands in a XMPP client using XEP-0050: Ad-Hoc Commands.
       This module requires mod_adhoc (to execute the commands), and
       recommends mod_disco (to discover the commands).

       Available options:

           default_version: integer() | string()
               What API version to use. If setting an ejabberd version, it
               will use the latest API version that was available in that
               ejabberd version. For example, setting "24.06" in this option
               implies 2. The default value is the latest version.

       Example:

               acl:
                 admin:
                   user: jan@localhost

               api_permissions:
                 "adhoc commands":
                   from: mod_adhoc_api
                   who: admin
                   what:
                     - "[tag:roster]"
                     - "[tag:session]"
                     - stats
                     - status

               modules:
                 mod_adhoc_api:
                   default_version: 2

   mod_admin_extra
       This module provides additional administrative commands.

       Details for some commands:

       ban_account API: This command kicks all the connected sessions of the
       account from the server. It also changes their password to a randomly
       generated one, so they can’t login anymore unless a server
       administrator changes their password again. It is possible to define
       the reason of the ban. The new password also includes the reason and
       the date and time of the ban. See an example below.

       push_roster API (and push_roster_all API): The roster file must be
       placed, if using Windows, on the directory where you installed
       ejabberd: C:/Program Files/ejabberd or similar. If you use other
       Operating System, place the file on the same directory where the .beam
       files are installed. See below an example roster file.

       srg_create API: If you want to put a group Name with blank spaces, use
       the characters "' and '" to define when the Name starts and ends. See
       an example below.

       The module has no options.

       Examples:

           With this configuration, vCards can only be modified with
           mod_admin_extra commands:

               acl:
                 adminextraresource:
                   - resource: "modadminextraf8x,31ad"
               access_rules:
                 vcard_set:
                   - allow: adminextraresource
               modules:
                 mod_admin_extra: {}
                 mod_vcard:
                   access_set: vcard_set

           Content of roster file for push_roster API:

               [{<<"bob">>, <<"example.org">>, <<"workers">>, <<"Bob">>},
               {<<"mart">>, <<"example.org">>, <<"workers">>, <<"Mart">>},
               {<<"Rich">>, <<"example.org">>, <<"bosses">>, <<"Rich">>}].

           With this call, the sessions of the local account which JID is
           boby@example.org will be kicked, and its password will be set to
           something like
           BANNED_ACCOUNT—20080425T21:45:07—2176635—Spammed_rooms

               ejabberdctl vhost example.org ban_account boby "Spammed rooms"

           Call to srg_create API using double-quotes and single-quotes:

               ejabberdctl srg_create g1 example.org "'Group number 1'" this_is_g1 g1

   mod_admin_update_sql
       This module can be used to update existing SQL database from the
       default to the new schema. Check the section
       database.md#default-and-new-schemas|Default and New Schemas for
       details. Please note that only MS SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are
       supported. When the module is loaded use update_sql API.

       The module has no options.

   mod_announce
       This module enables configured users to broadcast announcements and to
       set the message of the day (MOTD). Configured users can perform these
       actions with an XMPP client either using Ad-Hoc Commands or sending
       messages to specific JIDs.

           Note

           This module can be resource intensive on large deployments as it
           may broadcast a lot of messages. This module should be disabled for
           instances of ejabberd with hundreds of thousands users.

       To send announcements using XEP-0050: Ad-Hoc Commands, this module
       requires mod_adhoc (to execute the commands), and recommends mod_disco
       (to discover the commands).

       To send announcements by sending messages to specific JIDs, these are
       the destination JIDs:

       •   example.org/announce/all: Send the message to all registered users
           in that vhost. If the user is online and connected to several
           resources, only the resource with the highest priority will receive
           the message. If the registered user is not connected, the message
           is stored offline in assumption that offline storage (see
           mod_offline) is enabled.

       •   example.org/announce/online: Send the message to all connected
           users. If the user is online and connected to several resources,
           all resources will receive the message.

       •   example.org/announce/motd: Set the message of the day (MOTD) that
           is sent to users when they login. Also sends the message to all
           connected users (similar to announce/online).

       •   example.org/announce/motd/update: Set the message of the day (MOTD)
           that is sent to users when they login. This does not send the
           message to any currently connected user.

       •   example.org/announce/motd/delete: Remove the existing message of
           the day (MOTD) by sending a message to this JID.

       There are similar destination JIDs to apply to all virtual hosts in
       ejabberd:

       •   example.org/announce/all-hosts/all: send to all registered accounts

       •   example.org/announce/all-hosts/online: send to online sessions

       •   example.org/announce/all-hosts/motd: set MOTD and send to online

       •   example.org/announce/all-hosts/motd/update: update MOTD

       •   example.org/announce/all-hosts/motd/delete: delete MOTD

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               This option specifies who is allowed to send announcements and
               to set the message of the day. The default value is none (i.e.
               nobody is able to send such messages).

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

   mod_auth_fast
       Note about this option: added in 24.12.

       The module adds support for XEP-0484: Fast Authentication Streamlining
       Tokens that allows users to authenticate using self-managed tokens.

       Available options:

           db_type: mnesia
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           token_lifetime: timeout()
               Time that tokens will be kept, measured from it’s creation
               time. Default value set to 30 days

           token_refresh_age: timeout()
               This time determines age of token, that qualifies for automatic
               refresh. Default value set to 1 day

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_auth_fast:
                   token_lifetime: 14days

   mod_avatar
       The purpose of the module is to cope with legacy and modern XMPP
       clients posting avatars. The process is described in XEP-0398: User
       Avatar to vCard-Based Avatars Conversion.

       Also, the module supports conversion between avatar image formats on
       the fly.

       The module depends on mod_vcard, mod_vcard_xupdate and mod_pubsub.

       Available options:

           convert: {From: To}
               Defines image conversion rules: the format in From will be
               converted to format in To. The value of From can also be
               default, which is match-all rule. NOTE: the list of supported
               formats is detected at compile time depending on the image
               libraries installed in the system.

               Example:

                   convert:
                     webp: jpg
                     default: png

           rate_limit: Number
               Limit any given JID by the number of avatars it is able to
               convert per minute. This is to protect the server from image
               conversion DoS. The default value is 10.

   mod_block_strangers
       This module blocks and logs any messages coming from an unknown entity.
       If a writing entity is not in your roster, you can let this module drop
       and/or log the message. By default you’ll just not receive message from
       that entity. Enable this module if you want to drop SPAM messages.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               The option is supposed to be used when allow_local_users and
               allow_transports are not enough. It’s an ACL where deny means
               the message will be rejected (or a CAPTCHA would be generated
               for a presence, if configured), and allow means the sender is
               whitelisted and the stanza will pass through. The default value
               is none, which means nothing is whitelisted.

           allow_local_users: true | false
               This option specifies if strangers from the same local host
               should be accepted or not. The default value is true.

           allow_transports: true | false
               If set to true and some server’s JID is in user’s roster, then
               messages from any user of this server are accepted even if no
               subscription present. The default value is true.

           captcha: true | false
               Whether to generate CAPTCHA or not in response to messages from
               strangers. See also section basic.md#captcha|CAPTCHA of the
               Configuration Guide. The default value is false.

           drop: true | false
               This option specifies if strangers messages should be dropped
               or not. The default value is true.

           log: true | false
               This option specifies if strangers' messages should be logged
               (as info message) in ejabberd.log. The default value is false.

   mod_blocking
       The module implements XEP-0191: Blocking Command.

       This module depends on mod_privacy where all the configuration is
       performed.

       The module has no options.

   mod_bosh
       This module implements XMPP over BOSH as defined in XEP-0124 and
       XEP-0206. BOSH stands for Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP.
       It makes it possible to simulate long lived connections required by
       XMPP over the HTTP protocol. In practice, this module makes it possible
       to use XMPP in a browser without WebSocket support and more generally
       to have a way to use XMPP while having to get through an HTTP proxy.

       Available options:

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           json: true | false
               This option has no effect.

           max_concat: pos_integer() | infinity
               This option limits the number of stanzas that the server will
               send in a single bosh request. The default value is unlimited.

           max_inactivity: timeout()
               The option defines the maximum inactivity period. The default
               value is 30 seconds.

           max_pause: pos_integer()
               Indicate the maximum length of a temporary session pause (in
               seconds) that a client can request. The default value is 120.

           prebind: true | false
               If enabled, the client can create the session without going
               through authentication. Basically, it creates a new session
               with anonymous authentication. The default value is false.

           queue_type: ram | file
               Same as top-level queue_type option, but applied to this module
               only.

           ram_db_type: mnesia | sql | redis
               Same as top-level default_ram_db option, but applied to this
               module only.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

       Example:

               listen:
                 -
                   port: 5222
                   module: ejabberd_c2s
                 -
                   port: 5443
                   module: ejabberd_http
                   request_handlers:
                     /bosh: mod_bosh

               modules:
                 mod_bosh: {}

   mod_caps
       This module implements XEP-0115: Entity Capabilities. The main purpose
       of the module is to provide PEP functionality (see mod_pubsub).

       Available options:

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

   mod_carboncopy
       The module implements XEP-0280: Message Carbons. The module broadcasts
       messages on all connected user resources (devices).

       The module has no options.

   mod_client_state
       This module allows for queueing certain types of stanzas when a client
       indicates that the user is not actively using the client right now (see
       XEP-0352: Client State Indication). This can save bandwidth and
       resources.

       A stanza is dropped from the queue if it’s effectively obsoleted by a
       new one (e.g., a new presence stanza would replace an old one from the
       same client). The queue is flushed if a stanza arrives that won’t be
       queued, or if the queue size reaches a certain limit (currently 100
       stanzas), or if the client becomes active again.

       Available options:

           queue_chat_states: true | false
               Queue "standalone" chat state notifications (as defined in
               XEP-0085: Chat State Notifications) while a client indicates
               inactivity. The default value is true.

           queue_pep: true | false
               Queue PEP notifications while a client is inactive. When the
               queue is flushed, only the most recent notification of a given
               PEP node is delivered. The default value is true.

           queue_presence: true | false
               While a client is inactive, queue presence stanzas that
               indicate (un)availability. The default value is true.

   mod_configure
       The module provides server configuration functionalities using
       XEP-0030: Service Discovery and XEP-0050: Ad-Hoc Commands:

       •   List and discover outgoing s2s, online client sessions and all
           registered accounts

       •   Most of the ad-hoc commands defined in XEP-0133: Service
           Administration

       •   Additional custom ad-hoc commands specific to ejabberd

       This module requires mod_adhoc (to execute the commands), and
       recommends mod_disco (to discover the commands).

       Please notice that all the ad-hoc commands implemented by this module
       have an equivalent API Command that you can execute using mod_adhoc_api
       or any other API frontend.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               Note about this option: added in 25.03. This option defines
               which access rule will be used to control who is allowed to
               access the features provided by this module. The default value
               is configure.

       Example:

               acl:
                 admin:
                   user: sun@localhost

               access_rules:
                 configure:
                   allow: admin

               modules:
                 mod_configure:
                   access: configure

   mod_conversejs
       Note about this option: added in 21.12 and improved in 22.05.

       This module serves a simple page for the Converse XMPP web browser
       client.

       To use this module, in addition to adding it to the modules section,
       you must also enable it in listen → ejabberd_http →
       listen-options.md#request_handlers|request_handlers.

       Make sure either mod_bosh or
       listen.md#ejabberd_http_ws|ejabberd_http_ws are enabled in at least one
       request_handlers.

       When conversejs_css and conversejs_script are auto, by default they
       point to the public Converse client.

       Available options:

           bosh_service_url: auto | BoshURL
               BOSH service URL to which Converse can connect to. The keyword
               @HOST@ is replaced with the real virtual host name. If set to
               auto, it will build the URL of the first configured BOSH
               request handler. The default value is auto.

           conversejs_css: auto | URL
               Converse CSS URL. The keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the
               hostname. The default value is auto.

           conversejs_options: {Name: Value}
               Note about this option: added in 22.05. Specify additional
               options to be passed to Converse. See Converse configuration.
               Only boolean, integer and string values are supported; lists
               are not supported.

           conversejs_resources: Path
               Note about this option: added in 22.05. Local path to the
               Converse files. If not set, the public Converse client will be
               used instead.

           conversejs_script: auto | URL
               Converse main script URL. The keyword @HOST@ is replaced with
               the hostname. The default value is auto.

           default_domain: Domain
               Specify a domain to act as the default for user JIDs. The
               keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the hostname. The default value
               is @HOST@.

           websocket_url: auto | WebSocketURL
               A WebSocket URL to which Converse can connect to. The @HOST@
               keyword is replaced with the real virtual host name. If set to
               auto, it will build the URL of the first configured WebSocket
               request handler. The default value is auto.

       Examples:

           Manually setup WebSocket url, and use the public Converse client:

               listen:
                 -
                   port: 5280
                   module: ejabberd_http
                   request_handlers:
                     /bosh: mod_bosh
                     /websocket: ejabberd_http_ws
                     /conversejs: mod_conversejs

               modules:
                 mod_bosh: {}
                 mod_conversejs:
                   websocket_url: "ws://@HOST@:5280/websocket"

           Host Converse locally and let auto detection of WebSocket and
           Converse URLs:

               listen:
                 -
                   port: 443

   mod_delegation
       This module is an implementation of XEP-0355: Namespace Delegation.
       Only admin mode has been implemented by now. Namespace delegation
       allows external services to handle IQ using specific namespace. This
       may be applied for external PEP service.

           Warning

           Security issue: Namespace delegation gives components access to
           sensitive data, so permission should be granted carefully, only if
           you trust the component.

           Note

           This module is complementary to mod_privilege but can also be used
           separately.

       Available options:

           namespaces: {Namespace: Options}
               If you want to delegate namespaces to a component, specify them
               in this option, and associate them to an access rule. The
               Options are:

               access: AccessName
                   The option defines which components are allowed for
                   namespace delegation. The default value is none.

               filtering: Attributes
                   The list of attributes. Currently not used.

       Examples:

           Make sure you do not delegate the same namespace to several
           services at the same time. As in the example provided later, to
           have the sat-pubsub.example.org component perform correctly disable
           the mod_pubsub module.

               access_rules:
                 external_pubsub:
                   allow: external_component
                 external_mam:
                   allow: external_component

               acl:
                 external_component:
                   server: sat-pubsub.example.org

               modules:
                 mod_delegation:
                   namespaces:
                     urn:xmpp:mam:1:
                       access: external_mam

                       access: external_pubsub

   mod_disco
       This module adds support for XEP-0030: Service Discovery. With this
       module enabled, services on your server can be discovered by XMPP
       clients.

       Available options:

           extra_domains: [Domain, ...]
               With this option, you can specify a list of extra domains that
               are added to the Service Discovery item list. The default value
               is an empty list.

           name: Name
               A name of the server in the Service Discovery. This will only
               be displayed by special XMPP clients. The default value is
               ejabberd.

           server_info: [Info, ...]
               Specify additional information about the server, as described
               in XEP-0157: Contact Addresses for XMPP Services. Every Info
               element in the list is constructed from the following options:

               modules: all | [Module, ...]
                   The value can be the keyword all, in which case the
                   information is reported in all the services, or a list of
                   ejabberd modules, in which case the information is only
                   specified for the services provided by those modules.

               name: Name
                   The field var name that will be defined. See XEP-0157 for
                   some standardized names.

               urls: [URI, ...]
                   A list of contact URIs, such as HTTP URLs, XMPP URIs and so
                   on.

               Example:

                   server_info:
                     -
                       modules: all
                       name: abuse-addresses
                       urls: ["mailto:abuse@shakespeare.lit"]
                     -
                       modules: [mod_muc]
                       name: "Web chatroom logs"
                       urls: ["http://www.example.org/muc-logs"]
                     -
                       modules: [mod_disco]
                       name: feedback-addresses
                       urls:
                         - http://shakespeare.lit/feedback.php
                         - mailto:feedback@shakespeare.lit
                         - xmpp:feedback@shakespeare.lit
                     -
                       modules:
                         - mod_disco
                         - mod_vcard
                       name: admin-addresses
                       urls:
                         - mailto:xmpp@shakespeare.lit
                         - xmpp:admins@shakespeare.lit

   mod_fail2ban
       The module bans IPs that show the malicious signs. Currently only C2S
       authentication failures are detected.

       Unlike the standalone program, mod_fail2ban clears the record of
       authentication failures after some time since the first failure or on a
       successful authentication. It also does not simply block network
       traffic, but provides the client with a descriptive error message.

           Warning

           You should not use this module behind a proxy or load balancer.
           ejabberd will see the failures as coming from the load balancer
           and, when the threshold of auth failures is reached, will reject
           all connections coming from the load balancer. You can lock all
           your user base out of ejabberd when using this module behind a
           proxy.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               Specify an access rule for whitelisting IP addresses or
               networks. If the rule returns allow for a given IP address,
               that address will never be banned. The AccessName should be of
               type ip. The default value is none.

           c2s_auth_ban_lifetime: timeout()
               The lifetime of the IP ban caused by too many C2S
               authentication failures. The default value is 1 hour.

           c2s_max_auth_failures: Number
               The number of C2S authentication failures to trigger the IP
               ban. The default value is 20.

   mod_host_meta
       Note about this option: added in 22.05.

       This module serves small host-meta files as described in XEP-0156:
       Discovering Alternative XMPP Connection Methods.

       To use this module, in addition to adding it to the modules section,
       you must also enable it in listen → ejabberd_http →
       listen-options.md#request_handlers|request_handlers.

       Notice it only works if listen.md#ejabberd_http|ejabberd_http has
       listen-options.md#tls|tls enabled.

       Available options:

           bosh_service_url: undefined | auto | BoshURL
               BOSH service URL to announce. The keyword @HOST@ is replaced
               with the real virtual host name. If set to auto, it will build
               the URL of the first configured BOSH request handler. The
               default value is auto.

           websocket_url: undefined | auto | WebSocketURL
               WebSocket URL to announce. The keyword @HOST@ is replaced with
               the real virtual host name. If set to auto, it will build the
               URL of the first configured WebSocket request handler. The
               default value is auto.

       Example:

               listen:
                 -
                   port: 443
                   module: ejabberd_http
                   tls: true
                   request_handlers:
                     /bosh: mod_bosh
                     /ws: ejabberd_http_ws
                     /.well-known/host-meta: mod_host_meta
                     /.well-known/host-meta.json: mod_host_meta

               modules:
                 mod_bosh: {}
                 mod_host_meta:
                   bosh_service_url: "https://@HOST@:5443/bosh"
                   websocket_url: "wss://@HOST@:5443/ws"

   mod_http_api
       This module provides a ReST interface to call
       ../../developer/ejabberd-api/index.md|ejabberd API commands using JSON
       data.

       To use this module, in addition to adding it to the modules section,
       you must also enable it in listen → ejabberd_http →
       listen-options.md#request_handlers|request_handlers.

       To use a specific API version N, when defining the URL path in the
       request_handlers, add a vN. For example: /api/v2: mod_http_api.

       To run a command, send a POST request to the corresponding URL:
       http://localhost:5280/api/COMMAND-NAME

       Available options:

           default_version: integer() | string()
               Note about this option: added in 24.12. What API version to use
               when none is specified in the URL path. If setting an ejabberd
               version, it will use the latest API version that was available
               in that ejabberd version. For example, setting "24.06" in this
               option implies 2. The default value is the latest version.

       Example:

               listen:
                 -
                   port: 5280
                   module: ejabberd_http
                   request_handlers:
                     /api: mod_http_api

               modules:
                 mod_http_api:
                   default_version: 2

   mod_http_fileserver
       This simple module serves files from the local disk over HTTP.

       Available options:

           accesslog: Path
               File to log accesses using an Apache-like format. No log will
               be recorded if this option is not specified.

           content_types: {Extension: Type}
               Specify mappings of extension to content type. There are
               several content types already defined. With this option you can
               add new definitions or modify existing ones. The default values
               are:

               Example:

                   content_types:
                     .css: text/css
                     .gif: image/gif
                     .html: text/html
                     .jar: application/java-archive
                     .jpeg: image/jpeg
                     .jpg: image/jpeg
                     .js: text/javascript
                     .png: image/png
                     .svg: image/svg+xml
                     .txt: text/plain
                     .xml: application/xml
                     .xpi: application/x-xpinstall
                     .xul: application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml

           custom_headers: {Name: Value}
               Indicate custom HTTP headers to be included in all responses.
               There are no custom headers by default.

           default_content_type: Type
               Specify the content type to use for unknown extensions. The
               default value is application/octet-stream.

           directory_indices: [Index, ...]
               Indicate one or more directory index files, similarly to
               Apache’s DirectoryIndex variable. When an HTTP request hits a
               directory instead of a regular file, those directory indices
               are looked in order, and the first one found is returned. The
               default value is an empty list.

           docroot: Path
               Directory to serve the files from. This is a mandatory option.

           must_authenticate_with: [{Username, Hostname}, ...]
               List of accounts that are allowed to use this service. Default
               value: [].

       Examples:

   mod_http_upload
       This module allows for requesting permissions to upload a file via HTTP
       as described in XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload. If the request is accepted,
       the client receives a URL for uploading the file and another URL from
       which that file can later be downloaded.

       In order to use this module, it must be enabled in listen →
       ejabberd_http → listen-options.md#request_handlers|request_handlers.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               This option defines the access rule to limit who is permitted
               to use the HTTP upload service. The default value is local. If
               no access rule of that name exists, no user will be allowed to
               use the service.

           custom_headers: {Name: Value}
               This option specifies additional header fields to be included
               in all HTTP responses. By default no custom headers are
               included.

           dir_mode: Permission
               This option defines the permission bits of the docroot
               directory and any directories created during file uploads. The
               bits are specified as an octal number (see the chmod(1) manual
               page) within double quotes. For example: "0755". The default is
               undefined, which means no explicit permissions will be set.

           docroot: Path
               Uploaded files are stored below the directory specified (as an
               absolute path) with this option. The keyword @HOME@ is replaced
               with the home directory of the user running ejabberd, and the
               keyword @HOST@ with the virtual host name. The default value is
               "@HOME@/upload".

           external_secret: Text
               This option makes it possible to offload all HTTP Upload
               processing to a separate HTTP server. Both ejabberd and the
               HTTP server should share this secret and behave exactly as
               described at Prosody’s mod_http_upload_external:
               Implementation. There is no default value.

           file_mode: Permission
               This option defines the permission bits of uploaded files. The
               bits are specified as an octal number (see the chmod(1) manual
               page) within double quotes. For example: "0644". The default is
               undefined, which means no explicit permissions will be set.

           get_url: URL
               This option specifies the initial part of the GET URLs used for
               downloading the files. The default value is undefined. When
               this option is undefined, this option is set to the same value
               as put_url. The keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the virtual
               host name. NOTE: if GET requests are handled by this module,
               the get_url must match the put_url. Setting it to a different
               value only makes sense if an external web server or
               mod_http_fileserver is used to serve the uploaded files.

           host
               Deprecated. Use hosts instead.

           hosts: [Host, ...]
               This option defines the Jabber IDs of the service. If the hosts
               option is not specified, the only Jabber ID will be the
               hostname of the virtual host with the prefix "upload.". The
               keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the real virtual host name.

           jid_in_url: node | sha1
               When this option is set to node, the node identifier of the
               user’s JID (i.e., the user name) is included in the GET and PUT
               URLs generated by mod_http_upload. Otherwise, a SHA-1 hash of
               the user’s bare JID is included instead. The default value is
               sha1.

           max_size: Size
               This option limits the acceptable file size. Either a number of
               bytes (larger than zero) or infinity must be specified. The
               default value is 104857600.

           name: Name
               A name of the service in the Service Discovery. The default
               value is "HTTP File Upload". Please note this will only be
               displayed by some XMPP clients.

           put_url: URL
               This option specifies the initial part of the PUT URLs used for
               file uploads. The keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the virtual
               host name. NOTE: different virtual hosts cannot use the same
               PUT URL. The default value is "https://@HOST@:5443/upload".

           rm_on_unregister: true | false
               This option specifies whether files uploaded by a user should
               be removed when that user is unregistered. The default value is
               true.

           secret_length: Length
               This option defines the length of the random string included in
               the GET and PUT URLs generated by mod_http_upload. The minimum
               length is 8 characters, but it is recommended to choose a
               larger value. The default value is 40.

           service_url
               Deprecated.

           thumbnail: true | false
               This option specifies whether ejabberd should create thumbnails
               of uploaded images. If a thumbnail is created, a <thumbnail/>
               element that contains the download <uri/> and some metadata is
               returned with the PUT response. The default value is false.

           vcard: vCard
               A custom vCard of the service that will be displayed by some
               XMPP clients in Service Discovery. The value of vCard is a YAML
               map constructed from an XML representation of vCard. Since the
               representation has no attributes, the mapping is
               straightforward.

               Example:

                   # This XML representation of vCard:
                   #   <vCard xmlns='vcard-temp'>
                   #     <FN>Conferences</FN>
                   #     <ADR>
                   #       <WORK/>
                   #       <STREET>Elm Street</STREET>
                   #     </ADR>
                   #   </vCard>
                   #
                   # is translated to:
                   vcard:
                     fn: Conferences
                     adr:
                       -
                         work: true
                         street: Elm Street

       Example:

               listen:
                 -
                   port: 5443
                   module: ejabberd_http
                   tls: true
                   request_handlers:
                     /upload: mod_http_upload

               modules:
                 mod_http_upload:
                   docroot: /ejabberd/upload
                   put_url: "https://@HOST@:5443/upload"

   mod_http_upload_quota
       This module adds quota support for mod_http_upload.

       This module depends on mod_http_upload.

       Available options:

           access_hard_quota: AccessName
               This option defines which access rule is used to specify the
               "hard quota" for the matching JIDs. That rule must yield a
               positive number for any JID that is supposed to have a quota
               limit. This is the number of megabytes a corresponding user may
               upload. When this threshold is exceeded, ejabberd deletes the
               oldest files uploaded by that user until their disk usage
               equals or falls below the specified soft quota (see also option
               access_soft_quota). The default value is hard_upload_quota.

           access_soft_quota: AccessName
               This option defines which access rule is used to specify the
               "soft quota" for the matching JIDs. That rule must yield a
               positive number of megabytes for any JID that is supposed to
               have a quota limit. See the description of the
               access_hard_quota option for details. The default value is
               soft_upload_quota.

           max_days: Days
               If a number larger than zero is specified, any files (and
               directories) older than this number of days are removed from
               the subdirectories of the docroot directory, once per day. The
               default value is infinity.

       Examples:

           Notice it’s not necessary to specify the access_hard_quota and
           access_soft_quota options in order to use the quota feature. You
           can stick to the default names and just specify access rules such
           as those in this example:

               shaper_rules:
                 soft_upload_quota:
                   1000: all # MiB
                 hard_upload_quota:
                   1100: all # MiB

               modules:
                 mod_http_upload: {}
                 mod_http_upload_quota:
                   max_days: 100

   mod_jidprep
       This module allows XMPP clients to ask the server to normalize a JID as
       per the rules specified in RFC 6122: XMPP Address Format. This might be
       useful for clients in certain constrained environments, or for testing
       purposes.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               This option defines which access rule will be used to control
               who is allowed to use this service. The default value is local.

   mod_last
       This module adds support for XEP-0012: Last Activity. It can be used to
       discover when a disconnected user last accessed the server, to know
       when a connected user was last active on the server, or to query the
       uptime of the ejabberd server.

       Available options:

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

   mod_legacy_auth
       The module implements XEP-0078: Non-SASL Authentication.

           Note

           This type of authentication was obsoleted in 2008 and you unlikely
           need this module unless you have something like outdated Jabber
           bots.

       The module has no options.

   mod_mam
       This module implements XEP-0313: Message Archive Management and
       XEP-0441: Message Archive Management Preferences. Compatible XMPP
       clients can use it to store their chat history on the server.

           Note

           Mnesia backend for mod_mam is not recommended: it’s limited to 2GB
           and often gets corrupted when reaching this limit. SQL backend is
           recommended. Namely, for small servers SQLite is a preferred choice
           because it’s very easy to configure.

       Available options:

           access_preferences: AccessName
               This access rule defines who is allowed to modify the MAM
               preferences. The default value is all.

           assume_mam_usage: true | false
               This option determines how ejabberd’s stream management code
               (see mod_stream_mgmt) handles unacknowledged messages when the
               connection is lost. Usually, such messages are either bounced
               or resent. However, neither is done for messages that were
               stored in the user’s MAM archive if this option is set to true.
               In this case, ejabberd assumes those messages will be retrieved
               from the archive. The default value is false.

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           clear_archive_on_room_destroy: true | false
               Whether to destroy message archive of a room (see mod_muc) when
               it gets destroyed. The default value is true.

           compress_xml: true | false
               When enabled, new messages added to archives are compressed
               using a custom compression algorithm. This feature works only
               with SQL backends. The default value is false.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           default: always | never | roster
               The option defines default policy for chat history. When always
               is set every chat message is stored. With roster only chat
               history with contacts from user’s roster is stored. And never
               fully disables chat history. Note that a client can change its
               policy via protocol commands. The default value is never.

           request_activates_archiving: true | false
               If the value is true, no messages are stored for a user until
               their client issue a MAM request, regardless of the value of
               the default option. Once the server received a request, that
               user’s messages are archived as usual. The default value is
               false.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

           user_mucsub_from_muc_archive: true | false
               When this option is disabled, for each individual subscriber a
               separate mucsub message is stored. With this option enabled,
               when a user fetches archive virtual mucsub, messages are
               generated from muc archives. The default value is false.

   mod_matrix_gw
       Note about this option: improved in 25.03.

       Matrix gateway. Erlang/OTP 25 or higher is required to use this module.
       This module is available since ejabberd 24.02.

       Available options:

           host: Host
               This option defines the Jabber IDs of the service. If the host
               option is not specified, the Jabber ID will be the hostname of
               the virtual host with the prefix "matrix.". The keyword @HOST@
               is replaced with the real virtual host name.

           key: string()
               Value of the matrix signing key, in base64.

           key_name: string()
               Name of the matrix signing key.

           matrix_domain: Domain
               Specify a domain in the Matrix federation. The keyword @HOST@
               is replaced with the hostname. The default value is @HOST@.

           matrix_id_as_jid: true | false
               If set to true, all packets failing to be delivered via an XMPP
               server-to-server connection will then be routed to the Matrix
               gateway by translating a Jabber ID user@matrixdomain.tld to a
               Matrix user identifier @user:matrixdomain.tld. When set to
               false, messages must be explicitly sent to the matrix gateway
               service Jabber ID to be routed to a remote Matrix server. In
               this case, to send a message to Matrix user
               @user:matrixdomain.tld, the client must send a message to the
               JID user%matrixdomain.tld@matrix.myxmppdomain.tld, where
               matrix.myxmppdomain.tld is the JID of the gateway service as
               set by the host option. The default is false.

       Example:

               listen:
                 -
                   port: 8448
                   module: ejabberd_http
                   tls: true
                   request_handlers:
                     "/_matrix": mod_matrix_gw

               modules:
                 mod_matrix_gw:
                   key_name: "key1"
                   key: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
                   matrix_id_as_jid: true

   mod_metrics
       This module sends events to external backend (by now only grapherl is
       supported). Supported events are:

       •   sm_register_connection

       •   sm_remove_connection

       •   user_send_packet

       When enabled, every call to these hooks triggers a counter event to be
       sent to the external backend.

       Available options:

           ip: IPv4Address
               IPv4 address where the backend is located. The default value is
               127.0.0.1.

           port: Port
               An internet port number at which the backend is listening for
               incoming connections/packets. The default value is 11111.

   mod_mix
       Note about this option: added in 16.03 and improved in 19.02.

       This module is an experimental implementation of XEP-0369: Mediated
       Information eXchange (MIX). It’s asserted that the MIX protocol is
       going to replace the MUC protocol in the future (see mod_muc).

       To learn more about how to use that feature, you can refer to our
       tutorial: ../../tutorials/mix-010.md|Getting started with MIX

       The module depends on mod_mam.

       Available options:

           access_create: AccessName
               An access rule to control MIX channels creations. The default
               value is all.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           host
               Deprecated. Use hosts instead.

           hosts: [Host, ...]
               This option defines the Jabber IDs of the service. If the hosts
               option is not specified, the only Jabber ID will be the
               hostname of the virtual host with the prefix "mix.". The
               keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the real virtual host name.

           name: Name
               A name of the service in the Service Discovery. This will only
               be displayed by special XMPP clients. The default value is
               Channels.

   mod_mix_pam
       This module implements XEP-0405: Mediated Information eXchange (MIX):
       Participant Server Requirements. The module is needed if MIX compatible
       clients on your server are going to join MIX channels (either on your
       server or on any remote servers).

           Note

           mod_mix is not required for this module to work, however, without
           mod_mix_pam the MIX functionality of your local XMPP clients will
           be impaired.

                         "remoteB": "localB" # changes to 'remoteB' on remote server will be stored as 'localB' on local server

   mod_muc
       This module provides support for XEP-0045: Multi-User Chat. Users can
       discover existing rooms, join or create them. Occupants of a room can
       chat in public or have private chats.

       The MUC service allows any Jabber ID to register a nickname, so nobody
       else can use that nickname in any room in the MUC service. To register
       a nickname, open the Service Discovery in your XMPP client and register
       in the MUC service.

       It is also possible to register a nickname in a room, so nobody else
       can use that nickname in that room. If a nick is registered in the MUC
       service, that nick cannot be registered in any room, and vice versa: a
       nick that is registered in a room cannot be registered at the MUC
       service.

       This module supports clustering and load balancing. One module can be
       started per cluster node. Rooms are distributed at creation time on all
       available MUC module instances. The multi-user chat module is clustered
       but the rooms themselves are not clustered nor fault-tolerant: if the
       node managing a set of rooms goes down, the rooms disappear and they
       will be recreated on an available node on first connection attempt.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               You can specify who is allowed to use the Multi-User Chat
               service. By default everyone is allowed to use it.

           access_admin: AccessName
               This option specifies who is allowed to administrate the
               Multi-User Chat service. The default value is none, which means
               that only the room creator can administer their room. The
               administrators can send a normal message to the service JID,
               and it will be shown in all active rooms as a service message.
               The administrators can send a groupchat message to the JID of
               an active room, and the message will be shown in the room as a
               service message.

           access_create: AccessName
               To configure who is allowed to create new rooms at the
               Multi-User Chat service, this option can be used. The default
               value is all, which means everyone is allowed to create rooms.

           access_mam: AccessName
               To configure who is allowed to modify the mam room option. The
               default value is all, which means everyone is allowed to modify
               that option.

           access_persistent: AccessName
               To configure who is allowed to modify the persistent room
               option. The default value is all, which means everyone is
               allowed to modify that option.

           access_register: AccessName
               Note about this option: improved in 23.10. This option
               specifies who is allowed to register nickname within the
               Multi-User Chat service and rooms. The default is all for
               backward compatibility, which means that any user is allowed to
               register any free nick in the MUC service and in the rooms.

           cleanup_affiliations_on_start: true | false
               Note about this option: added in 22.05. Remove affiliations for
               non-existing local users on startup. The default value is
               false.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

               A small history of the current discussion is sent to users when
               they enter the room. With this option you can define the number
               of history messages to keep and send to users joining the room.
               The value is a non-negative integer. Setting the value to 0
               disables the history feature and, as a result, nothing is kept
               in memory. The default value is 20. This value affects all
               rooms on the service. NOTE: modern XMPP clients rely on Message
               Archives (XEP-0313), so feel free to disable the history
               feature if you’re only using modern clients and have mod_mam
               module loaded.

           host
               Deprecated. Use hosts instead.

           hosts: [Host, ...]
               This option defines the Jabber IDs of the service. If the hosts
               option is not specified, the only Jabber ID will be the
               hostname of the virtual host with the prefix "conference.". The
               keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the real virtual host name.

           max_captcha_whitelist: Number
               Note about this option: added in 21.01. This option defines the
               maximum number of characters that Captcha Whitelist can have
               when configuring the room. The default value is infinity.

           max_password: Number
               Note about this option: added in 21.01. This option defines the
               maximum number of characters that Password can have when
               configuring the room. The default value is infinity.

           max_room_desc: Number
               This option defines the maximum number of characters that Room
               Description can have when configuring the room. The default
               value is infinity.

           max_room_id: Number
               This option defines the maximum number of characters that Room
               ID can have when creating a new room. The default value is
               infinity.

           max_room_name: Number
               This option defines the maximum number of characters that Room
               Name can have when configuring the room. The default value is
               infinity.

           max_rooms_discoitems: Number
               When there are more rooms than this Number, only the non-empty
               ones are returned in a Service Discovery query. The default
               value is 100.

           max_user_conferences: Number
               This option defines the maximum number of rooms that any given
               user can join. The default value is 100. This option is used to
               prevent possible abuses. Note that this is a soft limit: some
               users can sometimes join more conferences in cluster
               configurations.

           max_users: Number
               This option defines at the service level, the maximum number of
               users allowed per room. It can be lowered in each room
               configuration but cannot be increased in individual room
               configuration. The default value is 200.

           max_users_admin_threshold: Number
               This option defines the number of service admins or room owners
               allowed to enter the room when the maximum number of allowed
               occupants was reached. The default limit is 5.

           max_users_presence: Number
               This option defines after how many users in the room, it is
               considered overcrowded. When a MUC room is considered
               overcrowded, presence broadcasts are limited to reduce load,
               traffic and excessive presence "storm" received by
               participants. The default value is 1000.

           min_message_interval: Number
               This option defines the minimum interval between two messages
               send by an occupant in seconds. This option is global and valid
               for all rooms. A decimal value can be used. When this option is
               not defined, message rate is not limited. This feature can be
               used to protect a MUC service from occupant abuses and limit
               number of messages that will be broadcasted by the service. A
               good value for this minimum message interval is 0.4 second. If
               an occupant tries to send messages faster, an error is send
               back explaining that the message has been discarded and
               describing the reason why the message is not acceptable.

           min_presence_interval: Number
               This option defines the minimum of time between presence
               changes coming from a given occupant in seconds. This option is
               global and valid for all rooms. A decimal value can be used.
               When this option is not defined, no restriction is applied.
               This option can be used to protect a MUC service for occupants
               abuses. If an occupant tries to change its presence more often
               than the specified interval, the presence is cached by ejabberd
               and only the last presence is broadcasted to all occupants in
               the room after expiration of the interval delay. Intermediate
               presence packets are silently discarded. A good value for this
               option is 4 seconds.

           name: string()
               The value of the service name. This name is only visible in
               some clients that support XEP-0030: Service Discovery. The
               default is Chatrooms.

           preload_rooms: true | false
               Whether to load all persistent rooms in memory on startup. If
               disabled, the room is only loaded on first participant join.
               The default is true. It makes sense to disable room preloading
               when the number of rooms is high: this will improve server
               startup time and memory consumption.

           queue_type: ram | file
               Same as top-level queue_type option, but applied to this module
               only.

           ram_db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_ram_db option, but applied to this
               module only.

           regexp_room_id: string()
               This option defines the regular expression that a Room ID must
               satisfy to allow the room creation. The default value is the
               empty string.

           room_shaper: none | ShaperName
               This option defines shaper for the MUC rooms. The default value
               is none.

           user_message_shaper: none | ShaperName
               This option defines shaper for the users messages. The default
               value is none.

           user_presence_shaper: none | ShaperName
               This option defines shaper for the users presences. The default
               value is none.

           vcard: vCard
               A custom vCard of the service that will be displayed by some
               XMPP clients in Service Discovery. The value of vCard is a YAML
               map constructed from an XML representation of vCard. Since the
               representation has no attributes, the mapping is
               straightforward.

               Example:

                   # This XML representation of vCard:
                   #   <vCard xmlns='vcard-temp'>
                   #     <FN>Conferences</FN>
                   #     <ADR>
                   #       <WORK/>
                   #       <STREET>Elm Street</STREET>
                   #     </ADR>
                   #   </vCard>
                   #
                   # is translated to:
                   vcard:
                     fn: Conferences
                     adr:
                       -
                         work: true
                         street: Elm Street

   mod_muc_admin
       This module provides commands to administer local MUC services and
       their MUC rooms. It also provides simple WebAdmin pages to view the
       existing rooms.

       This module depends on mod_muc.

       Available options:

           subscribe_room_many_max_users: Number
               Note about this option: added in 22.05. How many users can be
               subscribed to a room at once using the subscribe_room_many API.
               The default value is 50.

   mod_muc_log
       This module enables optional logging of Multi-User Chat (MUC) public
       conversations to HTML. Once you enable this module, users can join a
       room using a MUC capable XMPP client, and if they have enough
       privileges, they can request the configuration form in which they can
       set the option to enable room logging.

       Features:

       •   Room details are added on top of each page: room title, JID,
           author, subject and configuration.

       •   The room JID in the generated HTML is a link to join the room
           (using XMPP URI).

       •   Subject and room configuration changes are tracked and displayed.

       •   Joins, leaves, nick changes, kicks, bans and /me are tracked and
           displayed, including the reason if available.

       •   Generated HTML files are XHTML 1.0 Transitional and CSS compliant.

       •   Timestamps are self-referencing links.

       •   Links on top for quicker navigation: Previous day, Next day, Up.

       •   CSS is used for style definition, and a custom CSS file can be
           used.

       •   URLs on messages and subjects are converted to hyperlinks.

       •   Timezone used on timestamps is shown on the log files.

       •   A custom link can be added on top of each page.

       The module depends on mod_muc.

       Available options:

           access_log: AccessName
               This option restricts which occupants are allowed to enable or
               disable room logging. The default value is muc_admin. NOTE: for
               this default setting you need to have an access rule for
               muc_admin in order to take effect.

           cssfile: Path | URL
               With this option you can set whether the HTML files should have
               a custom CSS file or if they need to use the embedded CSS.
               Allowed values are either Path to local file or an URL to a
               remote file. By default a predefined CSS will be embedded into
               the HTML page.

           dirname: room_jid | room_name
               Configure the name of the room directory. If set to room_jid,
               the room directory name will be the full room JID. Otherwise,
               the room directory name will be only the room name, not
               including the MUC service name. The default value is room_jid.

           dirtype: subdirs | plain
               The type of the created directories can be specified with this
               option. If set to subdirs, subdirectories are created for each
               year and month. Otherwise, the names of the log files contain
               the full date, and there are no subdirectories. The default
               value is subdirs.

           file_format: html | plaintext
               Define the format of the log files: html stores in HTML format,
               plaintext stores in plain text. The default value is html.

           file_permissions: {mode: Mode, group: Group}
               Define the permissions that must be used when creating the log
               files: the number of the mode, and the numeric id of the group
               that will own the files. The default value is shown in the
               example below:

               Example:

                   file_permissions:
                     mode: 644
                     group: 33

           outdir: Path
               This option sets the full path to the directory in which the
               HTML files should be stored. Make sure the ejabberd daemon user
               has write access on that directory. The default value is
               www/muc.

           spam_prevention: true | false
               If set to true, a special attribute is added to links that
               prevent their indexation by search engines. The default value
               is true, which mean that nofollow attributes will be added to
               user submitted links.

           timezone: local | universal
               The time zone for the logs is configurable with this option. If
               set to local, the local time, as reported to Erlang emulator by
               the operating system, will be used. Otherwise, UTC time will be
               used. The default value is local.

           top_link: {URL: Text}
               With this option you can customize the link on the top right
               corner of each log file. The default value is shown in the
               example below:

               Example:

                   top_link:
                     /: Home

           url: URL
               A top level URL where a client can access logs of a particular
               conference. The conference name is appended to the URL if
               dirname option is set to room_name or a conference JID is
               appended to the URL otherwise. There is no default value.

   mod_muc_occupantid
       Note about this option: added in 23.10.

       This module implements XEP-0421: Anonymous unique occupant identifiers
       for MUCs.

       When the module is enabled, the feature is enabled in all
       semi-anonymous rooms.

       The module has no options.

   mod_muc_rtbl
       Note about this option: added in 23.04.

       This module implement Real-time blocklists for MUC rooms.

       It works by observing remote pubsub node conforming with specification
       described in https://xmppbl.org/.

       Available options:

           rtbl_node: PubsubNodeName
               Name of pubsub node that should be used to track blocked users.
               The default value is muc_bans_sha256.

           rtbl_server: Domain
               Domain of xmpp server that serves block list. The default value
               is xmppbl.org

   mod_multicast
       This module implements a service for XEP-0033: Extended Stanza
       Addressing.

       Available options:

           access: Access
               The access rule to restrict who can send packets to the
               multicast service. Default value: all.

           host
               Deprecated. Use hosts instead.

           hosts: [Host, ...]
               This option defines the Jabber IDs of the service. If the hosts
               option is not specified, the only Jabber ID will be the
               hostname of the virtual host with the prefix "multicast.". The
               keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the real virtual host name. The
               default value is multicast.@HOST@.

           limits: Sender: Stanza: Number
               Specify a list of custom limits which override the default ones
               defined in XEP-0033. Limits are defined per sender type and
               stanza type, where:

               •   sender can be: local or remote.

               •   stanza can be: message or presence.

               •   number can be a positive integer or infinite.

                   Example:

                       # Default values:
                       local:
                         message: 100
                         presence: 100
                       remote:
                         message: 20
                         presence: 20

           name
               Service name to provide in the Info query to the Service
               Discovery. Default is "Multicast".

           vcard
               vCard element to return when queried. Default value is
               undefined.

       Example:

               # Only admins can send packets to multicast service
               access_rules:
                 multicast:
                   - allow: admin

               # If you want to allow all your users:
               access_rules:
                 multicast:
                   - allow

               # This allows both admins and remote users to send packets,
               # but does not allow local users
               acl:
                 allservers:
                   server_glob: "*"
               access_rules:
                 multicast:
                   - allow: admin
                   - deny: local
                   - allow: allservers

               modules:
                 mod_multicast:
                    host: multicast.example.org
                    access: multicast
                    limits:
                      local:
                        message: 40
                        presence: infinite
                      remote:
                        message: 150

   mod_offline
       This module implements XEP-0160: Best Practices for Handling Offline
       Messages and XEP-0013: Flexible Offline Message Retrieval. This means
       that all messages sent to an offline user will be stored on the server
       until that user comes online again. Thus it is very similar to how
       email works. A user is considered offline if no session presence
       priority > 0 are currently open.

       The delete_expired_messages API allows to delete expired messages, and
       delete_old_messages API deletes older ones.

       Available options:

           access_max_user_messages: AccessName
               This option defines which access rule will be enforced to limit
               the maximum number of offline messages that a user can have
               (quota). When a user has too many offline messages, any new
               messages that they receive are discarded, and a
               <resource-constraint/> error is returned to the sender. The
               default value is max_user_offline_messages.

           bounce_groupchat: true | false
               This option is use the disable an optimization that avoids
               bouncing error messages when groupchat messages could not be
               stored as offline. It will reduce chat room load, without any
               drawback in standard use cases. You may change default value
               only if you have a custom module which uses offline hook after
               mod_offline. This option can be useful for both standard MUC
               and MucSub, but the bounce is much more likely to happen in the
               context of MucSub, so it is even more important to have it on
               large MucSub services. The default value is false, meaning the
               optimization is enabled.

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           store_empty_body: true | false | unless_chat_state
               Whether or not to store messages that lack a <body/> element.
               The default value is unless_chat_state, which tells ejabberd to
               store messages even if they lack the <body/> element, unless
               they only contain a chat state notification (as defined in
               XEP-0085: Chat State Notifications.

           store_groupchat: true | false
               Whether or not to store groupchat messages. The default value
               is false.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

           use_mam_for_storage: true | false
               This is an experimental option. By enabling the option, this
               module uses the archive table from mod_mam instead of its own
               spool table to retrieve the messages received when the user was
               offline. This allows client developers to slowly drop XEP-0160
               and rely on XEP-0313 instead. It also further reduces the
               storage required when you enable MucSub. Enabling this option
               has a known drawback for the moment: most of flexible message
               retrieval queries don’t work (those that allow
               retrieval/deletion of messages by id), but this specification
               is not widely used. The default value is false to keep former
               behaviour as default.

       Examples:

           This example allows power users to have as much as 5000 offline
           messages, administrators up to 2000, and all the other users up to
           100:

               acl:
                 admin:
                   user:
                     - admin1@localhost
                     - admin2@example.org
                 poweruser:
                   user:
                     - bob@example.org
                     - jane@example.org

               shaper_rules:
                 max_user_offline_messages:
                   - 5000: poweruser
                   - 2000: admin
                   - 100

               modules:
                 ...
                 mod_offline:
                   access_max_user_messages: max_user_offline_messages
                 ...

   mod_ping
       This module implements support for XEP-0199: XMPP Ping and periodic
       keepalives. When this module is enabled ejabberd responds correctly to
       ping requests, as defined by the protocol.

       Available options:

           ping_ack_timeout: timeout()
               How long to wait before deeming that a client has not answered
               a given server ping request. NOTE: when mod_stream_mgmt is
               loaded and stream management is enabled by a client, this value
               is ignored, and the ack_timeout applies instead. The default
               value is undefined.

           ping_interval: timeout()
               How often to send pings to connected clients, if option
               send_pings is set to true. If a client connection does not send
               or receive any stanza within this interval, a ping request is
               sent to the client. The default value is 1 minute.

           send_pings: true | false
               If this option is set to true, the server sends pings to
               connected clients that are not active in a given interval
               defined in ping_interval option. This is useful to keep client
               connections alive or checking availability. The default value
               is false.

           timeout_action: none | kill
               What to do when a client does not answer to a server ping
               request in less than period defined in ping_ack_timeout option:
               kill means destroying the underlying connection, none means to
               do nothing. NOTE: when mod_stream_mgmt is loaded and stream
               management is enabled by a client, killing the client
               connection doesn’t mean killing the client session - the
               session will be kept alive in order to give the client a chance
               to resume it. The default value is none.

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_ping:
                   send_pings: true
                   ping_interval: 4 min
                   timeout_action: kill

   mod_pres_counter
       This module detects flood/spam in presence subscriptions traffic. If a
       user sends or receives more of those stanzas in a given time interval,
       the exceeding stanzas are silently dropped, and a warning is logged.

       Available options:

           count: Number
               The number of subscription presence stanzas (subscribe,
               unsubscribe, subscribed, unsubscribed) allowed for any
               direction (input or output) per time defined in interval
               option. Please note that two users subscribing to each other
               usually generate 4 stanzas, so the recommended value is 4 or
               more. The default value is 5.

           interval: timeout()
               The time interval. The default value is 1 minute.

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_pres_counter:
                   count: 5
                   interval: 30 secs

   mod_privacy
       This module implements XEP-0016: Privacy Lists.

           Note

           Nowadays modern XMPP clients rely on XEP-0191: Blocking Command
           which is implemented by mod_blocking. However, you still need
           mod_privacy loaded in order for mod_blocking to work.

       Available options:

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

   mod_private
       This module adds support for XEP-0049: Private XML Storage.

       Using this method, XMPP entities can store private data on the server,
       retrieve it whenever necessary and share it between multiple connected
       clients of the same user. The data stored might be anything, as long as
       it is a valid XML. One typical usage is storing a bookmark of all
       user’s conferences (XEP-0048: Bookmarks).

       It also implements the bookmark conversion described in XEP-0402: PEP
       Native Bookmarks, see bookmarks_to_pep API.

       Available options:

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

   mod_privilege
       Note about this option: improved in 24.10.

       This module is an implementation of XEP-0356: Privileged Entity. This
       extension allows components to have privileged access to other entity
       data (send messages on behalf of the server or on behalf of a user,
       get/set user roster, access presence information, etc.). This may be
       used to write powerful external components, for example implementing an
       external PEP or MAM service.

       By default a component does not have any privileged access. It is worth
       noting that the permissions grant access to the component to a specific
       data type for all users of the virtual host on which mod_privilege is
       loaded.

       Make sure you have a listener configured to connect your component.
       Check the section about listening ports for more information.

           Warning

           Security issue: Privileged access gives components access to
           sensitive data, so permission should be granted carefully, only if
           you trust a component.

           Note

           This module is complementary to mod_delegation, but can also be
           used separately.

       Available options:

           iq: {Namespace: Options}
               This option defines namespaces and their IQ permissions. By
               default no permissions are given. The Options are:

               both: AccessName
                   Allows sending IQ stanzas of type get and set. The default
                   value is none.

               get: AccessName
                   Allows sending IQ stanzas of type get. The default value is
                   none.

               set: AccessName
                   Allows sending IQ stanzas of type set. The default value is
                   none.

           message: Options
               This option defines permissions for messages. By default no
               permissions are given. The Options are:

               outgoing: AccessName
                   The option defines an access rule for sending outgoing
                   messages by the component. The default value is none.

           presence: Options
               This option defines permissions for presences. By default no
               permissions are given. The Options are:

               managed_entity: AccessName
                   An access rule that gives permissions to the component to
                   receive server presences. The default value is none.

               roster: AccessName
                   An access rule that gives permissions to the component to
                   receive the presence of both the users and the contacts in
                   their roster. The default value is none.

           roster: Options
               This option defines roster permissions. By default no
               permissions are given. The Options are:

               both: AccessName
                   Sets read/write access to a user’s roster. The default
                   value is none.

               get: AccessName
                   Sets read access to a user’s roster. The default value is
                   none.

               set: AccessName
                   Sets write access to a user’s roster. The default value is
                   none.

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_privilege:
                   iq:
                     http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub:
                       get: all
                   roster:
                     get: all
                   presence:
                     managed_entity: all
                   message:
                     outgoing: all

   mod_proxy65
       This module implements XEP-0065: SOCKS5 Bytestreams. It allows ejabberd
       to act as a file transfer proxy between two XMPP clients.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               Defines an access rule for file transfer initiators. The
               default value is all. You may want to restrict access to the
               users of your server only, in order to avoid abusing your proxy
               by the users of remote servers.

           auth_type: anonymous | plain
               SOCKS5 authentication type. The default value is anonymous. If
               set to plain, ejabberd will use authentication backend as it
               would for SASL PLAIN.

           host
               Deprecated. Use hosts instead.

           hostname: Host
               Defines a hostname offered by the proxy when establishing a
               session with clients. This is useful when you run the proxy
               behind a NAT. The keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the virtual
               host name. The default is to use the value of ip option.
               Examples: proxy.mydomain.org, 200.150.100.50.

           hosts: [Host, ...]
               This option defines the Jabber IDs of the service. If the hosts
               option is not specified, the only Jabber ID will be the
               hostname of the virtual host with the prefix "proxy.". The
               keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the real virtual host name.

           ip: IPAddress
               This option specifies which network interface to listen for.
               The default value is an IP address of the service’s DNS name,
               or, if fails, 127.0.0.1.

           max_connections: pos_integer() | infinity
               Maximum number of active connections per file transfer
               initiator. The default value is infinity.

           name: Name
               The value of the service name. This name is only visible in
               some clients that support XEP-0030: Service Discovery. The
               default is "SOCKS5 Bytestreams".

           port: 1..65535
               A port number to listen for incoming connections. The default
               value is 7777.

           ram_db_type: mnesia | redis | sql
               Same as top-level default_ram_db option, but applied to this
               module only.

           recbuf: Size
               A size of the buffer for incoming packets. If you define a
               shaper, set the value of this option to the size of the shaper
               in order to avoid traffic spikes in file transfers. The default
               value is 65536 bytes.

           shaper: Shaper
               This option defines a shaper for the file transfer peers. A
               shaper with the maximum bandwidth will be selected. The default
               is none, i.e. no shaper.

           sndbuf: Size
               A size of the buffer for outgoing packets. If you define a
               shaper, set the value of this option to the size of the shaper
               in order to avoid traffic spikes in file transfers. The default
               value is 65536 bytes.

           vcard: vCard
               A custom vCard of the service that will be displayed by some
               XMPP clients in Service Discovery. The value of vCard is a YAML
               map constructed from an XML representation of vCard. Since the
               representation has no attributes, the mapping is
               straightforward.

       Example:

               acl:
                 admin:
                   user: admin@example.org
                 proxy_users:
                   server: example.org

               access_rules:
                 proxy65_access:
                   allow: proxy_users

               shaper_rules:
                 proxy65_shaper:
                   none: admin
                 proxyrate: proxy_users

               shaper:
                 proxyrate: 10240

               modules:
                 mod_proxy65:
                   host: proxy1.example.org
                   name: "File Transfer Proxy"
                   ip: 200.150.100.1
                   port: 7778
                   max_connections: 5
                   access: proxy65_access
                   shaper: proxy65_shaper
                   recbuf: 10240
                   sndbuf: 10240

   mod_pubsub
       This module offers a service for XEP-0060: Publish-Subscribe. The
       functionality in mod_pubsub can be extended using plugins. The plugin
       that implements PEP (XEP-0163: Personal Eventing via Pubsub) is enabled
       in the default ejabberd configuration file, and it requires mod_caps.

       Available options:

           access_createnode: AccessName
               This option restricts which users are allowed to create pubsub
               nodes using acl and access. By default any account in the local
               ejabberd server is allowed to create pubsub nodes. The default
               value is: all.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           default_node_config: List of Key:Value
               To override default node configuration, regardless of node
               plugin. Value is a list of key-value definition. Node
               configuration still uses default configuration defined by node
               plugin, and overrides any items by value defined in this
               configurable list.

           force_node_config: List of Node and the list of its Key:Value
               Define the configuration for given nodes. The default value is:
               [].

               Example:

                   force_node_config:
                     ## Avoid buggy clients to make their bookmarks public
                     storage:bookmarks:
                       access_model: whitelist

           host
               Deprecated. Use hosts instead.

           hosts: [Host, ...]
               This option defines the Jabber IDs of the service. If the hosts
               option is not specified, the only Jabber ID will be the
               hostname of the virtual host with the prefix "pubsub.". The
               keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the real virtual host name.

           ignore_pep_from_offline: false | true
               To specify whether or not we should get last published PEP
               items from users in our roster which are offline when we
               connect. Value is true or false. If not defined, pubsub assumes
               true so we only get last items of online contacts.

           last_item_cache: false | true
               To specify whether or not pubsub should cache last items. Value
               is true or false. If not defined, pubsub does not cache last
               items. On systems with not so many nodes, caching last items
               speeds up pubsub and allows you to raise the user connection
               rate. The cost is memory usage, as every item is stored in
               memory.

           max_item_expire_node: timeout() | infinity
               Note about this option: added in 21.12. Specify the maximum
               item epiry time. Default value is: infinity.

           max_items_node: non_neg_integer() | infinity
               Define the maximum number of items that can be stored in a
               node. Default value is: 1000.

           max_nodes_discoitems: pos_integer() | infinity
               The maximum number of nodes to return in a discoitem response.
               The default value is: 100.

           max_subscriptions_node: MaxSubs
               Define the maximum number of subscriptions managed by a node.
               Default value is no limitation: undefined.

           name: Name
               The value of the service name. This name is only visible in
               some clients that support XEP-0030: Service Discovery. The
               default is vCard User Search.

           nodetree: Nodetree
               To specify which nodetree to use. If not defined, the default
               pubsub nodetree is used: tree. Only one nodetree can be used
               per host, and is shared by all node plugins.

               •   tree nodetree store node configuration and relations on the
                   database.  flat nodes are stored without any relationship,
                   and hometree nodes can have child nodes.

               •   virtual nodetree does not store nodes on database. This
                   saves resources on systems with tons of nodes. If using the
                   virtual nodetree, you can only enable those node plugins:
                   [flat, pep] or [flat]; any other plugins configuration will
                   not work. Also, all nodes will have the default
                   configuration, and this can not be changed. Using virtual
                   nodetree requires to start from a clean database, it will
                   not work if you used the default tree nodetree before.

           pep_mapping: List of Key:Value
               In this option you can provide a list of key-value to choose
               defined node plugins on given PEP namespace. The following
               example will use node_tune instead of node_pep for every PEP
               node with the tune namespace:

               Example:

                   modules:
                     ...
                     mod_pubsub:
                       pep_mapping:
                         http://jabber.org/protocol/tune: tune
                     ...

           plugins: [Plugin, ...]
               To specify which pubsub node plugins to use. The first one in
               the list is used by default. If this option is not defined, the
               default plugins list is: [flat]. PubSub clients can define
               which plugin to use when creating a node: add
               type='plugin-name' attribute to the create stanza element.

               •   flat plugin handles the default behaviour and follows
                   standard XEP-0060 implementation.

               •   pep plugin adds extension to handle Personal Eventing
                   Protocol (XEP-0163) to the PubSub engine. When enabled, PEP
                   is handled automatically.

           vcard: vCard
               A custom vCard of the server that will be displayed by some
               XMPP clients in Service Discovery. The value of vCard is a YAML
               map constructed from an XML representation of vCard. Since the
               representation has no attributes, the mapping is
               straightforward.

               Example:

                   # This XML representation of vCard:
                   #   <vCard xmlns='vcard-temp'>
                   #     <FN>Conferences</FN>
                   #     <ADR>
                   #       <WORK/>
                   #       <STREET>Elm Street</STREET>
                   #     </ADR>
                   #   </vCard>
                   #
                   # is translated to:
                   vcard:
                     fn: Conferences
                     adr:
                       -
                         work: true
                         street: Elm Street

       Examples:

           Example of configuration that uses flat nodes as default, and
           allows use of flat, hometree and pep nodes:

               modules:
                 mod_pubsub:
                   access_createnode: pubsub_createnode
                   max_subscriptions_node: 100
                   default_node_config:
                     notification_type: normal
                     notify_retract: false
                     max_items: 4
                   plugins:
                     - flat
                     - pep

           Using relational database requires using mod_pubsub with db_type
           sql. Only flat, hometree and pep plugins supports SQL. The
           following example shows previous configuration with SQL usage:

               modules:
                 mod_pubsub:
                   db_type: sql
                   access_createnode: pubsub_createnode
                   ignore_pep_from_offline: true
                   last_item_cache: false
                   plugins:
                     - flat
                     - pep

   mod_push
       This module implements the XMPP server’s part of the push notification
       solution specified in XEP-0357: Push Notifications. It does not
       generate, for example, APNS or FCM notifications directly. Instead,
       it’s designed to work with so-called "app servers" operated by
       third-party vendors of mobile apps. Those app servers will usually
       trigger notification delivery to the user’s mobile device using
       platform-dependent backend services such as FCM or APNS.

       Available options:

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           include_body: true | false | Text
               If this option is set to true, the message text is included
               with push notifications generated for incoming messages with a
               body. The option can instead be set to a static Text, in which
               case the specified text will be included in place of the actual
               message body. This can be useful to signal the app server
               whether the notification was triggered by a message with body
               (as opposed to other types of traffic) without leaking actual
               message contents. The default value is "New message".

           include_sender: true | false
               If this option is set to true, the sender’s JID is included
               with push notifications generated for incoming messages with a
               body. The default value is false.

           notify_on: messages | all
               Note about this option: added in 23.10. If this option is set
               to messages, notifications are generated only for actual chat
               messages with a body text (or some encrypted payload). If it’s
               set to all, any kind of XMPP stanza will trigger a
               notification. If unsure, it’s strongly recommended to stick to
               all, which is the default value.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

   mod_push_keepalive
       This module tries to keep the stream management session (see
       mod_stream_mgmt) of a disconnected mobile client alive if the client
       enabled push notifications for that session. However, the normal
       session resumption timeout is restored once a push notification is
       issued, so the session will be closed if the client doesn’t respond to
       push notifications.

       The module depends on mod_push.

       Available options:

           resume_timeout: timeout()
               This option specifies the period of time until the session of a
               disconnected push client times out. This timeout is only in
               effect as long as no push notification is issued. Once that
               happened, the resumption timeout configured for mod_stream_mgmt
               is restored. The default value is 72 hours.

           wake_on_start: true | false
               If this option is set to true, notifications are generated for
               all registered push clients during server startup. This option
               should not be enabled on servers with many push clients as it
               can generate significant load on the involved push services and
               the server itself. The default value is false.

           wake_on_timeout: true | false
               If this option is set to true, a notification is generated
               shortly before the session would time out as per the
               resume_timeout option. The default value is true.

   mod_register
       This module adds support for XEP-0077: In-Band Registration. This
       protocol enables end users to use an XMPP client to:

       •   Register a new account on the server.

       •   Change the password from an existing account on the server.

       •   Delete an existing account on the server.

       This module reads also the top-level registration_timeout option
       defined globally for the server, so please check that option
       documentation too.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               Specify rules to restrict what usernames can be registered. If
               a rule returns deny on the requested username, registration of
               that user name is denied. There are no restrictions by default.
               If AccessName is none, then registering new accounts using
               In-Band Registration is disabled and the corresponding stream
               feature is not announced to clients.

           access_from: AccessName
               By default, ejabberd doesn’t allow the client to register new
               accounts from s2s or existing c2s sessions. You can change it
               by defining access rule in this option. Use with care: allowing
               registration from s2s leads to uncontrolled massive accounts
               creation by rogue users.

           access_remove: AccessName
               Specify rules to restrict access for user unregistration. By
               default any user is able to unregister their account.

           allow_modules: all | [Module, ...]
               Note about this option: added in 21.12. List of modules that
               can register accounts, or all. The default value is all, which
               is equivalent to something like [mod_register,
               mod_register_web].

           captcha_protected: true | false
               Protect registrations with basic.md#captcha|CAPTCHA. The
               default is false.

           ip_access: AccessName
               Define rules to allow or deny account registration depending on
               the IP address of the XMPP client. The AccessName should be of
               type ip. The default value is all.

           password_strength: Entropy
               This option sets the minimum Shannon entropy for passwords. The
               value Entropy is a number of bits of entropy. The recommended
               minimum is 32 bits. The default is 0, i.e. no checks are
               performed.

           redirect_url: URL
               This option enables registration redirection as described in
               XEP-0077: In-Band Registration: Redirection.

           registration_watchers: [JID, ...]
               This option defines a list of JIDs which will be notified each
               time a new account is registered.

           welcome_message: {subject: Subject, body: Body}
               Set a welcome message that is sent to each newly registered
               account. The message will have subject Subject and text Body.

               Example:

                   modules:
                     mod_register:
                       welcome_message:
                         subject: "Welcome!"
                         body: |-
                           Hi!
                           Welcome to this XMPP server

   mod_register_web
       This module provides a web page where users can:

       •   Register a new account on the server.

       •   Change the password from an existing account on the server.

       •   Unregister an existing account on the server.

       This module supports basic.md#captcha|CAPTCHA to register a new
       account. To enable this feature, configure the top-level captcha_cmd
       and top-level captcha_url options.

       As an example usage, the users of the host localhost can visit the
       page: https://localhost:5280/register/ It is important to include the
       last / character in the URL, otherwise the subpages URL will be
       incorrect.

       This module is enabled in listen → ejabberd_http →
       listen-options.md#request_handlers|request_handlers, no need to enable
       in modules. The module depends on mod_register where all the
       configuration is performed.

       The module has no options.

       Example:

               listen:
                 -
                   port: 5280
                   module: ejabberd_http
                   request_handlers:
                     /register: mod_register_web

               modules:
                 mod_register: {}

   mod_roster
       This module implements roster management as defined in RFC6121 Section
       2. The module also adds support for XEP-0237: Roster Versioning.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               This option can be configured to specify rules to restrict
               roster management. If the rule returns deny on the requested
               user name, that user cannot modify their personal roster, i.e.
               they cannot add/remove/modify contacts or send presence
               subscriptions. The default value is all, i.e. no restrictions.

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           store_current_id: true | false
               If this option is set to true, the current roster version
               number is stored on the database. If set to false, the roster
               version number is calculated on the fly each time. Enabling
               this option reduces the load for both ejabberd and the
               database. This option does not affect the client in any way.
               This option is only useful if option versioning is set to true.
               The default value is false. IMPORTANT: if you use
               mod_shared_roster or mod_shared_roster_ldap, you must set the
               value of the option to false.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

           versioning: true | false
               Enables/disables Roster Versioning. The default value is false.

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_roster:
                   versioning: true
                   store_current_id: false

   mod_s2s_bidi
       Note about this option: added in 24.10.

       The module adds support for XEP-0288: Bidirectional Server-to-Server
       Connections that allows using single s2s connection to communicate in
       both directions.

       The module has no options.

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_s2s_bidi: {}

   mod_s2s_dialback
       The module adds support for XEP-0220: Server Dialback to provide server
       identity verification based on DNS.

           Warning

           DNS-based verification is vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning, so
           modern servers rely on verification based on PKIX certificates.
           Thus this module is only recommended for backward compatibility
           with servers running outdated software or non-TLS servers, or those
           with invalid certificates (as long as you accept the risks, e.g.
           you assume that the remote server has an invalid certificate due to
           poor administration and not because it’s compromised).

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               An access rule that can be used to restrict dialback for some
               servers. The default value is all.

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_s2s_dialback:
                   access:
                     allow:
                       server: legacy.domain.tld
                       server: invalid-cert.example.org
                     deny: all

   mod_scram_upgrade
       Note about this option: added in 24.10.

       The module adds support for XEP-0480: SASL Upgrade Tasks that allows
       users to upgrade passwords to more secure representation.

       Available options:

           offered_upgrades: list(sha256, sha512)
               List with upgrade types that should be offered

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_scram_upgrade:
                   offered_upgrades:
                     - sha256
                     - sha512

   mod_service_log
       This module forwards copies of all stanzas to remote XMPP servers or
       components. Every stanza is encapsulated into <forwarded/> element as
       described in XEP-0297: Stanza Forwarding.

       Available options:

           loggers: [Domain, ...]
               A list of servers or connected components to which stanzas will
               be forwarded.

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_service_log:
                   loggers:
                     - xmpp-server.tld
                     - component.domain.tld

   mod_shared_roster
       This module enables you to create shared roster groups: groups of
       accounts that can see members from (other) groups in their rosters.

       The big advantages of this feature are that end users do not need to
       manually add all users to their rosters, and that they cannot
       permanently delete users from the shared roster groups. A shared roster
       group can have members from any XMPP server, but the presence will only
       be available from and to members of the same virtual host where the
       group is created. It still allows the users to have / add their own
       contacts, as it does not replace the standard roster. Instead, the
       shared roster contacts are merged to the relevant users at retrieval
       time. The standard user rosters thus stay unmodified.

       Shared roster groups can be edited via the Web Admin, and some API
       commands called srg_, for example srg_add API. Each group has a unique
       name and those parameters:

       •   Label: Used in the rosters where this group is displayed.

       •   Description: of the group, which has no effect.

       •   Members: A list of JIDs of group members, entered one per line in
           the Web Admin. The special member directive @all@ represents all
           the registered users in the virtual host; which is only recommended
           for a small server with just a few hundred users. The special
           member directive @online@ represents the online users in the
           virtual host. With those two directives, the actual list of members
           in those shared rosters is generated dynamically at retrieval time.

       •   Displayed: A list of groups that will be in the rosters of this
           group’s members. A group of other vhost can be identified with
           groupid@vhost.

       This module depends on mod_roster. If not enabled, roster queries will
       return 503 errors.

       Available options:

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

       Examples:

           Take the case of a computer club that wants all its members seeing
           each other in their rosters. To achieve this, they need to create a
           shared roster group similar to this one:

               Name: club_members
               Label: Club Members
               Description: Members from the computer club
               Members: member1@example.org, member2@example.org, member3@example.org
               Displayed Groups: club_members

           In another case we have a company which has three divisions:
           Management, Marketing and Sales. All group members should see all
           other members in their rosters. Additionally, all managers should
           have all marketing and sales people in their roster.
           Simultaneously, all marketeers and the whole sales team should see
           all managers. This scenario can be achieved by creating shared
           roster groups as shown in the following lists:

               First list:
               Name: management
               Label: Management
               Description: Management
               Members: manager1@example.org, manager2@example.org
               Displayed: management, marketing, sales

               Second list:
               Name: marketing
               Label: Marketing
               Description: Marketing
               Members: marketeer1@example.org, marketeer2@example.org, marketeer3@example.org
               Displayed: management, marketing

               Third list:
               Name: sales
               Label: Sales
               Description: Sales
               Members: salesman1@example.org, salesman2@example.org, salesman3@example.org
               Displayed: management, sales

   mod_shared_roster_ldap
       This module lets the server administrator automatically populate users'
       rosters (contact lists) with entries based on users and groups defined
       in an LDAP-based directory.

           Note

           mod_shared_roster_ldap depends on mod_roster being enabled. Roster
           queries will return 503 errors if mod_roster is not enabled.

       The module accepts many configuration options. Some of them, if
       unspecified, default to the values specified for the top level of
       configuration. This lets you avoid specifying, for example, the bind
       password in multiple places.

       •   Filters: ldap_rfilter, ldap_ufilter, ldap_gfilter, ldap_filter.
           These options specify LDAP filters used to query for shared roster
           information. All of them are run against the ldap_base.

       •   Attributes: ldap_groupattr, ldap_groupdesc, ldap_memberattr,
           ldap_userdesc, ldap_useruid. These options specify the names of the
           attributes which hold interesting data in the entries returned by
           running filters specified with the filter options.

       •   Control parameters: ldap_auth_check, ldap_group_cache_validity,
           ldap_memberattr_format, ldap_memberattr_format_re,
           ldap_user_cache_validity. These parameters control the behaviour of
           the module.

       •   Connection parameters: The module also accepts the connection
           parameters, all of which default to the top-level parameter of the
           same name, if unspecified. See ldap.md#ldap-connection|LDAP
           Connection section for more information about them.

       Check also the ldap.md#ldap-examples|Configuration examples section to
       get details about retrieving the roster, and configuration examples
       including Flat DIT and Deep DIT.

               only.

           ldap_auth_check: true | false
               Whether the module should check (via the ejabberd
               authentication subsystem) for existence of each user in the
               shared LDAP roster. Set to false if you want to disable the
               check. Default value is true.

           ldap_backups
               Same as top-level ldap_backups option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_base
               Same as top-level ldap_base option, but applied to this module
               only.

           ldap_deref_aliases
               Same as top-level ldap_deref_aliases option, but applied to
               this module only.

           ldap_encrypt
               Same as top-level ldap_encrypt option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_filter
               Additional filter which is AND-ed together with "User Filter"
               and "Group Filter". For more information check the LDAP
               ldap.md#filters|Filters section.

           ldap_gfilter
               "Group Filter", used when retrieving human-readable name
               (a.k.a. "Display Name") and the members of a group. See also
               the parameters ldap_groupattr, ldap_groupdesc and
               ldap_memberattr. If unspecified, defaults to the top-level
               parameter of the same name. If that one also is unspecified,
               then the filter is constructed exactly like "User Filter".

           ldap_groupattr
               The name of the attribute that holds the group name, and that
               is used to differentiate between them. Retrieved from results
               of the "Roster Filter" and "Group Filter". Defaults to cn.

           ldap_groupdesc
               The name of the attribute which holds the human-readable group
               name in the objects you use to represent groups. Retrieved from

               ldap_groupattr is set.

           ldap_memberattr
               The name of the attribute which holds the IDs of the members of
               a group. Retrieved from results of the "Group Filter". Defaults
               to memberUid. The name of the attribute differs depending on
               the objectClass you use for your group objects, for example:
               posixGroup → memberUid; groupOfNames → member;
               groupOfUniqueNames → uniqueMember.

           ldap_memberattr_format
               A globbing format for extracting user ID from the value of the
               attribute named by ldap_memberattr. Defaults to %u, which means
               that the whole value is the member ID. If you change it to
               something different, you may also need to specify the User and
               Group Filters manually; see section Filters.

           ldap_memberattr_format_re
               A regex for extracting user ID from the value of the attribute
               named by ldap_memberattr. Check the LDAP
               ldap.md#control-parameters|Control Parameters section.

           ldap_password
               Same as top-level ldap_password option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_port
               Same as top-level ldap_port option, but applied to this module
               only.

           ldap_rfilter
               So called "Roster Filter". Used to find names of all "shared
               roster" groups. See also the ldap_groupattr parameter. If
               unspecified, defaults to the top-level parameter of the same
               name. You must specify it in some place in the configuration,
               there is no default.

           ldap_rootdn
               Same as top-level ldap_rootdn option, but applied to this
               module only.

               Same as top-level ldap_servers option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_tls_cacertfile
               Same as top-level ldap_tls_cacertfile option, but applied to
               this module only.

           ldap_tls_certfile
               Same as top-level ldap_tls_certfile option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_tls_depth
               Same as top-level ldap_tls_depth option, but applied to this

               module only.

           ldap_ufilter
               "User Filter", used for retrieving the human-readable name of
               roster entries (usually full names of people in the roster).
               See also the parameters ldap_userdesc and ldap_useruid. For
               more information check the LDAP ldap.md#filters|Filters
               section.

           ldap_uids

               name. Retrieved from results of the "User Filter". Defaults to
               cn.

           ldap_userjidattr
               The name of the attribute which is used to map user id to XMPP
               jid. If not specified (and that is default value of this
               option), user jid will be created from user id and this module
               host.

           ldap_useruid
               The name of the attribute which holds the ID of a roster item.
               Value of this attribute in the roster item objects needs to
               match the ID retrieved from the ldap_memberattr attribute of a
               group object. Retrieved from results of the "User Filter".
               Defaults to cn.

           use_cache
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

   mod_sic
       This module adds support for XEP-0279: Server IP Check. This protocol
       enables a client to discover its external IP address.

           Warning

           The protocol extension is deferred and seems like there are no
           clients supporting it, so using this module is not recommended and,
           furthermore, the module might be removed in the future.

       The module has no options.

   mod_sip
       This module adds SIP proxy/registrar support for the corresponding
       virtual host.

           Note

           It is not enough to just load this module. You should also
           configure listeners and DNS records properly. For details see the
           section about the listen.md#ejabberd_sip|ejabberd_sip listen module
           in the ejabberd Documentation.

       Available options:

           always_record_route: true | false
               Always insert "Record-Route" header into SIP messages. With
               this approach it is possible to bypass NATs/firewalls a bit
               more easily. The default value is true.

           flow_timeout_tcp: timeout()
               The option sets a keep-alive timer for SIP outbound TCP
               connections. The default value is 2 minutes.

           flow_timeout_udp: timeout()
               The options sets a keep-alive timer for SIP outbound UDP
               connections. The default value is 29 seconds.

           record_route: URI
               When the option always_record_route is set to true or when SIP
               outbound is utilized, ejabberd inserts "Record-Route" header
               field with this URI into a SIP message. The default is a SIP
               URI constructed from the virtual host on which the module is
               loaded.

           routes: [URI, ...]
               You can set a list of SIP URIs of routes pointing to this SIP
               proxy server. The default is a list containing a single SIP URI
               constructed from the virtual host on which the module is
               loaded.

           via: [URI, ...]
               A list to construct "Via" headers for inserting them into
               outgoing SIP messages. This is useful if you’re running your
               SIP proxy in a non-standard network topology. Every URI element
               in the list must be in the form of "scheme://host:port", where
               "transport" must be tls, tcp, or udp, "host" must be a domain
               name or an IP address and "port" must be an internet port
               number. Note that all parts of the URI are mandatory (e.g. you
               cannot omit "port" or "scheme").

       Example:

               modules:
                 mod_sip:
                   always_record_route: false
                   record_route: "sip:example.com;lr"
                   routes:
                     - "sip:example.com;lr"
                     - "sip:sip.example.com;lr"
                   flow_timeout_udp: 30 sec
                   flow_timeout_tcp: 1 min
                   via:
                     - tls://sip-tls.example.com:5061
                     - tcp://sip-tcp.example.com:5060
                     - udp://sip-udp.example.com:5060

   mod_stats
       This module adds support for XEP-0039: Statistics Gathering. This
       protocol allows you to retrieve the following statistics from your
       ejabberd server:

       •   Total number of registered users on the current virtual host
           (users/total).

       •   Total number of registered users on all virtual hosts
           (users/all-hosts/total).

       •   Total number of online users on the current virtual host
           (users/online).

       •   Total number of online users on all virtual hosts
           (users/all-hosts/online).

           Note

           The protocol extension is deferred and seems like even a few
           clients that were supporting it are now abandoned. So using this
           module makes very little sense.

       The module has no options.

   mod_stream_mgmt
       This module adds support for XEP-0198: Stream Management. This protocol
       allows active management of an XML stream between two XMPP entities,
       including features for stanza acknowledgments and stream resumption.

       Available options:

           ack_timeout: timeout()
               A time to wait for stanza acknowledgments. Setting it to
               infinity effectively disables the timeout. The default value is
               1 minute.

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only. The default value is 48 hours.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           max_ack_queue: Size
               This option specifies the maximum number of unacknowledged
               stanzas queued for possible retransmission. When the limit is
               exceeded, the client session is terminated. The allowed values
               are positive integers and infinity. You should be careful when
               setting this value as it should not be set too low, otherwise,
               you could kill sessions in a loop, before they get the chance
               to finish proper session initiation. It should definitely be
               set higher that the size of the offline queue (for example at
               least 3 times the value of the max offline queue and never
               lower than 1000). The default value is 5000.

           max_resume_timeout: timeout()
               A client may specify the period of time until a session times
               out if the connection is lost. During this period of time, the
               client may resume its session. This option limits the period of
               time a client is permitted to request. It must be set to a
               timeout equal to or larger than the default resume_timeout. By
               default, it is set to the same value as the resume_timeout
               option.

           queue_type: ram | file
               Same as top-level queue_type option, but applied to this module
               only.

           resend_on_timeout: true | false | if_offline
               If this option is set to true, any message stanzas that weren’t
               acknowledged by the client will be resent on session timeout.
               This behavior might often be desired, but could have unexpected
               results under certain circumstances. For example, a message
               that was sent to two resources might get resent to one of them
               if the other one timed out. Therefore, the default value for
               this option is false, which tells ejabberd to generate an error
               message instead. As an alternative, the option may be set to
               if_offline. In this case, unacknowledged messages are resent
               only if no other resource is online when the session times out.
               Otherwise, error messages are generated.

           resume_timeout: timeout()
               This option configures the (default) period of time until a
               session times out if the connection is lost. During this period
               of time, a client may resume its session. Note that the client
               may request a different timeout value, see the
               max_resume_timeout option. Setting it to 0 effectively disables
               session resumption. The default value is 5 minutes.

   mod_stun_disco
       Note about this option: added in 20.04.

       This module allows XMPP clients to discover STUN/TURN services and to
       obtain temporary credentials for using them as per XEP-0215: External
       Service Discovery.

       Available options:

           access: AccessName
               This option defines which access rule will be used to control
               who is allowed to discover STUN/TURN services and to request
               temporary credentials. The default value is local.

           credentials_lifetime: timeout()
               The lifetime of temporary credentials offered to clients. If
               ejabberd’s built-in TURN service is used, TURN relays allocated
               using temporary credentials will be terminated shortly after
               the credentials expired. The default value is 12 hours. Note
               that restarting the ejabberd node invalidates any temporary
               credentials offered before the restart unless a secret is
               specified (see below).

           offer_local_services: true | false
               This option specifies whether local STUN/TURN services
               configured as ejabberd listeners should be announced
               automatically. Note that this will not include TLS-enabled
               services, which must be configured manually using the services
               option (see below). For non-anonymous TURN services, temporary
               credentials will be offered to the client. The default value is
               true.

           secret: Text
               The secret used for generating temporary credentials. If this
               option isn’t specified, a secret will be auto-generated.
               However, a secret must be specified explicitly if non-anonymous
               TURN services running on other ejabberd nodes and/or external
               TURN services are configured. Also note that auto-generated
               secrets are lost when the node is restarted, which invalidates
               any credentials offered before the restart. Therefore, it’s
               recommended to explicitly specify a secret if clients cache
               retrieved credentials (for later use) across service restarts.

           services: [Service, ...]
               The list of services offered to clients. This list can include
               STUN/TURN services running on any ejabberd node and/or external
               services. However, if any listed TURN service not running on
               the local ejabberd node requires authentication, a secret must
               be specified explicitly, and must be shared with that service.
               This will only work with ejabberd’s built-in STUN/TURN server
               and with external servers that support the same REST API For
               Access To TURN Services. Unless the offer_local_services is set
               to false, the explicitly listed services will be offered in
               addition to those announced automatically.

               host: Host
                   The hostname or IP address the STUN/TURN service is
                   listening on. For non-TLS services, it’s recommended to
                   specify an IP address (to avoid additional DNS lookup
                   latency on the client side). For TLS services, the hostname
                   (or IP address) should match the certificate. Specifying
                   the host option is mandatory.

               port: 1..65535
                   The port number the STUN/TURN service is listening on. The
                   default port number is 3478 for non-TLS services and 5349
                   for TLS services.

               restricted: true | false
                   This option determines whether temporary credentials for
                   accessing the service are offered. The default is false for
                   STUN/STUNS services and true for TURN/TURNS services.

               transport: tcp | udp
                   The transport protocol supported by the service. The
                   default is udp for non-TLS services and tcp for TLS
                   services.

               type: stun | turn | stuns | turns
                   The type of service. Must be stun or turn for non-TLS
                   services, stuns or turns for TLS services. The default type
                   is stun.

               Example:

                   services:
                     -
                       host: 203.0.113.3
                       port: 3478
                       type: stun
                       transport: udp
                       restricted: false
                     -
                       host: 203.0.113.3
                       port: 3478
                       type: turn
                       transport: udp
                       restricted: true
                     -
                       host: 2001:db8::3
                       port: 3478
                       type: stun
                       transport: udp
                       restricted: false
                     -
                       host: 2001:db8::3
                       port: 3478
                       type: turn
                       transport: udp
                       restricted: true
                     -
                       host: server.example.com
                       port: 5349
                       type: turns
                       transport: tcp
                       restricted: true

   mod_time
       This module adds support for XEP-0202: Entity Time. In other words, the
       module reports server’s system time.

       The module has no options.

   mod_vcard
       This module allows end users to store and retrieve their vCard, and to
       retrieve other users vCards, as defined in XEP-0054: vcard-temp. The
       module also implements an uncomplicated Jabber User Directory based on
       the vCards of these users. Moreover, it enables the server to send its
       vCard when queried.

       Available options:

           allow_return_all: true | false
               This option enables you to specify if search operations with
               empty input fields should return all users who added some
               information to their vCard. The default value is false.

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           db_type: mnesia | sql | ldap
               Same as top-level default_db option, but applied to this module
               only.

           host
               Deprecated. Use hosts instead.

           hosts: [Host, ...]
               This option defines the Jabber IDs of the service. If the hosts
               option is not specified, the only Jabber ID will be the
               hostname of the virtual host with the prefix "vjud.". The
               keyword @HOST@ is replaced with the real virtual host name.

           matches: pos_integer() | infinity
               With this option, the number of reported search results can be
               limited. If the option’s value is set to infinity, all search
               results are reported. The default value is 30.

           name: Name
               The value of the service name. This name is only visible in
               some clients that support XEP-0030: Service Discovery. The
               default is vCard User Search.

           search: true | false
               This option specifies whether the search functionality is
               enabled or not. If disabled, the options hosts, name and vcard
               will be ignored and the Jabber User Directory service will not
               appear in the Service Discovery item list. The default value is
               false.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

           vcard: vCard
               A custom vCard of the server that will be displayed by some
               XMPP clients in Service Discovery. The value of vCard is a YAML
               map constructed from an XML representation of vCard. Since the
               representation has no attributes, the mapping is
               straightforward.

               Example:

                   # This XML representation of vCard:
                   #
                   #   <vCard xmlns='vcard-temp'>
                   #     <FN>Conferences</FN>
                   #     <ADR>
                   #       <WORK/>
                   #       <STREET>Elm Street</STREET>
                   #     </ADR>
                   #   </vCard>
                   #
                   # is translated to:
                   #
                   vcard:
                     fn: Conferences
                     adr:
                       -
                         work: true
                         street: Elm Street

       Available options for ldap backend:

           ldap_backups
               Same as top-level ldap_backups option, but applied to this
               module only.

               Same as top-level ldap_port option, but applied to this module
               only.

           ldap_rootdn
               Same as top-level ldap_rootdn option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_search_fields: {Name: Attribute, ...}
               This option defines the search form and the LDAP attributes to
               search within.  Name is the name of a search form field which
               will be automatically translated by using the translation files
               (see msgs/*.msg for available words).  Attribute is the LDAP
               attribute or the pattern %u.

               Examples:

               The default is:

                   User: "%u"
                   "Full Name": displayName
                   "Given Name": givenName
                   "Middle Name": initials
                   "Family Name": sn

                   City: l
                   Email: mail
                   "Organization Name": o
                   "Organization Unit": ou

           ldap_search_reported: {SearchField: VcardField}, ...}
               This option defines which search fields should be reported.
               SearchField is the name of a search form field which will be
               automatically translated by using the translation files (see
               msgs/*.msg for available words).  VcardField is the vCard field
               name defined in the ldap_vcard_map option.

               Examples:

               The default is:

                   "Full Name": FN
                   "Given Name": FIRST
                   "Middle Name": MIDDLE
                   "Family Name": LAST
                   "Nickname": NICKNAME
                   "Birthday": BDAY
                   "Country": CTRY
                   "City": LOCALITY
                   "Email": EMAIL
                   "Organization Name": ORGNAME
                   "Organization Unit": ORGUNIT

           ldap_servers
               Same as top-level ldap_servers option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_tls_cacertfile
               Same as top-level ldap_tls_cacertfile option, but applied to
               this module only.

           ldap_tls_certfile
               Same as top-level ldap_tls_certfile option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_tls_depth
               Same as top-level ldap_tls_depth option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_tls_verify
               Same as top-level ldap_tls_verify option, but applied to this
               module only.

           ldap_uids
               Same as top-level ldap_uids option, but applied to this module
               only.

           ldap_vcard_map: {Name: {Pattern, LDAPattributes}, ...}
               With this option you can set the table that maps LDAP
               attributes to vCard fields.  Name is the type name of the vCard
               as defined in RFC 2426.  Pattern is a string which contains
               pattern variables %u, %d or %s.  LDAPattributes is the list
               containing LDAP attributes. The pattern variables %s will be
               sequentially replaced with the values of LDAP attributes from
               List_of_LDAP_attributes, %u will be replaced with the user part
               of a JID, and %d will be replaced with the domain part of a
               JID.

               Examples:

               The default is:

                   NICKNAME: {"%u": []}
                   FN: {"%s": [displayName]}
                   LAST: {"%s": [sn]}
                   FIRST: {"%s": [givenName]}
                   MIDDLE: {"%s": [initials]}
                   ORGNAME: {"%s": [o]}
                   ORGUNIT: {"%s": [ou]}
                   CTRY: {"%s": [c]}
                   LOCALITY: {"%s": [l]}
                   STREET: {"%s": [street]}
                   REGION: {"%s": [st]}
                   PCODE: {"%s": [postalCode]}
                   TITLE: {"%s": [title]}
                   URL: {"%s": [labeleduri]}
                   DESC: {"%s": [description]}
                   TEL: {"%s": [telephoneNumber]}
                   EMAIL: {"%s": [mail]}
                   BDAY: {"%s": [birthDay]}
                   ROLE: {"%s": [employeeType]}
                   PHOTO: {"%s": [jpegPhoto]}

       Available options for mnesia backend:

           search_all_hosts: true | false
               Whether to perform search on all virtual hosts or not. The
               default value is true.

   mod_vcard_xupdate
       The user’s client can store an avatar in the user vCard. The
       vCard-Based Avatars protocol (XEP-0153) provides a method for clients
       to inform the contacts what is the avatar hash value. However, simple
       or small clients may not implement that protocol.

       If this module is enabled, all the outgoing client presence stanzas get
       automatically the avatar hash on behalf of the client. So, the contacts
       receive the presence stanzas with the Update Data described in XEP-0153
       as if the client would had inserted it itself. If the client had
       already included such element in the presence stanza, it is replaced
       with the element generated by ejabberd.

       By enabling this module, each vCard modification produces a hash
       recalculation, and each presence sent by a client produces hash
       retrieval and a presence stanza rewrite. For this reason, enabling this
       module will introduce a computational overhead in servers with clients
       that change frequently their presence. However, the overhead is
       significantly reduced by the use of caching, so you probably don’t want
       to set use_cache to false.

       The module depends on mod_vcard.

           Note

           Nowadays XEP-0153 is used mostly as "read-only", i.e. modern
           clients don’t publish their avatars inside vCards. Thus in the
           majority of cases the module is only used along with mod_avatar for
           providing backward compatibility.

       Available options:

           cache_life_time: timeout()
               Same as top-level cache_life_time option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_missed: true | false
               Same as top-level cache_missed option, but applied to this
               module only.

           cache_size: pos_integer() | infinity
               Same as top-level cache_size option, but applied to this module
               only.

           use_cache: true | false
               Same as top-level use_cache option, but applied to this module
               only.

   mod_version
       This module implements XEP-0092: Software Version. Consequently, it
       answers ejabberd’s version when queried.

       Available options:

           show_os: true | false
               Should the operating system be revealed or not. The default
               value is true.
