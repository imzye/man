GEMEXP(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              GEMEXP(1)

NAME
     gemexp – export a directory over Gemini

SYNOPSIS
     gemexp [-hRVv] [-d certs-dir] [-H hostname] [-p port] [directory]

DESCRIPTION
     gemexp exports the given directory over the Gemini protocol.  It's
     intended to be used interactively mostly for testing purposes, for a
     full-fledged daemon look for gmid(8).

     The arguments are as follows:

     -d certs-path
             Directory where certificates are stored.  By default is
             $XDG_DATA_HOME/gemexp, i.e. ~/.local/share/gemexp.

     -H hostname
             The hostname to use, localhost by default.  Certificates for the
             given hostname are searched inside the certs-dir specified with
             the -d option.  The certificate files are named hostname.pem and
             hostname.key and are implicitly generated if not found.

     -h, --help
             Print the usage and exit.

     -p port
             The port to bind to, 1965 by default.

     -R      Generate an RSA key instead of an EC one.

     -V, --version
             Print the version and exit.

     -v      Verbose mode.

     directory
             The root directory to serve, or the current working directory if
             not specified.
