NAME
       hf, ef, nf, pf - address to name filters

SYNOPSIS
       hf [-1abcdilN] [-f format] [-R qps] [-t secs] [file ...]
       hf -x [file ...]
       ef [-d] [file ...]
       nf [-di] [file ...]
       pf [-d] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       These filters reads the named files (or from stdin if there are none)
       and replace occurrences of a particular kind of address to the
       corresponding name:

              hf - converts raw internet addresses to hostnames.
              ef - converts ethernet addresses to hostnames.
              nf - converts network addresses to names.
              pf - converts square bracketed port numbers to names.


OPTIONS
       Options common to all programs:

       -d     Print some debugging infomation to stderr before exiting. When
              used more than once, also dump the internal hash table.

       Options specific to hf:

       -1     Attempt to convert only the first address on a line.

       -a     Use asynchronous DNS lookups.

       -b     Prints both the hostname and the ip address (the latter in
              parentheses).  This is a shortcut for -f "%h(%i)".

       -c     Checks the names against ip addresses; that is, the hostname the
              address resolves to must resolve back to the address or else the
              address is not converted to a hostname.

       -f     Specify a format string containing escapes to be used to create
              the replacement text. The escapes are as follows:

                     %h - hostname (%D, %N, %l or even %i)
                     %D - local domain truncated hostname
                     %N - domain truncated hostname
                     %l - long hostname (FQDN)
                     %i - ip address
                     %% - %

              Unrecognized escapes expand to the character without the
              percent.  It's acceptable to use specific escapes more than
              once. Specifying an empty format resets it to the default
              ("%h").

       -i     Force converted names to be all lowercase.

       -l     By default, hf strips the domain part of hostnames in the local
              domain. The -l flag suppresses this stripping.

       -N     Strips the entire domain of all hostnames.

       -R     Specify a maximum rate in queries per second. By default queries
              are limited to 1000/sec. This can be disabled by specifying a
              rate of 0.

       -t     Specify a timeout (in seconds) for name and address lookups. By
              default, timeouts are left up to the resolver routines.

       -x     Instead of replacing ip addresses with names, just output the
              raw ip addresses, one per line. When the flag is used more than
              once, the cidr width is included with the ip address in the
              output. For example 203.0.113.0/24.  No other flags are allowed
              (or would even make sense).

       Options specific to nf:

       -i     Force converted names to be all lowercase.

       -b     Prints both the hostname and the ip address (the latter in
              parentheses).

       -p     Pad network addresses to four octets.

BUGS
       If a port number has different tcp and udp names, pf will favor the tcp
       name.
