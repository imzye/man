CXGB(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                CXGB(4)

NAME
     cxgb – Chelsio T3 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device firmware
           device cxgb

     To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
     loader.conf(5):

           if_cxgb_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The cxgb driver supports Transmit/Receive checksum offload, Jumbo Frames,
     TCP segmentation offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO), VLAN
     hardware insertion / extraction, and VLAN checksum offload.  For further
     hardware information, see http://www.chelsio.com/.

     For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the
     documentation supplied with your Chelsio T3 adapter.  All hardware
     requirements listed apply to use with FreeBSD.

     Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
     Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
     configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.  The maximum
     MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 9000.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The cxgb driver supports 10 Gigabit and 1 Gigabit Ethernet adapters based
     on the T3 and T3B chipset:

     •   Chelsio 10GBase-CX4
     •   Chelsio 10GBase-LR
     •   Chelsio 10GBase-SR

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

DIAGNOSTICS
     cxgb%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: memory  A fatal initialization
     error has occurred.

     cxgb%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: interrupt  A fatal
     initialization error has occurred.

     cxgb%d: Could not find firmware image %s  The appropriate firmware kld
     module was not installed.  This is a fatal initialization error.
