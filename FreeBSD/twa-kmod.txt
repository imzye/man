TWA(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 TWA(4)

NAME
     twa – 3ware 9000/9500/9550/9650 series SATA RAID controllers driver

DEPRECATION NOTICE
     The twa driver is not present in FreeBSD 14.0.

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device scbus
           device twa

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           twa_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The twa driver provides support for AMCC's 3ware 9000/9500/9550/9650
     series SATA controllers.

     These controllers are available in 4, 8, 12 or 16-port configurations,
     and support the following RAID levels: 0, 1, 10, 5, 50.  The device nodes
     for the controllers are of the form /dev/twaX, where X is the controller
     number.  The driver is implemented as a SCSI SIM under CAM, and, as such,
     the logical units that it controls are accessible via the device nodes,
     /dev/daY, where Y is the logical unit number.

HARDWARE
     The twa driver supports the following SATA RAID controllers:

     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500S-4LP
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500S-8
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500S-8MI
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500S-12
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500S-12MI
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500SX-4LP
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500SX-8LP
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500SX-12
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500SX-12MI
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9500SX-16ML
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9550SX-4LP
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9550SX-8LP
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9550SX-12
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9550SX-12MI
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9550SX-16ML
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9650SE-2LP
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9650SE-4LPML
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9650SE-8LPML
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9650SE-12ML
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9650SE-16ML
     •   AMCC's 3ware 9650SE-24M8

DIAGNOSTICS
     Whenever the driver encounters a command failure, it prints out an error
     code in the format: "ERROR: (<error source>: <error code>):", followed by
     a text description of the error.  There are other error messages and
     warnings that the driver prints out, depending on the kinds of errors
     that it encounters.  If the driver is compiled with TWA_DEBUG defined, it
     prints out a whole bunch of debug messages, the quantity of which varies
     depending on the value assigned to TWA_DEBUG (0 to 10).
