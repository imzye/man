DESCRIPTION
       camlp5 is a Pre-Processor-Pretty-Printer for OCaml, parsing a source
       file and printing some result on standard output.

       camlp5o, camlp5r and camlp5sch are versions of camlp5 with some files
       already loaded (see further).

       camlp5o.cma, camlp5r.cma and camlp5sch.cma are files to be loaded in
       ocaml toplevel to use the camlp5 machinery

       mkcamlp5 and mkcamlp5.opt creates camlp5 executables with almost the
       same options than ocamlmktop. See further.

       ocpp5 is an universal preprocessor, treating any kind of source file,
       generating the same text with the possible quotations expanded.

       camlp5o.opt and camlp5r.opt are versions of camlp5o and camlp5r
       compiled by the native-code compiler ocamlopt. They are faster but not
       extensible. And they are not available in all installations of camlp5.


LOAD OPTIONS
       The load options select parsing and printing actions recorded in OCaml
       object files (ending with .cmo or .cma). Several usage of these options
       are authorized. They must precede the other options.


       An optional -- may end the load options.


       -I directory
              Add directory in the search path for files loaded. Unless the
              option -nolib is used, the camlp5 library directory is appended
              to the path. Warning: there is no automatic search in the
              current directory: add "-I ." for this.

       -where Print camlp5 library directory name and exit.

       -nolib No automatic search for objects files in camlp5 library
              directory.

       object-file
              The file is loaded in camlp5 core.


OTHER OPTIONS
       The others options are:


       file   Treat file as an interface file if it ends with .mli and as an
              implementation file if it ends with .ml.


       -intf file
              Treat file as an interface file, whatever its extension.

       -impl file
              Treat file as an implementation file, whatever its extension.

       -unsafe
              Generate unsafe accesses to arrays and strings.

       -noassert
              Do not compile assertion checks.

       -verbose
              More verbose in parsing errors.

       -QD file
              Dump in file in case of syntax error in the result of a
              quotation expansion.

       -o out-file
              Print the result on out-file instead of standard output. File is
              opened with open_out_bin (see OCaml library Pervasives).

       -v     Print the version number and exit.

       -help  Print the available options and exit. This print includes the
              options possibly added by the loaded object files.


       The others options can be extended by loaded object files. The provided
       files add the following options:


       -l line-length
              Added by pr_o.cmo and pr_r.cmo: set the line length (default
              78).

       -sep string
              Added by pr_o.cmo and pr_r.cmo: print this string between
              phrases instead of comments.

       -no_ss Added by pr_o.cmo: do not print double semicolons

       -D ident
              Added by pa_macro.cmo: define the ident.

       -U ident
              Added by pa_macro.cmo: undefine the ident.

           camlp5 pa_r.cmo pa_rp.cmo pr_dump.cmo

           camlp5 pa_scheme.cmo pr_dump.cmo

       The file camlp5o.cma can be loaded in the toplevel to start camlp5 with
       OCaml syntax.

       The file camlp5r.cma can be loaded in the toplevel to start camlp5 with
       revised syntax.

       The file camlp5sch.cma can be loaded in the toplevel to start camlp5
       with Scheme syntax.


MKCAMLP5
       mkcamlp5 and mkcamlp5.opt creates camlp5 executables with almost the
       same options than ocamlmktop. The version mkcamlp5.opt can create
       native code executables, faster but not extensible.

       For mkcamlp5, the interfaces to be visible must be explicitly added in
       the command line as ".cmi" files. For example, how to add the the OCaml
       module "str":
           mkcamlp5 -custom str.cmi str.cma -cclib -lstr -o camlp5str

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
       The following environment variable is also consulted:


       CAMLP5PARAM
              Set the grammars parsing algorithm parameters.  This variable
              must be a sequence of parameter specifications.  A parameter
              specification is a letter optionally followed by an = and a
              value. There are four possible parameters:


       b (backtrack)
              Set the backtrack algorithm as default.

       t (trace)
              Trace symbols (terminals and non-terminals) while parsing with
              backtracking.

       y (trace-stalling)
              In backtracking, trace the advance in the input stream (number
              of unfrozen tokens) and the possible stalling (number of tokens
              tests).

       l (maximum-stalling)
              Set the maximum stalling value.
