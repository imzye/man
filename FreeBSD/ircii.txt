DESCRIPTION
     The ircII program is a full screen, termcap based interface to Internet
     Relay Chat.  It gives full access to all of the normal IRC functions,
     plus a variety of additional options.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -a                  This adds the normal irc server list to the command
                         line list of irc servers.

     -b                  Load the .ircrc file before connection to a server,
                         not afterwards.

     -c chan             Automatically join channel chan.

     -d                  Start in non-full screen mode.  All input is taken
                         directly from stdin and all output goes to stdout
                         without using any of the termcap(5) screen control
                         codes.

     -D level            Enable debugging of level.  This option is only
                         available if ircII is built with -DDEBUG.

     -e protocol level   For protocol protocol, set the default encryption
                         (SSL) level to level.  Currently, only "IRC" is
                         supported for the protocol and the values that level
                         can take are "check", "nocheck", and "off".  Please
                         also see the description of the "server list" below.

     -F                  Don't use flow control (^S and ^Q) to stop start the
                         display.  This switch is ignored if the -d switch is
                         used.

     -f                  Use flow control (^S and ^Q) to stop/start the
                         display.  Normally these are both bound to other
                         functions within ircII.  This switch is ignored if
                         the -d switch is used.

     -H host[:port]      This option instructs ircII to use the given host as
                         the local address for DCC, and works otherwise
                         identically to the -h option.

     -h host[:port]      This option instructs ircII to use the given host as
                         the local address.  Useful only on multi-homed hosts.
                         If the optional port segment is included, ircII will
                         attempt to bind to this local port as well as local
                         host address.  If host is an IPv6 "number", it must
                         be provided in the common file ... [12:34:ab:cd]
                         format.  This means for an IPv6 "number" and port, it
                         would be written [12:34:ab:cd]:6669.

     -icb                Use ICB connections by default.

     -irc                Use IRC connections by default.

     -l ircrc            Use ircrc Instead of the default ~/.ircrc.

     -o file             Set the debug output file to file.  This option is
                         only available if ircII is built with -DDEBUG.

     -P portno           Set the ICB port number to portno (default: 7326, the
                         standard ICB port).

     -p portno           Set the IRC port number to portno (default: 6667, the
                         standard IRC port).  Only supply this if you connect
                         to a server which uses a port other than 6667.

     -q                  Start up ircII quickly.  Don't load the IRCRC file,
                         only the quick IRCRC file set by the

     -I                  option.

     -R host[:port]      Set the default HTTP proxy host for server
                         connections to host:port.

     -r                  Reverse the normal default foreground and background
                         colours.

     -S                  Start up the ircio process to connect to the IRC
                         server.

     -s                  Don't start up the ircio process to connect to the
                         IRC server (default).

     -T                  Do use the termcap ti and te sequences when starting
                         and exiting if they exist.

     -t                  Don't use the termcap ti and te sequences when
                         starting and exiting (default).

     -v                  Print the version and release date of ircII and exit.

     --                  End all option processing.

     The remaining command line arguments are:

     •   nickname Set the nickname (overrides the environment variable
         IRCNICK; default: the username).

     •   server list Set the list of servers with which ircII will try to
         connect upon startup.  This list is also used by the program's
         /server command.

     For IRC connections, the format is: host[:portno[:password[:nick]]]

     For ICB connections, the format is: ICB/host
     [:portno[:nick[:group[:mode]]]] with group being the initial group and
     mode being the initial group mode.  See /HELP ICB for more information
     about ICB.

     If the host is in the format :servergroup:host.com then servergroup is
     taken to be the Server Group for this server entry.

     If the host is prefixed with SSLIRC/ or SSLIRCNOCHECK/ then an attempt
     will be made to initiate an SSL/TLS connection for this host.  The
     SSLIRCNOCHECK/ form does not verify the remote server's certificate,
     which may have security implications.  Please see SSL/TLS documentation
     for more information.

     If the host is prefixed with PROXY/host:port/ then this server will be
     connected via specified HTTP proxy server.  The NO_PROXY/ prefix will
     disable any global proxy setting for this server.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   The Screen
     The screen is split into two parts, separated by an inverse-video status
     line (if supported).  The upper (larger) part of the screen displays
     responses from the IRC server.  The lower part of the screen (a single
     line) accepts keyboard input.

     Some terminals do not support certain features required by ircII, in
     which case you receive a message stating this.  If this occurs, try
     changing the terminal type or run ircII with the -d option.

   IRC Commands
     Any line beginning with the slash character (‘/’) is regarded as an ircII
     command (the command character may be changed; type /help set cmdchar).
     Any line not beginning with this character is treated as a message to be
     sent to the current channel.  To produce a listing of commands, type
     /help ?.  To receive information about the commands type /help <command>.

   The .ircrc File
     When ircII is executed, it checks the user's home directory for a .ircrc
     file, executing the commands in the file.  Commands in this file do not
     need to have a leading slash character (‘/’).  This allows predefinition
     of aliases and other features.

ENVIRONMENT
     It can be helpful to predefine certain variables in in the .cshrc,
     .profile, or .login file:

     IRCNICK       The user's ircII nickname.

     IRCNAME       The user's IRC realname (otherwise retrieved from
                   /etc/passwd)

     IRCSERVER     The default IRC server(s) (see server option for details)

     IRCSERVERSFILE
                   The file containing the default list of server(s), usually
                   /usr/local/share/irc/ircII.servers.  This file should
                   contain one server entry per line.

     HOME          Overrides the default home path in /etc/passwd.

     TERM          The type of terminal in use.

FILES
     ~/.ircrc              default initialization file

     ~/.irc/               directory into which you can put your own ircII
                           scripts, that can then be loaded with /load

     .../share/irc/        directory containing message-of-the-day, master
                           initialization, help files, and ircII scripts

     .../share/irc/script/global
                           file loaded at the start of every ircII session.

     /usr/local/share/irc/ircII.servers
                           The initial list of servers if none are provided on
                           the command line.

     /usr/local/share/irc/ircII.motd
                           Message of the day.  This file is displayed only
                           once each time it is changed.

EXAMPLES
           irc -c #users -p 5555
     Connect IRC to port number 5555 of the default host and enter on channel
     #users.

           irc Mermaid
     Use the nickname “Mermaid”.

           irc Mermaid server1:5000 server2::passwd server3
     Use the nickname “Mermaid” and the modified server list.

           irc piglet3 :ln:irc1.lamenet.org :ln:irc.us.lamenet.org
     Use the nickname “piglet3”, initially connecting to irc.au.lamenet.org,
     with also irc.us.lamenet.org added to the server list, both having a
     server group name “ln”.

           irc oink ICB/evolve.icb.net
     Use the nick “oink” making an ICB connection to evolve.icb.net.

           irc -d
     Use dumb mode.
           irc -f
     Allow use of ^S/^Q to stop/start screen display.

           irc -e elisa
     Interface IRC with a program called “elisa”.

           setenv IRCNICK Mermaid
           setenv IRCNAME
           irc
     Set the username (if not specified elsewhere) to “Mermaid”.  The user's
     name (when provided inside parentheses in response to a WHOIS command) is
     set to “The one and only :)”.

THE HELP FILES
     All of the ircII commands are fully described in the help files package.
     The best way to start here is with the /HELP ? command as this prints a
     listing of all available help files.

     Access to HTML version of the help files is available from
     http://eterna23.net/ircii/help/. Note that these are generated from the
     builtin help files and may have formatting issues.

SIGNALS
     ircII handles the following signals

     SIGUSR1          Closes all DCC connections and EXEC'ed processes.

     SIGUSR2          Drops ircII back to the command line.
