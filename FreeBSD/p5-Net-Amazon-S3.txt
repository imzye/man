DESCRIPTION
       This program gives a command line interface to Amazons s3 storage
       service. It does not limit the number of requests (which may cost you
       more money than if you did it a different way!) and each request costs
       Money (although some costs from EC2 may be $0.0, check latest from
       Amazon costs page) - we take NO responsibility for your bill.

COMMANDS
       buckets
           s3cl buckets

           List all buckets for this account.

       mkbucket
           s3cl mkbucket --bucket sombucketname [--jurisdiction [EU|US]]

           Create a new bucket, optionally specifying what jurisdiction it
           should be created in.

       ls  s3cl ls <bucket>:[prefix]

           List contents of a bucket, the optional prefix can be partial, in
           which case all keys matching this as the start of the key name will
           be returned.  If no prefix is supplied all keys of the bucket will
           be returned.

       cp  s3cl cp <bucket>:<key> target_file

           s3cl cp <bucket>:<key> target_directory

           Copy a single key from the bucket to the target file, or into the
           target_directory.

       sync
           s3cl sync <bucket>:[prefix] target_dir

           Downloads all files matching the prefix into a directory structure
           replicating that of the prefix and all 'sub-directories'. It will
           download ALL files - even if already on your local disk:

           http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261

             #  Data transfer "in" and "out" refers to transfer into and out
             #  of Amazon S3.  Data transferred between Amazon EC2 and
             #  Amazon S3, is free of charge (i.e., $0.00 per GB), except
             #  data transferred between Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3-Europe,
             #  which will be charged at regular rates.

       sync_up
           s3cl sync_up [--acl_short=public-read] <bucket>:[prefix] /path/

           Upload all the files below /path/ to S3, with an optional prefix at
           the start of the key name. The existing S3 files and meta data are
           fetched from S3 and the md5 (etag) is compaired to what is on the
           local disk, files are not upload if the content has not changed.

           Use --acl_short to set access control, options from
           Net::Amazon::S3::Bucket#set_acl this is only applied when the file
           is uploaded.

           Each files content-type is worked out using MIME::Types, if this
           does not match 'text/plain' is used for ASCII text files, otherwise
           a warning is issued and the file is NOT uploaded.

           Currently this does NOT remove old files from S3, and if there is
           any change to a file then the entire file will be reuploaded.

       rm  s3cl rm <bucket>:<key>

           Remove a key(file) from the bucket, removing a non-existent file is
           not classed as an error. Once removed the key (file) can not be
           restored - so use with care!
