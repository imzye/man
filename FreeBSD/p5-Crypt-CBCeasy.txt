NAME
       Crypt::CBCeasy - Easy things make really easy with Crypt::CBC

SYNOPSIS
        use Crypt::CBCeasy; # !!! YOU can not 'require' this module !!!

        IDEA::encipher($my_key, "plain-file", "crypted-file");

        $plain_text = DES::decipher($my_key, \*CRYPTO_FILE);

        $crypted = Blowfish::encipher($my_key, \*PLAIN_SOCKET);

ABSTRACT
       This module is just a helper for Crypt::CBC to make simple and usual
       jobs just one-liners.

       The current version of the module is available at CPAN.

DESCRIPTION
       After you call this module as

         use Crypt::CBCeasy IMPORT-LIST;

       it creates the encipher() and decipher() functions in all namespaces
       (packages) listed in the "IMPORT-LIST".

       Without the "IMPORT-LIST" it creates these 2 functions in the DES::,
       IDEA:: and Blowfish:: namespaces by default to stay compatible with the
       previous versions that were capable to handle only these 3 ciphers.

       You have to install "Crypt::CBC" v. 1.22 or later to work with
       "Blowfish".

       Sure IDEA:: functions will work only if you have Crypt::IDEA installed,
       DES:: - if you have Crypt::DES, Blowfish:: - if you have
       Crypt::Blowfish and Crypt::CBC is version 1.22 or above etc.

       Here's the list of the ciphers that could be called via the
       "Crypt::CBCeasy" interface today (in fact the same modules that are
       "Crypt::CBC" compatible):

         Cipher          CPAN module

         DES             Crypt::DES
         IDEA            Crypt::IDEA
         Blowfish        Crypt::Blowfish
         Twofish2        Crypt::Twofish2
         DES_PP          Crypt::DES_PP
         Blowfish_PP     Crypt::Blowfish_PP
         Rijndael        Crypt::Rijndael
         TEA             Crypt::TEA

       Note that cipher names are case sensitive in the "IMPORT-LIST", so
       "blowfish" will give an error.  Type them exactly as they are written
       in the correspondent underlying modules.

       Both encipher() and decipher() functions take 3 parameters:

         1 - en/decryption key
         2 - source
         3 - destination

       The sources could be: an existing file, a scalar (just a string that
       would be encrypted), an opened filehandle, any other object that
       inherits from the filehandle, for example IO::File or FileHandle
       object, and socket.

       Destinations could be any of the above except scalar, because we can
       not distinguish between scalar and output file name here.

       Well, it's easier to look at the examples:

       ($fh vars here are IO::Handle, IO::File or FileHandle objects,
       variables of type "GLOB", "GLOB" refs or sockets)

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, "in-file", "out-file" );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, *IN, "out-file" );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, \*IN, "out-file" );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, $fh_in, "out-file" );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, "in-file", *OUT );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, "in-file", \*OUT );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, "in-file", $fh_out );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, *IN, *OUT );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, \*IN, \*OUT );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, $fh_in, $fh_out );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, $plain_text, "out-file" );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, $plain_text, *OUT );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, $plain_text, \*OUT );

       IDEA::encipher( $my_key, $plain_text, $fh_out );

       any of the above will work and do what was expected.

       In addition there is a 2-argument version that returns it's result as
       scalar:

       $crypted_text = IDEA::encipher( $my_key, $plain_text );

       $crypted_text = IDEA::encipher( $my_key, "in-file" );

       $crypted_text = IDEA::encipher( $my_key, *IN );

       $crypted_text = IDEA::encipher( $my_key, \*IN );

       $crypted_text = IDEA::encipher( $my_key, $fh );

       All the same is possible for any of the ciphers in the "IMPORT-LIST".

       All functions croak on errors (such as "input file not found"), so if
       you want to trap errors use them inside the "eval{}" block and check
       the $@.

       Note that all filehandles are used in "binmode" whether you claimed
       them "binmode" or not. On Win32 for example this will result in CRLF's
       in $plain_text after

        $plain_text = DES::decipher($my_key, "crypted_file");

       if "crypted_file" was created by

        DES::encipher($my_key, "text_file", "crypted_file");

       If the filehandle was used before - it's your job to rewind it to the
       beginning and/or close.

INSTALLATION
       As this is just a plain module no special installation is needed. Put
       it into the /Crypt subdirectory somewhere in your @INC. The standard

        Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

       procedure is provided. In addition

        make html

       will produce the HTML-docs.

       This module requires

       Crypt::CBC by Lincoln Stein, lstein@cshl.org v.1.20 or later.

       one or more of

       Crypt::IDEA, Crypt::DES, Crypt::Blowfish, Crypt::Blowfish_PP,
       Crypt::Twofish2, Crypt::DES_PP or other Crypt::CBC compatible modules.

CAVEATS
       This module has been created and tested in a Win95/98/2000Pro
       environment with Perl 5.004_02 and ActiveState ActivePerl build 618.  I
       expect it to function correctly on other systems too.

CHANGES
        0.21   Mon Mar  6 07:28:41 2000  -  first public release

        0.22   Sun Feb 18 13:11:59 2001
               A horrible BUG was found by Michael Drumheller <drumheller@alum.mit.edu>
               In fact 0.21 was ALWAYS using DES despite of the desired cipher.
               DAMN!
               Fixed.
               And the test is modified so that this will never happen again.

               Now you can define the list of ciphers that are compatible
               with Crypt::CBC in the import list.
               You can not call this module with the "require" statement. This
               is incompatible with the older versions.

         0.23  Crypt::Rijndael 0.02 compatibility was approved.
               Tests are some more complex now.

         0.24  Crypt::TEA 1.01 by Abhijit Menon-Sen <ams@wiw.org> is checked
               and approved.

TODO
       Any suggestions are much appreciated.
