ELFTC_SET_TIMESTAMPS(3)                       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     elftc_set_timestamps – set file timestamps

LIBRARY
     library “libelftc”

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libelftc.h>

     int
     elftc_set_timestamps(const char *filename, struct stat *sb);

DESCRIPTION
     The elftc_set_timestamps() function is used to set the access and
     modified time stamps on a file based on the contents of a struct stat
     descriptor.

     Argument filename names an existing file in the file system.

     Argument sb points to structure of type struct stat populated by a prior
     call to fstat(2) or stat(2).

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     This function will invoke the high-resolution utimes(2) system call if
     the underlying operating system supports it.  On operating systems
     lacking support for utimes(2), the function will use lower resolution
     utime(2) system call.

EXAMPLES
     To set the access and modified times for a new file to those of an
     existing file, use:

           struct stat sb;
           const char *existing_filename, *new_filename;

           if (stat(existing_filename, &sb) < 0)
                   err(EXIT_FAILURE, "stat failed");

           if (elftc_set_timestamps(new_filename, &sb) < 0)
                   err(EXIT_FAILURE, "timestamps could not be set");
