X-CD-ROAST(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          X-CD-ROAST(1)

NAME
       xcdroast - graphical frontend to create or copy CDs.

SYNOPSIS
       xcdroast [-d <debug-level>] [-c <config-directory>] [-l <lib-
       directory>] [-o] [-n] [-w] [-a] [-f "<list of scsi-devices>"]
       [--display <display>] [--no-xshm]


DESCRIPTION
       xcdroast is a program-package dedicated to easy CD creation. It
       combines command line tools like cdrecord, cdda2wav, readcd and mkisofs
       into a graphical user interface.

       With a few simple mouse-clicks you can copy or create your own CDs,
       without long study of any command line parameters.


   OPTIONS
       -d <debug-level>
              Run X-CD-Roast in debug mode, which causes a lot of text to be
              output on the console. Set the debug-level to 10 and reproduce
              the problem to generate a useable bug-report.

       -c <config-directory>
              Sets the directory where X-CD-Roast should look for the config
              files. By default this is set to $HOME/.xcdroast.

       -l <lib-directory>
              Sets the directory where X-CD-Roast should look for its library
              files (like icons, translations and sounds). By default this is
              /usr/lib/xcdroast-0.98 or /usr/local/lib/xcdroast-0.98 (depends
              on your installation).

       -o     This disables multibyte font support. This might be handy when
              you have problems to display some special characters in the on-
              screen texts. (e.g. german umlauts)

              Note: This option has no effect on GTK2 builds.

       -n     Disables the cdrtools version check and allows X-CD-Roast to
              start when even wrong versions of cdrecord, mkisofs, readcd or
              cdda2wav are installed. Use at own risk! This also overrides the
              forced exit when you don't meet the 800x600 minimal resolution
              requirement.

       -w     Don't use cdrecord-ProDVD, even when it is installed. Sometimes
              it may be desireable to use only the free version of cdrecord.
              In this case you can disable ProDVD support here without needing
              to deinstall the ProDVD-binary.

       -a     Disable additional scans for CD-Writers or CD-Readers. In
              addition to the usual SCSI transport support (generic scsi), X-
              CD-Roast also supports the experimental ATA-transport of the
              latest linux kernels. If you set this option then this extra
              support will be disabled.

              On Mac OS X this option will disable the display of the
              autodiskmount daemon handling code. Useful when you have other
              means to handle the mount issue.

       -f "<list of scsi-devices>"
              Will not scan for devices, but force X-CD-Roast to use the given
              ones (semicolon seperated list). Most useful on AIX or OpenBSD
              system where scanning fails. Can be also used to use remote-SCSI
              devices. You can set these devices also within the setup menu.

       --display <display>
              Use the designated X display.

       --no-xshm
              Do not use the X Shared Memory extension. If X-CD-Roast is being
              displayed on a remote X server, this probably needs to be
              enabled. Also useful for any X server that doesn't properly
              support the X shared memory extension.  This will result in
              slower performance than with X shared memory enabled.


Multiple concurrent instances
       It is possible to start X-CD-Roast more than once at the same time.
       This way you can write to several CD-Writers if your system can handle
       the load.

       Be sure to give each instance of X-CD-Roast own devices and don't scan
       for devices while another copy of X-CD-Roast is already running. Also
       note that writing two CDs at the same time requires that the writers
       are at a own IDE bus each. (Real SCSI devices should be fine.)
