NAME
       dm_date - print out the system date and time

SYNOPSIS
       This performs the same operation as the unix 'date' command, but using
       the Date::Manip module.

          dm_date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]

DESCRIPTION
       This displays information about the current system time, or some other
       time. Options are:

       -h, --help
           Print online help.

       -d STRING, --date=STRING
           Display time described by STRING. STRING can be any string which
           can be parsed by Date::Manip.  Please refer to the
           Date::Manip::Date documentation for details.

       -f DATEFILE, --file=DATEFILE
           This reads each line in DATEFILE, and extracts a date from it and
           prints out the information.

           Blank lines and lines starting with a pound (#) are ignored. Lines
           not containing a valid date are also ignored.

       -r FILE, --reference=FILE
           Displays the last modification time of FILE.

       -R, --rfc-2822
           Displayc the date and time in RFC 2822 format.

           Example: Mon, 07 Aug 2006 12:34:56 -0600

       -u, --utc, --universal
           Converts the date to UT (GMT) and prints out the information.

       Only one of -d, -f, or -r should be included. If more than one is
       included, the first one from the list (-d, -f, -r) is used and any
       other is ignored.

       The format string starts with a plus (+) and contains any of the format
       directives described in Date::Manip::Date.

KNOWN BUGS
