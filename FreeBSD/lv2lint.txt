LV2LINT(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             LV2LINT(1)




NAME
       lv2lint - an LV2 lintian


SYNOPSIS
       lv2lint [OPTIONS] {PLUGIN_URI}*


DESCRIPTION
       lv2lint checks whether given LV2 plugins are up to the specification.

       It not only checks the *.ttl, but actually loads plugins (and their
       UIs) and checks whether required features and exposed extensions
       actually match between binary and *.ttl.

       It thus finds errors that cannot readily be found by just checking the
       *.ttl for validity.

       It is good practice to run it over your plugins as part of your
       continuous integration after checking them for validity with
       sord_validate and before releasing them to the public


OPTIONS
       -v

              Print version and license information


       -h

              Print usage information


       -q

              Quiet mode, show only a summary


       -d

              Show verbose test item documentation







       -u URI_PATTERN

              URI pattern (shell wildcards) to be prefixed to test, symbol and
              library whitelist patterns (can be used multiple times). The
              latter whitelist pattern will then only be effective when also
              the current URI pattern matches (e.g. for plugin itself or one
              of its UIs)


       -t TEST_PATTERN

              Test name pattern (shell wildcards) to whitelist (can be used
              multiple times)


       -I INCLUDE_DIR

              Apart from default LV2 plugin install paths, use include
              directory to search for plugins (can be used multiple times)


       -M (no)pack (Default: pack)

              Modes to enable/disable, e.g. (pack)ager mode skips some fatal
              tests for distribution packagers that are important only for
              freely distributed binaries.

              If you are a distribution packager, preferebly run with '-M
              pack' (Default).  If you want to build binaries for
              distributing, preferably run with -M nopack.


       -S (no)warn|note|pass|all (Default: fail|warn)

              Apart from errors alone (fail), also show warnings (warn), notes
              (note), passes (pass) or all (all) on console. The no- prefix
              inverts the meaning.


       -E (no)warn|note|all (Default: fail)

              Apart from errors alone (fail), also treat warnings (warn),
              notes (note) or all (all) as errors. The no- prefix inverts the
              meaning.
