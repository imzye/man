NAME
     umoscom – USB support for serial adapters based on chips made by MOSCHIP

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device umoscom

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           umoscom_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The umoscom driver provides support for various serial adapters based on
     chips from MOSCHIP.

     The device is accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
     like a tty(4).
