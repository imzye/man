IWI(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 IWI(4)

NAME
     iwi – Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG IEEE 802.11 driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, include the following lines in
     your kernel configuration file:

           device iwi
           device iwifw
           device pci
           device wlan
           device firmware

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_iwi_load="YES"

     In both cases, place the following line in loader.conf(5) to acknowledge
     the firmware license (see below):

           legal.intel_iwi.license_ack=1

DESCRIPTION
     The iwi driver provides support for Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2915ABG
     MiniPCI and 2225BG PCI network adapters.  iwi supports station, adhoc,
     and monitor mode operation.  Only one virtual interface may be configured
     at any time.  For more information on configuring this device, see
     ifconfig(8).

     This driver requires the firmware built with the iwifw module to work.
     For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
     /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_iwi.LICENSE must be agreed by adding the
     following line to loader.conf(5):

           legal.intel_iwi.license_ack=1

FILES
     /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_iwi.LICENSE      iwi firmware license

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwi0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwi0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

     Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwi0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \
               wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1

DIAGNOSTICS
     iwi%d: device timeout  The driver will reset the hardware.  This should
     not happen.

     iwi%d: firmware error  The onboard microcontroller crashed for some
     reason.  The driver will reset the hardware.  This should not happen.

     iwi%d: timeout waiting for firmware initialization to complete  The
     onboard microcontroller failed to initialize in time.  This should not
     happen.

     iwi%d: could not load firmware image '%s'  The driver failed to load the
     firmware image using the firmware(9) subsystem.  Verify the iwifw(4)
     firmware module is installed and the license agreement loader(8) tunable
     has been set.

     iwi%d: could not load boot firmware  An attempt to upload the boot
     firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed.  This should not
     happen.

     iwi%d: could not load microcode  An attempt to upload the microcode image
     to the onboard microcontroller failed.  This should not happen.

     iwi%d: could not load main firmware  An attempt to upload the main
     firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed.  This should not
     happen.
