AUTHORIZED-KEYS-TEST(1)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
           authorized-keys-test - Validate a authorized_keys file

SYNOPSIS
           authorized-keys-test ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

DESCRIPTION
       authorized-keys-test reads in the keys of an ssh client authorized_keys
       file and reports any errors.

OPTIONS
       -v  Verbose mode. Turns on DEBUG instead of INFO.

       -s  Strict mode. If on, the test insists on properly formatted
           authorized_keys files and isn't nearly as lenient as the sshd
           daemon's parser.

EXAMPLES
         $ authorized-keys-test ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

         /home/joe/.ssh/authorized_keys ok
         Found 4 keys
           * ssh-2
           * ssh-2
           * ssh-2
           * ssh-2


            # strict mode:
         $ authorized-keys-test -s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

         AuthorizedKeysFile.pm-69: Key [eme alsdkfj] failed sanity check -- ignored
         AuthorizedKeysFile.pm-71: Strict mode on: Abort
         /home/joe/.ssh/authorized_keys *not* ok
         Found 4 keys
           * ssh-2
           * ssh-2
           * ssh-2
           * ssh-2
