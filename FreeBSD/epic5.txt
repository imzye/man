EPIC5(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               EPIC5(1)

NAME
     epic5 – Internet Relay Chat client for UNIX like systems

SYNOPSIS
     epic5 [-a] [-b] [-B] [-c chan] [-d] [-f] [-F] [-h] [-H hostname]
           [-l filename] [-L filename] [-n nickname] [-o] [-O] [-p port] [-q]
           [-s] [-S] [-v] [-x] [-z username] [nickname]
           [server description list]

DESCRIPTION
     The EPIC5 program is a unix-based character oriented user agent
     ('client') to Internet Relay Chat.  It is a fully functional ircII client
     with many useful extensions.  This version works with modern irc2 server
     networks as of early 2006.  Support for non-irc2 networks (such as OPN or
     MS Comic Chat) is hit-and-miss.

OPTIONS
     -a    Append the [server description list] to the end of the hardcoded
           default server list, rather than replacing it.

     -b    Operate in so called “bot mode.” This also turns on the [-d]
           option.  EPIC5 will fork(2) immediately and the parent process will
           exit, returning you to your shell.  This was more useful before GNU
           screen and tmux, when logging out killed your processes.  It's a
           better idea to just run your bot as a foreground client in another
           window.  Some IRC networks limit the number of connections from an
           IP address to discourage bots.

     -c chan
           Join chan the first time you successfully connect to a server.

     -d    Operate in “dumb mode.” This is an alternate interface that is not
           full-screen.  Input is read from stdin, and output is written to
           stdout.  This interface is useful for screen readers and bots.

     -h    Display a moderately concise help message and exit immediately.

     -H hostname
           Use the IP address for hostname as your “local” IP address.  This
           is for people with vhosts.  Please note, the client doesn't tell
           the irc server what hostname to appear as, the server decides that.
           Usually it is the official hostname of your IP address.  This
           option overrides the IRCHOST environment variable.

     -l filename,[filename]
           Use the specified filename(s) as the startup file.  The startup
           file is loaded the first time you successfully connect to a server,
           unless you specify the [-B] option.  This overrides the EPICRC
           environment variable.  If this option is not specified, and the
           EPICRC environment variable is not set, then ~/.epicrc is the
           default startup file.

     -n nickname
           Use the specified nickname as the default nickname whenever you
           connect to an irc server.  This option overrides the IRCNICK
           environment variable.  This option can be overridden if you specify
           nickname argument in the command line (see below).

     -p port
           Use the specified port as the default port for new server
           connections.  The default port is usually 6667.  Make sure that the
           servers you want to connect to are listening on this port before
           you try to connect there.

     -q    Suppress the loading of any file when you first establish a
           connection to an irc server.

     -s    Do not connect to a server after reading the startup script.
           Instead, present the server list and advise the user to connect to
           a server manually.

     -S    The EPIC5 program is being run as a shell script.  You must make
           this look like #/path/to/epic -S other args.

     -v    Output version identification (VID) information and exit.

     -x    This undocumented feature turns on all of the XDEBUG flags.  Refer
           to the help files for XDEBUG if you want to know what happens if
           you use this.

     -z username
           Use the specified username when negotiating a connection to a new
           irc server.  This overrides the IRCUSER environment variable.  If
           this option is not specified, then the user name specified in
           /etc/passwd for your user is used.  This feature was formerly
           undocumented, but because of identd(8) this option isn't as useful
           as it once was.  If you are a sysadmin, please install identd, and
           then this flag will provide no value to your users.

     nickname
           The first bare word found is taken as the default nickname to use.
           This overrides all other options, including the -n option and the
           IRCNICK environment variable.  If all else fails, then the client
           uses your login name as the default nickname.

     server,[server]
           After the nickname, a list of one or more server specifications can
           be listed.  Unless you specify the -a option, this will replace
           your default server list!  The -a option forces any servers listed
           here to be appended to the default server list.  The format for
           server specifications is:

                 hostname:port:password:nick

           Any item can be omitted by leaving the field blank, and any
           trailing colons can also be omitted.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   The Screen:
     The screen is split into two parts, separated by an inverse-video status
     line (if supported).  The upper (larger) part of the screen displays
     responses from the ircd(8) server.  The lower part of the screen (a
     single line) accepts keyboard input.

     Some terminals do not support certain features required by epic5 , in
     which case you receive a message stating this.  If this occurs, try
     changing the terminal type or run epic5 with the -d option.

   Irc Commands:
     Any line beginning with the slash character “/” is regarded as an epic5
     command (the command character may be changed).  Any line not beginning
     with this character is treated as a message to be sent to the current
     channel.  The client has a built in help system.  Install the help files
     (they should be available at the same place you got the client) and then
     type “/help” to open up the help system.

   The .epicrc File:
     When epic5 is executed, it checks the user's home directory for a
     ~/.epicrc file, executing the commands in the file.  Commands in this
     file do not need to have a leading slash character “/” This allows
     predefinition of aliases and other features.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
     Certainly any description of epic5 in this man page will be sorely
     inadequate because most of the confusion doesn't even start until after
     you get the client to connect to a server.  But if you really have
     problems getting the client to connect to a server, try some of these:

     epic5
           Try this first.  This will assume all the defaults.  If the person
           who is maintaining epic at your site has done a halfway decent job,
           this will put you on a server that is somewhat local to you.

     epic5 nickname irc.domain.com
           or something similar will attempt to connect to the irc server
           running on the host "irc.domain.com" (fill in a real irc server
           here) with the nickname of well, "nickname".  This is the most
           common way to specify an alternate server to use.

     epic5 nickname irc.domain.com:6664
           Sometimes, some servers are really busy, and it can take them a
           long time to establish a connection with you on the default port
           (6667).  Most major servers on big public networks accept
           connections on many different ports, with the most common being
           most or all of the ports between 6660 and 6675.  You can usually
           connect much faster if you use a port other than 6667, if the
           server you're connecting to supports an alternate port.

     epic5 nickname irc.efnet.net
           If you're totally stumped and trying to get on efnet, try this.

     epic5 nickname irc.undernet.org
           If you're totally stumped and trying to get on undernet, try this.

     epic5 nickname irc.dal.net
           If you're totally stumped and trying to get on dalnet, try this.

FILES
     /usr/local/bin/epic5    the default location of the binary

     ~/.epicrc               default initialization file

     ~/.epic/                directory you can put your own epic5 scripts
                             into, that can then be loaded with /load

     /usr/local/share/epic5  default directory containing message-of-the-day,
                             server list, help files and epic5 scripts

THE HELP FILES
     Starting up the client is the easy part.  Once you get connected, you'll
     probably find you have no idea what you're doing.  That's where the help
     files come in.  If the person who maintains irc at your site didn't
     install the help files, pester them until they do.  Once the help files
     are available, use the “/help” command to get started.  There are a
     bazillion commands and a multitude of nuances that will take a few months
     to get down pat.  But once you do, you will be so firmly addicted to irc
     that your wife will divorce you, your kids will leave you, your dog will
     run away, and you'll flunk all your classes, and be left to sing the
     blues.

SIGNALS
     epic5 handles the following signals gracefully

     SIGUSR1    Closes all DCC connections and EXEC'd processes.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     It can be helpful to predefine certain variables in in the ~/.cshrc ,
     ~/.profile , or ~/.login file:

     IRCNICK    The user's default IRC nickname

     IRCNAME    The user's default IRC realname (otherwise retrieved from
                /etc/passwd )

     IRCSERVER  The user's default IRC server list (see server option for
                details)

     HOME       Overrides the default home page in /etc/password

     TERM       The type of terminal emulation to use

BUGS
     Any non-trivial piece of software has bugs.  EPIC5 is no exception.  You
     can refer to the KNOWNBUGS file that is distributed with the client
     source code for a list of problems that are known to exist and may or may
     not be fixed some day.  If you find a bug that is not listed there, you
     can refer to the BUG_FORM file that is also distributed with the source
     code.  It will give you instructions on how to fill out the report and
     where to send it.

ERRATA
     The online documentation probably should be in docbook form rather than
     in the current help format.  The entire help system is a hack.  This
     manual page only describes the options to epic, but doesn't tell you what
     to do once you get connected.
