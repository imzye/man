DWARF_SET_RELOC_APPLICATION(3)                FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     dwarf_set_reloc_application – set a library-wide relocation flag

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_set_reloc_application(int apply);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_set_reloc_application() allows applications to specify how
     relocation information is to be handled by the DWARF(3) library.

     If the argument apply holds a non-zero value, the library will process
     all the relevant “.rel” and “.rela” relocation sections and will apply
     the relocation records found to their corresponding DWARF sections.

     If the argument apply is zero, the library will not attempt to apply any
     relocations.

     The default behaviour of the library is to process relocation records.

NOTES
     Function dwarf_set_reloc_application() should be called before
     initialising a dwarf debugging context, i.e, it should be called by the
     application before calling either of the functions dwarf_init(3) or
     dwarf_elf_init(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Function dwarf_set_reloc_application() returns the previous value of the
     library-wide relocation application flag.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_set_reloc_application() does not return an error.
