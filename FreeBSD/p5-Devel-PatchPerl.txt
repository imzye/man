PATCHPERL(1)          User Contributed Perl Documentation         PATCHPERL(1)


NAME
       patchperl - patch a perl source tree

VERSION
       version 2.08

SYNOPSIS
         patchperl

COMMAND LINE SWITCHES
       "--version"
           Prints the version of Devel::PatchPerl to STDOUT and exits

       "--patchlevel"
           Devel::PatchPerl will normally update the "patchlevel.h" file in
           the perl source tree to indicate that it has applied local patches.
           This behaviour is negated if it is detected that it is operating in
           a git repository. To override this and update "patchlevel.h" when
           in a Git repository use this switch.
