RNTRACK(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             RNTRACK(1)

NAME
       RNtrack - mail tracker and packer for FTN-networks

SYNOPSIS
       rntrack [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       RNtrack is a so called netmail "tracker". Its purpose is to process
       netmail on netmail hubs, though it can be useful for an ordinary node.
       It takes a message, compares it with a mask and, if comparison was
       successful, it executes corresponding operation with this message.

OPTIONS
       -c configfile
              The configuration file name.  For example,
              -c_"d:\soft\fido\RNtrack.cfg".  The space between the '-c' and
              the beginning of the path is required.  Quotes are required.
              This parameter overrides RNTRACKCONFIG environment variable.

       -u     Unpack outbound. Shows that outbound repack is necessary.
              Before execution of all main functions, described in
              configuration file, RNtrack will unpack the entire outbound into
              the directory specified in the 'TempMail:' statement.

       -t     Run all 'ScanDir:' statements, for which one-shot execution is
              indicated, regardless of whether they should be executed right
              now or not.

       -v     Display the version of the program and the list of authors.

       -h, -? Display help screen.

ENVIRONMENT
       RNTRACKCONFIG
              If you run RNtrack without parameters, then in Windows it will
              try to read the %USERPROFILE%\fido\rntrack.cfg as a
              configuration file, in an UNIX-like operating system it will try
              to read ~/fido/etc/rntrack.conf, and in other operating systems
              it will try to find rntrack.cfg file in the current directory
              and process it.


              You may set the RNTRACKCONFIG environment variable to choose a
              different path to RNtrack configuration file.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
       Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, MacOS X, AIX, OS/2, DOS and
       Windows.
