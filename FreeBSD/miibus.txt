MIIBUS(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              MIIBUS(4)

NAME
     miibus – IEEE 802.3 Media Independent Interface network bus

SYNOPSIS
     For most network interface cards (NIC):
     device miibus

DESCRIPTION
     The miibus driver provides an interconnection between the Media Access
     Control (MAC) sublayer, the Physical Layer entities (PHY), Station
     Management (STA) entities, and the PHY Layer as defined by the IEEE 802.3
     Standard.

     The miibus layer allows network device drivers to share common support
     code for various external PHY devices.  Most 10/100 network interface
     cards either use an MII transceiver or have built-in transceivers that
     can be programmed using an MII interface.  The miibus driver currently
     handles all of the media detection, selection, and reporting using the
     ifmedia interface.  A generic driver has been included for all PHYs that
     are not handled by a specific driver, this is possible because all 10/100
     PHYs implement the same general register set along with their vendor
     specific register set.

     The following network device drivers use the miibus interface:

COMPATIBILITY
     The implementation of miibus was originally intended to have similar API
     interfaces to BSD/OS 3.0 and NetBSD, but as a result are not well behaved
     newbus device drivers.
