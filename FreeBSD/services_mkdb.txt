SERVICES_MKDB(8)        FreeBSD System Manager's Manual       SERVICES_MKDB(8)

NAME
     services_mkdb – generate the services database

SYNOPSIS
     services_mkdb [-b | -l] [-q] [-o database] [file]
     services_mkdb -u [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The services_mkdb utility creates a db(3) database for the specified
     file.  If no file is specified, then /etc/services is used.  The database
     is installed into /var/db/services.db.  The file must be in the correct
     format (see services(5)).

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Use big-endian byte order for database metadata.

     -l      Use little-endian byte order for database metadata.

     -o database
             Put the output databases in the named file.

     -q      Do not warn about duplicate services.

     -u      Print the services file to stdout, omitting duplicate entries and
             comments.

     The databases are used by the C library services routines (see
     getservent(3)).

     The -b and -l flags are mutually exclusive.  The default byte ordering is
     the current host order.

FILES
     /var/db/services.db          The current services database.
     /var/db/services.db.tmp      A temporary file.
     /etc/services                The current services file.

EXIT STATUS
     The services_mkdb utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     db(3), getservent(3), services(5)

BUGS
     Because services_mkdb guarantees not to install a partial destination
     file it must build a temporary file in the same file system and if
     successful use rename(2) to install over the destination file.

     If services_mkdb fails it will leave the previous version of the
     destination file intact.
