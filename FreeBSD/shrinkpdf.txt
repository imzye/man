NAME
     shrinkpdf – A simple wrapper around Ghostscript to reduce the file size
     of PDFs

SYNOPSIS
     shrinkpdf [-gh] [-o outfile] [-r res] infile

DESCRIPTION
     Inspired by some code found in an OpenOffice Python script, shrinkpdf
     feeds a PDF through Ghostscript, which performs lossy recompression by
     such methods as downsampling the images to a lower resolution.  The
     result should be (but not always is) a much smaller file.

     The following options are available:

     -g          Enable grayscale conversion which can further reduce output
                 size.

     -h          Show help screen.

     -o outfile  Output file, default is standard output.

     -r res      Resolution in DPI, default is 72.

     If both [infile] and [outfile] are regular files, the script checks if
     the shrunk output file is actually smaller than the input file.  If it is
     not, it writes a message to stderr and copies the input to output.

EXAMPLES
     Reduce PDF resolution to 72 dpi:
           $ shrinkpdf myfile.pdf >myfile-72dpi.pdf

     Reduce PDF resolution to 300 dpi:
           $ shrinkpdf -r 300 myfile.pdf >myfile-300dpi.pdf

     Reduce PDF resolution to 150 dpi, specify [outfile]:
           $ shrinkpdf -o myfile-150dpi.pdf -r 150 myfile.pdf
