NAME
       dbicdeploy - deploy a DBIx::Class schema to a database

SYNOPSIS
       Deploy to a database server:

           dbicdeploy schema DSN [username [password [{ extra => 'args'}]]]

       Generate a directory containing SQL to execute to create the schema:

           dbicdeploy schema directory [databases]

       Examples:

           dbicdeploy -Ilib MyApp::Schema DBI:SQLite:root/database

           dbicdeploy MyApp::Schema DBI:mysql:foo username password

           dbicdeploy MyApp::Schema DBI:Pg:foo user pass '{ pg_enable_utf8 => 1 }'

           dbicdeploy MyApp::Schema root/myapp_schema

           dbicdeploy MyApp::Schema root/myapp_schema SQLite MySQL

       See "perldoc dbicdeploy" for more information.

OPTIONS
   -Ilib
       "lib" is a directory to add to the search path for the schema.  You can
       have 0 or more of these, just like "perl".

   -l
       Alias for -Ilib

   -b
       Get libraries from blib instead.

   Schema
       The name of the DBIx::Class::Schema subclass that you want to deploy.

   DSN
       The DBI data source ("DBI:...") that you want to connect to, or the
       directory to write SQL scripts to.

   Extra Arguments
       Everything after the Schema and DSN will be passed to the connect
       command.  Usually the first two arguments are the username and
       password.

       The third argument is special.  It will be run through eval, so you can
       say "{ hash => 'of options', and => 'so on' }", and DBI will see a
       hash, not a string.  If the option doesn't parse as perl, the deploy
       will be aborted.

       In the case that you're deploying to a file instead of a database, the
       arguments after the filename are used as the names of the database
       engines you want to generate SQL for.
