NAME
     dwarf_vendor_ext – add vendor-specific macro information to a DWARF
     producer instance

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_vendor_ext(Dwarf_P_Debug dbg, Dwarf_Unsigned constant,
         char *string, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_vendor_ext() adds a vendor-specific macro information
     entry to a DWARF producer instance.

     Argument dbg should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
     dwarf_producer_init(3) or dwarf_producer_init_b(3).

     Argument constant specifies a constant value for the macro information
     entry.

     Argument string point to a NUL-terminated string containing the string
     value for the macro information entry.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to store error information
     in case of an error.

     The meaning of the arguments constant and string are not defined by the
     DWARF specification, but are instead governed by application and vendor
     conventions.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, function dwarf_vendor_ext() returns DW_DLV_OK.  In case of an
     error, function dwarf_vendor_ext() returns DW_DLV_ERROR and sets the
     argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_vendor_ext() can fail with:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Either arguments dbg or string was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_MEMORY]         An out of memory condition was encountered during
                             the execution of the function.
