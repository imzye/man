POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTIONS_INIT(3)              FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     posix_spawn_file_actions_init, posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy –
     initialize and destroy spawn file actions object

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <spawn.h>

     int
     posix_spawn_file_actions_init(posix_spawn_file_actions_t * file_actions);

     int
     posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(posix_spawn_file_actions_t * file_actions);

DESCRIPTION
     The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function initialize the object
     referenced by file_actions() to contain no file actions for posix_spawn()
     or posix_spawnp().  Initializing an already initialized spawn file
     actions object may cause memory to be leaked.

     The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function destroy the object
     referenced by file_actions; the object becomes, in effect, uninitialized.
     A destroyed spawn file actions object can be reinitialized using
     posix_spawn_file_actions_init().  The object should not be used after it
     has been destroyed.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, these functions return zero; otherwise, an
     error number is returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function will fail if:

     [ENOMEM]           Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn
                        file actions object.
