NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::OpenID - OpenID Authentication

SYNOPSIS
           use Catalyst qw( Authentication::OpenID );

           sub begin : Private {
               my($self, $c) = @_;
               if ($c->authenticate_openid) {
                   my $identity = $c->req->{openid_identity};
               } else {
                   $c->res->redirect('<your-login-screen>')
                       unless $c->res->redirect;
               }
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::OpenID implements support for OpenID
       authentication in a Catalyst application. For more information on
       OpenID, take a look at http://www.openid.net/.

       In most cases, you'll want to use this plugin in combination with a
       session plugin for Catalyst. For example,
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap, which uses a memory-mapped
       database to store session data. For an example, take a look below at
       EXAMPLE.

USAGE
   $c->authenticate_openid
       Attempts to authenticate the request using OpenID.

       There are three phases in OpenID authentication, which means that
       authenticate_openid will actually be invoked multiple times, on
       different requests.

       It will return 1 if the user was successfully authenticated, and 0
       otherwise. Since the OpenID authentication protocol involves a number
       of redirects, authenticate_openid will automatically install redirects
       in $c->response.

       After a successful authentication, your application can fetch the
       identity of the authenticated user through $c->req->{openid_identity},
       a Net::OpenID::VerifiedIdentity object.

       1.  When the initial request arrives for your application, the user
           will not yet have entered any authentication credentials. In this
           state, authenticate_openid will return 0, and will not set a
           redirect URI.

           Your application must present a login form that will allow the user
           to enter his or her OpenID identity URI; the form action should
           point back at your Catalyst application.

       2.  Given the identity URI, authenticate_openid will look up the user's
           identity server, and will automatically install a redirect in
           $c->response that points to the appropriate check URI for the
           identity server. It will return 0 in this state, as well.

           The user will then be redirected to the identity server, where
           he/she will either be recognized, or be forced to log in.

       3.  Once the user has successfully authenticated on the remote server,
           the identity server will redirect back to your application.
           authenticate_openid will again be invoked, this time with state
           telling it to verify the response from the identity server.

           If the authentication is successful, authenticate_openid will
           return 1, and set $c->req->{openid_identity}.

       Confused? The EXAMPLE may help to clear it up.

EXAMPLE
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::OpenID is best used combined with a
       Catalyst session plugin, like Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap. In
       general, all of the session plugins have a similar interface, so the
       example below should work with that share this interface.

       This example uses a begin method in the main application class to force
       authentication throughout the application. It first checks to see
       whether the request included a session ID, and if so, it simply looks
       up a user account based on the user ID in the session.

       In the other case, however, where the request does not have a session,
       it attempts to use authenticate_openid to authenticate the request. If
       the authentication is successful, we have a verified identity, so we
       can either load an existing user record, or provision a new account.

       If the authentication is not successful, the assumption is that either
       authenticate_openid has set a redirect for where we need to send the
       user, or no authentication credentials were provided at all. In the
       latter case, we can just send the user off to our application's login
       form.

       Note: the only bit of voodoo here is the "$c->req->action(undef);"
       code. This seems to be necessary to force Catalyst not to handle the
       rest of the request, and to just issue the redirect right away.

           sub begin : Private {
               my($self, $c) = @_;
               my $session = $c->session;
               return if $c->req->action eq 'login';
               if ($c->sessionid && $c->session->{user_id}) {
                   $c->req->{user} = My::User->lookup($c->session->{user_id});
               } else {
                   if ($c->authenticate_openid) {
                       $c->req->{user} = $c->get_user($c->req->{openid_identity});
                       $c->session->{user_id} = $c->req->{user}->user_id;
                       $c->req->action(undef);
                       $c->res->redirect('/');
                   } else {
                       $c->req->action(undef);
                       $c->res->redirect('/login')
                           unless $c->res->redirect;
                   }
               }
           }

           sub get_user {
               my $c = shift;
               my($identity) = @_;
               ## Lookup or provision a user account, using the $identity.
           }
