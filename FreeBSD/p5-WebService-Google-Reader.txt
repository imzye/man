SYNOPSIS
           use WebService::Google::Reader;

           my $reader = WebService::Google::Reader->new(
               host     => 'www.inoreader.com',

           );

           my $feed = $reader->unread(count => 100);
           my @entries = $feed->entries;

           # Fetch past entries.
           while ($reader->more($feed)) {
               my @entries = $feed->entries;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       The "WebService::Google::Reader" module provides an interface to
       webservices using the Google Reader API. The only tested webservice at
       this time is www.inoreader.com.

METHODS
       $reader = WebService::Google::Reader->new
           Creates a new WebService::Google::Reader object. The following
           named parameters are accepted:

           host
               The hostname of the service.

           username and password
               Required for accessing any personalized or account-related
               functionality (reading-list, editing, etc.).

           appid and appkey
               Inoreader requires users to also obtain an appid and appkey.

               See <http://www.inoreader.com/developers/register-app>

           https / secure
               Use https scheme for all requests, even when not required.

           ua  An optional useragent object.

           debug
               Enable debugging. Default: 0. This will dump the headers and
               content for both requests and responses.

           compress
               Disable compression. Default: 1. This is useful when debugging
               is enabled and you want to read the response content.

       $error = $reader->error
           Returns the error string, if any.

       $response = $reader->response
           Returns an HTTP::Response object for the last submitted request.
           Can be used to determine the details of an error.

   Feed generators
       The following methods request an ATOM feed and return a subclass of
       "XML::Atom::Feed". These methods accept the following optional named
       parameters:

           order / sort
               The sort order of the entries: desc (default) or asc in time.
               When ordering by asc, Google only returns entries within 30
               days, whereas the default order has no limitation.

           start_time
               Request entries only newer than this time (represented as a
               unix timestamp).

           exclude(feed => $feed|[@feeds], tag => $tag|[@tags])
               Accepts a hash reference to one or more of feed / tag / state.
               Each of which is a scalar or array reference.

       feed($feed)
           Accepts a single feed url.

       tag($tag)
           Accepts a single tag name. See "TAGS"

       state($state)
           Accepts a single state name. See "STATES".

       shared
           Shortcut for state('broadcast').

       starred
           Shortcut for state('starred').

       unread
           Shortcut for state('reading-list', exclude => { state => 'read' })

       liked
           Shortcut for state('like').

       search($query, %params)
           Accepts a query string and the following named parameters:

           feed / state / tag
               One or more (as a array reference) feed / state / tag to
               search. The default is to search all feed subscriptions.

           results
               The total number of search results: defaults to 1000.

           count
               The number of entries per fetch: defaults to 40.

           order / sort
               The sort order of the entries: desc (default) or asc in time.

       more / previous / next
           A feed generator only returns $count entries. If more are
           available, calling this method will return a feed with the next
           $count entries.

   List generators
       The following methods return an object of type
       "WebService::Google::Reader::ListElement".

       counts
           Returns a list of subscriptions and a count of unread entries. Also
           listed are any tags or states which have positive unread counts.
           The following accessors are provided: id, count. The maximum count
           reported is 1000.

       feeds
           Returns the list of user subscriptions. The following accessors are
           provided: id, title, categories, firstitemmsec. categories is a
           reference to a list of "ListElement"s providing accessors: id,
           label.

       preferences
           Returns the list of preference settings. The following accessors
           are provided: id, value.

       tags
           Returns the list of user-created tags. The following accessors are
           provided: id, shared.

       userinfo
           Returns the list of user information. The following accessors are
           provided: isBloggerUser, userId, userEmail.

   Edit feeds
       The following methods are used to edit feed subscriptions.

       edit_feed($feed|[@feeds], %params)

               removed from the user's subscriptions.

           title
               Accepts a title to associate with the feed. This probaby
               wouldn't make sense to use when there are multiple feeds.
               (Maybe later will consider allowing a list here and zipping the
               feed and title lists).

           tag / state / untag / unstate

   Private methods
       The following private methods may be of use to others.

           "HTTP::Response" on success, false on failure (check error).

       _token
           This is automatically called from within methods that require a
           user token.  If successful, the token is available via the token
           accessor.

           Returns a list of all the known states. See "STATES".
