SVN::Notify::Filter::AuthZMail(3)          User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       SVN::Notify::Filter::AuthZMail - Determines Subversion accounts to
       receive the email, via the AuthZSVNAccess file

VERSION
       Version 1.01

SYNOPSIS
       This is intended to work with SVN::Notify, as part of a subversion
       post-commit hook.

           svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" ..etc..  \
                     --filter AuthZMail                         \
                           --authz_file /x/x/x/authz            \
                           --authz_module yyy

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a filter for SVN::Notify, intended to assist with the
       maintenance of access control lists with Subversion repositories.  This
       module removes the need to maintain a separate list of people to send
       email notification messages to (via svnnotify --to arguments), from the
       AuthZSVNAccessFile.

       Based upon the Subversion revision, it finds the files that were
       modified in the commit, determines the union of people that access to
       those files (via the AuthZ file), and passes those account names into
       the SVN::Notify.  Hopefully, this module follows Subversion's rules for
       determining access.

       This module works well with SVN::Notify::Filter::EmailFlatFileDB.  If
       this filter is put first in the svnnotify argument list, it will add to
       the usernames to SVN::Notify's list of recipient names, and then the
       EmailFlatFileDB filter will convert those usernames into email
       addresses.

       (Note that for SVN::Notify versions less than 2.76, you may need to
       include a --to option line in order to bypass some of SVN::Notify's
       checking.)

DEPENDENCIES
       This module depends upon SVN::Notify, by David Wheeler.  It also
       depends upon SVN::Access, by Michael Gregorowicz, to parse the AuthZ
       file.

FUNCTIONS
   from
       This SVN::Notify callback function is not used.

   pre_prepare
       This SVN::Notify callback function adds the usernames to the list,
       based on the contents of the authz file.  This is executed
       automatically by the SVN::Notify framework.  It will add to the list of
       recipients.  Note that any other SVN::Notify::Filter that manipulates
       the list of recipients should be specified after this filter.
