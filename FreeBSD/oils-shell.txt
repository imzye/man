NAME
     osh – command language interpreter

SYNOPSIS
     osh [options] script [args]
     osh [options] -c [command_string] [args]

DESCRIPTION
     The osh utility is a bash(1)-compatible command language interpreter: it
     reads commands either from standard input, a script file or command-line
     arguments and executes them.

     osh accepts POSIX sh(1) arguments, with the following differences:

     -n      Only validate the syntax.  Also prints the AST.

     --ast-format
             What format the AST should be in.

ENVIRONMENT
     OILS_HIJACK_SHEBANG

     OILS_CRASH_DUMP_DIR

FILES
     The interactive shell only sources ~/.config/oils/oshrc on startup.

EXIT STATUS
     The osh utility exits with one of the following values:

     1    One or more runtime errors occurred.

     2    One or more parsing errors occurred, either due to incorrect script
          syntax or improper invocation of a shell builtin.

     126  Permission was denied when running a command.

     127  The referenced command or script could not be found.
