NAME
     elfctl – change an ELF binary's feature control note

SYNOPSIS
     elfctl [-h | --help] [-l] [-e featurelist] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The elfctl utility modifies feature flags in the feature control note in
     an ELF binary.

     The options are as follows:

     -h | --help
             Print a usage message and exit.

     -l      List known ELF feature flags.

     -e featurelist
             Edit features from the given comma separated list featurelist.
             featurelist starts with one of the three operations: “+” to turn
             on the features, “-” to turn off the features, “=” to only turn
             on the given features.  A comma separated list of feature names
             follows the operation.

     If -e is not specified elfctl displays the status of each feature in the
     ELF note in each file ....

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails if a file does
     not exist, is too short, or fails to find or edit features note.

EXAMPLES
     The following is an example of a typical usage of the elfctl command:

           elfctl file
           elfctl -e +aslr file
