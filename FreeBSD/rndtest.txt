RNDTEST(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             RNDTEST(4)

NAME
     rndtest – FIPS 140-2 random number generator test monitor

SYNOPSIS
     device rndtest

DESCRIPTION
     The rndtest driver “hooks up” to hardware crypto devices to monitor the
     entropy data passed to the random(4) subsystem.  This data is
     periodically tested for FIPS 140-2 compliance and statistics are
     collected.  If the harvested entropy fails any of the FIPS test suite,
     then it is discarded and testing is continuously applied until “good
     data” is received from the device.  Failures are optionally reported on
     the console.

SEE ALSO
     crypto(4), hifn(4), random(4), safe(4), crypto(9)

HISTORY
     The idea for this and the original code came from Jason L. Wright.  The
     rndtest device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.

BUGS
     Crypto device drivers must be compiled specially to make use of this
     driver; this should not be necessary.  This feature might better be
     integrated into the random(4) subsystem where it can be applied to
     devices that claim to supply “pure entropy”.
