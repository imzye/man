LUMINA-FM(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           LUMINA-FM(1)



NAME
     lumina-fm – is a utility used for browsing and interacting with files on
     the system.


SYNOPSIS
     lumina-fm [-new-instance] [FILE]



DESCRIPTION
     lumina-fm is the CLI command to open Insight File Manager.  The file
     manager interface maintains files stored on the system.  lumina-fm can
     take an optional argument and file path.  If no argument or file path is
     specified, the command opens the Insight File Manager in the home
     directory.  Specifying a file path while the interface is open creates a
     new tab in the existing window.

     -new-instance
             Opens Insight File Manager in a new window.


EXAMPLES
           % lumina-fm -new-instance /usr/bin/etc
     Opens Insight in a new window pointed to the specified directory.

           % lumina-fm /usr/etc/bin
     Opens the specified directory with the file manager.  If Insight is
     already open, a second tab is created.
