NAME
       Net::IPv4Addr - Perl extension for manipulating IPv4 addresses.

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::IPv4Addr qw( :all );

         my ($ip,$cidr) = ipv4_parse( "127.0.0.1/24" );
         my ($ip,$cidr) = ipv4_parse( "192.168.100.10 / 255.255.255.0" );

         my ($net,$msk) = ipv4_network( "192.168.100.30" );

         my $broadcast  = ipv4_broadcast( "192.168.100.30/26" );

         if ( ipv4_in_network( "192.168.100.0", $her_ip ) ) {
           print "Welcome !";
         }

         etc.

DESCRIPTION
       Net::IPv4Addr provides functions for parsing IPv4 addresses both in
       traditional address/netmask format and in the new CIDR format.  There
       are also methods for calculating the network and broadcast address and
       also to see check if a given address is in a specific network.

ADDRESSES
       All of Net::IPv4Addr functions accepts addresses in many format. The
       parsing is very liberal.

       All these addresses would be accepted:

           127.0.0.1
           192.168.001.010/24
           192.168.10.10/255.255.255.0
           192.168.30.10 / 21
           10.0.0.0 / 255.0.0.0
           255.255.0.0

       Those wouldn't though:

           272.135.234.0
           192.168/16

       Most functions accepts the address and netmask or masklength in the
       same scalar value or as separate values. That is either

           my($ip,$masklength) = ipv4_parse($cidr_str);
           my($ip,$masklength) = ipv4_parse($ip_str,$msk_str);

USING
       No functions are exported by default. Either use the ":all" tag to
       import them all or explicitly import those you need.

FUNCTIONS
       ipv4_parse
               my ($ip,$msklen) = ipv4_parse($cidr_str);
               my $cidr = ipv4_parse($ip_str,$msk_str);
               my ($ip) = ipv4_parse($ip_str,$msk_str);

           Parse an IPv4 address and in scalar context the address in CIDR
           format and in an array context the address and the mask length.

           If the parameters doesn't contains a netmask or a mask length, in
           scalar context only the IPv4 address is returned and in an array
           context the mask length is undefined.

           If the function cannot parse its input, it croaks. Trap it using
           "eval" if don't like that.

       ipv4_network
               my $cidr = ipv4_network($ip_str);
               my $cidr = ipv4_network($cidr_str);
               my ($net,$msk) = ipv4_network( $net_str, $msk_str);

           In scalar context, this function returns the network in CIDR format
           in which the address is. In array context, it returns the network
           address and its mask length as a two elements array. If the input
           is an host without a netmask of mask length, the default netmask is
           assumed.

           Again, the function croak if the input is invalid.

       ipv4_broadcast
               my ($broadcast) = ipv4_broadcast($ip_str);
               my $broadcast   = ipv4_broadcast($ip_str,$msk_str);

           This function returns the broadcast address. If the input doesn't
           contains a netmask or mask length, the default netmask is assumed.

           This function croaks if the input is invalid.

       ipv4_network
               my $cidr = ipv4_network($net_str);
               my $cidr = ipv4_network($cidr_sstr);
               my ($net,$msk) = ipv4_network( $ip_str, $mask_str);

           In scalar context, this function returns the network in CIDR format
           in which the address is. In array context, it returns the network
           address and its mask length as a two elements array. If the input
           is an host without a netmask or mask length, the default netmask is
           assumed.

           Again, the function croak if the input is invalid.

       ipv4_in_network
               print "Yes" if ipv4_in_network( $cidr_str1, $cidr_str2);
               print "Yes" if ipv4_in_network( $ip_str1, $mask_str1, $cidr_str2 );
               print "Yes" if ipv4_in_network( $ip1, $mask1, $ip2, $msk2 );

           This function checks if the second network is contained in the
           first one and it implements the following semantics :

              If net1 or net2 is a magic address (0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.255)
              than this function returns true.

              If net1 is an host, net2 will be in the same net only if
              it is the same host.

              If net2 is an host, it will be contained in net1 only if
              it is part of net1.

              If net2 is only part of net1 if it is entirely contained in
              net1.

           Trap bad input with "eval" or else.

       ipv4_checkip
               if ($ip = ipv4_checkip($str) ) {
                   # Do something
               }

           Return the IPv4 address in the string or undef if the input doesn't
           contains a valid IPv4 address.

       ipv4_cidr2msk
               my $netmask = ipv4_cidr2msk( $cidr );

           Returns the netmask corresponding to the mask length given in
           input.  As usual, croaks if it doesn't like your input (in this
           case a number between 0 and 32).

       ipv4_msk2cidr
               my $masklen = ipv4_msk2cidr( $msk );

           Returns the mask length of the netmask in input. As usual, croaks
           if it doesn't like your input.
