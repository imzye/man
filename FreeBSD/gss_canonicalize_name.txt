GSS_CANONICALIZE_NAME(3)                FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_canonicalize_name – Convert an internal name to an MN

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_canonicalize_name(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         const gss_name_t input_name, const gss_OID mech_type,
         gss_name_t *output_name);

DESCRIPTION
     Generate a canonical mechanism name (MN) from an arbitrary internal name.
     The mechanism name is the name that would be returned to a context
     acceptor on successful authentication of a context where the initiator
     used the input_name in a successful call to gss_acquire_cred(),
     specifying an OID set containing mech_type as its only member, followed
     by a call to gss_init_sec_context(), specifying mech_type as the
     authentication mechanism.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status      Mechanism specific status code.

     input_name        The name for which a canonical form is desired.

     mech_type         The authentication mechanism for which the canonical
                       form of the name is desired.  The desired mechanism
                       must be specified explicitly;
                        no default is provided.

     output_name       The resultant canonical name.  Storage associated with
                       this name must be freed by the application after use
                       with a call to gss_release_name().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE          Successful completion.

     GSS_S_BAD_MECH          The identified mechanism is not supported.

     GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE      The provided internal name contains no elements
                             that could be processed by the specified
                             mechanism.

     GSS_S_BAD_NAME          The provided internal name was ill-formed.
