NAME
       Net::XMPP - XMPP Perl Library

SYNOPSIS
       Net::XMPP provides a Perl user with access to the Extensible Messaging
       and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

       For more information about XMPP visit:

       <http://www.xmpp.org>

DESCRIPTION
       Net::XMPP is a convenient tool to use for any perl script that would
       like to utilize the XMPP Instant Messaging protocol.  While not a
       client in and of itself, it provides all of the necessary back-end
       functions to make a CGI client or command-line perl client feasible and
       easy to use.  Net::XMPP is a wrapper around the rest of the official
       Net::XMPP::xxxxxx packages.

       There is are example scripts in the example directory that provide you
       with examples of very simple XMPP programs.

       NOTE: The parser that XML::Stream::Parser provides, as are most Perl
       parsers, is synchronous.  If you are in the middle of parsing a packet
       and call a user defined callback, the Parser is blocked until your
       callback finishes.  This means you cannot be operating on a packet,
       send out another packet and wait for a response to that packet.  It
       will never get to you.  Threading might solve this, but as of this
       writing threading in Perl is not quite up to par yet.  This issue will
       be revisted in the future.

EXAMPLES
         use Net::XMPP;
         my $client = Net::XMPP::Client->new();

METHODS
       The Net::XMPP module does not define any methods that you will call
       directly in your code.  Instead you will instantiate objects that call
       functions from this module to do work.  The three main objects that you
       will work with are the Message, Presence, and IQ modules. Each one
       corresponds to the Jabber equivalent and allows you get and set all
       parts of those packets.

       There are a few functions that are the same across all of the objects:

   Retrieval functions
       GetXML
           Returns the XML string that represents the data contained in the
           object.

             $xml  = $obj->GetXML();

       GetChild
           Returns an array of Net::XMPP::Stanza objects that represent all of
           the stanzas in the object that are namespaced.  If you specify a
           namespace then only stanza objects with that XMLNS are returned.

             @xObj = $obj->GetChild();
             @xObj = $obj->GetChild("my:namespace");

       GetTag
           Return the root tag name of the packet.

       GetTree
           Return the XML::Stream::Node object that contains the data.  See
           XML::Stream::Node for methods you can call on this object.

   Creation functions
       NewChild
             NewChild(namespace)
             NewChild(namespace,tag)

           Creates a new Net::XMPP::Stanza object with the specified namespace
           and root tag of whatever the namespace says its root tag should be.
           Optionally you may specify another root tag if the default is not
           desired, or the namespace requres you to set one.

             $xObj = $obj->NewChild("my:namespace");
             $xObj = $obj->NewChild("my:namespace","foo");

           ie. <foo xmlns='my:namespace'...></foo>

       InsertRawXML
             InsertRawXML(string)

           puts the specified string raw into the XML packet that you call
           this on.

             $message->InsertRawXML("<foo></foo>")
               <message...>...<foo></foo></message>

             $x = $message->NewChild(..);
             $x->InsertRawXML("test");

             $query = $iq->GetChild(..);
             $query->InsertRawXML("test");

       ClearRawXML
             ClearRawXML()

           Removes the raw XML from the packet.

   Removal functions
       RemoveChild
             RemoveChild()
             RemoveChild(namespace)

           Removes all of the namespaces child elements from the object.  If a
           namespace is provided, then only the children with that namespace
           are removed.

   Test functions
       DefinedChild
             DefinedChild()
             DefinedChild(namespace)

           Returns 1 if there are any known namespaced stanzas in the packet,
           0 otherwise.  Optionally you can specify a namespace and determine
           if there are any stanzas with that namespace.

             $test = $obj->DefinedChild();
             $test = $obj->DefinedChild("my:namespace");

PACKAGES
       For more information on each of these packages, please see the man page
       for each one.

   Net::XMPP::Client
       This package contains the code needed to communicate with an XMPP
       server: login, wait for messages, send messages, and logout.  It uses
       XML::Stream to read the stream from the server and based on what kind
       of tag it encounters it calls a function to handle the tag.

   Net::XMPP::Protocol
       A collection of high-level functions that Client uses to make their
       lives easier.  These methods are inherited by the Client.

   Net::XMPP::JID
       The XMPP IDs consist of three parts: user id, server, and resource.
       This module gives you access to those components without having to
       parse the string yourself.

   Net::XMPP::Message
       Everything needed to create and read a <message/> received from the
       server.

   Net::XMPP::Presence
       Everything needed to create and read a <presence/> received from the
       server.

   Net::XMPP::IQ
       IQ is a wrapper around a number of modules that provide support for the
       various Info/Query namespaces that XMPP recognizes.

   Net::XMPP::Stanza
       This module represents a namespaced stanza that is used to extend a
       <message/>, <presence/>, and <iq/>.

       The man page for Net::XMPP::Stanza contains a listing of all supported
       namespaces, and the methods that are supported by the objects that
       represent those namespaces.

   Net::XMPP::Namespaces
       XMPP allows for any stanza to be extended by any bit of XML.  This
       module contains all of the internals for defining the XMPP based
       extensions defined by the IETF.  The documentation for this module
       explains more about how to add your own custom namespace and have it be
       supported.

BUGS
       See unpatched issues at
       <https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Net-XMPP>.

       There is at least one issue with XML::Stream providing different node
       structures depending on how the node is created. Net::XMPP should now
       be able to handle this, but who knows what else lurks.
