CHI::Driver::TokyoTyrant(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       CHI::Driver::TokyoTyrant -- Distributed cache via Tokyo Tyrant - a
       network interface to the DBM  Tokyo Cabinet.

SYNOPSIS
           use CHI;

           my $cache = CHI->new(
               driver => 'TokyoTyrant',
               namespace => 'products',
               hostname  => 'localhost',
               port      => 1978,
           );

DESCRIPTION
       A CHI driver that uses Tokyo Tyrant as a storage backend.  As Tokyo
       Tyrant Tokyo Tyrant also supports Memcached protocol so other option is
       to use it with Memcached driver.  This driver is much faster though.

CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS
       Namespaces are handled by prepending namespace to the key.  Hostname
       defaults to localhost and port to 1978.

METHODS
       Besides the standard CHI methods:

       rdb Returns a handle to the underlying TokyoTyrant::RDB object. You can
           use this to call specific methods that are not supported by the
           general API.
