KVM_NLIST(3)           FreeBSD Library Functions Manual           KVM_NLIST(3)

NAME
     kvm_nlist, kvm_nlist2 – retrieve symbol table names from a kernel image

LIBRARY
     Kernel Data Access Library (libkvm, -lkvm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <kvm.h>
     #include <nlist.h>

     int
     kvm_nlist(kvm_t *kd, struct nlist *nl);

     int
     kvm_nlist2(kvm_t *kd, struct kvm_nlist *nl);

DESCRIPTION
     The kvm_nlist() function retrieves the symbol table entries indicated by
     the name list argument nl.  This argument points to an array of nlist
     structures, terminated by an entry whose n_name field is NULL (see
     nlist(3)).  Each symbol is looked up using the n_name field, and if
     found, the corresponding n_type and n_value fields are filled in.  These
     fields are set to 0 if the symbol is not found.

     The kldsym(2) system call is used to locate symbols in live kernels.
     This is a less than perfect emulation of the nlist values but has the
     advantage of being aware of kernel modules and is reasonably fast.

     The kvm_nlist2() function retrieves the symbol table entries indicated by
     the name list argument nl.  This argument points to an array of struct
     kvm_nlist structures, terminated by an entry whose n_name field is NULL
     These structures are similar to the nlist structures used by kvm_nlist()
     except that the n_value field uses a different type (kvaddr_t) to avoid
     truncation when examining non-native kernel images.

RETURN VALUES
     The kvm_nlist() and kvm_nlist2() functions return the number of invalid
     entries found.  If the kernel symbol table was unreadable, -1 is
     returned.
