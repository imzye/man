NAME
     zfs-wait – wait for activity in ZFS filesystem to stop

SYNOPSIS
     zfs wait [-t activity[,activity]…] filesystem

DESCRIPTION
     Waits until all background activity of the given types has ceased in the
     given filesystem.  The activity could cease because it has completed or
     because the filesystem has been destroyed or unmounted.  If no activities
     are specified, the command waits until background activity of every type
     listed below has ceased.  If there is no activity of the given types in
     progress, the command returns immediately.

     These are the possible values for activity, along with what each one
     waits for:
           deleteq  The filesystem's internal delete queue to empty

     Note that the internal delete queue does not finish draining until all
     large files have had time to be fully destroyed and all open file handles
     to unlinked files are closed.
