NAME
       rebot3 - rename MP3 files using their corresponding CDDB entries

SYNOPSIS
       rebot3 [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       rebot3 is a utiliy intended for renaming MP3 files using their
       corresponding CDDB entries. It works best in combination with
       cdda2wav(1), but it is also usefull in combination with other rippers
       like cdparanoia(1).  If run without any option specified on the command
       line it looks in the current directory for the file audio.cddb which is
       written by cdda2wav(1).  Out of this file rebot3 tries to extract the
       disc id which used to identify the corresponding CDDB entry. It looks
       also in the current directory for MP3 files containg a one or two digit
       number in the filename (not in the extension ;-). Then it simply
       renames all found MP3 files using a default pattern. Optionally an ID3
       tag can be attached to the MP3 files.  rebot3 can retrieve the disc
       information from a remote CDDB over the internet or a local CDDB,
       created by cd (and other) players like xmcd(1), kscd, gcd or xmms.

OPTIONS
       -r, --remote-cddb
              retrieve the disc information from a remote CDDB server. If
              omitted it will use a local CDDB. The correct CD has to be
              inserted into your cdrom drive.

       -cs SERVER[:PORT], --cddb-server SERVER[:PORT]
              use SERVER as CDDB server. Optionally you can specify the port
              used to connect to the server.  The default is
              cddb.cddb.com:8880.

       -cd DEVICE, --cdrom-device DEVICE
              use DEVICE as cdrom device. Defaults to /dev/cdrom.

       -id ID, --disc-id ID
              use ID as disc id, do not look for audio.cddb.  If used in
              combination with remote cddb mode you have to specify the genre
              using the -g option. In this case rebot3 will not try to
              calculate the disc id from the CD in your cdrom drive.

       -if FILE, --id-file FILE
              look in FILE for the disc id.

       -g GENRE
              use GENRE as the genre the album (the set of MP3 files to
              rename) is listed under at the CDDB (or FreeDB). This is most
              useful in combination with -id in remote CDDB mode, which
              enables you to use the CDDB even if you don't have the cd the
              MP3 files where ripped from (inserted in your CD drive). You
              could use the web interfaces to CDDB or FreeDB to obtain the
              disc id and the genre assigned to the album.

       -G     print the list of CDDB genres known by the CDDB server.  On
              first use it should be used in combination with remote CDDB mode
              to let rebot3 download the list from a CDDB server. It will then
              save the obtained information in a file called .cddb-genres in
              your home directory.  Next time when used in local CDDB mode it
              will use this file to retrieve the list of known genres.

       -c, --use-cdda2wav
              use cdda2wav(1) to determine the disc id. The correct CD has to
              be inserted into your cdrom drive.

       -C, --use-cd
              calculate the disc id using the CD in your cdrom drive.

       -db PATH, --cddb-path PATH
              look in PATH for CDDB files. Defaults to ~/.cddb, ~/cddb,
              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xmcd/cddb and /opt/kde/share/apps/kscd/cddb.

       -x FILE, --xmms-cdinfo-file FILE
              use FILE as xmms cdinfo file. Defaults to ~/.xmms/cdinfo.

       -xo, --xmms-cdinfo-only
              search in the xmms cdinfo file only for a matching CDDB entry.

       -f FILES, --file[s] FILES
              rename FILES instead of all the MP3 files in the current
              directory.  This option must be specified as the last one,
              because all options specified after -f will be treated as normal
              filenames. If a filename does not contain any track number you
              have to specify the correct one with -l.

       -l LIST, --track-list LIST
              use LIST instead of the numbers in the filenames. Multiple track
              numbers must be seperated by comma or colon. This option also
              invokes -S.

       -S, --dont-sort
              don't sort file list.

       -n NUMBER, --use-number NUMBER
              use the n'th number (not digit) in the mp3's filenames as the
              track number, where n is specified by NUMBER. Default is to use
              the first number.

       -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
              rename files using PATTERN.  PATTERN may contain the following
              symbols:
                - %%, means a single %
                - %a or %{artist}, mean the artist's name
                - %b or %{album}, mean the album name
                - %n or %{number}, mean the track number
                - %t or %{title}, mean the track title.
              PATTERN defaults to "%b - %n - %t".

       -t, --add-id3-tag[s]
              append ID3 tag to each file. The comment section of the tag will
              be used for storing the track number.

       -to, --id3tag[s]-only
              append ID3 tags only, do not rename files.

       -T, --remove-tag[s]
              remove ID3 tag from each file.

       -u [UNDOFILE], --undo [UNDOFILE]
              create an undo file wich enables you to restore the old
              filenames in case the result of renaming is not what you
              expected. This defaults to undo but you can specify another name
              with UNDOFILE.  To be able to use this file you must have mmv(1)
              installed. All you have to do to restore the old filenames is
              typing "cat UNDOFILE | mmv".

       -uo [UNDOFILE], --undo-only [UNDOFILE]
              same as above with the difference that only the undo file is
              created and no file is renamed.

       -s, --silent
              supress any output (except error messages and warnings).

       -q, --quiet
              same as above.

       -d, --debug
              do not rename files, just print the resulting names to STDOUT.

       -h, --help
              print a short summary of all available commands.

ENVIRONMENT
       REBOT_CDDB_PATHS
              may contain a list of paths (seperated by colons) where to look
              for CDDB files.  Overridden by -db option.

       REBOT_PATTERN
              may contain a default pattern. Overridden by -p option.

       REBOT_CDDB_SERVER
              may contain the a default CDDB server, where server and port
              have to be seperated by a colon. Overridden by -cs option.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If all oprations complete successfully rebot3 exits with status 0,
       otherwise it returns a non-zero status.

EXAMPLES
       The following example is usefull when run in combination with
       cdparanoia(1). It uses the CD in the cdrom drive to calculate the disc
       id, uses a local CDDB, renames all mp3 files in the current directory
       that have a one or two digit number in the filename, appends ID3 tags
       to these files and creates an undo file.

              rebot3 -C -t -u

       The next example uses the cdrom drive at /dev/hdc to get the CD's table
       of contents and the remote CDDB server de.freedb.org at port 8880 to
       get the disc information.

              rebot3 -r -cs de.freedb.org:8880 -cd /dev/hdc

       This example will use a local CDDB to get the information about a disc
       with the id 3b115617 and then rename foo.mp3 to 03 - The Black
       Rider.mp3 and bar.mp3 to 19 - Jesus Gonna Be Here.mp3.

              rebot3 -id 3b115617 -p '%n - %t' -l 4,20 -f foo.mp3 bar.mp3

       The last example uses the disc id 06118912 in combination with the
       genre misc to fetch the correct disc information from a remote cddb
       server, renames the files found in the current working directory using
       this information and creates an undo file. This way don't need to have
       the correct CD in your cdrom drive.

              rebot3 -r -id 06118912 -g misc -u
