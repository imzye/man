S7(1)                          SEED7 INTERPRETER                         S7(1)

NAME
       s7 - interpreter for the Seed7 programming language

SYNOPSIS
       s7 [ options ] sourcefile [ parameters ]

DESCRIPTION
       s7 invokes the Seed7 interpreter.  Seed7 is an extensible general
       purpose programming language. It is a higher level language compared to
       Ada, C/C++ and Java. Its major features include: user defined
       statements and operators, abstract data types, templates without
       special syntax, OO with interfaces and multiple dispatch, statically
       typed, interpreted or compiled, and portability. The documentation of
       Seed7 and many examples can be found in /usr/share/doc/seed7

OPTIONS
       -?     Write Seed7 interpreter usage.
       -a     Analyze only and suppress the execution phase.
       -dx    Set compile time trace level to x. E.g.: -de
       -d     Equivalent to -da
       -i     Show the identifier table after the analyzing phase.
       -l     Add a directory to the include library search path (e.g.: -l
              ../lib ).
       -p     Specify a protocol file, for trace output (e.g.: -p prot.txt ).
       -q     Compile quiet. Line and file information and compilation
              statistics are suppressed.
       -s     Deactivate signal handlers.
       -tx    Set runtime trace level to x. E.g.: -te
       -t     Equivalent to -ta
       -vn    Set verbosity level of analyse phase to n. Where n is between 0
              and 3.
       -v     Equivalent to -v2
       -x     Execute even if the program contains errors.

TRACE LEVEL
       The options -d and -t can set the trace level.  The following trace
       levels are defined:
       a      Trace primitive actions
       c      Do action check
       d      Trace dynamic calls
       e      Trace exceptions and handlers
       h      Trace heap size (in combination with 'a')
       s      Trace signals

VERBOSITY LEVEL
       The option -v can set the verbosity level.  The following verbosity
       levels are defined:
       0      Compile quiet (equivalent to -q )
       1      Write just the header with version information (default)
       2      Write a list of include libraries
       3      Write line numbers, while analyzing
