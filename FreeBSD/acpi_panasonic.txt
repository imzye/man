ACPI_PANASONIC(4)      FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual      ACPI_PANASONIC(4)

NAME
     acpi_panasonic – ACPI hotkey driver for Panasonic laptops

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device acpi_panasonic

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           acpi_panasonic_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The acpi_panasonic driver enables such hotkey facilities of various
     Panasonic laptops as changing LCD brightness, controlling mixer volumes,
     entering sleep or suspended state and so on.  On the following models it
     is reported to work: Let's note (or Toughbook, outside Japan) CF-R1N, CF-
     R2A and CF-R3.  It may also work on other models as well.

     The driver consists of three functionalities.  The first is to detect
     hotkey events and take corresponding actions, which include changing LCD
     luminance and speaker mute state.  The second role is to notify
     occurrences of the event by way of devctl(4) and eventually to devd(8).
     The third and last is to provide a way to adjust LCD brightness and sound
     mute state via sysctl(8).

   Hotkeys
     There are 9 hotkeys available on the supported hardware:

           Fn+F1       Make LCD backlight darker.
           Fn+F2       Make LCD backlight brighter.
           Fn+F3       Switch video output between LCD and CRT.  Not supported
                       by the acpi_panasonic driver.
           Fn+F4       Toggle muting the speaker.
           Fn+F5       Turn the mixer volume down.
           Fn+F6       Turn the mixer volume up.
           Fn+F7       Enter suspend-to-RAM state.
           Fn+F9       Show battery status.
           Fn+F10      Enter suspend-to-disk state.

     Actions are automatically taken within the driver for Fn+F1, Fn+F2 and
     Fn+F4.  For the other events such as mixer control and showing battery
     status, devd(8) should take the role as described below.

   devd(8) Events
     When notified to devd(8), the hotkey event provides the following
     information:

           system      "ACPI"
           subsystem   "Panasonic"
           type        The source of the event in ACPI namespace.  The value
                       depends on the model but typically "\_SB_.HKEY".
           notify      Event code (see below).

     Event codes to be generated are assigned as follows:

           0x81-0x86, 0x89
                       Fn+F<n> pressed.  0x81 corresponds to Fn+F1, 0x82
                       corresponds to Fn+F2, and so on.

           0x01-0x07, 0x09, 0x1a
                       Fn+F<n> released.  0x01 corresponds to Fn+F1, 0x02
                       corresponds to Fn+F2, and so on.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following MIBs are available:

     hw.acpi.panasonic.lcd_brightness_max
             The maximum level of brightness.  This read-only value is
             automatically set according to hardware model.

     hw.acpi.panasonic.lcd_brightness_min
             The minimum level of brightness.  This read-only value is
             automatically set according to hardware model.

     hw.acpi.panasonic.lcd_brightness
             Current brightness level of the LCD (read-write).  The value
             ranges from hw.acpi.panasonic.lcd_brightness_min to
             hw.acpi.panasonic.lcd_brightness_max.

     hw.acpi.panasonic.sound_mute
             A read-write boolean flag to control whether to mute the speaker.
             The value 1 means to mute and 0 not.
