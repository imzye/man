JACK-SMF-PLAYER(1)                                          JACK-SMF-PLAYER(1)



NAME
       jack-smf-player - Standard MIDI File player for JACK MIDI

SYNOPSIS
       jack-smf-player [ -a input port ] [ -d ] [ -n ] [ -q ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [
       -V ] [ -r rate ] [ file name ]


OPTIONS
       -a input port
              Automatically connect to the named input port.  Note that this
              may cause problems with LASH.

       -d     When throttling, drop messages instead of delaying them.

       -n     Don't start JACK transport at startup.

       -q     Be quiet, don't print messages about SMF metaevents etc.

       -s     By default, jack-smf-player creates one output port, "midi_out",
              through which MIDI messages from all tracks are sent with their
              original MIDI channel number unchanged, and then one port per
              track, through which only MIDI messages from that particular
              track are sent with their MIDI channel reset to 0.  That may
              cause problems with large number of tracks, as the number of
              JACK ports is a limited resource.  Passing the "-s" option
              causes jack-smf-player to not create per-channel output ports.
              This option does not change behaviour of the "midi_out" port.

       -t     Do not use JACK transport.  That means that playback will not
              start when the transport starts, will not seek when transport is
              relocated etc.  Also, this flag will make jack-smf-player exit
              after the end of the song.

       -V     Print version number to standard output and exit.

       -r rate
              Set output rate limit to rate, in Kbaud.  Limit defined by the
              MIDI specification is 31.25.  By default this parameter is zero,
              that is, rate limiting is disabled.

DESCRIPTION
       jack-smf-player is a tool to play SMF (Standard MIDI Format) files
       through JACK MIDI.  At startup, it will load file which name is passed
       as a parameter, and, unless the "-n" option is given, rewind JACK
       transport to position zero and start playing.  You can pause, play and
       seek using JACK transport, for example by using buttons under the
       display in qjackctl.
