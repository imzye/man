PreSuf(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation            PreSuf(3)


NAME
       Regex::PreSuf - create regular expressions from word lists

SYNOPSIS
               use Regex::PreSuf;

               my $re = presuf(qw(foobar fooxar foozap));

               # $re should be now 'foo(?:zap|[bx]ar)'

DESCRIPTION
       The presuf() subroutine builds regular expressions out of 'word lists',
       lists of strings.  The regular expression matches the same words as the
       word list.  These regular expressions normally run faster than a
       simple-minded '|'-concatenation of the words.

       Examples:

       •


                   'foobar fooxar' => 'foo[bx]ar'

       •


                   'foobar foozap' => 'foo(?:bar|zap)'

       •


                   'foobar fooar'  => 'foob?ar'

       The downsides:

       •   The original order of the words is not necessarily respected, for
           example because the character class matches are collected together,
           separate from the '|' alternations.

       •   The module blithely ignores any specialness of any regular
           expression metacharacters such as the ".*?+{}[]^$", they are just
           plain ordinary boring characters.

       For the second downside there is an exception.  The module has some
       rudimentary grasp of how to use the 'any character' metacharacter.  If
       you call presuf() like this:

               my $re = presuf({ anychar=>1 }, qw(foobar foo.ar fooxar));

               # $re should be now 'foo.ar'

       The module finds out the common prefixes and suffixes of the words and
       then recursively looks at the remaining differences.  However, by
       default only common prefixes are used because for many languages
       (natural or artificial) this seems to produce the fastest matchers.  To
       allow also for suffixes use

               my $re = presuf({ suffixes=>1 }, ...);

       To use only suffixes use

               my $re = presuf({ prefixes=>0 }, ...);

       (this implicitly enables suffixes)

   Debugging
       In case you want to flood your session without debug messages you can
       turn on debugging by saying

               Regex::PreSuf::debug(1);

       How to turn them off again is left as an exercise for the kind reader.
