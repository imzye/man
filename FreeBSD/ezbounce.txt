NAME
       ezbounce - A highly configurable Internet Relay Chat (IRC) proxy

SYNOPSIS
       ezbounce [options] configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ezbounce command.  This manual
       page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the
       original program does not have a manual page.  ezbounce is a very
       configurable IRC proxy or 'bouncer'.  Its basic features include
       password protection, remote administration, logging and listening on
       multiple ports.  It lets you configure hosts to give access to and
       which addresses and ports they may connect to.  It also can be setup to
       ban connections to and from certain addresses.
