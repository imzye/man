DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents DOSBox Staging, a modern
       continuation of DOSBox.

       If PATH is a directory, it's mounted as C:.
       If PATH is a bootable disk image (.IMA/.IMG), it's booted.
       If PATH is a CD-ROM disc image (.CUE/.ISO), it's mounted as D:.
       If PATH is a DOS executable (.BAT/.COM/.EXE), it's parent path is
       mounted as C: and the executable is run. When the executable exits,
       DOSBox Staging quits.

       For an introduction, type INTRO inside DOSBox Staging.

       The document will refer to DOSBox Staging as dosbox from now on for
       readability.


OPTIONS
       Legacy single dash abbrevations still work for backwards compatibility.

       --conf <config_file>     Start with the options specified in
       <config_file>.
                                Multiple configuration files can be specified.
                                Example: --conf conf1.conf --conf conf2.conf

       --printconf              Print the location of the primary
       configuration file.

       --editconf               Open the primary configuration file in a text
       editor.

       --eraseconf              Delete the primary configuration file.

       --noprimaryconf          Don't load or create the primary configuration
       file.

       --nolocalconf            Don't load the local 'dosbox.conf'
       configuration file
                                if present in the current working directory.

       --set <setting>=<value>  Set a configuration setting. Multiple
       configuration
                                settings can be specified. Example:
                                --set mididevice=fluidsynth --set
       soundfont=mysoundfont.sf2

       --working-dir <path>     Set working directory to <path>. DOSBox will
       act as if
                                started from this directory.

       --list-countries         List all supported countries with their
       numeric codes.
                                Codes are to be used in the 'country' config
       setting.

       --list-glshaders         List all available OpenGL shaders and their
       paths.
                                Shaders are to be used in the 'glshader'
       config setting.

       --fullscreen             Start in fullscreen mode.

       --lang <lang_file>       Start with the language specified in
       <lang_file>.

       --machine <type>         Emulate a specific type of machine. The
       machine type has
                                influence on both the emulated video and sound
       cards.
                                Valid choices are: hercules, cga, cga_mono,
       tandy,
                                pcjr, ega, svga_s3 (default), svga_et3000,

       the PATH.
                                Multiple commands can be specified.

       --noautoexec             Don't run DOS commands from any [autoexec]
       sections.

       --exit                   Exit after running '-c <command>'s and
       [autoexec] sections.

       --startmapper            Run the mapper GUI.

       --erasemapper            Delete the default mapper file.

       --securemode             Enable secure mode by disabling the MOUNT and
       IMGMOUNT
                                commands.

       --socket <num>           Run nullmodem on the specified socket number.

       --help                   Print help message and exit.

       --version                Print version information and exit.


INTERNAL COMMANDS
       dosbox has a comprehensive internal help system which can be accessed
       by running HELP command.

       dosbox supports most of the DOS commands found in COMMAND.COM. In
       addition, the following extra commands are frequently used:

       MOUNT

       Program to mount local directories as drives inside dosbox.

       IMGMOUNT

       A utility to mount disk images and CD‐ROM images in dosbox.

       CONFIG

       Change dosbox internal configuration on the fly. May not work with all
       options.

       LOADFIX

       Program to reduce the amount of  memory available. Useful for old
       programs which don't expect much memory to be free.

       RESCAN

       Make dosbox reread the directory structure. Useful if you changed
       something on a mounted drive outside dosbox. Ctrl+F4 does this as well.

       BOOT

       BOOT will start floppy images or hard disk images independent of the
       operating system emulation offered by dosbox. This will allow you to
       play booter floppies or boot to other operating systems inside dosbox.


FILES
       Configuration and language files use a format similar to Windows .ini
       files.  If no configfile is specified at the commandline, a file named
       dosbox-staging.conf (if present in the current directory) will be
       loaded automatically. We also will read and load dosbox.conf locally
       too, if dosbox-staging.conf isn't present.

       If a configfile is specified at the commandline that one will be used
       instead. If no configfile is specified or found in the current
       directory  then dosbox will load one from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dosbox/
       (which defaults to ~/.config/dosbox/). It will try to create a new
       default config file if it does not exist yet.


SPECIAL KEYS
       Alt+Enter
              Switch between fullscreen and window mode.

       Alt+Pause
              Pause/Unpause emulator.

       Ctrl+F1
              Start the keymapper.

       Ctrl+F4
              Swap mounted disk‐image (only used with imgmount). Update
              directory cache for all drives.

       Ctrl+F5
              Save a screenshot of the DOS pre-rendered image.

       Alt+F5 Save a screenshot of the rendered image.

       Ctrl+F6
              Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.

       Ctrl+F7
              Start/Stop recording video output to a zmbv file.

       Ctrl+F8
              Mute/Unmute the audio.

       Ctrl+F9
              Kill dosbox.

       Ctrl+F10
              Capture/Release the mouse.

       Ctrl+F11
              Slow down emulation (Decrease number of cycles/s).

       Ctrl+F12
              Speed up emulation (Increase number of cycles/s).

       Alt+F12
              Unlock speed (turbo button).

       These are the default keybindings. They can be changed in the
       keymapper. More bindable actions can be found in the keymapper.

NOTES
       Saved/recorded files can be found in current_directory/capture (can be
       changed in the configfile).  The directory has to exist prior to
       starting dosbox else nothing gets saved/recorded!

       Once you increase your dosbox cycles beyond your computer's maximum
       capacity, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the
       emulation.  This maximum will vary from computer to computer, there is
       no standard.


ENVIRONMENT
       Any configuration option can be override using an environment variable.
       Environment variables starting with prefix DOSBOX are processed and
       interpreted as follows: DOSBOX_SECTIONNAME_PROPERTYNAME=value

       For example, you can override Sound Blaster type to Sound Blaster Pro 2
       this way:

       $ DOSBOX_SBLASTER_SBTYPE=sbpro2 dosbox
