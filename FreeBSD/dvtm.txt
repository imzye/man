NAME
       dvtm - dynamic virtual terminal manager

SYNOPSIS
       dvtm [-v] [-M] [-m modifier] [-d delay] [-h lines] [-t title] [-s
       status-fifo] [-c cmd-fifo] [command ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dvtm is a dynamic tiling window manager for the console.  As a console
       window manager it tries to make it easy to work with multiple console
       based applications.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print version information to standard output and exit.

       -M     Toggle default mouse grabbing upon startup. Use this to allow
              normal mouse operation under X.

       -m_modifier
              Set command modifier at runtime.

       -d_delay
              Set the delay ncurses waits before deciding if a character that
              might be part of an escape sequence is actually part of an
              escape sequence.

       -h_lines
              Set the scrollback history buffer size at runtime.

       -t_title
              Set a static terminal title and don't change it to the one of
              the currently focused window.

       -s_status-fifo
              Open or create the named pipe status-fifo read its content and
              display it in the statusbar. See the dvtm-status script for an
              usage example.

       -c_cmd-fifo
              Open or create the named pipe cmd-fifo and look for commands to
              execute which were defined in config.h.

       command ...
              Execute command(s), each in a separate window.

   Mouse commands
       Copy and Paste
              By default dvtm captures mouse events to provide the actions
              listed below.  Unfortunately this interferes with the standard X
              copy and paste mechanism.  To work around this you need to hold
              down Shift while selecting or pasting text.  Alternatively you
              can disable mouse support at compile time, start dvtm with the
              -M flag or toggle mouse support during runtime with Mod-M.

       Button1 click
              Focus window.

       Button1 double click
              Focus window and toggle maximization.

       Button2 click
              Zoom/cycle current window to/from master area.

       Button3 click
              Toggle minimization of current window.

   Copy mode
       Copy mode gives easy access to past output by piping it to an editor.
       What ever the editor prints to stdout upon exiting will be stored in an
       internal register and can be pasted into other clients (via Mod-p )

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DVTM   Each process spawned by dvtm will have this variable set to the
              dvtm version it is running under.

       DVTM_WINDOW_ID
              Each process also has access to its constant and unique window
              id.

       DVTM_CMD_FIFO
              If the -c command line argument was specified upon dvtm startup,
              this variable will be set to the file name of the named pipe.
              Thus allowing the process to send commands back to dvtm.

       DVTM_TERM
              By default dvtm uses its own terminfo file and therefore sets
              TERM=dvtm within the client windows. This can be overridden by
              setting the DVTM_TERM environment variable to a valid terminal
              name before launching dvtm.

       DVTM_EDITOR
              When entering the copymode dvtm pipes the whole scroll back
              buffer to DVTM_EDITOR which is launched with - (indicating to
              read from stdin) as its only argument.  If DVTM_EDITOR is not
              set EDITOR is checked, if this is also not set the default value
              specified in config.h is used instead.

EXAMPLE
       See the dvtm-status script as an example of how to display text in the
       status bar.

CUSTOMIZATION
       dvtm is customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
       source code.  This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
