GSS_WRAP_SIZE_LIMIT(3)                  FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_wrap_size_limit – Determine maximum message sizes

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_wrap_size_limit(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle, int conf_req_flag,
         gss_qop_t qop_req, OM_uint32 req_output_size,
         OM_uint32 *max_input_size);

DESCRIPTION
     Allows an application to determine the maximum message size that, if
     presented to gss_wrap(3) with the same conf_req_flag and qop_req
     parameters, will result in an output token containing no more than
     req_output_size bytes.

     This call is intended for use by applications that communicate over
     protocols that impose a maximum message size.  It enables the application
     to fragment messages prior to applying protection.

     GSS-API implementations are recommended but not required to detect
     invalid QOP values when gss_wrap_size_limit() is called.  This routine
     guarantees only a maximum message size, not the availability of specific
     QOP values for message protection.

     Successful completion of this call does not guarantee that gss_wrap(3)
     will be able to protect a message of length max_input_size bytes, since
     this ability may depend on the availability of system resources at the
     time that gss_wrap(3) is called.  However, if the implementation itself
     imposes an upper limit on the length of messages that may be processed by
     gss_wrap, the implementation should not return a value via
     max_input_bytes that is greater than this length.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status         Mechanism specific status code.

     context_handle       A handle that refers to the security over which the
                          messages will be sent.

     conf_req_flag        Indicates whether gss_wrap(3) will be asked to apply
                          confidentiality protection in addition to integrity
                          protection.

     qop_req              Indicates the level of protection that gss_wrap(3)
                          will be asked to provide.

     req_output_size      The desired maximum size for tokens emitted by
                          gss_wrap(3).

     max_input_size       The maximum input message size that may be presented
                          to gss_wrap(3) in order to guarantee that the
                          emitted token shall be no larger than
                          req_output_size bytes.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE             Successful completion.

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT           The referenced context could not be accessed.

     GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED      The context has expired.

     GSS_S_BAD_QOP              The specified QOP is not supported by the
                                mechanism.
