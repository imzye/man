miau Manual
       This is edition 0.6.1 of the `miau Manual', last updated 7 January
       2006.

       1 What is an irc-bouncer?

       A bouncer doesn't do anything else than diverting a network-connection.

       In case of an irc-bouncer, connections from your irc-program (client)
       are diverted by the bouncer to a irc-server.

       "What is this good for?", you might ask.

       Well, let's assume you've got a dialup-connection.  If somebody
       performs a `/WHOIS' on you it shows something like "yournick is
       yournick!yourident@dialup66-r-v.isp.at".

       If you are vain you don't want people to see this stupid hostname.  So
       you get a account on a machine with a cool hostname (from now on
       refered as middleman), get miau running there and a /whois on you will
       show middleman's hostname, since the connection to the irc-server is
       actually originating from middleman.

       Another advantage is that network-attacks aren't really destinating to
       YOUR computer but to middleman, which is in theory a machine that can't
       be brought down.

       2 What makes miau special over other bouncers?
       **********************************************

       miau is very straight and simple to set up and the probably most
       important and interesting feature is that miau keeps the middleman ->
       irc-server connection up even after you disconnect with your client.

       This means miau prevents people from using your nick (this is
       especially handy on nets like IRCNet, since there are no services like
       on dalnet etc) and tells people who message you that you're not here
       and logs what these people said.

       Upon your next connect to miau, it will let the channels you've been in
       in your last session pop up, which means that you'll keep your status
       in these channels.

       Besides that miau's got a sophisticated flood-protection making it
       (almost) impossible to disconnect miau.

       3 Copyright ***********

       miau has been written by Tommi Saviranta <wnd@iki.fi>.  miau branched
       from muh, see http://mind.riot.org/muh/.  miau is licensed under the
       GPL. See COPYING for details.

       4 Command Line Options

       `-f' Stay in foreground (don't fork)

       `-d directory' Specifies a different directory than the default for
       miaurc, messages and log

       `-c' You will be prompted for a word to crypt. The output can be used
       as `password' in miaurc if you don't wanna have the password stored in
       clear text.  Note that you'll still have to authorize with the
       unencrypted password.

       This option might not be compiled in.

       5 miau Commands

       miau accepts following commands to be issued by the client via `/MIAU
       <command>'.

       Note that some IRC-clients might require a prefix such as `/QUOTE' or
       `/RAW' to send commands they don't know about.

       `HELP' Display supported commands

       `READ' Read received messages

       `DEL' Delete all messages

       `PRINT' Prints miau's server-list. Servers prefixed with '+' work,
       those with '-' don't.

       `JUMP [servernumber]' Jump to next server in serverlist. If
       `servernumber' (see `PRINT') is specified, miau will jump to this
       server (even if marked as not working).

       `REHASH' Reread config-file. Note that this can also be performed by
       sending a `SIGHUP' to miau (see `kill(1)'). If `realname' or `username'
       have been changed miau will reconnect to it's current server.

       `DIE [reason]' Terminate miau. A quit reason can be given after
       command.

       `UPTIME' Prints uptime of miau.

       This command might not be compiled in.

       `PINGSTAT' Prints ping statistics.

       This command might not be compiled in.

       `DUMP' Prints some of miau's internal variables. Used for debugging.

       This command might not be compiled in.

       6 Installation

       Create a `.miau/'-directory in your homedir and copy `miaurc' there (it
       will probably reside in `/usr/share/miau', depending on your
       os/distribution).

       Edit `miaurc', _make sure noone except you has read-access_ and launch
       miau.

       To make sure miau's running all day there is a script called `miau-
       check' that came with miau. Edit it as well and make `crontab(5)' call
       it periodically.

       7 miaurc Commands

       There are numerous commands with which you can extensively customize
       miau's behaviour. The must be placed in the `miaurc' that miau reads on
       startup, it is usually `$HOME/.miau/miaurc'.

       8 Required settings *******************

       `nicknames = { "nick" }' Your nickname (and secondary nicknames) on
       IRC. If the primary nick (first nick on the list) is already on use,
       miau will try the others on the list.

       `realname = "realname"' Your "real" name (which will be shown by
       `/WHOIS'-command) on IRC.

       `username = "username"' Your ident (matters only if you don't have
       `identd' running).

       `password = "password"' The password miau will expect to receive from
       client when it's registering with nick. If this is 13 characters long,
       miau assumed it's crypted. miau can generate password-hashes with `-c'
       -switch, if it is compiled with that feature.

       `listenport = "port"' The port miau will wait for incoming connections.
       This is the port you connect your IRC-client to.

       `servers = { "server":"port":"password":"timeout" }' miau's
       IRC-server-list. Each line represents one server, where timeout is
       delay in seconds before connectiong attempt times out.  Only `server'
       parameter is required.

       `connhosts = { "host":"permitted" }' List of hosts that are allowed (or
       denied) to connect to miau. When `permitted' is left unset, it is
       assumed to be `true'. This list will be processed as a chain which
       means latter rules can override previous ones.

       Note: You can define "your" hostname with `@@'. Only the _last_
       occurance of `@@' will be translated.

       9 Optional settings *******************

       `statelog = "state"' Should miau write state log to `$MIAUDIR/log'?
       When true, log will be written in this file. If set to false, the same
       stuff is printed on `stdout' (on terminal).

       `listenhost = "host"' Host miau uses to listen on.  If you are compiled
       with IPV6 and need this to listen on an IPV4 port, you must use an IP
       in the form `::FFFF:127.0.0.1'.

       `floodtimer = "number"' Time it takes to send one message. When
       configuring flood-protection, this variable defined how fast you can
       send messages; how many seconds sending one message takes. See also
       `burstsize'.

       `burstsize = "number"' How many messages can be sent at once. When
       configuring flood-protection, this variable defined how many messages
       can be sent at once (in a burst). See also `floodtimer'.

       `jointries = "number"' Number of tries to join channel after dropping
       from server etc.  miau tries to join channels once a minute.

       `bind = "host"' Host/IP miau uses for outgoing connections.

       `maxclients = "number"' Maximum number of clients connected to miau
       concurrently. Set to zero for unlimited clients.

       `stonedtimeout = "seconds"' Time (in seconds) with no data from the
       server before it is declared stoned and being disconnected. Although
       minimum value is 30, this value has no upper limit. Watch out, though,
       if this value is set too high, death of servers may stay undetected for
       a very long time if you are idle.

       `connecttimeout = "seconds"' Time (in seconds) before connection
       attampt will time out. Note that while connecting to the server miau
       will not respond to clients. Minimum value is 5, and many systems
       define maximum value.

       `channels = { "channel":"keyword" }' List of channels to join.

       `rejoin = "state"' Rejoin channels after disconnecting from the server.
       If `rejoin' is set to `true', channels defined in `channels'" are also
       joined when client first time connects to miau.

       `leave = "state"' Leave channels when all clients have detached from
       miau.  If `leave' is set to `false' and `rejoin' is set to `true',
       channels defined at `channels' will be joined at miau startup.  If both
       `leave' and `rejoin' is set to `true', channels that are left at client
       detach, are rejoined when client attached back to miau.

       `leavemsg = "message"' Message miau will either use as PART-message or
       as ACTION when all clients have detached from miau. If unset or set to
       empty, no message will be shown. Note that many people dislike event-
       based messages (which happens when `leave' is set to `false' and
       `leavemsg' is set). Note that commenting this option out and rehashing
       after `leavemsg' was set, this option is _not_ reverted.  To disable
       `leavemsg' afterwards you need to write an empty string here and
       rehash. Also see `usequitmsg'.

       `awaymsg = "message"' Text that will be set to miau's away-reason when
       all clients have detached from miau. If unset or set to empty, AWAY-
       status will be left untouched. When any client attaches back to miau,
       AWAY-status will be reset. Note that is user sets him/herself away,
       miau will _not_ touch away-status nor message neither when connecting
       to or disconnected from miau. Also note that commenting this option out
       and rehashing after `awaymsg' was set, this option is _not_ reverted.
       To disable `awaymsg' afterwards you need to write an empty string here
       and rehash. Also see `usequitmsg'.

       `usequitmsg = "state"' Use last quit-reason as away-reason and/or
       leave-message (if respective options are enabled) when all clients have
       disconnected from miau. If quit-reason was empty, default values of
       awaymsg and leavemsg will be used, otherwise most recent quit-message
       overrides values in miaurc.

       `autoaway = "mode"' miau can set user away automatically. This option
       allows to define when to do that: `never' Never set user away
       automatically

       `detach' Set user away when any of the clients disconnects

       `noclients' Set user away when the last client disconnects If
       `usequitmsg' is set, quit message will be used as a reason.  If not,
       `awaymsg' will be used.

       `chandiscon = "mode"' When miau is disconnected from the server e.g.
       because of network problem, miau can notify user about this in a couple
       of ways.  `nothing' Only print server notice

       `notice' Send notice to each channel

       `part' Part each channel. mIRC users probably don't want to use this.

       `privmsg' Only send a private message to the user

       `getnick = "selection"' miau can try to reclaim your primary nick when
       it is lost. This option may be one of the following: `never' miau will
       not try to get your nick back

       `detached' miau will try to get your nick when no clients are attached

       `attached' miau will try to get your nick when there are one or more
       clients       attached

       `always' miau will try to get your nick Note: do _not_ use options
       `attached' and `always' with clients (like irc-II EPIC) that
       automatically change your nick when they receive `ERR_NICKINUSE' from
       the server - you might end up chaning your nick until server drops your
       connection due excess (nick) flood.

       `getnickinterval = "seconds"' Time between tries (in seconds) to obtain
       currently (possibly) lost primary nick. Don't set it too low or you
       might get kicked out the server due to excess flood.

       `antiidle = "minutes"' Time between idle-timer resets in minutes. Set
       to 0 to disable.

       `qloglength = "minutes"' Age of oldest entry in quicklog in minutes.
       Set to zero to disable quicklog.

       Note: private messages get also logged into quicklog, but if `inbox' is
       enabled, they are moved to messagelog instead of simply dropping of
       from quicklog.

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `timestamp = "mode"' Location of timestamp in quicklog.

       Available modes: `none' No timestamp

       `beginning' Timestamp in beginning of line

       `end' Timestamp at end of line

       This options might not be compiled in.

       `flushqlog = "state"' If set to `true', quicklog will be written only
       when no clients are connected and quicklog will be erased when client
       connects to miau. If you are running a single client, you probably want
       to leave this to `false'.

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `inbox = "state"' Enables logging private messages when no clients are
       connected to miau.

       Note: if quicklog is enabled (see `qloglength'), private messages are
       first stored in quicklog and moved to messagelog when they become too
       old to be stored in quicklog.

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `nevergiveup = "state"' If set to `true', miau will reset
       "working"-status of servers to working when all are set to
       dysfunctional.  Respectively, if set to `false', miau will quit when
       all servers on the list have been set to dysfunctional.

       `norestricted = "state"' If set to `true', miau will not stay on server
       that forces user to have restricted-status (+r).

       `reconnectdelay = "seconds"' Time (in seconds) between connection
       attempts.  Minumun value is set to 1.

       `nickfillchar = "fill character"' Character used to modify your primary
       nick when all defined nicks are already occupied. Note character is a
       single octet (byte) and if longer string is fed, only the first
       character is used.

       `maxnicklen = "length"' Maximum nick length, used with `nickfillchar'.

       `usermode = "usermode(s)"' Usermode that miau will request (if no
       clients are attached at the moment) from the server when connection to
       the server is established. Leave unset or set to empty to disable this
       feature.

       `forwardmsg = "command"' miau can collect the (private) messages within
       specified time (see `forwardtime') and pipe them into the program
       specified. Leave this unset or set to empty to disable this feature.

       `forwardtime = "seconds"' Time in seconds after first inserted line
       into forwardmsg queue before piping the stuff out. Default is 180
       seconds (or three mintues).

       `ignore = { "mask":"ignored" }' List of users whose private messages
       (PRIVMSG) and noticies (NOTICE) are ignored when no clients are
       attached to miau. When `ignored' is left undefined, it is assumed to be
       `true'. Setting `ignored' to `false' means that this user will _not_ be
       ignored.  This list is processed as a chain.

       Note: You can define "your" hostname with @@. Only the _last_ occurance
       of @@ will be translated.

       `privlog = "mode"' Whatever private messages should be logged in nick-
       specific files.  Can be one of following: `never' never write private
       message logs

       `detached' write private message logs only when there are no clients
       connected

       `attached' write private logs only when there are clients connected

       `always' always write private message logs

       All logfiles are written into miau's log directory (`logs').

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `chanlog = { "channel(s)":"options":"logfile" }' List of channel
       logfiles.

       When channel is set to `*', line represents global log. When logging,
       if channel doesn't have entry of it's own in this list, it will use
       settings of global log and write log to it's own file.  When defining
       global log, `logfile' is ignored. Each line can have multiple channels
       (like `#foobar,#miau').

       If logfile is left undefined, logfile will be named after the channel
       with possible suffix (see `logsuffix'). All filenames are relative and
       are, by default, written in miau's log directory (`logs').

       Options consist of abritary set of following possibilities: `j' log
       joins

       `e' log parts (exits)

       `q' log quits

       `m' log messages (privmsg/notice)

       `c' log mode changes

       `n' log nick changes

       `o' log misc events (other)

       `b' log messages from miau (bouncer)

       `a' log all of above

       `A' log when a client is attached

       `D' log when a client is detached

       `C' log continuously (status of clients doesn't matter)

       Note that all channelless messages (such as QUIT) are logged on every
       active channel. This is a feature, not a bug.

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `logsuffix = "suffix"' When writing log to undefined logfile, each
       logfile consists of channel name followed by suffix. Suffix can be
       defined here.

       `onconnect = { "mode":"target/data"(:"data") }' When miau connects and
       registers user to server, miau can send pre-defined messages. User can
       define miau to send normal messages (`PRIVMSG'), notices (`NOTICE') or
       arbitrary messages.

       Mode can be one of the following: `p' private message (`PRIVMSG').

       `n' notice (`NOTICE'). Should be used with services and automatons,
       but unfortunately some network services can't cope with notices.

       `r' "raw" message. This means user must provide complete message to
       send to    the server. Using raw message user has complete control over
       what is  being sent. If you don't know what this is, you don't need
       this.  When      using modes "`p'" or "`n'", user must provide both
       message and target where as with raw messages only one parameter in
       addition to type should be given.

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `automodes = { "mask":"privilegded" }' List of people who are
       automatically given certain privilege on channel. Mask is given in form
       of `mode:nick!username@host/#channel' (where `mode' is a single
       character) and list is processed as a chain.

       Note: You can define "your" hostname with @@. Only the _last_ occurance
       of @@ will be translated.

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `automodedelay = "seconds"' Time (in seconds) after first queued mode
       change would take effect. During this period of time miau can collect
       more than one mode change and commit up to three at a time. Other
       situation reasonaly big value (like 30) here could prove useful is
       channel where there are stupid "auto-oping" bots. (Stupid bots do mode
       changes even if someone else did that already.)

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `cmdpasswd = "password"' Password for remote commands. If this is 13
       characters long, miau assumes it's crypted. Comment this out or leave
       it empty to disable remote commands. When sending miau a remote
       command, password _always_ begins with column (':') (if `cmdpasswd' is
       set to "foobar" (or hash of it), you need to send miau a message
       beginning with `:foobar' to issue a remote command).  miau can generate
       password-hashes with `-c' -switch, if it is compiled with that feature.

       This feature might not be compiled in.

       `dccbounce = "state"' miau can bounce DCCs. Set to true to enable
       bouncing.  You probably don't need this.

       This option might not be compiled in.

       `dccbindhost = "host"' If miau has separate IPs for IRC-network and
       clients, you should enter IP for clients here.

       This option might not be compiled in.
