DESCRIPTION
       FET-CL software is a free software implementation of a heuristic
       algorithm to automatically schedule the timetable of an educational
       institution (school, high-school or university). This program runs on
       command line, without using the X server.

       Running simply fet-cl will show usage.

       Running fet-cl --inputfile=filename.fet [options] will start generation
       on the desired input file.

       Running fet-cl --version [--outputdir=d] will show the program version
       and will also print this version in the output directory (which is by
       default the current directory).
