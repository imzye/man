IO::Handle::Iterator(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       IO::Handle::Iterator - Iterator based read handle

SYNOPSIS
           IO::Handle::Iterator->new(sub {
               return $next_line; # or undef on eof
           });

DESCRIPTION
       This class lets you define a read handle with a few fallback methods
       (like "read") using a single callback that behaves like "getline".

       This is similar but much simpler than:

           IO::Handle::Prototype::Fallback->new(
               __read => sub { ... },
           );

       The reason being that the IO::Handle::Prototype::Fallback
       implementation will try its very best to behave correctly (i.e. respect
       the value of $/), whereas this implementation assumes it's fine to
       return things that aren't exactly lines from "getline", so the values
       are just passed through.

READ BUFFERING
       When a method that requires buffering is invoked the handle is
       reblessed to a subclass which handles buffering.

       Calling "getline" again on this object will return the value of the
       buffer and return to the normal iterator class.
