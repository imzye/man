                              -height   => $height,
                              -margin   => $margin,
                              -tick     => $tick,
                              -tickfont => $tickfont,
                              -tst      => $tst,
                              -width    => $width,
                              -xmin     => $xmin,
                              -xmax     => $xmax,
                              -ymin     => $ymin,
                              -ymax     => $ymax,
                             );

           #    $height  - height of the window
           #    $width   - width  ......
           #    $xmin    - lowest x value we will display
           #    $xmax    - highest .....
           #    $ymin    - lowest y value .....
           #    $ymax    - highest .....
           #    $margin  - the number of pixels used as a margin around the plot
           #    $tick    - the length (in pixels) of the tickmarks
           #    $tst     - the step size for the tick marks
           #    $tst[x|y]- step size for tick marks on the x (or y) axis
           #                (if not specified tst is used)
           #    $tickfont    - for for the lables

DESCRIPTION
       This is an improved version of the axis widget. Changes with respect to
       the previous version are :

       •   the 'pack' has been moved out the widget. One has to do his own
           packing

       •   it is now possible to work in the coordinates of the axis. The
           following piece of code draws a line between the points (2 , 3.1)
           (4 , 4).

               $t->create('line',$t->plx(2),$t->ply(3.1),$t->plx(4),$t->ply(4));
