NAME
     spl – parameters of the SPL kernel module

DESCRIPTION
     spl_kmem_cache_kmem_threads=4 (uint)
             The number of threads created for the spl_kmem_cache task queue.
             This task queue is responsible for allocating new slabs for use
             by the kmem caches.  For the majority of systems and workloads
             only a small number of threads are required.

     spl_kmem_cache_reclaim=0 (uint)
             When this is set it prevents Linux from being able to rapidly
             reclaim all the memory held by the kmem caches.  This may be
             useful in circumstances where it's preferable that Linux reclaim
             memory from some other subsystem first.  Setting this will
             increase the likelihood out of memory events on a memory
             constrained system.

     spl_kmem_cache_obj_per_slab=8 (uint)
             The preferred number of objects per slab in the cache.  In
             general, a larger value will increase the caches memory footprint
             while decreasing the time required to perform an allocation.
             Conversely, a smaller value will minimize the footprint and
             improve cache reclaim time but individual allocations may take
             longer.

     spl_kmem_cache_max_size=32 (64-bit) or 4 (32-bit) (uint)
             The maximum size of a kmem cache slab in MiB.  This effectively
             limits the maximum cache object size to
             spl_kmem_cache_max_size/spl_kmem_cache_obj_per_slab.

             Caches may not be created with object sized larger than this
             limit.

     spl_kmem_cache_slab_limit=16384 (uint)
             For small objects the Linux slab allocator should be used to make
             the most efficient use of the memory.  However, large objects are
             not supported by the Linux slab and therefore the SPL
             implementation is preferred.  This value is used to determine the
             cutoff between a small and large object.

             Objects of size spl_kmem_cache_slab_limit or smaller will be
             allocated using the Linux slab allocator, large objects use the
             SPL allocator.  A cutoff of 16K was determined to be optimal for
             architectures using 4K pages.

     spl_kmem_alloc_warn=32768 (uint)
             As a general rule kmem_alloc() allocations should be small,
             preferably just a few pages, since they must by physically
             contiguous.  Therefore, a rate limited warning will be printed to
             the console for any kmem_alloc() which exceeds a reasonable
             threshold.

             The default warning threshold is set to eight pages but capped at
             32K to accommodate systems using large pages.  This value was
             selected to be small enough to ensure the largest allocations are
             quickly noticed and fixed.  But large enough to avoid logging any
             warnings when a allocation size is larger than optimal but not a
             serious concern.  Since this value is tunable, developers are
             encouraged to set it lower when testing so any new largish
             allocations are quickly caught.  These warnings may be disabled
             by setting the threshold to zero.

     spl_kmem_alloc_max=KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE/4 (uint)
             Large kmem_alloc() allocations will fail if they exceed
             KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.  Allocations which are marginally smaller than
             this limit may succeed but should still be avoided due to the
             expense of locating a contiguous range of free pages.  Therefore,
             a maximum kmem size with reasonable safely margin of 4x is set.
             kmem_alloc() allocations larger than this maximum will quickly
             fail.  vmem_alloc() allocations less than or equal to this value
             will use kmalloc(), but shift to vmalloc() when exceeding this
             value.

     spl_kmem_cache_magazine_size=0 (uint)
             Cache magazines are an optimization designed to minimize the cost
             of allocating memory.  They do this by keeping a per-cpu cache of
             recently freed objects, which can then be reallocated without
             taking a lock.  This can improve performance on highly contended
             caches.  However, because objects in magazines will prevent
             otherwise empty slabs from being immediately released this may
             not be ideal for low memory machines.

             For this reason, spl_kmem_cache_magazine_size can be used to set
             a maximum magazine size.  When this value is set to 0 the
             magazine size will be automatically determined based on the
             object size.  Otherwise magazines will be limited to 2-256
             objects per magazine (i.e per cpu).  Magazines may never be
             entirely disabled in this implementation.

     spl_hostid=0 (ulong)
             The system hostid, when set this can be used to uniquely identify
             a system.  By default this value is set to zero which indicates
             the hostid is disabled.  It can be explicitly enabled by placing
             a unique non-zero value in /etc/hostid.

     spl_hostid_path=/etc/hostid (charp)
             The expected path to locate the system hostid when specified.
             This value may be overridden for non-standard configurations.

     spl_panic_halt=0 (uint)
             Cause a kernel panic on assertion failures.  When not enabled,
             the thread is halted to facilitate further debugging.

             Set to a non-zero value to enable.

     spl_taskq_kick=0 (uint)
             Kick stuck taskq to spawn threads.  When writing a non-zero value
             to it, it will scan all the taskqs.  If any of them have a
             pending task more than 5 seconds old, it will kick it to spawn
             more threads.  This can be used if you find a rare deadlock
             occurs because one or more taskqs didn't spawn a thread when it
             should.

     spl_taskq_thread_bind=0 (int)
             Bind taskq threads to specific CPUs.  When enabled all taskq
             threads will be distributed evenly across the available CPUs.  By
             default, this behavior is disabled to allow the Linux scheduler
             the maximum flexibility to determine where a thread should run.

     spl_taskq_thread_dynamic=1 (int)
             Allow dynamic taskqs.  When enabled taskqs which set the
             TASKQ_DYNAMIC flag will by default create only a single thread.
             New threads will be created on demand up to a maximum allowed
             number to facilitate the completion of outstanding tasks.
             Threads which are no longer needed will be promptly destroyed.
             By default this behavior is enabled but it can be disabled to aid
             performance analysis or troubleshooting.

     spl_taskq_thread_priority=1 (int)
             Allow newly created taskq threads to set a non-default scheduler
             priority.  When enabled, the priority specified when a taskq is
             created will be applied to all threads created by that taskq.
             When disabled all threads will use the default Linux kernel
             thread priority.  By default, this behavior is enabled.

     spl_taskq_thread_sequential=4 (int)
             The number of items a taskq worker thread must handle without
             interruption before requesting a new worker thread be spawned.
             This is used to control how quickly taskqs ramp up the number of
             threads processing the queue.  Because Linux thread creation and
             destruction are relatively inexpensive a small default value has
             been selected.  This means that normally threads will be created
             aggressively which is desirable.  Increasing this value will
             result in a slower thread creation rate which may be preferable
             for some configurations.

     spl_max_show_tasks=512 (uint)
             The maximum number of tasks per pending list in each taskq shown
             in /proc/spl/taskq{,-all}.  Write 0 to turn off the limit.  The
             proc file will walk the lists with lock held, reading it could
             cause a lock-up if the list grow too large without limiting the
             output.  "(truncated)" will be shown if the list is larger than
             the limit.
