SSH-AUDIT(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           SSH-AUDIT(1)

NAME
       ssh-audit - SSH server & client configuration auditor

SYNOPSIS
       ssh-audit [options] <target_host>

DESCRIPTION
       ssh-audit analyzes the configuration of SSH servers & clients, then
       warns the user of weak, obsolete, and/or untested cryptographic
       primitives.  It is very useful for hardening SSH tunnels, which by
       default tend to be optimized for compatibility, not security.

       See <https://www.ssh-audit.com/> for official hardening guides for
       common platforms.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print short summary of options.


       -1, --ssh1
              Only perform an audit using SSH protocol version 1.


       -2, --ssh2
              Only perform an audit using SSH protocol version 2.


       -4, --ipv4
              Prioritize the usage of IPv4.


       -6, --ipv6
              Prioritize the usage of IPv6.


       -b, --batch
              Enables grepable output.


       -c, --client-audit
              Starts a server on port 2222 to audit client software
              configuration.  Use -p/--port=<port> to change port and
              -t/--timeout=<secs> to change listen timeout.


       --conn-rate-test=N[:max_rate]
              Performs a connection rate test (useful for collecting metrics
              related to susceptibility of the DHEat vulnerability
              [CVE-2002-20001]).  A successful connection is counted when the
              server returns a valid SSH banner.  Testing is conducted with N
              concurrent sockets with an optional maximum rate of connections
              per second.


       -d, --debug
              Enable debug output.


       --dheat=N[:kex[:e_len]]
              Run the DHEat DoS attack (CVE-2002-20001) against the target
              server (which will consume all available CPU resources).  The
              number of concurrent sockets, N, needed to achieve this effect
              will be highly dependent on the CPU resources available on the
              target, as well as the latency between the source and target
              machines.  The key exchange is automatically chosen based on
              which would cause maximum effect, unless explicitly chosen in
              the second field.  Lastly, an (experimental) option allows the
              length in bytes of the fake e value sent to the server to be
              specified in the third field.  Normally, the length of e is
              roughly the length of the modulus of the Diffie-Hellman exchange
              (hence, an 8192-bit / 1024-byte value of e is sent in each
              connection when targeting the diffie-hellman-group18-sha512
              algorithm).  Instead, it was observed that many SSH
              implementations accept small values, such as 4 bytes; this
              results in a much more network-efficient attack.


       -g, --gex-test=<x[,y,...] | min1:pref1:max1[,min2:pref2:max2,...] |
       x-y[:step]>
              Runs a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange modulus size test against a
              server.

              Diffie-Hellman requires the client and server to agree on a
              generator value and a modulus value.  In the "Group Exchange"
              implementation of Diffie-Hellman, the client specifies the size
              of the modulus in bits by providing the server with minimum,
              preferred and maximum values. The server then finds a group that
              best matches the client's request, returning the corresponding
              generator and modulus.  For a full explanation of this process
              see RFC 4419 and its successors.

              This test acts as a client by providing an SSH server with the
              size of a modulus and then obtains the size of the modulus
              returned by the server.

              Three types of syntax are supported:

                1. <x[,y,...]>

                   A comma delimited list of modulus sizes.
                   A test is performed against each value in the list where it
              acts as the minimum, preferred and maximum modulus size.

                2. <min:pref:max[,min:pref:max,...]>

                   A set of three colon delimited values denoting minimum,
              preferred and maximum modulus size.
                   A test is performed against each set.
                   Multiple sets can specified as a comma separated list.

                3. <x-y[:step]>

                   A range of modulus sizes with an optional step value. Step
              defaults to 1 if omitted.
                   If the left value is greater than the right value, then the
              sequence operates from right to left.
                   A test is performed against each value in the range where
              it acts as the minimum, preferred and maximum modulus size.

              Duplicates are excluded from the return value.


       -j, --json
              Output results in JSON format.  Specify twice (-jj) to enable
              indent printing (useful for debugging).


       -l, --level=<info|warn|fail>
              Specify the minimum output level.  Default is info.


       -L, --list-policies
              List all official, built-in policies for common systems.  Their
              full names can then be passed to -P/--policy.  Add -v to -L to
              view policy change logs.


       --lookup=<alg1,alg2,...>
              Look up the security information of an algorithm(s) in the
              internal database.  Does not connect to a server.


       -m, --manual
              Print the man page (Docker, PyPI, Snap, and Windows builds
              only).


       -M, --make-policy=<custom_policy.txt>
              Creates a policy based on the target server.  Useful when other
              servers should be compared to the target server's custom
              configuration (i.e.: a cluster environment).  Note that the
              resulting policy can be edited manually.


       -n, --no-colors
              Disable color output.  Automatically set when the NO_COLOR
              environment variable is set.


       -p, --port=<port>
              The TCP port to connect to when auditing a server, or the port
              to listen on when auditing a client.


       -P, --policy=<"built-in policy name" | path/to/custom_policy.txt>
              Runs a policy audit against a target using the specified policy
              (see POLICY AUDIT section for detailed description of this mode
              of operation).  Combine with -c/--client-audit to audit a client
              configuration instead of a server.  Use -L/--list-policies to
              list all official, built-in policies for common systems.


       --skip-rate-test
              Skips the connection rate test during standard audits.  By
              default, a few dozen TCP connections are created with the target
              host to see if connection throttling is implemented (this can
              safely infer whether the target is vulnerable to the DHEat
              attack; see CVE-2002-20001).


       -t, --timeout=<secs>
              The timeout, in seconds, for creating connections and reading
              data from the socket.  Default is 5.


       -T, --targets=<hosts.txt>
              A file containing a list of target hosts.  Each line must have
              one host, in the format of HOST[:PORT].  Use -p/--port to set
              the default port for all hosts.  Use --threads to control
              concurrent scans.


       --threads=<threads>
              The number of threads to use when scanning multiple targets
              (with -T/--targets).  Default is 32.


       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output.



STANDARD AUDIT
       By default, ssh-audit performs a standard audit.  That is, it
       enumerates all host key types, key exchanges, ciphers, MACs, and other
       information, then color-codes them in output to the user.
       Cryptographic primitives with potential issues are displayed in yellow;
       primitives with serious flaws are displayed in red.



POLICY AUDIT
       When the -P/--policy option is used, ssh-audit performs a policy audit.
       The target's host key types, key exchanges, ciphers, MACs, and other
       information is compared to a set of expected values defined in the
       specified policy file.  If everything matches, only a short message
       stating a passing result is reported.  Otherwise, the field(s) that did
       not match are reported.


       Policy auditing is helpful for ensuring a group of related servers are
       properly hardened to an exact specification.


       The set of official built-in policies can be viewed with -L/--list-
       policies.  Multiple servers can be audited with
       -T/--targets=<servers.txt>.  Custom policies can be made from an ideal
       target server with -M/--make-policy=<custom_policy.txt>.



EXAMPLES
       Basic server auditing:
              ssh-audit localhost
              ssh-audit 127.0.0.1
              ssh-audit 127.0.0.1:222
              ssh-audit ::1
              ssh-audit [::1]:222


       To run a standard audit against many servers (place targets into
       servers.txt, one on each line in the format of HOST[:PORT]):
              ssh-audit -T servers.txt


       To audit a client configuration (listens on port 2222 by default;
       connect using "ssh -p 2222 anything@localhost"):
              ssh-audit -c


       To audit a client configuration, with a listener on port 4567:
              ssh-audit -c -p 4567


       To list all official built-in policies (hint: use their full names with
       -P/--policy):
              ssh-audit -L


       To run a built-in policy audit against a server (hint: use -L to see
       list of built-in policies):
              ssh-audit -P "Hardened Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (version 1)" targetserver



       To run a custom policy audit against a server (hint: use -M/--make-
       policy to create a custom policy file):
              ssh-audit -P path/to/server_policy.txt targetserver


       To run a policy audit against a client:
              ssh-audit -c -P ["policy name" | path/to/client_policy.txt]


       To run a policy audit against many servers:
              ssh-audit -T servers.txt -P ["policy name" | path/to/server_policy.txt]


       To create a policy based on a target server (which can be manually
       edited; see official built-in policies for syntax examples):
              ssh-audit -M new_policy.txt targetserver


       To run a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange modulus size test using the
       values 2000 bits, 3000 bits, 4000 bits and 5000 bits:
              ssh-audit targetserver --gex-test=2000,3000,4000,5000


       To run a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange modulus size test where 2048
       bits is the minimum, 3072 bits is the preferred and 5000 bits is the
       maximum:
              ssh-audit targetserver --gex-test=2048:3072:5000


       To run a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange modulus size test from 0 bits to
       5120 bits in increments of 1024 bits:
              ssh-audit targetserver --gex-test=0-5120:1024


       To run the DHEat DoS attack (monitor the target server's CPU usage to
       determine the optimal number of concurrent sockets):
              ssh-audit targetserver --dheat=10


       To run the DHEat attack and manually target the diffie-hellman-group-
       exchange-sha256 algorithm:
              ssh-audit targetserver --dheat=10:diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256


       To run the DHEat attack and manually target the diffie-hellman-group-
       exchange-sha256 algorithm with a very small length of e (resulting in
       the same effect but without having to send large packets):
              ssh-audit targetserver --dheat=10:diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256:4


       To test the number of successful connections per second that can be
       created with the target using 8 parallel threads (useful for detecting
       whether connection throttling is implemented by the target):
              ssh-audit targetserver --conn-rate-test=8


       To use 8 parallel threads to create up to 100 connections per second
       with the target (useful for understanding how much CPU load is caused
       on the target simply from handling new connections vs excess modular
       exponentiation when performing the DHEat attack):
              ssh-audit targetserver --conn-rate-test=8:100


RETURN VALUES
       When a successful connection is made and all algorithms are rated as
       "good", ssh-audit returns 0.  Other possible return values are:

              1 = connection error
              2 = at least one algorithm warning was found
              3 = at least one algorithm failure was found
              <any other non-zero value> = unknown error
