NAME
     hccontrol – Bluetooth HCI configuration utility

SYNOPSIS
     hccontrol [-hN] [-n HCI_node_name] command [parameters ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The hccontrol utility connects to the specified Netgraph node of type HCI
     or the first one found if none is specified and attempts to send the
     specified command to the HCI Netgraph node or to the associated Bluetooth
     device.  The hccontrol utility will print results to the standard output
     and error messages to the standard error.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Display usage message and exit.

     -N      Show Bluetooth addresses as numbers.  Normally hccontrol attempts
             to resolve Bluetooth addresses, and display them symbolically.

     -n HCI_node_name
             Connect to the specified HCI Netgraph node.

     command
             One of the supported commands (see below).  The special command
             help can be used to obtain the list of all supported commands.
             To get more information about a specific command use help
             command.

     parameters
             One or more optional space separated command parameters.  Many
             commands require a remote device address as one of the
             parameters.  The remote device address can be specified as
             BD_ADDR or a name.  If a name was specified then the hccontrol
             utility will attempt to resolve the name via bt_gethostbyname(3).
