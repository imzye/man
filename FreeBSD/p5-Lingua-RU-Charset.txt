Charset(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation           Charset(3)


NAME
       Lingua::RU::Charset - Perl extension for detecting and converting
       various russian character sets: KOI8-r, Windows-1251, CP866,
       ISO-8859-5, X-Mac-Cyrillic, russian text in english letters, russian
       part of Unicode and UTF-8. This module can be especially useful for
       computers with broken cyrillic locales (like foreign web hosts).

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::RU::Charset qw (:CHARSET);
         use Lingua::RU::Charset qw (:CONVERT);
         use Lingua::RU::Charset qw (:CONVERT :CHARCASE);
         use Lingua::RU::Charset qw (any2koi koi2lc koi2uc);

DESCRIPTION
       More documentation and examples coming soon...

NOTE
       Unfortunately I don't have time to implement the Unicode and UTF-8
       subroutines.  But I am sure that such functions would be useful for
       interesting Perl scripts exchanging russian data with Java servlets. So
       you are welcome to submit some code!
