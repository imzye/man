NAME
     pawd – print automounter working directory

SYNOPSIS
     pawd [path ...]

DESCRIPTION
     This command is obsolete.  Users are advised to use autofs(5) instead.

     The pawd utility is used to print the current working directory, adjusted
     to reflect proper paths that can be reused to go through the automounter
     for the shortest possible path.  In particular, the path printed back
     does not include any of amd(8)'s local mount points.  Using them is
     unsafe, because amd(8) may unmount managed file systems from the mount
     points, and thus including them in paths may not always find the files
     within.

     Without any arguments, pawd will print the automounter adjusted current
     working directory.  With any number of arguments, it will print the
     adjusted path of each one of the arguments.
