PROMETHEUS_SYSCTL_EXPORTER(8)                  FreeBSD System Manager's Manual

NAME
     prometheus_sysctl_exporter – print kernel state as Prometheus metrics

SYNOPSIS
     prometheus_sysctl_exporter [-dgh] [prefix ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Prometheus is a monitoring system that gathers metrics from its targets
     by fetching them through HTTP GET requests.  Metrics are identified by a
     name and an optional set of labels.  Sample values are required to be
     numerical.

     The prometheus_sysctl_exporter utility prints the values of sysctl nodes
     to standard output, formatted such that they can be scraped by Prometheus
     directly.  By default, it prints metrics for all numerically
     representable nodes in the sysctl namespace.  It is also possible to
     limit output to a smaller number of metrics by specifying one or more
     prefixes as arguments.

     Metrics printed by this utility are named ‘sysctl_’, followed by the name
     of the sysctl node having its ‘.’ separators replaced by ‘_’.  Components
     on which it is desirable to aggregate (e.g., names of devices) are
     omitted from the metric's name, but are appended as labels instead.

     There are two different methods for exporting the output of
     prometheus_sysctl_exporter to Prometheus.  The first method is to
     periodically invoke this utility through cron(8) and store its output in
     a textfile.  The metrics in this textfile can then be served over HTTP
     using the Prometheus node exporter's textfile collector.  The second
     method is to run this utility through inetd(8).  TCP port 9124 has been
     allocated for this purpose.

     The following options are available:

     -d      Print descriptions of metrics when available.

     -g      Gzip compresses the HTTP response body.

     -h      Precede the output with a HTTP response header.  This flag is
             required when running this utility through inetd(8).
