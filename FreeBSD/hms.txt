NAME
     hms – HID mouse driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device hms
           device hidbus
           device hid
           device evdev

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hms_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The hms driver provides support for HID mice that attach to the HID
     transport backend.  See iichid(4) or usbhid(4).  Supported are mice with
     any number of buttons, mice with a wheel and absolute mice.

     The /dev/input/eventX device presents the mouse as a evdev type device.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variable is available as both sysctl(8) variable and
     loader(8) tunable:

     dev.hms.X.debug
             Debug output level, where 0 is debugging disabled and larger
             values increase debug message verbosity.  Default is 0.

     It default value is derived from loader(8) tunable:

     hw.hid.hms.debug

FILES
     /dev/input/eventX  input event device node.
