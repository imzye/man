NAME
       Starlink::AST - Interface to the Starlink AST library

SYNOPSIS
         use Starlink::AST;

         my $zmap = new Starlink::AST::ZoomMap( 2, 5, "" );
         $zmap->Set( Zoom => 5 );

         my ($xout, $yout ) = $zmap->Tran2( [1,2], [4,6], 1);

         my $fchan = new Starlink::AST::FitsChan();
         for (<DATA>) {
          $fchan->PutFits( $_, 0);
         }
         $fchan->Clear( "Card" );

         $wcs = $fchan->Read();

         tie %hash, "Starlink::AST::KeyMap";
         $hash{KEYWORD} = $value;

         $km = Starlink::AST::KeyMap->new( "" );
         tie %hash, $km;

DESCRIPTION
       "Starlink::AST" provides a perl wrapper to the Starlink AST library.
       The Starlink AST library provides facilities for transforming
       coordinates from one system to another in an object oriented manner.
       Multiple coordinate frames can be associated with a data set and it is
       also possible to generate automatic mappings between frames.

       Coordinate frame objects can be imported from FITS headers and from NDF
       files.

CALLING CONVENTIONS
       In general the method names used in the Perl interface match the
       function names in the C library with the "ast" prefix dropped.
       Functions that require C arrays, should take references to Perl arrays.
       AST functions that return values/arrays now return these values/arrays
       onto the perl stack rather than the argument stack.

       The constructor functions are now replaced with "new" methods in the
       relevant class. e.g rather than calling astZoomMap(), the Perl
       interface uses the "new" method in the "Starlink::AST::ZoomMap"
       namespace.

   Constructors
       The following constructors are available. Currently, these constructors
       match the C constructors fairly closely.

       This is one area which may change when the class comes out of alpha
       release. The main problem with the constructors is the options string
       (a standard AST option string with comma-separated keyword value
       pairs). It would make more sense to replace these constructors with
       hash constructors that take the mandatory arguments in the correct
       order and hash arguments for the options.

       Starlink::AST::Frame
           Instantiate an astFrame() object.

             $frame = new Starlink::AST::Frame( $naxes, $options );

       Starlink::AST::FrameSet
             $frameSet = new Starlink::AST::FrameSet( $frame, $options );

       Starlink::AST::CmpFrame
             $cmpFrame = new Starlink::AST::CmpFrame( $frame1, $frame2, $options );

       Starlink::AST::CmpMap
             $cmpMap = new Starlink::AST::CmpMap( $map1, $map2, $series, $options );

       Starlink::AST::Channel
           The astChannel contructor takes a hash argument. There are no
           mandatory keys to the hash. Sink and Source callbacks for the
           channel can be supplied using the keys "sink" and "source". All
           other keys are expected to correspond to attributes of the channel
           object (e.g. Comment, Full and Skip for astChannel).

             $chann = new Starlink::AST::Channel( %options );

             $chann = new Starlink::AST::Channel( sink => sub { print "$_[0]\n"; } );

           The "sink" callback expects to be given a single argument as a
           string.  The "source" callback takes no arguments and should return
           a single string.

       Starlink::AST::FitsChan
           Same calling signature as "Starlink::AST::Channel".

       Starlink::AST::XmlChan
           Same calling signature as "Starlink::AST::Channel". Note that
           xmlChan is only available for AST v3.1 and newer.

       Starlink::AST::StcsChan
           A "Starlink::AST::Channel" using IVOA STC-S descriptions.

       Starlink::AST::GrisMap
           Only available in AST v3.0 and newer.

             $grismMap = new Starlink::AST::GrisMap( $options );

       Starlink::AST::IntraMap
           Not Yet Implemented.

            $intraMap = new Starlink::AST::IntraMap( $name, $nin, $nout, $options );

   Base class methods
       These methods will work on all classes of AST objects.

   Mapping methods
       TODO

   FrameSet methods
       TODO

EXCEPTIONS
       Rather than using the "astOK" function provided to the C interface
       (which is not thread safe) AST errors are converted to Perl exceptions
       (currently croaks) which can be caught with an eval.

TODO
        + Convert AST croaks to true exceptions of class Starlink::AST::Error

        + Tidy up the interfaces to the constructors

        + Properly document the Perl interface

        + Finalise the interface
