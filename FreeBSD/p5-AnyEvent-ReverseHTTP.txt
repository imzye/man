NAME
       AnyEvent::ReverseHTTP - reversehttp for AnyEvent

SYNOPSIS
         use AnyEvent::ReverseHTTP;

         # simple Hello World server
         my $guard = reverse_http "myserver123", "token", sub {
             my $req = shift;
             return "Hello World"; # You can return HTTP::Response object for more control
         };

         # more controls over options and callbacks
         my $server = AnyEvent::ReverseHTTP->new(
             endpoint => "http://www.reversehttp.net/reversehttp",
             label    => "aedemo1234",
             token    => "mytoken",
         );

         $server->on_register(sub {
             my $pub_url = shift;
         });

         $server->on_request(sub {
             my $req = shift;
             # $req is HTTP::Request, return HTTP::Response or AnyEvent::CondVar that receives it
         });

         my $guard = $server->connect;

         AnyEvent->condvar->recv;

DESCRIPTION
       AnyEvent::ReverseHTTP is an AnyEvent module that acts as a Reverse HTTP
       server (which is actually a polling client for Reverse HTTP gateway).

       This module implements simple Reverse HTTP client that's tested against
       reversehttp.net demo server. More complicated specification like
       relaying or pipelining is not (yet) implemented.
