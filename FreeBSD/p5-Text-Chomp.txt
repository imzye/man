NAME
       Text::Chomp - a module implementing a portable chomp.

SYNOPSIS
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Text::Chomp;

           open FILE, "file.dat"
               or die "Unable to open file:  $!";

           while (<FILE>) {
               # Strip off any end of line character, not just $/
               my $line = tchomp $_;
               ...
           }

           close FILE;

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Chomp implements a single function, tchomp, which will remove all
       known (by me, at least) line separators.  chomp() works only on the
       value in $/, which can be difficult if working in multi-platform
       environments.

EXPORTS
       tchomp() is the only function exported.  Attempts to export other
       functions will cause the module to fail to load.

FUNCTIONS
   tchomp $text
       This function removes the end of line character from a line of text and
       returns the text.  Line separators currently handled include:

       \n - line feed
       \r\n - carriage return/line feed
       \r - carriage return
       \f - form feed
       \x{2028} - Unicode line separator
       \x{2029} - Unicode page separator

TODO
       Precompile the regular expression used for speed, and so that it can be
       accessed for split().

BUGS
       Please report any bugs or feature requests to
       "bug-text-chomp@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
       <http://rt.cpan.org>.  I will be notified, and then you'll
       automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Original inspiration came from an ancient perlbug
       <http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=1807>.  #p5p provided
       some additional ideas regarding the Unicode (and a suggested name of
       Ch::omp).  Finally, the "Perl Cookbook" had information on how to match
       the Unicode line and page separators.
