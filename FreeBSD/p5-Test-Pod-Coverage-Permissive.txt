Test::Pod::Coverage::Permissive(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Test::Pod::Coverage::Permissive - Checks for pod coverage regression.

VERSION
       Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
       Checks for POD coverage regressions in your code. This module is for
       large projects, which can't be covered by POD for a 5 minutes. If you
       have small module or your project is fully covered - use
       Test::Pod::Coverage instead.

       After first run, this module creates data file, where saves all
       uncovered subroutines. If you create new uncovered subroutine, it will
       fail. If you create new package with uncovered subroutines, it will
       fail. Otherwise it will show diagnostic messages like these:

           t/03podcoverage.t .. 2/? # YourProject::Controller::Root: naked 4 subroutine(s)
           # YourProject::Controller::NotRoot: naked 8 subroutine(s)
           # YorProject::Controller::AlsoNotRoot: naked 3 subroutine(s)
           ...

       This module will help you to cover your project step-by-step. And your
       new code will be covered by POD.

       Interface is like Test::Pod::Coverage:

           use Test::Pod::Coverage::Permissive;

           use Test::More;
           eval "use Test::Pod::Coverage::Permissive";
           plan skip_all => "Test::Pod::Coverage::Permissive required for testing POD coverage" if $@;
           all_pod_coverage_ok();

FUNCTIONS
   all_pod_coverage_ok( [$parms] )
       Checks that the POD code in all modules in the distro have proper POD
       coverage.

       If the $parms hashref if passed in, they're passed into the
       "Pod::Coverage" object that the function uses.  Check the Pod::Coverage
       manual for what those can be.

       The exception is the "coverage_class" parameter, which specifies a
       class to use for coverage testing.  It defaults to "Pod::Coverage".

   pod_coverage_ok( $module, [$parms,] $msg )
       Checks that the POD code in $module has proper POD coverage.

       If the $parms hashref if passed in, they're passed into the
       "Pod::Coverage" object that the function uses.  Check the Pod::Coverage
       manual for what those can be.

       The exception is the "coverage_class" parameter, which specifies a
       class to use for coverage testing.  It defaults to "Pod::Coverage".

   all_modules( [@dirs] )
       Returns a list of all modules in $dir and in directories below. If no
       directories are passed, it defaults to blib if blib exists, or lib if
       not.

       Note that the modules are as "Foo::Bar", not "Foo/Bar.pm".

       The order of the files returned is machine-dependent.  If you want them
       sorted, you'll have to sort them yourself.
