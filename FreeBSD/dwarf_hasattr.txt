DWARF_HASATTR(3)       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual       DWARF_HASATTR(3)

NAME
     dwarf_hasattr – check for the presence of an attribute

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_hasattr(Dwarf_Die die, Dwarf_Half attr, Dwarf_Bool *ret_bool,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_hasattr() tests whether the debugging information entry
     referenced in argument die contains the attribute named by argument attr.
     Legal values for argument attr are those denoted by the DW_AT_* constants
     in the DWARF specification.

     If the named attribute is present in the debugging information entry,
     function dwarf_hasattr() returns a non-zero value in the location pointed
     to by argument ret_bool.  If the named attribute is not present, a zero
     is written instead.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to return an error
     descriptor in case of an error.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, function dwarf_hasattr() returns DW_DLV_OK.  In case of an
     error, it returns DW_DLV_ERROR and sets argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_hasattr() can fail with the following error:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Either of argument die or ret_bool was NULL.
