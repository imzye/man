NAME
     pipeglade – pipe-driven GTK+ interface

SYNOPSIS
     pipeglade [[-i in-fifo] [-o out-fifo] [-b] [-u builder-file]
               [-e parent-xid] [-l log-file] [-O err-file]
               [--display X-server]] | [-h | -G | -V]

DESCRIPTION
     pipeglade is a helper program that displays graphical user interfaces for
     other programs.  It renders the GUI definition found in a GtkBuilder XML
     file (typically created using the glade(1) interface designer), and
     communicates with the main program solely through plain text messages via
     pipes or fifos.  It provides access to a subset of features of a subset
     of widgets of GTK+ 3.  Simple one-shot dialogs as well as more complex,
     long-running programs can be built using pipeglade; see EXAMPLES.

OPTIONS
     -i in-fifo
             Creates a named pipe in-fifo if necessary, sets its permissions
             to 0600, and uses it for command input.

             A command is a line of text.  Its format is "id:action [data]",
             id being the name of the receiving widget; data is separated from
             the rest of the command by a single whitespace character.
             Commands whose first non-whitespace character is # are considered
             comments and ignored silently, as are empty input lines.  Any
             occurences of the two-character sequences \n and \r will be
             converted into newline or carriage return, respectively.  Every
             other character following a backslash will be left unchanged, but
             the backslash will be removed.  Invalid commands are reported on
             stderr and are otherwise ignored.  See WIDGETS for applicable
             commands.

             It is an error if in-fifo exists but is not a named pipe.  The
             named pipe in-fifo is deleted upon successful program
             termination.

             Default command input is stdin.

     -o out-fifo
             Creates a named pipe out-fifo if necessary, sets its permissions
             to 0600, and uses it for output of feedback messages from the
             graphical user interface.

             A feedback message is a line of text; its format is "id:info
             [data]", id being the name of the sending widget.  See WIDGETS
             for possible feedback messages.

             It is an error if out-fifo exists but is not a named pipe.  The
             named pipe out-fifo is deleted upon successful program
             termination.

             Default feedback-message output is stdout.

     -b      Runs pipeglade in the background after printing its process ID to
             stdout.

             It is an error if option -b is used and not both -i in-fifo and
             -o out-fifo are specified.

     -u builder-file
             Displays the graphical user interface builder-file which should
             be created using the glade(1) user interface designer and saved
             in GtkBuilder (.ui) format.  Widget ids should consist of
             alphanumeric ASCII characters including hyphens and underscores.
             The main window must must be given the id main.

             Default is ./pipeglade.ui.

     -e parent-xid
             Embeds the main window into the XEmbed socket parent-xid of
             another process.

     -l log-file
             Appends for each command a line of "time activity" to log-file,
             time being the number of microseconds elapsed during activity.
             time and activity are separated by a tab character.  Permissions
             of log-file are set to 0600.  A log-file name of ‘-’ means
             stderr.

     -O err-file
             Redirects stderr, appending its output to err-file.  Permissions
             of err-file are set to 0600.

     --display X-server
             Uses the display on X-server for user interaction.

     -h      Prints a help message and exits.

     -G      Prints the versions of the underlying GTK+ and cairo libraries
             and exits.

     -V      Prints the pipeglade version and exits.

WIDGETS
     The widget classes able to communicate through pipeglade are GtkBox,
     GtkButton, GtkButtonBox, GtkCalendar, GtkCheckButton, GtkColorButton,
     GtkComboBoxText, GtkDialog, GtkDrawingArea, GtkEntry, GtkEventBox,
     GtkExpander, GtkFileChooserButton, GtkFileChooserDialog, GtkFontButton,
     GtkFrame, GtkGrid, GtkImage, GtkImageMenuItem, GtkInfoBar, GtkLabel,
     GtkMenuItem, GtkNotebook, GtkOverlay, GtkPlug, GtkPrintUnixDialog,
     GtkProgressBar, GtkRadioButton, GtkScale, GtkScrolledWindow,
     GtkSeparator, GtkSeparatorMenuItem, GtkSocket, GtkSpinButton, GtkSpinner,
     GtkStatusbar, GtkSwitch, GtkTextView, GtkToggleButton, GtkTreeView,

     pipeglade references a widget by the id attribute it is given in Glade.
     In the .ui file, a GtkWindow named foo would appear as
           <object class="GtkWindow" id="foo">.

   Unspecific Widget
     Commands

                "id:load file" reads arbitrary pipeglade commands from file.
                A non-empty id is required but ignored.  :load commands may be
                nested but on attempts to read from the same file, the inner
                :load is ignored.  There is also a :save command; see
                GtkTextView and GtkTreeView.

                "id:main_quit" kills the user interface.  A non-empty id is
                required but ignored.

   GtkDialog
     A GtkDialog with id foo will be invoked by a GtkMenuItem or a
     GtkImageMenuItem with id foo_invoke.

     The GtkDialog should have a ‘Cancel’ GtkButton with id foo_cancel
     (main_cancel if the dialog is the sole window of the GUI and therefore
     named main).

     If the GtkDialog has an ‘Ok’ GtkButton with id foo_ok, it will take care
     of hiding the dialog window.

     Commands   "id:set_title string" replaces the text in the title bar with
                string.

                "id:resize [width height]" changes the size of the dialog

                visible (1).

                "id:block {0|1}" blocks (1) or unblocks (0) feedback messages
                from the dialog window.  Initially, the window is unblocked.

                "id:set_tooltip_text [text]" sets the dialog window's tooltip.
                Default is disabling the tooltip.

                "id:snapshot file{.ps|.eps|.epsf|.pdf|.svg}" writes a snapshot
                of the dialog window to an image file of the specified type.

                "id:set_size_request [width height]" sets the dialog window's

                style.  See Style.

     Feedback   "id:closed" if the GtkDialog window was closed by the window
                manager.

   GtkDrawingArea
     Drawing commands expect a context parameter of the form {n|=n|n<m} where
     n is an arbitrary non-negative integer that can be used later to
     reference the command.  The first form, n, appends its command to the
     current list of drawing operations.  The second form, =n, replaces the
     first drawing operation with context parameter n by the new command.  The
     third form, n<m, inserts its command before the first drawing operation
     with context parameter m.  Both second and third form fall back to
     appending.

     The default coordinate system is a left-handed system with its origin in
     the upper-left corner.  Angles increase from the positive X axis towards
     the positve Y axis (clockwise in the default system).

     Commands   "id:arc {n|=n|n<m} x y radius angle1 angle2" adds a circular
                arc to the current path.  The arc is centered at (x, y) and
                proceeds from angle1 to angle2 (in degrees).

                "id:arc_negative {n|=n|n<m} x y radius angle1 angle2" adds a
                circular arc to the current path.  The arc is centered at (x,
                y) and proceeds in the direction of decreasing angles from
                angle1 to angle2 (in degrees).

                "id:close_path {n|=n|n<m}" adds a line segment from the
                current point to the point most recently passed to id:move_to
                or id:rel_move_to.

                "id:curve_to {n|=n|n<m} x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3" adds a cubic Bezier
                spline from the current point to (x3, y3), using (x1, y1) and
                (x2, y2) as control points.  If there is no current point, the
                curve will start at (x1, y1).

                "id:fill {n|=n|n<m}" fills the current path and clears it.

                "id:fill_preserve {n|=n|n<m}" fills the current path without
                clearing it.

                "id:line_to {n|=n|n<m} x y" adds a line from the current point
                to (x, y), or creates a new current point at (x, y).

                "id:move_to {n|=n|n<m} x y" sets the current point to (x, y).

                "id:rectangle {n|=n|n<m} x y width height" adds a rectangle to
                the current path.  The top left corner is at (x, y).

                "id:rel_curve_to {n|=n|n<m} dx1 dy1 dx2 dy2 dx3 dy3" adds a
                cubic Bezier spline from the current point to (dx3, dy3),
                using (dx1, dy1) and (dx2, dy2) as control points.  All
                coordinates are offsets relative to the current point.

                "id:rel_line_to {n|=n|n<m} dx dy" adds a line from the current

   GtkTextView
     There should be a dedicated GtkButton for sending (parts of) the text.
     If the id of the GtkTextView is foo, a GtkButton with id foo_send_text
     will send the content of the GtkTextView; a GtkButton with id
     foo_send_selection will send the highlighted part the GtkTextView.

     Commands   "id:set_text string" replaces the user-editable text with
                (potentially empty) string.

   GtkTreeView
     pipeglade can deal with columns of type gboolean, gint, guint, glong,
     gulong, gint64, guint64, gfloat, gdouble, and gchararray.

     row and column refer to the underlying model (GtkListStore or
     GtkTreeStore).  row is a sequence of one or more colon-separated
     integers, e.g.  ‘3’ or ‘0:0:1’.

     Commands   "id:set row column data" replaces the content at (row, column)
                with data (which should be compatible with the type of
                column).  If necessary, new tree nodes are created to obtain
                the minimal tree structure needed to support row.

                "id:insert_row {row [as_child] | end}" inserts a new, empty
                row; either as a sibling of row at position row, or as a child
                of row, or at the end of the list, respectively.

                "id:move_row origin {destination | end}" moves the row at
                origin within its current level to destination or to the end.

                "id:clear" removes all rows.

                "id:expand row" expands one level of the subtree below row.

                "id:expand_all [row]" expands the subtree below row, or the
                whole tree.

                "id:collapse [row]" collapses the subtree below row, or the
                whole tree.

                "id:set_cursor [row]" sets the cursor to row, or unsets it.

                "id:scroll row column" scrolls the cell at (row, column) into
                view.

                "id:save file" stores the content of the underlying model as a
                sequence of pipeglade commands into file.

                "id:grab_focus" puts the keyboard focus onto the tree view.

EXIT STATUS
     The pipeglade utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
   Discovering Pipeglade Interactively
     Suppose the interface in ./pipeglade.ui has a GtkLabel ‘label1’ and a
     GtkButton ‘button1’.  After invoking

           pipeglade

     and clicking the GtkButton, ‘button1:clicked’ will be reported on the
     terminal.  Typing

           label1:set_text The Button

     will change the text shown on the label into ‘The Button’.

   One-Shot File Dialog
     Suppose the interface in ./simple_open.ui contains a GtkFileChooserDialog
     with an ‘OK’ GtkButton whose id is ‘main_ok’.  Invoking

           pipeglade -u simple_open.ui

     will open the dialog; pressing ‘OK’ will close it after sending the
     selected filename to stdout.

   One-Shot User Notification
     If the interface in ./simple_dialog.ui contains a GtkLabel ‘label1’, then

           pipeglade -u simple_dialog.ui <<< \
               "label1:set_text NOW READ THIS!"
     will set the label text accordingly and wait for user input.

   Continuous Input
     The following shell command displays a running clock:

           while true; do
               echo "label1:set_text `date`";
               sleep 1;
           done | pipeglade -u simple_dialog.ui

   Continuous Input and Output
     The following shell script fragment sets up pipeglade for continuous
     communication with another program, main_prog:

           pipeglade -i in.fifo -o out.fifo -b
           main_prog <out.fifo >in.fifo

BUGS
     Due to what appears to be a bug in cairo v1.14.0, pipeglade used with
     this library version occasionally crashes on GtkDrawingArea commands.
