NAME
     eui64 – IEEE EUI-64 address database

DESCRIPTION
     The eui64 database contains information regarding known IEEE EUI-64s of
     hosts.  The data is stored in a file called /etc/eui64 in the following
     format:

           EUI-64 host-name

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A ‘#’
     at the start of a line indicates the beginning of a comment that extends
     to the end of the line.  Valid lines may also contain comments.  A ‘+’ at
     the start of a line will cause the eui64(3) library functions to use data
     stored in the NIS eui64.byname and eui64.byid maps in addition to the
     data in the /etc/eui64 file.

     An EUI-64 is expressed in ASCII form as "x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x" where x is a
     hexadecimal value between 0x00 and 0xFF.  The address values should be in
     network order.  Hostnames specified in the /etc/eui64 database should
     correspond to entries in the hosts(5) file.

FILES
     /etc/eui64      The eui64 file resides in /etc.

SEE ALSO
     eui64(3), yp(8)

HISTORY
     The eui64 format is based on the ethers(5) format.
