PYI-MAKESPEC(1)                   PyInstaller                  PYI-MAKESPEC(1)



NAME
       pyi-makespec - Create a spec file for your PyInstaller project

SYNOPSIS
       pyi-makespec <options> SCRIPT [SCRIPT ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The spec file is the description of what you want PyInstaller to do
       with your program. pyi-makespec is a simple wizard to create spec files
       that cover basic usages:

          pyi-makespec [--onefile] yourprogram.py

       By default, pyi-makespec generates a spec file that tells PyInstaller
       to create a distribution directory contains the main executable and the
       dynamic libraries. The option --onefile specifies that you want
       PyInstaller to build a single file with everything inside.

       In most cases the specfile generated by pyi-makespec is all you need.
       If not, see When things go wrong in the manual and be sure to read the
       introduction to Spec Files.

OPTIONS

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --log-level_LEVEL
              Amount of detail in build-time console messages. LEVEL may be
              one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL (default:
              INFO).

   What to generate

       -D, --onedir
              Create a one-folder bundle containing an executable (default)

       -F, --onefile
              Create a one-file bundled executable.

       --specpath_DIR
              Folder to store the generated spec file (default: current
              directory)

       -n_NAME, --name_NAME
              Name to assign to the bundled app and spec file (default: first
              script's basename)

   What to bundle, where to search

       --add-data_<SRC;DESTorSRC:DEST>
              Additional non-binary files or folders to be added to the
              executable. The path separator is platform specific, os.pathsep
              (which is ; on Windows and : on most unix systems) is used. This
              option can be used multiple times.

       --add-binary_<SRC;DESTorSRC:DEST>
              Additional binary files to be added to the executable.  See the
              --add-data option for more details. This option can be used
              multiple times.

       -p_DIR, --paths_DIR
              A path to search for imports (like using PYTHONPATH).  Multiple
              paths are allowed, separated by ':', or use this option multiple
              times

       --hidden-import_MODULENAME, --hiddenimport_MODULENAME
              Name an import not visible in the code of the script(s). This
              option can be used multiple times.

       --additional-hooks-dir_HOOKSPATH
              An additional path to search for hooks. This option can be used
              multiple times.

       --runtime-hook_RUNTIME_HOOKS
              Path to a custom runtime hook file. A runtime hook is code that
              is bundled with the executable and is executed before any other
              code or module to set up special features of the runtime
              environment. This option can be used multiple times.

       --exclude-module_EXCLUDES
              Optional module or package (the Python name, not the path name)
              that will be ignored (as though it was not found). This option
              can be used multiple times.

       --key_KEY
              The key used to encrypt Python bytecode.

   How to generate

       -d_<all,imports,bootloader,noarchive>, --debug_<all,imports,bootloader,noarchive>
              R|Provide assistance with debugging a frozen application. This
              argument may be provided multiple times to select several of the
              following options. - all: All three of the following options. -
              imports: specify the -v option to the underlying Python
              interpreter, causing it to print a message each time a module is
              initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module)
              from which it is loaded. See
              https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#id4. - bootloader:
              tell the bootloader to issue progress messages while
              initializing and starting the bundled app. Used to diagnose
              problems with missing imports. - noarchive: instead of storing
              all frozen Python source files as an archive inside the
              resulting executable, store them as files in the resulting
              output directory.

       -s, --strip
              Apply a symbol-table strip to the executable and shared libs
              (not recommended for Windows)

       --noupx
              Do not use UPX even if it is available (works differently
              between Windows and *nix)

       --upx-exclude_FILE
              Prevent a binary from being compressed when using upx.  This is
              typically used if upx corrupts certain binaries during
              compression. FILE is the filename of the binary without path.
              This option can be used multiple times.

   Windows and Mac OS X specific options

       -c, --console, --nowindowed
              Open a console window for standard i/o (default). On Windows
              this option will have no effect if the first script is a '.pyw'
              file.

       -w, --windowed, --noconsole
              Windows and Mac OS X: do not provide a console window for
              standard i/o. On Mac OS X this also triggers building an OS X
              .app bundle. On Windows this option will be set if the first
              script is a '.pyw' file. This option is ignored in *NIX systems.

       -i_<FILE.icoorFILE.exe,IDorFILE.icns>, --icon_<FILE.icoorFILE.exe,IDorFILE.icns>
              FILE.ico: apply that icon to a Windows executable.  FILE.exe,ID,
              extract the icon with ID from an exe.  FILE.icns: apply the icon
              to the .app bundle on Mac OS X

   Windows specific options

       --version-file_FILE
              add a version resource from FILE to the exe

       -m_<FILEorXML>, --manifest_<FILEorXML>
              add manifest FILE or XML to the exe

       -r_RESOURCE, --resource_RESOURCE
              Add or update a resource to a Windows executable. The RESOURCE
              is one to four items, FILE[,TYPE[,NAME[,LANGUAGE]]]. FILE can be
              a data file or an exe/dll. For data files, at least TYPE and
              NAME must be specified. LANGUAGE defaults to 0 or may be
              specified as wildcard * to update all resources of the given
              TYPE and NAME. For exe/dll files, all resources from FILE will
              be added/updated to the final executable if TYPE, NAME and
              LANGUAGE are omitted or specified as wildcard *.This option can
              be used multiple times.

       --uac-admin
              Using this option creates a Manifest which will request
              elevation upon application restart.

       --uac-uiaccess
              Using this option allows an elevated application to work with
              Remote Desktop.

   Windows Side-by-side Assembly searching options (advanced)

       --win-private-assemblies
              Any Shared Assemblies bundled into the application will be
              changed into Private Assemblies. This means the exact versions
              of these assemblies will always be used, and any newer versions
              installed on user machines at the system level will be ignored.

       --win-no-prefer-redirects
              While searching for Shared or Private Assemblies to bundle into
              the application, PyInstaller will prefer not to follow policies
              that redirect to newer versions, and will try to bundle the
              exact versions of the assembly.

   Mac OS X specific options

       --osx-bundle-identifier_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER
              Mac OS X .app bundle identifier is used as the default unique
              program name for code signing purposes. The usual form is a
              hierarchical name in reverse DNS notation. For example:
              com.mycompany.department.appname (default: first script's
              basename)

   Rarely used special options

       --runtime-tmpdir_PATH
              Where to extract libraries and support files in onefile-mode. If
              this option is given, the bootloader will ignore any temp-folder
              location defined by the run-time OS. The _MEIxxxxxx-folder will
              be created here. Please use this option only if you know what
              you are doing.

       --bootloader-ignore-signals
              Tell the bootloader to ignore signals rather than forwarding
              them to the child process. Useful in situations where e.g. a
              supervisor process signals both the bootloader and child (e.g.
              via a process group) to avoid signalling the child twice.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

       PYINSTALLER_CONFIG_DIR
              This changes the directory where PyInstaller caches some files.
              The default location for this is operating system dependent, but
              is typically a subdirectory of the home directory.
