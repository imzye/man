NAME
       caffeine - utility to temporarily disable (inhibit) screensavers

SYNOPSIS
       caffeine
       caffeine start Starts caffeine
       caffeine kill Kills a running caffeine instance

DESCRIPTION
       caffeine shows an icon on the system tray. When activated,
       screensavers, screen dimming, and sceenlockers will be temporarily
       disabled (also referred to as "inhibiting").

COMMANDS
       start
           Runs caffeine and shows a tray icon. This is the default when no
           command is specified.

       kill
           Kills a running caffeine instance. May not work between different
           major versions (e.g.: v3 and v4). Be sure to stop before updating.
           Otherwise the old version will continue running until the next
           reboot / logout.

INTEGRATIONS
       caffeine-ng works with the following screensavers / screenlockers:

       •   Anything that implements the ``org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver`` API
           (this includes KDE, amongst others)
       •   gnome-screensaver
       •   XSS
       •   Xorg + DPMS
       •   xautolock
       •   xidlehook.

       On Xorg, caffeine will automatically detect fullscreen applications,
       and disable the screensaver while they are active.

CONFIGURATION
       Caffeine will auto-detect which screensaver is being used at runtime.

       Caffeine includes a GTK3+ preferences interface. It is not, as of yet,
       configurable via the command line.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables may optionally be defined:

       CAFFEINE_LEGACY_TRAY
           This will use legacy APIs rather than AppIndicator APIs. This may
           fail on Wayland, and may allow left-clicking on some Xorg status
           tray implementations.

PRIVACY
       Caffine does not require any network connectivity.

       When the pulseaudio peak detection feature is enabled, caffeine will
       detect peaks in volume to determine if audio is being used.
