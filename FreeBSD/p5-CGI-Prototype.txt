NAME
       CGI::Prototype - Create a CGI application by subclassing

SYNOPSIS
         package My::HelloWorld;
         use base CGI::Prototype;

         sub template { \ <<'END_OF_TEMPLATE' }
         [% self.CGI.header; %]
         Hello world at [% USE Date; Date.format(date.now) | html %]!
         END_OF_TEMPLATE

         My::HelloWorld->activate;

DESCRIPTION
       The core of every CGI application seems to be roughly the same:

       •   Analyze the incoming parameters, cookies, and URLs to determine the
           state of the application (let's call this "dispatch").

       •   Based on the current state, analyze the incoming parameters to
           respond to any form submitted ("respond").

       •   From there, decide what response page should be generated, and
           produce it ("render").

       CGI::Prototype creates a "Class::Prototyped" engine for doing all this,
       with the right amount of callback hooks to customize the process.
       Because I'm biased toward Template Toolkit for rendering HTML, I've
       also integrated that as my rendering engine of choice.  And, being a
       fan of clean MVC designs, the classes become the controllers, and the
       templates become the views, with clean separation of responsibilities,
       and "CGI::Prototype" a sort of "archetypal" controller.

       You can create the null application by simply activating it:

         use CGI::Prototype;
         CGI::Prototype->activate;

       But this won't be very interesting.  You'll want to subclass this class
       in a "Class::Prototyped"-style manner to override most of its behavior.
       Slots can be added to add or alter behavior.  You can subclass your
       subclasses when groups of your CGI pages share similar behavior.  The
       possibilities are mind-boggling.

       Within the templates, "self" refers to the current controller.  Thus,
       you can define callbacks trivially.  In your template, if you need some
       data, you can pull it as a request:

         [% my_data = self.get_some_big_data %]

       which is supplied by simply adding the same slot (method or data) in
       the controlling class:

         sub get_some_big_data {
           my $self = shift;
           return $self->some_other_method(size => 'big');
         }

       And since the classes are hierarchical, you can start out with an
       implementation for one page, then move it to a region or globally
       quickly.

       Although the name "CGI::Prototype" implies a CGI protocol, I see no
       reason that this would not work with "Apache::Registry" in a "mod_perl"
       environment, or a direct content handler such as:

         package My::App;
         use base CGI::Prototype;
         sub handler {
           __PACKAGE__->activate;
         }

       Note that the $r request object will have to be created if needed if
       you use this approach.

   CORE SLOTS
       These slots provide core functionality.  You will probably not need to
       override these.

       activate
           Invoke the "activate" slot to "activate" your application, causing
           it to process the incoming CGI values, select a page to be respond
           to the parameters, which in turn selects a page to render, and then
           responds with that page.  For example, your App might consist only
           of:

             package My::App;
             use base qw(CGI::Prototype);
             My::App->activate;

           Again, this will not be interesting, but it shows that the null app
           is easy to create.  Almost always, you will want to override some
           of the "callback" slots below.

       CGI Invoking "$self->CGI" gives you access to the CGI.pm object
           representing the incoming parameters and other CGI.pm-related
           values.  For example,

             $self->CGI->self_url

           generates a self-referencing URL.  From a template, this is:

             [% self.CGI.self_url %]

           for the same thing.

           See "initialize_CGI" for how this slot gets established.

       render
           The "render" method uses the results from "engine" and "template"
           to process a selected template through Template Toolkit.  If the
           result does not throw an error, "$self->display" is called to show
           the result.

       display
           The "display" method is called to render the output of the template
           under normal circumstances, normally dumping the first parameter to
           "STDOUT".  Test harnesses may override this method to cause the
           output to appear into a variable, but normally this method is left
           alone.

       param
           The "param" method is a convenience method that maps to
           "$self->CGI->param", because accessing params is a very common
           thing.

       interstitial
           Please note that this feature is still experimental and subject to
           change.

           Use this in your per-page respond methods if you have a lot of
           heavy processing to perform.  For example, suppose you're deleting
           something, and it takes 5 seconds to do the first step, and 3
           seconds to do the second step, and then you want to go back to
           normal web interaction.  Simulating the heavy lifting with sleep,
           we get:

             my $p = $self->interstitial
               ({ message => "Your delete is being processed...",
                  action => sub { sleep 5 },
                },
                { message => "Just a few seconds more....",
                  action => sub { sleep 3 },
                },
               );
             return $p if $p;

           "interstitial" returns either a page that should be returned so
           that it can be rendered (inside a wrapper that provides the
           standard top and bottom of your application page), or "undef".

           The list passed to "interstitial" should be a series of hashrefs
           with one or more parameters reflecting the steps:

           message
               What the user should see while the step is computing.
               (Default: "Working...".)

           action
               A coderef with the action performed server-side during the
               message.  (Default: no action.)

           delay
               The number of seconds the browser should wait before initiating
               the next connection, triggering the start of "action".
               (Default: 0 seconds.)

           The user sees the first message at the first call to "interstitial"
           (via the first returned page), at which time a meta-refresh will
           immediately repost the same parameters as on the call that got you
           here.  (Thus, it's important not to have changed the params yet, or
           you might end up in a different part of your code.)  When the call
           to "interstitial" is re-executed, the first coderef is then
           performed.  At the end of that coderef, the second interstitial
           page is returned, and the user sees the second message, which then
           performs the next meta-refresh, which gets us back to this call to
           "interstitial" again (whew).  The second coderef is executed while
           the user is seeing the second message, and then "interstitial"
           returns "undef", letting us roll through to the final code.  Slick.

       config_interstitial_param
           This parameter is used by "interstitial" to determine the
           processing step.  You should ensure that the name doesn't conflict
           with any other param that you might need.

           The default value is "_interstitial".

   CALLBACK SLOTS
       engine
           The engine returns a Template object that will be generating any
           response.  The object is computed lazily (with autoloading) when
           needed.

           The Template object is passed the configuration returned from the
           "engine_config" callback.

       engine_config
           Returns a hashref of desired parameters to pass to the "Template"
           "new" method as a configuration.  Defaults to an empty hash.

       prototype_enter
           Called when the prototype mechanism is entered, at the very
           beginning of each hit.  Defaults to calling "-"initialize_CGI>,
           which see.

           Generally, you should not override this method. If you do, be sure
           to call the SUPER method, in case future versions of this module
           need additional initialization.

       prototype_leave
           Called when the prototype mechanism is exited, at the very end of
           each hit.  Defaults to no action.

           Generally, you should not override this method. If you do, be sure
           to call the SUPER method, in case future versions of this module
           need additional teardown.

       initialize_CGI
           Sets up the CGI slot as an autoload, defaulting to creating a new
           CGI.pm object.  Called from "prototype_enter".

       app_enter
           Called when the application is entered, at the very beginning of
           each hit.  Defaults to no action.

       app_leave
           Called when the application is left, at the very end of each hit.
           Defaults to no action.

       control_enter
           Called when a page gains control, either at the beginning for a
           response, or in the middle when switched for rendering.  Defaults
           to nothing.

           This is a great place to hang per-page initialization, because
           you'll get this callback at most once per hit.

       control_leave
           Called when a page loses control, either after a response phase
           because we're switching to a new page, or render phase after we've
           delivered the new text to the browser.

           This is a great place to hang per-page teardown, because you'll get
           this callback at most once per hit.

       render_enter
           Called when a page gains control specifically for rendering
           (delivering text to the browser), just after "control_enter" if
           needed.

       render_leave
           Called when a page loses control specifically for rendering
           (delivering text to the browser), just before "control_leave".

       respond_enter
           Called when a page gains control specifically for responding
           (understanding the incoming parameters, and deciding what page
           should render the response), just after "control_enter".

       respond_leave
           Called when a page loses control specifically for rendering
           (understanding the incoming parameters, and deciding what page
           should render the response), just before "control_leave" (if
           needed).

       template
           Delivers a template document object (something compatible to the
           "Template" "process" method, such as a "Template::Document" or a
           filehandle or a reference to a scalar).  The default is a simple
           "this page intentionally left blank" template.

           When rendered, the only extra global variable passed into the
           template is the "self" variable, representing the controller
           object.  However, as seen earlier, this is sufficient to allow
           access to anything you need from the template, thanks to Template
           Toolkit's ability to call methods on an object and understand the
           results.

           For example, to get at the "barney" parameter:

             The barney field is [% self.param("barney") | html %].

       error
           Called if an uncaught error is triggered in any of the other steps,
           passing the error text or object as the first method parameter.
           The default callback simply displays the output to the browser,
           which is highly insecure and should be overridden, perhaps with
           something that logs the error and puts up a generic error message
           with an incident code for tracking.

       dispatch
           Called to analyze the incoming parameters to define which page
           object gets control based on the incoming CGI parameters.

           This callback must return a page object (the object taking control
           during the response phase).  By default, this callback returns the
           application itself.

       respond
           Called to determine how to respond specifically to this set of
           incoming parameters.  Probably updates databases and such.

           This callback must return a page object (the object taking control
           during the render phase).  By default, this callback returns the
           same object that had control during the response phase ("stay here"
           logic), which works most of the time.
