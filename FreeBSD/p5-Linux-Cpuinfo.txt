NAME
       Linux::Cpuinfo - Object Oriented Interface to /proc/cpuinfo

SYNOPSIS
         # Old interface ( for single processor devices )

         use Linux::Cpuinfo;

         my $cpu = Linux::Cpuinfo->new();

         die ('Could not find cpu info (does /proc/cpuinfo exists?)')
           unless ref $cpu;

         print $cpu->model_name();


         # New Interface ( copes with SMP ).

         my $cpuinfo = Linux::Cpuinfo->new();

         $cnt  = $cpuinfo->num_cpus();  # > 1 for an SMP system


          foreach my $cpu ( $cpuinfo->cpus() )
          {
            print $cpu->bogomips(),"\n";
          }

DESCRIPTION
       On Linux systems various information about the CPU ( or CPUs ) in the
       computer can be gleaned from "/proc/cpuinfo". This module provides an
       object oriented interface to that information for relatively simple use
       in Perl programs.

   METHODS
       The interface has changed between revisions 1.2 and 1.3 of this module
       in order to deal with systems with multiple CPUs - now the details of a
       CPU are acquired by the methods of the Linux::Cpuinfo::Cpu objects
       returned by the cpu() and cpus() methods of this class. However in
       order to retain backward compatibility if the methods described for
       Linux::Cpuinfo::Cpu are called a Linux::Cpuinfo object then it will
       work as previously - returning the details of the sole CPU on a single
       processor system and the last discovered
        CPU on system with multiple processors ( this was the implicit
       behaviour on previous versions).  Whilst not strictly deprecated this
       interface is not the recommended one.

       cpuinfo
           Returns a blessed object suitable for calling the rest of the
           methods on or a false value if for some reason "/proc/cpuinfo" cant
           be opened.  The first argument can be an alternative file that
           provides identical information.  You may also supply a hashref
           containing other arguments - the valid keys are

           NoFatal
             The default behaviour is for the method to croak if an attribute
             is requested that is not available on this particular CPU.  If
             this argument is supplied with a true value then the method will
             return undef instead.

       num_cpus
           Returns the number of CPUs reported for this system.

       cpu SCALAR $cpu
           Returns an object of type Linux::Cpuinfo::Cpu corresponding to the
           CPU of index $cpu ( where $cpu >= 0 and $cpu < num_cpus() ) - if
           $cpu is omitted this will return an object correspnding to the last
           CPU found.

           If $cpu is out of bounds with respect to the number of CPUs then it
           will be set to the first or last CPU ( depending whether $cpu was <
           0 or >num_cpus )

       cpus
           Returns a list containing objects of type Linux::Cpuinfo::Cpu
           corresponding to the CPUs discovered in this system.   If the
           method is called in a scalar context it will return a reference to
           an array of those objects.

   PER CPU METHODS OF Linux::Cpuinfo::Cpu
       Note that not all of the methods listed here are available on all CPU
       types.  For instance, MIPS CPUs have no cpuid instruction, but might
       sport a byte order attribute.

       There are also some other methods available for some CPUs which aren't
       listed here.

       processor
           This is the index of the processor this information is for, it will
           be zero for a the first CPU (which is the only one on single-
           proccessor systems), one for the second and so on.

       vendor_id
           This is a vendor defined string for X86 CPUs such as 'GenuineIntel'
           or 'AuthenticAMD'. 12 bytes long, since it is returned via three 32
           byte long registers.

       cpu_family
           This should return an integer that will indicate the 'family' of
           the processor - This is for instance '6' for a Pentium III. Might
           be undefined for non-X86 CPUs.

       model or cpu_model
           An integer that is probably vendor dependent that indicates their
           version of the above cpu_family

       model_name
           A string such as 'Pentium III (Coppermine)'.

       stepping
           I'm lead to believe this is a version increment used by intel.

       cpu_mhz
           I guess this is self explanatory - it might however be different to
           what it says on the box. The Mhz is measured at boot time by the
           kernel and represents the true Mhz at that time.

       bus_mhz
           The MHz of the bus system.

       cache_size
           The cache size for this processor - it might well have the units
           appended ( such as 'KB' )

       fdiv_bug
           True if this bug is present in the processor.

       hlt_bug
           True if this bug is present in the processor.

       sep_bug
           True if this bug is present in the processor.

       f00f_bug
           True if this bug is present in the processor.

       coma_bug
           True if this bug is present in the processor.

       fpu True if the CPU has a floating point unit.

       fpu_exception
           True if the floating point unit can throw an exception.

       cpuid_level
           The "cpuid" assembler instruction is only present on X86 CPUs. This
           attribute represents the level of the instruction that is supported
           by the CPU. The first CPUs had only level 1, newer chips have more
           levels and can thus return more information.

       wp  No idea what this is on X86 CPUs.

       flags
           This is the set of flags that the CPU supports - this is returned
           as an array reference.

       byte_order
           The byte order of the CPU, might be little endian or big endian, or
           undefined for unknown.

       bogomips
           A system constant calculated when the kernel is booted - it is a
           (rather poor) measure of the CPU's performance.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

BUGS
       The enormous bug in this is that I didnt realize when I made this that
       the contents of "/proc/cpuinfo " are different for different
       processors.

       I really would be indebted if Linux users from other than x86
       processors would help me document this properly.
