NAME
       sshoutcfg - Configuring Secure Shout Host Oriented Unified Talk server
       side

SYNOPSIS
       sshoutcfg adduser [-a <public-key>] [-f] <user-name>
       sshoutcfg removeuser [-f] <user-name>
       sshoutcfg listuser [-h {md5|sha256}]
       sshoutcfg getmotd
       sshoutcfg setmotd [-m <message> | -d]

DESCRIPTION
       The sshoutcfg tool is used for SSHOUT server side configuring.

       This tool changes user information by altering .ssh/authorized_keys
       file in sshout user's home.

       This tool must be run under sshout user account or root (UID=0).


   Subcommands:
       adduser [-a <public-key>] [-f] <user-name>

           Add an new user with his/her public key to SSHOUT user list, or add
           another key for an existing user. The key string is the SSH2 public
           key, which is in form '<key-type> <base64-encoded-key>
           [<comment>]', or omit <key-type> and <comment>, just
           '<base64-encoded-key>'; see sshd(8) for more details on SSH2 public
           key format.

           Options:

           -a <key>
                  Specify the public key for user; if this option is not
                  specified, public key string will be read from stdin.

           -f     Force add key; add new key for existing user without ask.

       sshoutcfg removeuser [-f] <user-name>

           Remove user <user-name> and his/her all public keys from SSHOUT
           user list. If an user have multiple public keys registered in user
           list, and you want remove some of the user's keys, instead of all
           keys; don't use this command, edit the user list file
           .ssh/authorized_keys manually instead.

           Options:

           -f     Force remove user without ask.

       listuser [-h {md5|sha256}]

           List registered user names and publib keys. Doing this action also
           verifys the format of the authorized_keys file. Key fingerprints
           will be printed instead of original public keys, if option '-h' is
           used; the available hash algorithms used to hash public keys are
           md5 and sha256.

       getmotd

           Print current MOTD to stdout.

       setmotd [-m <message> | -d]

           Set a new MOTD, or delete the existing MOTD if option '-d' is
           specified.

           Options:

           -m <message>
                  Set MOTD to <message>; if this option is not specified,
                  stdin will be read to get the message.

           -d     Delete existing MOTD if any. This option cannot be used
                  together with '-m'.
