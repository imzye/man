NAME
       MogileFS::Network - Network awareness and extensions for
       MogileFS::Server

DESCRIPTION
       This collection of modules adds multiple network awareness to the
       MogileFS server. It provides two replication policies,
       'MultipleNetworks' and 'HostsPerNetwork'; and also provides a plugin
       'ZoneLocal' that causes get_paths queries to be returned in a
       prioritized order based on locality of storage.

       For information on configuring a location-aware installation of
       MogileFS please check out the MogileFS wiki.
