NAME
       Error::TypeTiny - exceptions for Type::Tiny and friends

SYNOPSIS
          use feature 'try';
          use Data::Dumper;
          use Types::Standard qw( Str );

          try {
             Str->assert_valid( undef );
          }
          catch ( $exception ) {
             warn "Encountered Error: $exception";
             warn Dumper( $exception->explain )
                if $exception->isa( "Error::TypeTiny::Assertion" );
          }

STATUS
       This module is covered by the Type-Tiny stability policy.

DESCRIPTION
       When Type::Tiny and its related modules encounter an error, they throw
       an exception object. These exception objects inherit from
       Error::TypeTiny.

   Constructors
       new(%attributes)
           Moose-style constructor function.

       throw(%attributes)
           Constructs an exception and passes it to "die".

           Automatically populates "context" and "stack_trace" if appropriate.

       "throw_cb($callback, %attributes)"
           Constructs an exception and passes it to $callback which should be
           a coderef; if undef, uses "die".

           Automatically populates "context" and "stack_trace" if appropriate.

   Attributes
       "message"
           The error message.

       "context"
           Hashref containing the package, file and line that generated the
           error.

       "stack_trace"
           A more complete stack trace. This feature requires
           Devel::StackTrace; use the $StackTrace package variable to switch
           it on.

   Methods
       "to_string"
           Returns the message, followed by the context if it is set.

   Functions
       "Error::TypeTiny::croak($format, @args)"
           Functional-style shortcut to "throw" method. Takes an
           "sprintf"-style format string and optional arguments to construct
           the "message".

   Overloading
       •   Stringification is overloaded to call "to_string".

   Package Variables
       %Carp::CarpInternal
           Error::TypeTiny honours this package variable from Carp.  (
           %Error::TypeTiny::CarpInternal is an alias for it.)

       $Error::TypeTiny::StackTrace
           Boolean to toggle stack trace generation.

       $Error::TypeTiny::LastError
           A reference to the last exception object thrown.

CAVEATS
       Although Error::TypeTiny objects are thrown for errors produced by
       Type::Tiny, that doesn't mean every time you use Type::Tiny you'll get
       Error::TypeTinys whenever you want.

       For example, if you use a Type::Tiny type constraint in a Moose
       attribute, Moose will not call the constraint's "assert_valid" method
       (which throws an exception). Instead it will call "check" and
       "get_message" (which do not), and will "confess" an error message of
       its own. (The $LastError package variable may save your bacon.)
