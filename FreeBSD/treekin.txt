DESCRIPTION
       treekin 0.5.1

       Compute biopolymer macrostate dynamics

       treekin computes a reduced dynamics of biopolymer folding by means of
       numeric integration of a Markov process that generally operates at the
       level of macrostates, i.e. basins of attraction of the underlying
       energy landscape.

       treekin expects a .bar file via stdin, and optionally a rates file in
       the current working directory. Both the .bar file and the rates file
       (default name is rates.out) can be obtained from barriers. In case of
       -m I option (default) the program needs just the rate file provided as
       standard input.

EXAMPLES
       Typically, computation of a reduced dynamics based on the analysis of
       folding landscapes requires two steps: Elucidation of the landscape
       (topology) and - based on that - calculation of the reduced dynamics.


       The first step involves computing the relevant properties of an energy
       landscape by barriers (see barriers(1) for details). The resulting
       .bar-file contains information on local minima, basins, saddle points
       as well as thermodynamic properties of the energy landscape.
       Additionally, the --rates option in the below example triggers barriers
       to generate another output file (rates.out) containing the transition
       rates between all pairs of macrostates (ie. basins of attraction),
       calculated by summing over the corresponding microscopic rates.


         $ barriers --saddle --bsize --rates < foo.sub > foo.bar


       In a second step, treekin is called with options to calculate the
       macrostate dynamics on the previously generated landscape by means of
       applying microscopic transition rates (option -m I):


         $ treekin --p0 2=1 < rates.out


       In this example, the simulation starts with 100% of the initial
       population in macrostate 2, i.e. the second lowest minimum in the
       barrier tree (option --p0 2=1).  The transition matrix is computed from
       a set of microscopic rates, read from a rates file (as computed by
       barriers).


       Generally, calculation of the macrostate dynamics by means of
       microscopic rates (option -m I) is consiberably more accurate than the
       simplified Arrhenius-like dynamics (option -m A).


       Looking at the default output produced by treekin, there are two
       sections: Overall status information on the computation (marked by hash
       signs at the beginning of the line) are printed at the top. Below, the
       actual data is printed for each time step in (n+1) space-separated
       columns, where n is the number of investigated (macro)states. The first
       column lists the current time, whereas all remaining columns correspond
       to the population probabilities of individual (macro)states.
