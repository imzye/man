NAME
       xin - split standard input and pipe into a command

SYNOPSIS
       xin [ -h | -v ]
       xin [ -b size | -l lines | -p size | -f code ] -e command [
       arguments...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       xin reads from standard input and splits the data up into sections,
       piping each section to a separate command.  If both -b and -l are used
       xin will split the section as soon as either limit is reached. A
       command will only be executed when there is data waiting to be written.

       If command exits or closes the pipe before the entire section is
       written an error will occur and xin will exit. There is no way of
       recovering from this situation without losing data since xin cannot
       know if the data has been read and processed - this is a limitation of
       pipes.

       A size may have a multiplier suffix: 'b' for 512, 'k' for 1024, and 'm'
       for 1024k.

OPTIONS
   -b, --bytes
       Limit each section to size bytes.

   -l, --lines
       Limit each section to lines lines.

   -p, --padding
       Zero extend any section of input written to command to a multiple of
       size bytes. This option can be used by itself for padding a data stream
       without splitting. The default is no padding.

   -f, --fatal-code
       When command exits with error code xin will exit with a fatal error.
       The default is 255.

   -e, --exec
       Use to denote the end of xin arguments and the beginning of command.

   -V, --version
       Display version and exit.

   -h, --help
       Display usage information and exit.
