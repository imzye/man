VIRTUAL_OSS(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         VIRTUAL_OSS(8)

NAME
     virtual_oss – daemon to multiplex and demultiplex an OSS device

SYNOPSIS
     virtual_oss [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     virtual_oss is an audio mixing application that multiplexes and
     demultiplexes a single OSS device into multiple customizable OSS
     compatible devices using character devices from userspace.  These devices
     can be used to record played back audio and mix the individual channels
     in multiple ways.

     virtual_oss requires the cuse(3) kernel module.  To load the driver as a
     module at boot time, place the following line in loader.conf(5):

            cuse_load="YES"

     All channel numbers start at zero.  Left channel is zero and right
     channel is one.

     The following options are available:

     -B      Run program in background.

     -S      Enable automatic DSP rate resampling.

     -Q quality
             Set resampling quality: 0=best, 1=medium and 2=fastest (default).

     -b bits
             Set sample depth to bits for the subsequent commands.  Valid
             values are 8, 16, 24 and 32.

     -r rate
             Set default sample-rate for the subsequent commands.

     -s value
             Set default buffer size to value.  If the argument is suffixed by
             "ms" it is interpreted as milliseconds.  Else the argument gives
             number of samples.  The buffer size specified is per channel.  If
             there are multiple channels, the total buffer size will be
             larger.

     -i priority
             Set real-time priority to priority.  Refer to rtprio(1) for more
             information.

     -a log2_amp
             Set the default DSP output and input device amplification to
             log2_amp.  The specified amplification is logarithmic.  Valid
             values range from -63 to 63 inclusivly.  The device input
             amplification gets set to minus log2_amp and the device output
             amplification gets set to log2_amp.

     -a i,log2_amp
             Set the default DSP input device amplification to log2_amp.  The
             specified amplification is logarithmic.  Valid values range from
             -63 to 63 inclusivly.

     -a o,log2_amp
             Set default DSP output device amplification to log2_amp.  The
             specified amplification is logarithmic.  Valid values range from
             -63 to 63 inclusivly.

     -p polarity
             Set default polarity of DSP device.  A value of zero means normal
             polarity.  A value of one means negative polarity.

     -e rx_mute,tx_mute
             Set default mute state of DSP device.  A value of zero means
             unmuted.  A value of one means muted.

     -m rx_ch,tx_ch,....
             Set default channel mapping of DSP device, as a comma separated
             list of integers.  The first integer selects the receive channel,
             the second value selects the transmit channel and then it
             repeats.  A value of zero indicates the first receive or transmit
             channel.

     -C num  Set the maximum number of mix channels to num.

     -c num  Set mix channels for the subsequent commands.

     -M type,src_ch,dst_ch,pol,mute,log2_gain
             Add a monitoring filter.  The filter consists of a list of comma
             separated arguments.  The first argument indicates the type of
             monitoring filter:

             i       Feedback one mix input channel into another mix output
                     channel, for remote feedback.

             o       Add one mix output channel into another mix output
                     channel, for creating a mix of multiple output channels.

             x       Feedback one mix output channel into another mix input
                     channel, for local feedback.
             The second argument gives the source mix channel.  The third
             argument gives the destination mix channel.  The fourth argument
             gives the polarity, default is zero.  The fifth argument gives
             the mute state, default is one or muted.  The sixth argument
             gives the amplitude, default is zero or no gain.

     -t devname
             Set control device name.

     -P devname
             Set playback DSP device only.  Specifying /dev/null is magic and
             means no playback device.  Specifying a sndio(7) device
             descriptor prefixed by "/dev/sndio/" is also magic, and will use
             a sndio backend rather than an OSS device.

     -O devname
             Set playback DSP device only which acts as a master device.  This
             option is used in conjunction with -R /dev/null .

     -R devname
             Set recording DSP device only.  Specifying /dev/null is magic and
             means no recording device.

     -f devname
             Set both playback and recording DSP device

     -w name
             Create a WAV file format compatible companion device by given
             name.  This option should be specified before the -d and -l
             options.

     -d name
             Create an OSS device by given name.

     -l name
             Create a loopback OSS device by given name.

     -L name
             Create a loopback OSS device which acts as a master device.  This
             option is used in conjunction with -f /dev/null .

     -F size
             Set receive filter size in number of samples or <milliseconds>ms
             for the next device to be created.

     -G size
             Set transmit filter size in number of samples or <milliseconds>ms
             for the next device to be created.

     -D file
             Write process ID of virtual_oss to file.

     -g knee,attack,decay
             Enable device compressor in receive direction.  See description
             of -x option.

     -x knee,attack,decay
             Enable output compressor and set knee, attack and decay.  Knee is
             in the range 0..255, while attack and decay are between 0 and 62.
             Samples having an absolute value lower than the knee are
             transmitted unchanged.  Sample values over the knee are lowered
             "a little bit".  You can think about attack and decay as a
             measure of how fast or slow the gain of the compressor will work.
             It is advised that attack is low, so it reacts fast once too high
             sample values appear.  It is also advised that the decay value is
             higher than the attack value so that the gain reduction is
             gradually removed.  The reasoning behind this is that the
             compressor should react almost immediately when high volume
             signals arrive to protect the hardware, but it slowly changes
             gain when there are no loud signals to avoid distorting the
             signal.  The default values are 85,3,20 .

     -E enable_recording
             If the value passed is non-zero, recording is enabled.  Else
             recording is disabled.  This can be used to synchronize multiple
             recording streams.

     -h      Show usage and all available options.

     All character devices are created using the 0666 mode which gives
     everyone in the system access.
