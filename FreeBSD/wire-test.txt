WIRE-TEST(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           WIRE-TEST(8)

NAME
     wire-test – test your network interfaces and local IP address

SYNOPSIS
     wire-test [host]

DESCRIPTION
     This command is obsolete.  Users are advised to use autofs(5) instead.

     The wire-test utility is used to find out what amd(8) thinks are the
     first two network interfaces and network names/numbers used, as well as
     the IP address used for amd(8) to NFS-mount itself.

     If host is specified, then wire-test will test for the working
     combinations of NFS protocol and version from the current client to the
     NFS server host.  If not specified, host defaults to “localhost”.
