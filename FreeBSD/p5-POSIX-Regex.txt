NAME
       POSIX::Regex - OO interface for the gnu regex engine

SYNOPSIS
           use POSIX::Regex qw(:all);

           my $reg = new POSIX::Regex('a\(a\|b\)\(c\)');

           print "You win a toy!\n" if $reg->match("aac");

           if( my @m = $reg->match("abc") ) { # returns the matches
               print "entire match: ", shift @m, "\n";
               print "\tgroup match: $_\n" for @m;

           } else {
               print "No toy for you!\n";
           }

REGULAR OPTIONS
       (All of the following text was plagarized without edit from 'man 3
       regex'.)

       If you choose to import :all then you will have the following regular
       options that you may optionally pass to new() (aka regcomp).

   REG_ICASE
       Do  not differentiate case.  Subsequent regexec() searches using this
       pattern buffer will be case insen- sitive.

   REG_EXTENDED
       Use POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax when interpreting regex.
       If not set, POSIX  Basic  Regular Expression syntax is used.

   REG_NEWLINE
       Match-any-character operators don't match a newline.

       A non-matching list ([^...])  not containing a newline does not match a
       newline.

       Match-beginning-of-line operator (^) matches the empty string
       immediately after a newline, regardless of whether eflags, the
       execution flags of regexec(), contains REG_NOTBOL.

       Match-end-of-line operator ($) matches the empty string immediately
       before  a newline,  regardless  of whether eflags contains REG_NOTEOL.

   REG_NOTBOL
       The match-beginning-of-line operator always fails to match  (but see
       the compilation  flag  REG_NEWLINE above) This flag may be used when
       different portions of a string are passed to regexec() and the
       beginning of the string should not be interpreted as the beginning of
       the line.

   REG_NOTEOL

       I am using this software in my own projects...  If you find bugs,
       please please please let me know. :) Actually, let me know if you find
       it handy at all.  Half the fun of releasing this stuff is knowing that
       people use it.

FAQ
       Yes, I'm aware there's special support for alternate regular expression
       systems in perl 5.10.x ... let me know when people are done with perl
       5.6 and 5.8 and I'll delete this from CPAN.  Thanks.
