DESCRIPTION
       NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE

       This module has been deprecated by the Gtk-Perl project.  This means
       that the module will no longer be updated with security patches, bug
       fixes, or when changes are made in the Perl ABI.  The Git repo for this
       module has been archived (made read-only), it will no longer possible
       to submit new commits to it.  You are more than welcome to ask about
       this module on the Gtk-Perl mailing list, but our priorities going
       forward will be maintaining Gtk-Perl modules that are supported and
       maintained upstream; this module is neither.

       Since this module is licensed under the LGPL v2.1, you may also fork
       this module, if you wish, but you will need to use a different name for
       it on CPAN, and the Gtk-Perl team requests that you use your own
       resources (mailing list, Git repos, bug trackers, etc.) to maintain
       your fork going forward.

           Gtk2::TextBuffer or undef if there isn't one attached.

       $spell->detach
