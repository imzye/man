FSTYP(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               FSTYP(8)

NAME
       fstyp - identify file systems

SYNOPSIS
       fstyp device

       fstyp [-hV]

DESCRIPTION
       The fstyp command tries to guess the filesystem type of a device and
       outputs its findings.

       If a filesystem can be successfully identified, its name is printed and
       0 returned.

       If no known superblocks can be found, fstyp prints an empty string and
       returns a non-zero value.

       fstyp is often used in backup scripts to pick dump and restore commands
       appropriate for the filesystem type.

       Since fstyp relies on heuristics to identify the filesystem, there is
       no guarantee for correct results.

       The detection algorithm used in fstyp is the same as in the mount(8)
       command.


OPTIONS
       -V     Print version and exit.

       -h     Print help message and exit.
