DESCRIPTION
       Tux Paint Configuration Tool (tuxpaint-config) is a graphical
       configuration program for Tux Paint, a drawing program for young
       children.  It can be used to create a configuration file for Tux Paint,
       rather than doing it manually by editing the configuration file in a
       text edtior.


OPTIONS - INFORMATIONAL
       --help  Display short, helpful information about Tux Paint.

       --version
               Output the version info.

       --usage Display a list of all commandline options.

       --copying
               Show the license (GNU GPL) under which Tux Paint is released.


OPTIONS - LANGUAGE
       Much like Tux Paint itself, Tux Paint Configuration Tool has been
       translated into numerous languages.  tuxpaint-config will try its best
       to honor your locale setting (i.e., the LANG environment variable), if
       possible.


ENVIRONMENT
       HOME    to determine where the user's configuration file is.


       LANG    to determine langauge to use, if setlocale(3) refers to
               'LC_MESSAGES'.


       TPC_SIZE
               set to "small" to cause Tux Paint Config. to run in a smaller
               window, or "large" to run in a larger window. Overrides screen
               resolution and DPI detection which causes Tux Paint Config. to
               open a larger window and use larger fonts on modern high-pixel-
               density displays (added in version 0.0.18).


FILES
       /etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf
               System-wide configuration file.

               (Created during installation.)

       $HOME/.tuxpaintrc
               User's configuration file.  It can be used to set default
               options (rather than setting them on the command-line every
               time), and/or to override any settings in the system-wide
               configuration file.
