DESCRIPTION
       Audiotool is used to copy, manipulate, and examine the contents of
       audio files.  These audio files may be raw headerless audio data or
       audio stored in common data files such as .wav or .au files.  In the
       near future audiotool will also support packetized audio files such as
       .mp3 and .ogg.

       -append
              appends the content of other audio files into an existing audio
              file.  The offset to save within the existing file may be
              specified.  If nessisary the content of the specified files will
              be re-encoded in the codec of the file being appended to.

       -build Build a brand new audio file from scratch and then copy content
              from existing audio files into it.  The encoding of the new
              audio file will either be based on the file extension, the audio
              file that is being copied into it, or by specifying the encoding
              format directly.

       -chart This is used to generate an energy chart profile of the audio
              file frame by frame.  A * indicates solid audio content, a ^
              indicates what might be a lead or trailer section of partial
              content, and a . indicates relative silence.  Soon a autotrim
              option will be added to audiotool to remove silent frames.

       -codecs
              List all active codec objects.  If you have plugins which are
              loaded that creates codec objects which match a built-in codec,
              the plugin will be selected first.

       -info  The info command gives you basic information on the audio file,
              including what format it is stored as, what codec the audio data
              is encoded in, how much data is in the file, what the bit rate
              used is, etc.

       -notation
              Notation can be used to either set or display the annotation
              stored in audio files which support annotations, such as .au and
              .wav files.

       -play  Plays the content of the audio file to the default system audio
              device (soundcard).  Play is supported on w32 and posix systems
              that support oss audio.  Future work will expand to additional
              platforms.

       -plugins
              This simply returns the path to the plugins directory.  All
              plugins are loaded with Audio::init().  Plugins are not
              supported when building with static linkage.

       -strip Strips out all silent frames from an audio file.  Silent frames
              are those which fall below a threashold and that have no peak
              impulse above the threashold.

       -trim  Removes leading and trailing "silence" from a file.  The
              -padding option may be used to add additional silent frames at
              the end of the file after it has been trimed, as this may be
              needed for files that will later be used to join together
              phrases.

BUGS
       At this time audiotool does not perform and ccaudio does not support
       sample rate conversion.  Appending and building from files which are
       encoded at different sample rates could have ammusing results.
