NAME
       xwrits - reminds you to take wrist breaks

SYNOPSIS
       xwrits [-display display] [typetime=time] [breaktime=time] [other
       options]

DESCRIPTION
       Xwrits reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention or management of
       repetitive stress injuries. When you should take a break, it pops up an
       X window, the warning window. You click on the warning window, then
       take a break. The window changes appearance while you take the break.
       It changes again when your break is over. Then you just resume typing.
       Xwrits hides itself until you should take another break.

       The typetime option changes the amount of time between breaks, and the
       breaktime option changes the length of a break. The defaults are 55
       minutes and 5 minutes, respectively.

       Xwrits's graphics are brightly colored pictures of a wrist and hand.
       The hand clenches and spreads ``as if in pain'' on the warning window,
       slumps relaxed during the break, and points forward valiantly when the
       break is over. It is trapped behind bars while the keyboard is locked.
       Other gestures are included (see the +finger option). You can also use
       your own pictures: see the warning-picture, rest-picture, and ready-
       picture options.

       Normally, xwrits works through annoyance -- it flashes until you stop
       typing. However, an option makes it actively prevent you from typing by
       locking the screen. See +lock below.

       Xwrits notices when you leave your workstation idle, and treats a long
       idle period as if you took a break. You can turn this off with the
       -idle option. With the +mouse option, it will also monitor your mouse
       movements -- you won't be able to move the mouse during a break without
       aborting the break.

       Each wrist break normally lasts the same amount of time. This is what
       doctors suggest, but, if you'd like, the +quota option will reward you
       for taking small breaks by reducing the length of the next official
       break.

       Some doctors recommend taking a short ``microbreak'' every five
       minutes, as well as a longer break every hour. To use xwrits this way,
       just run two xwrits processes, one for the microbreaks and one for the
       longer breaks.

ESCALATION
       It is easy to put the warning window aside ``for 5 minutes'' and ignore
       it for fifty. The after=delay option causes xwrits to escalate its
       activity over time, making it harder to ignore.

       Options following after come into effect after you have ignored the
       warning window for delay. In other words, xwrits's behavior escalates
       after delay. For instance, with this command line,
            xwrits flashtime=:2 after=10 flashtime=:.03
       the warning window will begin flashing very quickly if it is ignored
       for 10 minutes.

       Any options preceding an after option also apply following it, unless
       you explicitly cancel them. For example:
            xwrits +finger after=10 -finger

       Multiple after options create a series of escalations. Delay arguments
       are cumulative, so ``after=10 after=10'' means the same as
       ``after=20''.

       One interesting use for after is to make a break's length depend on how
       long you waited to take it. For example:
            xwrits break=5 after=10 break=7
       Here, a wrist break normally takes 5 minutes. However, if you ignore
       the warning window for 10 minutes or more before taking a break, the
       wrist break will last 7 minutes.

OPTIONS
       All options may be abbreviated to their unique prefixes. Some may be
       abbreviated further, in which case the smallest legal abbreviation is
       shown in brackets. Options are processed from left to right.

       Options listed as ``+option (-option)'' are toggles, which can be on or
       off. A + turns the option on; - turns it off. Off is the default for
       most toggle options, and only the on behavior is described. You can
       leave off the + sign if you like: ``xwrits +finger'' and ``xwrits
       finger'' are equivalent. Or you can say ``-no-finger'' instead of
       ``-finger''.

       Many options take arguments. You can give these after an equal sign, as
       in ``xwrits breaktime=2''. Non-optional arguments can also be given
       separately, as in ``xwrits breaktime 2''.

       Time arguments are expressed in minutes. For example, ``2'' is 2
       minutes, ``2.5'' is 2 minutes 30 seconds. Use a colon to specify
       seconds: ``2:05.4'' is 2 minutes 5.4 seconds, and ``:5'' is 5 seconds.


       -display display
            Specify the X display. Xwrits monitors this display for keystrokes
            and mouse movements, and displays windows on it. You can
            simultaneously monitor more than one display by giving this option
            multiple times; for example, ``xwrits display :0.0 display fun-
            orgy:0.0''.

       +multiscreen (-multiscreen)
            When this option is on, xwrits will open every available screen on
            each specified display.  Useful for multihead displays.

       typetime=time [t]
            Allow typing for time between breaks. Default is 55 minutes.

       breaktime=time [b]
            The amount of time a break lasts. Default is 5 minutes. This
            option can be supplied multiple times; see ESCALATION above.

       after=delay-time
            See ESCALATION above.

       bars-picture=file [bp=file]
            Sets the background GIF image that appears while the screen is
            locked. By default, this is an image of bars designed to work with
            the usual lock-picture. If you specify your own lock-picture,
            however, bars-picture defaults to a black screen. (Say ``bars-
            picture="&bars"'' to keep the bars.) Animations are not
            acceptable.

       +beep (-beep)
            Xwrits will beep when the break should begin and again when it is
            over.

       +breakclock (-breakclock) [bc]
            A clock will appear in the resting window showing how many minutes
            remain in the wrist break.

       canceltime=time [ct]
            Allow typing for time after a break is cancelled. You cancel a
            break by deleting all xwrits windows with your window manager.
            This time should probably be less than the regular type time.
            Default is 10 minutes.

       +cheat[=num] (-cheat)
            Allows you to cheat during a break. You can type num keystrokes
            before xwrits cancels the break. Default for num is 5. (If you're
            using +mouse, mouse movements also count as keystrokes.)

       +clock (-clock) [c]
            A clock will appear in the warning window showing how many minutes
            you've put off the wrist break.

       +finger (-finger) [f]
            The warning window will be rude to you.

       +finger=culture
            The warning window will be rude to you, according to culture's
            idea of rudeness. Possible values for culture are `american' (the
            default), `korean' (synonyms `japanese' and `russian'), `german',
            or the name of any GIF image file.

       flashtime=time
            The amount of time between flashes of the warning window. Default
            is 2 seconds.

       +flipoff (-flipoff)
            Synonym for +finger.

       +iconified (-iconified)
            The warning window will initially appear as an icon.

       +idle[=idletime] (-idle) [i]
            If you leave your workstation idle for idletime or longer, xwrits
            will behave as if you took a break. The default for idletime is
            the break length (see breaktime above). idle is on by default.

       +lock[=jump-time] (-lock)
            Xwrits will lock your screen until your break is over. You can
            prematurely disable the lock and get a normal warning window by
            typing your password (see password below). The jump-time argument
            specifies how fast the screensaver will move; default is 4
            seconds. If the keyboard has been grabbed by another application
            when the lock is attempted, the lock fails and a normal warning
            window appears instead.

       lock-picture=file [lp=file]
            Sets the GIF image that appears while the screen is locked.
            Animations are acceptable. See also bars-picture.

       maxhands=num
            No more than num warning windows will appear on your screen
            simultaneously. Normally, there will be only one warning window,
            but see +multiply below. Num cannot be less than 1, or more than
            137. Default is 25.

       minbreaktime=time
            Sets the minimum break length to time. This option is meaningful
            when +quota is on (see below); no matter how many short breaks you
            take, the break length will not be shortened below time. It
            defaults to half the break time or the quota time, whichever is
            larger.

       mono (-mono)
            Xwrits will display its graphics in black and white. This may be
            useful if you live in a world with a limited colormap.

       +mouse[=sensitivity] (-mouse)
            Xwrits will monitor your mouse movements. Every couple seconds, it
            checks whether the mouse has moved. Movements of more than
            sensitivity pixels in any direction are treated like key presses.
            Default for sensitivity is 15 pixels.

       +multiply[=breed-time] (-multiply) [m]
            A new warning window will be created every breed-time. Default for
            breed-time is 2.3 seconds.

       +noiconify (-noiconify)
            The warning window will not allow itself to be iconified.

       +once[=count]
            Put up the warning window once, or (with count) count times, then
            exit.

       password=password
            The password you type to unlock a locked screen (see +lock above).
            Xwrits does not protect this password from intruders.  Therefore,
            do not use your login password or any other password you must keep
            secure. Default is ``quit''.

       +quota[=time] (-quota)
            If you leave your workstation idle for more than time, the idle
            time is deducted from the length of your next break. This option
            turns the break length into a break quota -- instead of resting
            for breaktime consecutive minutes every typetime, you must rest
            for a total of breaktime minutes per typetime. Default for time is
            1 minute. See also minbreaktime.

       ready-picture=file [okp=file]
            Sets the image that appears when your break is over to an
            arbitrary GIF.  Animations are acceptable.

       rest-picture=file [rp=file]
            Sets the image that appears during your break to an arbitrary GIF.
            Animations are acceptable.

       title=text
            Xwrits windows will have text for their title, instead of the
            default ``xwrits''.

       +top (-top)
            The warning window will try to keep itself above all other windows
            on the desktop. (Note: it can be fooled into staying only
            partially visible.)

       +verbose (-verbose)
            Xwrits will print a lot of information about the windows on which
            it is listening for keystrokes. This is mostly useful for
            debugging.

       version
            Prints the version number and some quickie warranty information
            and exits.

       warning-picture=file [wp=file]
            Sets the image that appears on the warning window to an arbitrary
            GIF.  Animations are acceptable.

EXAMPLES
       Here is the way I run xwrits:
            xwrits typetime=40 finger after 15 clock multiply=5:1.4
       This looks pretty spectacular:
            xwrits t=0 b=:2 f fla=:.5 m=:.31 max=100 -i
       Whee!!

BUGS
       Xwrits does not use the X resource database at all.

       More options might be nice. So might more careful screen locking and
       password protection. I would like to include rude finger gestures from
       other cultures (see the GESTURES file in the distribution for gestures
       I know about so far).

       Please send any bugs, comments, or suggestions to me.

       Yes the misspelling is intentional.

       Yes it's my left wrist.
