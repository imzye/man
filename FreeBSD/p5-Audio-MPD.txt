NAME
       mpd-dump-ratings - dump mpd ratings & filter them

VERSION
       version 2.004

DESCRIPTION
       Dumps the mpd ratings associated to songs. Each filename will be dumped
       on a line with a prefix "rating: ". One can filter out the filenames
       dumped with some options.

NAME
       mpd-dump-ratings - dump mpd ratings

USAGE
           mpd-dump-ratings [options]

OPTIONS
       -m[in[imum]] [=] <min>
           Minimum rating for a song to be displayed. Default to 0.

       -o[rphan[ed]]
           Print only orphan pathes (ie, with no matching filename).

       -r[epair]
           Try to fix the database for orphan pathes (ie, doesn't work if
           "-orphan" is not supplied). Existing fixes performed:

           try to convert orphan path to utf8.

           If one of those fix leads to a valid path, it will try to fix
           database.  Of course, it checks if this leads to duplicate values.

       -d[elete]
           If "-repair" did not manage to find a plausible replacement for the
           orphan rating, then it will remove this rating from the database.
           This can be the case when you removed a song...

           Warning: you will potentially loose some information!

       <pattern>
           Filter out songs that don't match given "pattern".
