DNSKEY(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              DNSKEY(1)

NAME
     dnskey – generate DNSSEC DNSKEY record

SYNOPSIS
     dnskey [-k] [-t ttl] [-c class] domain keyfile

DESCRIPTION
     dnskey writes a DNSSEC DNSKEY record to standard output.

     The record is generated with the name domain and public key given by
     keyfile.

     A DNSKEY record contains a public key that can be used to verify the
     signatures of the records in a zone.  If the Secure Entry Point (SEP)
     flag is set, the key may be used to verify signatures of the DNSKEY
     RRset.  Otherwise, it may only be used to verify the signatures of other
     record types.

OPTIONS
     -k      Set the Secure Entry Point (SEP) flag.

     -a      The signature algorithm to use with the key.  This option can be
             used to disambiguate the hash used with RSA keys.  The following
             algorithms are supported:
             •   RSASHA1
             •   RSASHA256 (default for RSA keys)
             •   RSASHA512
             •   ECDSAP256SHA256
             •   ECDSAP384SHA384

     -t      The TTL value of the record.  If not specified, the TTL is
             omitted.

     -c      The record class.  Defaults to IN.

EXAMPLES
     Generate a DNSKEY record with the SEP flag set for the key in key.pem.

           $ dnskey -k example.com. key.pem
           example.com.    IN      DNSKEY  257 3 13 vj2jYoUXYP5L/Y3VKwy2tv1lTQKvieaDdg2DpZRItJ0TblzoKoJ+9WQgxi4/mq0JkFUFeltRmhPnhtXoCH7Tfw==
