ADS111x(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             ADS111x(4)

NAME
     ads111x – driver for ADS101x and ADS111x i2c analog to digital converters

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ads111x

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ads111x_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ads111x driver provides support for the ADS101x/ADS111x family of
     analog to digital converter (ADC) devices.  The supported devices are all
     similar to each other, varying in features such as resolution and number
     of input channels.  The devices offer a number of configuration options
     which can be set via hints, FDT data, and sysctl(8).

     Sysctl(8) provides access to the voltage measurements made by the device.
     Each time the dev.ads111x.<unit>.<channel>.voltage variable is accessed
     for a given channel, the driver switches the chip's internal mux to
     choose the right input pins for that channel, directs it to make a single
     measurement, and returns the measured value in microvolts.  The amount of
     time required to make the measurement is a function of the sampling rate
     configured for the device.  While device is directed to make a single
     measurement, it still averages the input values for the same amount of
     time as it would to emit one sample if it were in continuous mode.  For
     example, if the sample rate were configured as 125 samples per second, a
     single measurement would require 8 milliseconds.

     For devices that support multiple input pins, the device datasheet
     describes mux settings to control how those pins are interpeted when
     making either single-ended or differential measurements.  There are eight
     possible ways to combine the inputs from the four pins.  The ads111x
     driver models that by creating a separate output channel for each of the
     eight combinations.  To make a measurement on a given pin or pair of
     pins, you simply access the voltage variable for the channel number that
     corresponds the mux setting number (0 through 7) shown in the datasheet.
     When the driver is configured with hints or FDT data, it creates sysctl
     variables for just the channels specified in the config data.  When there
     is no channel config data, it creates all eight possible channels so that
     you can access whichever one(s) you need.

     For devices that include an alert output pin, the ads111x driver does not
     directly support the pin in terms of sensing or acting on changes in the
     pin state.  However, you may connect the pin to a gpio input or fan
     controller or other external device, and use the driver's sysctl
     variables to configure behavior and threshold values for the pin.  The
     driver avoids perturbing your settings as it does other manipulations to
     the config register.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     Sysctl variables are used to access the voltage measurements, and to
     change the configuration of the channels.  All writeable variables may
     also be set as loader(8) tunables.  Channel numbers in these sysctl
     variables range from 0 through 7.

     dev.ads111x.<unit>.config
             Provides access to the configuration register bits that control
             the alert pin configuration.  Other bits which are controlled by
             the driver are masked out, and cannot be viewed or changed using
             this variable.

     dev.ads111x.<unit>.lo_thresh
             Sets the low threshold for activating the alert pin.

     dev.ads111x.<unit>.hi_thresh
             Sets the high threshold for activating the alert pin.

     dev.ads111x.<unit>.<channel>.rate_index
             Sets the sample rate for the channel.  The device datasheet
             documents eight available sample rates, chosen by setting a value
             of 0 through 7 into the corresponding control register bits.
             This variable sets the value used for those bits when making a
             measurement on the given channel.

             Because measurements are always made in single-shot mode, think
             of this variable as controlling the averaging time for a single
             sample; the time to make a measurement is 1 / samplerate.

     dev.ads111x.<unit>.<channel>.gain_index
             Sets the programmable gain amplifier for the channel on devices
             which have an internal amplifier.  The device datasheet documents
             eight available gain values, chosen by setting a value of 0
             through 7 into the corresponding control register bits.  This
             variable sets the value used for those bits when making a
             measurement on the given channel.

     dev.ads111x.<unit>.<channel>.voltage
             Reading this variable causes the device to make a measurement on
             the corresponding input pin(s) and return the voltage in
             microvolts.

             Note that this variable does not appear when you list multiple
             sysctl variables -- you must access it specifically by name,
             because accessing it triggers device I/O.

HARDWARE
     The ads111x driver provides support for the following devices:

           ADS1013     ADS1113
           ADS1014     ADS1114
           ADS1015     ADS1115

FDT CONFIGURATION
     On an fdt(4) based system, the ads111x device is defined as a slave
     device subnode of the i2c bus controller node.  All properties documented
     in the ads1015.txt bindings document can be used with the ads111x device.

     The following properties are required in the ads111x device subnode:

     compatible
             One of the following:
                   “ti,ads1013”      “ti,ads1113”
                   “ti,ads1014”      “ti,ads1114”
                   “ti,ads1015”      “ti,ads1115”

     reg     I2c slave address of device.

     Specific channels can be configured by adding child nodes to the ads111x
     node, as described in the standard ads1015.txt bindings document.  If no
     channels are configured, sysctl variables will be created for all
     possible channels supported by the device type, otherwise only the
     specified channels are created.

   Example including channel configuration
           adc@48 {
               compatible = "ti,ads1115";
               reg = <0x48>;
               status = "okay";
               #address-cells = <1>;
               #size-cells = <0>;

               channel@6 {
                   reg = <6>;
                   ti,gain = <3>;
                   ti,datarate = <4>;
               };
               channel@7 {
                   reg = <7>;
                   ti,gain = <1>;
                   ti,datarate = <7>;
               };
           };

HINTS CONFIGURATION
     On a device.hints(5) based system, such as MIPS, these values are
     configurable for ads111x:

     hint.ads111x.<unit>.at
             The iicbus instance the ads111x instance is attached to.

     hint.ads111x.<unit>.<channel>.gain_index
             The amplifier gain, as described above for the sysctl variable
             dev.ads111x.<unit>.<channel>.gain_index.

     hint.ads111x.<unit>.<channel>.rate_index
             The sample rate, as described above for the sysctl variable
             dev.ads111x.<unit>.<channel>.rate_index.

     If no channels are configured, sysctl variables will be created for all
     possible channels supported by the device type, otherwise only the
     specified channels are created.
