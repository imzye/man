NAME
       img-bmp - Img, Windows Bitmap Format (bmp)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::bmp ?1.4?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

______________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       package require img::bmp.

       Like all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so that it supports files containing
       raster images in the Windows Bitmap Format (bmp). More specifically
       img::bmp extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is bmp.

       The package img::bmp is a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img, or on its
       own, via package require img::bmp.

       This handler provides new additional configuration options. See section
       BMP OPTIONS for more detailed explanations.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

       [1]    Image data in bmp format (options -data and -file) is detected
              automatically.

       [2]    The format name bmp is recognized by the option -format.  In
              addition the value for the option is treated as list and may
              contain any of the special options listed in section BMP
              OPTIONS.

BMP OPTIONS
       The handler provides the following options:

       -resolution res
              The display resulation and/or aspect ratio property of the
              outputted bmp file may be set using this option.  The default
              values are an x and y resolution of 74 dpi.  res is a list of 2
              or 3 elements and may have one of the following formats.  The
              values xres, yres and unit are specified after the formats.

              res = xres unit
                     Set the same resolution for x and y.  Example: Write
                     image with a resolution of 300dpi:


                     img write out.bmp -format {bmp -resolution {300 i}}


              res = xres yres
                     Set the aspect ratio only.  The x resolution remains to
                     the default value 74dpi, as the bmp format does not allow
                     to specify the aspect ratio only. The y resolution is set
                     to 74*yres/xres.  Example: Write image with an aspect
                     ratio of 1/3:


                     img write out.bmp -format {bmp -resolution {1 3}}


              res = xres yres unit
                     Set an independent resolution for x and y direction.
                     Example: Write image with a resolution of x=300dpi and
                     y=150dpi:


                     img write out.bmp -format {bmp -resolution {300 100 i}}


              The used parameters are:

              float xres (input)
                     The output resolution in x direction as a float number.

              float yres (input)
                     The output resolution in x direction as a float number.

              string unit (input)
                     Unit of the given resolution numbers similar to
                     Tk_GetPixel.  Possible units are:

                     c      pixel per centimeter.

                     m      pixel per meter.

                     i      pixel per inch.

                     p      pixel per inch/72 (Printer points).
