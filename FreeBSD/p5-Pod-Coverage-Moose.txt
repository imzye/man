Pod::Coverage::Moose(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Pod::Coverage::Moose - Pod::Coverage extension for Moose

VERSION
       version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
         use Pod::Coverage::Moose;

         my $pcm = Pod::Coverage::Moose->new(package => 'MoosePackage');
         print 'Coverage: ', $pcm->coverage, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       When using Pod::Coverage in combination with Moose, it will report any
       method imported from a role. This is especially bad when used in
       combination with Test::Pod::Coverage, since it takes away its ease of
       use.

       To use this module in combination with Test::Pod::Coverage, use
       something like this:

         use Test::Pod::Coverage;
         all_pod_coverage_ok({ coverage_class => 'Pod::Coverage::Moose'});

ATTRIBUTES
   package
       This is the package used for inspection.

   cover_requires
       Boolean flag to indicate that "requires $method" declarations in a Role
       should be trusted.

METHODS
   meta
       Moose meta object.

   BUILD
       Initialises the internal Pod::Coverage object. It uses the meta object
       to find all methods and attribute methods imported via roles.

DELEGATED METHODS
       Delegated to the traditional Pod::Coverage object are:

   coverage
   covered
   naked
   uncovered
   why_unrated

EXTENDED METHODS
   new
       The constructor will only return a "Pod::Coverage::Moose" object if it
       is invoked on a class that "can" a "meta" method. Otherwise, a
       traditional Pod::Coverage object will be returned. This is done so you
       don't get in trouble for mixing Moose with non Moose classes in your
       project.
