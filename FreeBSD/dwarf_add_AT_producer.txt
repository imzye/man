NAME
     dwarf_add_AT_producer – create and attach a DW_AT_producer attribute

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     Dwarf_P_Attribute
     dwarf_add_AT_producer(Dwarf_P_Die die, char *producer, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_add_AT_producer() creates a DW_AT_producer attribute
     descriptor and attaches it to the debugging information entry referenced
     by argument die.  The created attribute will have DWARF form
     DW_FORM_strp.

     Argument die should reference a debugging information entry allocated
     using dwarf_new_die(3).

     Argument producer should point to a NUL-terminated string which will
     become the value of the created attribute.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to store error information
     in case of an error.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, function dwarf_add_AT_producer() returns the created
     attribute descriptor.  In case of an error, function
     dwarf_add_AT_producer() returns DW_DLV_BADADDR and sets the argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_add_AT_producer() can fail with:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Either of the arguments die or producer was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_MEMORY]         An out of memory condition was encountered during
                             the execution of the function.
