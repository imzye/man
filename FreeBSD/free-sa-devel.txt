NAME
       free-sa - statistic analyzer

SYNOPSIS
       free-sa [-s|-r|-F|-h|-v|-V] [-d STARTDATE-ENDDATE | PERIODWORD] [-e
                ADDRESS] [-f FILE] [-l FILE] [-o DIRECTORY] [-n NAME]

DESCRIPTION
       Free-SA is tool that is used for statistic analysis of daemons log
       files.

   Program objectives:
       •      Control of users traffic usage;
       •      Help for security engineers to control internet access security
              policies and investigate security incidents;
       •      Evaluate server efficiency to detect troubles with
              configuration;
       •      Be crossplatform and generate W3C compliant reports.

   Supported log formats:
       •      Squid 2.x native log format;
       •      CERN/NCSA Common Log Format (CLF);
       •      CERN/NCSA Combined Log Format (in similar to CLF way);
       •      Postfix 2.x over syslog log format (EXPERIMENTAL);
       •      Qmail over syslog log format (EXPERIMENTAL);
       •      NetCache via Squid 2.x native log format (EXPERIMENTAL);
       •      Blue Coat via Squid 2.x native log format (EXPERIMENTAL);
       •      Communigate pro 5.x native log format (VERY EXPERIMENTAL).

OPTIONS
       free-sa accepts the following options (you should not use more than one
       action option at the same time, silent default action is to generate
       reports):

       -d STARTDATE-ENDDATE | PERIODWORD
              Set period by dates range in free-sa runtime locale for reports
              generation or remove records from log file (check '-r' option).
              You may omit STARTDATE or ENDDATE, but not both of them. Sign
              '-' is always required. You may also use next words as
              PERIODWORD: hour, day, week, month, quarter, year, today,
              yesterday, thisweek, lastweek, thismonth, lastmonth, thisyear,
              lastyear.

       -e ADDRESS
              Send top users report in text format to e-mail ADDRESS, if
              ADDRESS is '-' then report is writed to stdout.

       -f FILE
              Set file to read configuration from.

       -F     Fix root index.html file according to reports directories
              presense. This option also implies rotate action. Useful after
              removing reports directories with 3rd party tools like rm(1)
              (this changes action).

       -h     Show help message.

       -l FILE
              Overwrite 'log' option from free-sa configuration file, check
              free-sa.conf(5).

       -n NAME
              Overwrite 'name' option from free-sa configuration file, check
              free-sa.conf(5).

       -o DIRECTORY
              Overwrite 'targetdir' option from free-sa configuration file,
              check free-sa.conf(5).

       -s     Show log file information: name, size, start and end dates (this
              changes action).

       -r     Remove records from log file. You must also set period to remove
              with '-d' option (this changes action).

       -v     Show version.

       -V     Show advanced information about current free-sa build.

EXAMPLES
       1.  Generate report for full log file period using non-default
       configuration file /usr/local/etc/free-sa/free-sa2.conf:

       $ free-sa -f /usr/local/etc/free-sa/free-sa2.conf

       2.  Generate report for full log file period of 30 days (month) ending
       at current date:

       $ free-sa -d month

       3.  Generate report for full log file period ending at 12/21/06 (C or
       POSIX runtime locale):

       $ free-sa -d -12/21/06

       4.  Generate report for full log file period starting at 21.12.2006
       (ru_RU or de_DE runtime locale):

       $ free-sa -d 21.12.2006-

       5.  Show useful log file information (ru_RU runtime locale):

       $ free-sa -s
       Log file information:
       File name:              /var/log/squid/access.log
       File size:              55.053.777
