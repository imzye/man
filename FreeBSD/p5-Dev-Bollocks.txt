NAME
       Dev::Bollocks - Arbitrary sized bollocks straight from middle
       management

SYNOPSIS
           use Dev::Bollocks;

           print Dev::Bollocks->new(),"\n";    # create first bollox
           print Dev::Bollocks->rand(),"\n";   # create random bollox
           print Dev::Bollocks::rand(3),"\n";  # create random bollox w/ 3 words

           $x = Dev::Bollocks->rand(),"\n";    # create some random bollox
           for ($i = 0; $i ++; $i < 10)
             {
             print "$x\n"; $x++;               # next bollox
             }

REQUIRES

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements /dev/bollocks, which generates management
       bullshit whenever you need it.

       Of course, to follow the spirit outlined in
       <http://www.fatsquirrel.org/veghead/software/bollocks/> this module
       doesn't simple do a "head /dev/bollocks", that would be too easy, too
       fast and non-portable. And bullshit is universilly portable.

       Thus the module makes a subclass of Math::String and changes the
       default charset to a charset that somewhat emulates and extends the
       original /dev/bollocks charset.

       As a side-effect you can calculate with bollocks strings, or even
       compare them to find out which is greater crap than the other:

               use Dev::Bollocks;

               my $x = Dev::Bollocks->rand();
               my $y = Dev::Bollocks->rand();

               print "$x is more crap than $y\n" if ($x > $y);
               print "$y is more crap than $x\n" if ($y > $x);
               print "$x is the same bollox than $y\n" unless ($y != $x);

        We better biannually enable high-yield metrics.

INTERNAL DETAILS
       I spare you the internal details. You don't want to know the internas
       of middle management. Trust me. If you still are inclined to know, see
       Math::String. Don't say I didn't warn you.

USEFULL METHODS
   new()
                   $bollocks = Dev::Bollock->new();

       Create a new Dev::Bollocks object with the first bollocks ever.
       Optionally you can pass another bollocks string and it will see if it
       is valid middle management speak. Never was generating crap so easy!

   rand()
                   $bollocks = Dev::Bollock->rand($words);

       Create a new, random Dev::Bollocks object with $words words. $words
       defaults to 4.

   first()
                   $bollocks->first($length);
                   $bollocks = Dev::Bollocks->first($length);

       Generate the first bollocks of a certain length, length beeing here the
       number of words.

   last()
                   $bollocks->last($length);
                   $bollocks = Dev::Bollocks->last($length);

       Same as first(), only does the, well, last crap you expect.

   as_number()
                   $bollocks->as_number();

       Return internal number as normalized BigInt including sign.

   length()
                   $bollocks->length();

       Return the number of characters in the resulting string (aka it's
       length). It returns the number of words, since a Dev::Bollocks charset
       contains the crap words as 'characters'.

   charset()
                   $bollocks->charset();

       Return a reference to the charset of the Dev::Bollocks object.

PERFORMANCE
       It is rather slow. This is a feature, not a bug.

   Benchmarks
       Were not done on purpose. Nobody expects middle, or any other, for what
       it matters, management, to be fast or efficient, so we didn't waste our
       time in profiling it.

PLANS
       Bring upper and lower management speak to the, er, waiting masses.
