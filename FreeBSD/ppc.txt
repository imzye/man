PPC(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 PPC(4)

NAME
     ppc – Parallel Port Chipset driver

SYNOPSIS
     device ppc

     In /boot/device.hints:
     hint.ppc.0.at="isa"
     hint.ppc.0.irq="7"

     For one or more PPBUS busses:
     device ppbus

DESCRIPTION
     The ppc driver provides low level support to various parallel port
     chipsets for the ppbus(4) system.

     During the probe phase, ppc detects parallel port chipsets and
     initializes private data according to their operating mode: COMPATIBLE,
     NIBBLE, PS/2, EPP, ECP and other mixed modes.  If a mode is provided at
     startup through the flags variable of the boot interface, the operating
     mode of the chipset is forced according to flags and the hardware
     supported modes.

     During the attach phase, ppc allocates a ppbus structure, initializes it
     and calls the ppbus attach function.

   Supported flags
           bits 0-3: chipset forced mode(s)

           PPB_COMPATIBLE  0x0     /* Centronics compatible mode */
           PPB_NIBBLE      0x1     /* reverse 4 bit mode */
           PPB_PS2         0x2     /* PS/2 byte mode */
           PPB_EPP         0x4     /* EPP mode, 32 bit */
           PPB_ECP         0x8     /* ECP mode */

           And any mixed values.

           bit 4: EPP protocol (0 EPP 1.9, 1 EPP 1.7)

           bit 5: activate IRQ (1 IRQ disabled, 0 IRQ enabled)

           bit 6: disable chipset specific detection

           bit 7: disable FIFO detection

   Supported chipsets
     Some parallel port chipsets are explicitly supported: detection and
     initialisation code has been written according to their datasheets.

           •   SMC FDC37C665GT and FDC37C666GT chipsets

           •   Natsemi PC873xx-family (PC87332 and PC87306)

           •   Winbond W83877xx-family (W83877F and W83877AF)

           •   SMC-like chipsets with mixed modes (see ppbus(4))

   Adding support to a new chipset
     You may want to add support for the newest chipset your motherboard was
     sold with.  For the ISA bus, just retrieve the specs of the chipset and
     write the corresponding ppc_mychipset_detect() function.  Then add an
     entry to the general purpose ppc_detect() function.

     Your ppc_mychipset_detect() function should ensure that if the mode field
     of the flags boot variable is not null, then the operating mode is forced
     to the given mode and no other mode is available and ppb->ppb_avm field
     contains the available modes of the chipset.

BUGS
     The chipset detection process may corrupt your chipset configuration.
     You may disable chipset specific detection by using the above flags.
