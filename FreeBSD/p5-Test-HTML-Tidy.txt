NAME
       Test::HTML::Tidy - Test::More-style wrapper around HTML::Tidy

VERSION
       Version 1.28

           $Header: /home/cvs/test-html-tidy/Tidy.pm,v 1.4 2004/02/26 06:12:36 andy Exp $

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::HTML::Tidy tests => 4;

           my $page = build_a_web_page();
           html_tidy_ok( $page, 'Built page properly' );

DESCRIPTION
       Handy way to check that HTML is valid, according to HTML::Tidy.  It is
       built with Test::Builder and plays happily with Test::More and friends.

       If you are not already familiar with Test::More now would be the time
       to go take a look.

EXPORT
       "html_tidy_ok"

   html_tidy_ok( [$tidy, ] $html, $name )
       Checks to see if $html contains valid HTML.  $html being blank is OK.
       $html being undef is not.

       If you pass an HTML::Tidy object, "html_tidy_ok()" will use that for
       its settings.  The $html will get passed through $tidy.

           my $tidy = new HTML::Tidy;
           $tidy->ignore( type => TIDY_WARNING );
           html_tidy_ok( $tidy, $content, "Web page passes without errors" );

       Otherwise, "html_tidy_ok" will use the default rules.

           html_tidy_ok( $content, "Web page passes ALL tests" );

       Note that if you pass in your own HTML::Tidy object, "html_tidy_ok()"
       will clear its errors before using it.
