VIRTIO_SCSI(4)         FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual         VIRTIO_SCSI(4)

NAME
     virtio_scsi – VirtIO SCSI driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device virtio_scsi

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           virtio_scsi_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The virtio_scsi device driver provides support for VirtIO SCSI devices.

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.vtscsi.bus_reset_disable
             In the initial QEMU release with VirtIO SCSI support, in-flight
             operations were not aborted when stopping the device, rendering
             bus reset ineffective.  This tunable disables attempts to issue
             reset bus commands.  The default value is 1.

DEBUGGING
     To enable debugging prints from the virtio_scsi driver, set the

           hw.vtscsi.X.debug_level

     variable, where X is the adapter number, either in loader.conf(5) or via
     sysctl(8).  The following bits have the described effects:

           0x01    Enable informational prints.

           0x02    Enable prints for driver errors.

           0x04    Enable tracing prints.
