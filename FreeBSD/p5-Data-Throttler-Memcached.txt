Data::Throttler::Memcached(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Data::Throttler::Memcached - Memcached-Based Data::Throttler

SYNOPSIS
         my $t = Data::Throttler::Memcached->new(
           max_items => 10,
           interval  => 60,
           cache     => {
             data  => '127.0.0.1:11211', # optional
           }
         );

         $t->try_push( 'foo' );
         $t->try_push( key => 'foo' );

DESCRIPTION
       Data::Throttler does a good job throttling data for you, but
       unfortunately it's not distributed -- that is, since the storage is in
       memory, if you have a system with multiple hosts, throttling will be
       done individually on each host.

       To workaround this limitation, Data::Throttler::Memcached uses
       Cache::Memcached::Managed to store the actual data.

CAVEATS
       There's no locking mechanism when checking/incrementing counts. This
       means that each process could possibly overwrite another's value -- but
       since throttling is something that isn't "exact", I'm not considering
       this to be such a big issue.

       We may in the future work around this problem by utilizing distributed
       locks like KeyedMutex. Patches welcome.

METHODS
   new
       Creates a new instance of Data::Throttler::Memcached.  Accepts the same
       arguments as Data::Throttler, plus the "cache" argument.

       The cache argument must be a hashref, which contains the arguments
       passed to the cache backend. For example, if you wanted to change the
       data server, you can specify it like so:

         cache => {
           data => 'my.data.host:11211'
         }
