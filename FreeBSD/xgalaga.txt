INSTRUCTIONS
       It's Galaga, you know how to play Galaga, stop bothering me.  (Ship
       follows the mouse, button fires.  Auto-fire by holding it down, so no-
       one accuses me of breaking their mouse!)

       The xgalaga-hyperspace version features some new weapons and different
       gameplay.
