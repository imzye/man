DESCRIPTION
       configctl is a generic tool for parsing and updating configuration
       files.

OPTIONS
       configctl expects the name of a variable to be specified on the command
       line, optionally following a section name delimited with a dot (".").
       In write mode, a new value can be set after an equal ("=") delimiter.
       The following options are available:

       -a
           Print every value set in every section for this file.

       -f
           Filename to parse or update.

       -q
           Disable output on the standard stream.

       -v
           Be more verbose.

       -w
           Update a value or add a new one, and save it back into the original
           file.
