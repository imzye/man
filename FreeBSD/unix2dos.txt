UNIX2DOS(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            UNIX2DOS(1)

NAME
     unix2dos – convert ASCII files from UNIX's LF to DOS's CR/LF

SYNOPSIS
     unix2dos [-p] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     When called without parameters, the unix2dos utility reads from the
     standard input, transforming LF characters into CR/LF pairs and writing
     them to the standard output.  If there's at least one filename specified,
     the file operands are processed in command line order, reading from the
     files specified and overwriting them with the converted version.

     If the [-p] option is given, both the access and modification time of the
     original file are preserved.

     It's important to note that the unix2dos utility is the same program as
     the dos2unix(1) utility. It simply checks its name to see what operation
     is expected.  If you change the name of the binary, unix2dos will default
     to converting files from UNIX to DOS.

RETURN VALUES
     The unix2dos utility exits 0 on success, and 1 if there was an error
     processing any of the files. Note however that execution of the program
     does not stop if one of the files has a problem. The offending file is
     simply skipped and processing of the remaining files continues.

SEE ALSO
     dos2unix(1)

NOTES
     All Complains, or even better, suggestions should be addressed to the
     author Oscar Bonilla <obonilla@galileo.edu>
