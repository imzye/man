ORM(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 ORM(4)

NAME
     orm – ISA I/O space option ROM(s) driver

SYNOPSIS
     orm is automatically included on all systems that have an ISA bus.

DESCRIPTION
     The driver scans at boot time the ISA I/O memory space for option ROM(s)
     and claims them.  Other drivers are thus precluded from using ISA I/O
     memory that is on top of an option ROM.

AUTHORS
     This manual page was written by Nikolai Saoukh <nms@otdel-1.org>.

BUGS
     Due to the implementation of the resource manager, other drivers cannot
     attach to the option ROM address range.
