NAME
       subtle - a grid-based manual tiling window manager

SYNOPSIS
       subtle OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
       subtle is a manual tiling window manager with a rather uncommon
       approach of tiling: Instead of relying on predefined layouts, subtle
       divides the screen into a grid with customizeable slots (called
       gravities). For better understanding, the default config uses a 3x3
       grid and maps each gravity to one key of the numpad. With those keys,
       windows can be moved directly to the desired gravity - the same can be
       done with tagging rules in the config.

       Another unique concept is the strict tagging: Unlike other tiling
       window managers, subtle doesn´t allow weak tagging and always maps
       windows to virtual desktops (called views) with matching tags,
       regardless of the current active view.

OPTIONS
       •   -c, --config=CONFIG
           Load config

       •   -d, --display=DISPLAY
           Connect to DISPLAY

       •   -h, --help
           Show this help and exit

       •   -k, --check
           Check config syntax

       •   -n, --no-randr
           Disable RandR extension (required for Twinview)

       •   -r, --replace
           Replace current window manager

       •   -s, --sublets=DIR
           Load sublets from DIR

       •   -v, --version
           Show version info and exit

       •   -l, --level=LEVEL[,LEVEL] Set logging levels

       •   -D, --debug
           Print debugging messages




LOGLEVELS
       subtle uses a loglevel system to distinguish between messages and to be
       able to turn certain messages off. The level can be set with the -l or
       --level= options, multiple values are comma separated without any
       whitespace.

       •   subtle -l ruby,subtlext

       •   subtle --level=ruby,subtlext




       Default levels:

       •   warnings Warning messages

       •   sublet Sublet warnings

       •   error Error messages

       •   deprecated Deprecation warnings




       Debugging levels:

       •   events Information about handled events

       •   ruby Ruby debugging messages

       •   xerror X11 error messages

       •   subtlext Debugging messages of subtlext

       •   subtle Subsystem messages of subtle

       •   debug General debugging messages




GETTING STARTED
       To get started with subtle just follow the install instructions, have a
       look in the INSTALL file in the tarball or check if there is a package
       for your distribution. If no package is available and you want to
       supply one you are welcome.

       Next step after installing is configuring. subtle follows the XDG
       specifications, therefore can the default system config be found in
       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/subtle or in /etc/xdg/subtle. If you prefer a user
       based config just copy the system config to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/subtle or
       to $HOME/.config/subtle.

       If you update the config please check it with subtle -k first before
       starting subtle.

       Inside of subtle just press Win+Return to launch a xterm which usually
       starts at center gravity. Once you have a client you can play with
       gravites to get used to the system. It´s really easy and straight
       forward, just try the various combinations of Win+Numpad number.
