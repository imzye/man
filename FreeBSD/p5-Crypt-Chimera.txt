NAME
       Crypt::Chimera - An implementation of the Chimera key exchange protocol

DESCRIPTION
       The Chimera key exchange protocol generates a shared key between two
       parties. The protocol was shown to be INSECURE by Frank Niedermeyer and
       Werner Schindler of the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der
       Informationstechnik (BSI), Bonn, Germany. This module is therefore
       released for purely academic curiosity.

       Anyone interested in more details should read the source code and the
       examples in the eg/ subdirectory.
