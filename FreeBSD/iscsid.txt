ISCSID(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              ISCSID(8)

NAME
     iscsid – iSCSI initiator daemon

SYNOPSIS
     iscsid [-P pidfile] [-d] [-l loglevel] [-m maxproc] [-t seconds]

DESCRIPTION
     The iscsid daemon is the userspace component of the iSCSI initiator,
     responsible for performing the Login Phase of iSCSI connections and the
     SendTargets discovery.

     Upon startup, the iscsid daemon opens the iSCSI initiator device file and
     waits for requests from the kernel component, iscsi(4).  iscsid does not
     use any configuration files.  All needed information is supplied by the
     kernel.

     When the iscsid daemon is not running, already established iSCSI
     connections continue to work.  However, establishing new connections, or
     recovering existing ones in case of connection error, is not possible.

     The following options are available:

     -P pidfile        Specify alternative location of a file where main
                       process PID will be stored.  The default location is
                       /var/run/iscsid.pid.

     -d                Debug mode.  The daemon sends verbose debug output to
                       standard error, and does not put itself in the
                       background.  The daemon will also not fork and will
                       exit after processing one connection.  This option is
                       only intended for debugging the initiator.

     -l loglevel       Specifies debug level.  The default is 0.

     -m maxproc        Specifies limit for concurrently running child
                       processes handling connections.  The default is 30.
                       Setting it to 0 disables the limit.

     -t seconds        Specifies timeout for login session, after which the
                       connection will be forcibly terminated.  The default is
                       60.  Setting it to 0 disables the timeout.

FILES
     /dev/iscsi               The iSCSI initiator device file.
     /var/run/iscsid.pid      The default location of the iscsid PID file.

EXIT STATUS
     The iscsid utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
