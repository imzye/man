GELF_GETSYMINFO(3)     FreeBSD Library Functions Manual     GELF_GETSYMINFO(3)

NAME
     gelf_getsyminfo, gelf_update_syminfo – read and update symbol information

LIBRARY
     ELF Access Library (libelf, -lelf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gelf.h>

     GElf_Syminfo *
     gelf_getsyminfo(Elf_Data *data, int ndx, GElf_Syminfo *syminfo);

     int
     gelf_update_syminfo(Elf_Data *data, int ndx, GElf_Syminfo *syminfo);

DESCRIPTION
     These convenience functions are used to retrieve and update class-
     dependent Elf32_Syminfo and Elf64_Syminfo records in an ELF object.

     Argument data is an Elf_Data descriptor associated with a section of type
     SHT_SUNW_syminfo.  Argument ndx is the index of the record being
     retrieved or updated.  The class-independent GElf_Syminfo structure is
     described in gelf(3).

     Function gelf_getsyminfo() retrieves class-dependent record at index ndx
     in data buffer data and copies it to the destination pointed to by
     argument syminfo after translation to class-independent form.

     Function gelf_update_syminfo() converts the class-independent record
     pointed to by argument syminfo to class-dependent form, and writes it to
     the record at index ndx in the data buffer described by argument data.

RETURN VALUES
     Function gelf_getsyminfo() returns the value of argument syminfo if
     successful, or NULL in case of an error.  Function gelf_update_syminfo()
     returns a non-zero value if successful, or zero in case of an error.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail with the following errors:

     [ELF_E_ARGUMENT]  Arguments data or syminfo were NULL.

     [ELF_E_ARGUMENT]  Argument ndx was less than zero or larger than the
                       number of symbols in the data descriptor.

     [ELF_E_ARGUMENT]  Data descriptor data was not associated with a section
                       containing symbol information.

     [ELF_E_VERSION]   The Elf_Data descriptor denoted by argument data is
                       associated with an ELF object with an unsupported
                       version.
