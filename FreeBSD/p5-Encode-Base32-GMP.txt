NAME
       Encode::Base32::GMP - High speed Base32 encoding using GMP with BigInt
       and MD5 support

SYNOPSIS
         use Encode::Base32::GMP;

         # Encode Int as Base32
         encode_base32(12345);                        # => C1S string
         encode_base32('0x3039');                     # => C1S string
         encode_base32(Math::GMPz->new('0x3039'));    # => C1S string

         # Encode Int as Base32 using GMP alphabet
         encode_base32(12345,'rfc4648');              # => MBZ string
         encode_base32(12345,'zbase32');              # => CB3 string
         encode_base32(12345,'base32hex');            # => C1P string
         encode_base32(12345,'gmp');                  # => C1P string

         # Decode Base32 as Math::GMPz Int
         decode_base32('C1S');                        # => 12345 Math::GMPz object
         int decode_base32('C1S');                    # => 12345 integer

         # Decode Base32 as Math::GMPz Int using normaliztion (built-in)
         decode_base32('c1s');                        # => 12345 Math::GMPz object
         decode_base32('cis');                        # => 12345 Math::GMPz object

         # Decode Base32 as Math::GMPz Int using GMP alphabet
         decode_base32('MBZ','rfc4648');              # => 12345 Math::GMPz object
         decode_base32('CB3','zbase32');              # => 12345 Math::GMPz object

         # MD5 Base32 Digest
         md5_base32('foo@bar.com');                   # => 7KNPJ0BKM91DQR41099QNH5P58

         # Convert between alphabets, e.g. Crockford and RFC-4648
         base32_from_to('0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ','crockford','rfc4648');
           # => ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567
         base32_from_to('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567','rfc4648','zbase32');
           # => YBNDRFG8EJKMCPQXOT1UWISZA345H769

DESCRIPTION
       Encode::Base32::GMP is a numerical Base32 encoder/decoder
       implementation using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
       (GMP) with transcoding between Crockford, RFC 4648, z-base-32, and
       Base32hex / GMP implementations. The Crockford alphabet is the default
       and used when no alphabet is provided.  Crockford was selected as the
       default because it extends hexadecimal more naturally than other
       alphabets and it is easier to distinguish visually.

         crockford: [0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ]
         rfc4648:   [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567]
         zbase32:   [YBNDRFG8EJKMCPQXOT1UWISZA345H769]
         base32hex: [0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV]
         gmp:       [0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV]

       The encode_base32, decode_base32 and md5_base32 methods support an
       alphabet parameter which can be set to the supported alphabets to
       indicate the value to be encoded or decoded:

         [qw/crockford rfc4648 base32hex zbase32 gmp/]

       This module functions similarly to Encode::Base58::GMP with Base32
       being ideal for case-insensitive encoding and Base58 being ideal for
       case-sensitive encoding.

FUNCTIONS
   encode_base32 ( $number [, $alphabet ] )
       This routine encodes a $number in Base32. $number can be a Math::GMPz
       object or a binary, octal, decimal or hexidecimal number. Binary, octal
       and hexidecimal string literals must be prefixed with 0[Bb]/0/0[Xx]
       respectively. The resulting Base32 encoded number is provided in upper
       case per Crockford and RFC-4648 definitions. The Crockford alphabet is
       used unless $alphabet is set.

   decode_base32( $base32 [, $alphabet ] )
       This routine decodes a Base32 value and returns a Math::GMPz object.
       Use int on the return value to convert the Math::GMPz object to an
       integer. The input can be upper or lower case. Crockford and RFC-4648
       inputs are normalized exchanging the set [01ilo] as necessary. The
       Crockford alphabet is used unless $alphabet is set.

   base32_from_to( $base32, $from_alphabet, $to_alphabet )
       This routine encodes a Base32 string from one encoding to another
       encoding.  The input can be upper or lower case. Crockford and RFC-4648
       inputs are normalized exchanging the set [01ilo] as necessary. The
       resulting Base32 encoded number is provided in upper case per Crockford
       and RFC-4648 definitions. This routing is not exported by default.

   md5_base32( $data [, $alphabet ] )
       This routine returns a MD5 digest in Base32. This routine is not
       exported by default.

NOTE
       This module is designed to encode and decode numbers. As such, it is
       backward compatible with Encode::Base32::Crockford while also adding
       BigInt support.

       While this module can be used to transcode other Base32 encodings, this
       module is not designed to encode and decode binary strings, for which
       Convert::Base32, Convert::Base32::Crockford, and MIME::Base32 can be
       used. These modules also result in different and longer encodings for
       numbers which is not desirable when encoding digests and other uids.
