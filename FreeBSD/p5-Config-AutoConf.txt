NAME
       Config::AutoConf - A module to implement some of AutoConf macros in
       pure perl.

ABSTRACT
       With this module I pretend to simulate some of the tasks AutoConf
       macros do. To detect a command, to detect a library, etc.

SYNOPSIS
           use Config::AutoConf;

           Config::AutoConf->check_prog("agrep");
           my $grep = Config::AutoConf->check_progs("agrep", "egrep", "grep");

           Config::AutoConf->check_header("ncurses.h");
           my $curses = Config::AutoConf->check_headers("ncurses.h","curses.h");

           Config::AutoConf->check_prog_awk;
           Config::AutoConf->check_prog_egrep;

           Config::AutoConf->check_cc();

           Config::AutoConf->check_lib("ncurses", "tgoto");

           Config::AutoConf->check_file("/etc/passwd"); # -f && -r

DESCRIPTION
       Config::AutoConf is intended to provide the same opportunities to Perl
       developers as GNU Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/> does
       for Shell developers.

       As Perl is the second most deployed language (mind: every Unix comes
       with Perl, several mini-computers have Perl and even lot's of Windows
       machines run Perl software - which requires deployed Perl there, too),
       this gives wider support than Shell based probes.

       The API is leaned against GNU Autoconf, but we try to make the API
       (especially optional arguments) more Perl'ish than m4 abilities allow
       to the original.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
       This function instantiates a new instance of Config::AutoConf, e.g. to
       configure child components. The constructor adds also values set via
       environment variable "PERL5_AUTOCONF_OPTS".

METHODS
   check_file
       This function checks if a file exists in the system and is readable by
       the user. Returns a boolean. You can use '-f $file && -r $file' so you
       don't need to use a function call.

   check_files
       This function checks if a set of files exist in the system and are
       readable by the user. Returns a boolean.

   check_prog( $prog, \@dirlist?, \%options? )
       This function checks for a program with the supplied name. In success
       returns the full path for the executable;

       An optional array reference containing a list of directories to be
       searched instead of $PATH is gracefully honored.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.

   check_progs(progs, [dirlist])
       This function takes a list of program names. Returns the full path for
       the first found on the system. Returns undef if none was found.

       An optional array reference containing a list of directories to be
       searched instead of $PATH is gracefully honored.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively. The
       name of the $prog to check and the found full path are passed as first
       and second argument to the action_on_true callback.

   check_prog_yacc
       From the GNU Autoconf
       <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html> documentation,

         If `bison' is found, set [...] `bison -y'.
         Otherwise, if `byacc' is found, set [...] `byacc'.
         Otherwise set [...] `yacc'.  The result of this test can be influenced
         by setting the variable YACC or the cache variable ac_cv_prog_YACC.

       Returns the full path, if found.

   check_prog_awk
       From the GNU Autoconf
       <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html> documentation,

         Check for `gawk', `mawk', `nawk', and `awk', in that order, and
         set output [...] to the first one that is found.  It tries
         `gawk' first because that is reported to be the best implementation.
         The result can be overridden by setting the variable AWK or the
         cache variable ac_cv_prog_AWK.

       Note that it returns the full path, if found.

   check_prog_egrep
       From the GNU Autoconf
       <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html> documentation,

         Check for `grep -E' and `egrep', in that order, and [...] output
         [...] the first one that is found.  The result can be overridden by
         setting the EGREP variable and is cached in the ac_cv_path_EGREP
         variable.

       Note that it returns the full path, if found.

   check_prog_lex
       From the GNU Autoconf
       <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html> documentation,

         If flex is found, set output [...] to ‘flex’ and [...] to -lfl, if that
         library is in a standard place. Otherwise set output [...] to ‘lex’ and
         [...] to -ll, if found. If [...] packages [...] ship the generated
         file.yy.c alongside the source file.l, this [...] allows users without a
         lexer generator to still build the package even if the timestamp for
         file.l is inadvertently changed.

       Note that it returns the full path, if found.

       The structure $self->{lex} is set with attributes

         prog => $LEX
         lib => $LEXLIB
         root => $lex_root

   check_prog_sed
       From the GNU Autoconf
       <https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html> documentation,

         Set output variable [...] to a Sed implementation that conforms to Posix
         and does not have arbitrary length limits. Report an error if no
         acceptable Sed is found. See Limitations of Usual Tools, for more
         information about portability problems with Sed.

         The result of this test can be overridden by setting the SED variable and
         is cached in the ac_cv_path_SED variable.

       Note that it returns the full path, if found.

   check_prog_pkg_config
       Checks for "pkg-config" program. No additional tests are made for it
       ...

   check_prog_cc
       Determine a C compiler to use. Currently the probe is delegated to
       ExtUtils::CBuilder.

   check_cc
       (Deprecated) Old name of "check_prog_cc".

   check_valid_compiler
       This function checks for a valid compiler for the currently active
       language.  At the very moment only "C" is understood (corresponding to
       your compiler default options, e.g. -std=gnu89).

   check_valid_compilers(;\@)
       Checks for valid compilers for each given language. When unspecified
       defaults to "[ "C" ]".

   msg_checking
       Prints "Checking @_ ..."

   msg_result
       Prints result \n

   msg_notice
       Prints "configure: " @_ to stdout

   msg_warn
       Prints "configure: " @_ to stderr

   msg_error
       Prints "configure: " @_ to stderr and exits with exit code 0 (tells
       toolchain to stop here and report unsupported environment)

   msg_failure
       Prints "configure: " @_ to stderr and exits with exit code 0 (tells
       toolchain to stop here and report unsupported environment). Additional
       details are provides in config.log (probably more information in a
       later stage).

   define_var( $name, $value [, $comment ] )
       Defines a check variable for later use in further checks or code to
       compile.  Returns the value assigned value

   write_config_h( [$target] )
       Writes the defined constants into given target:

         Config::AutoConf->write_config_h( "config.h" );

   push_lang(lang [, implementor ])
       Puts the current used language on the stack and uses specified language
       for subsequent operations until ending pop_lang call.

   pop_lang([ lang ])
       Pops the currently used language from the stack and restores previously
       used language. If lang specified, it's asserted that the current used
       language equals to specified language (helps finding control flow
       bugs).

   lang_build_program( prologue, body )
       Builds program for current chosen language. If no prologue is given
       (undef), the default headers are used. If body is missing, default body
       is used.

       Typical call of

         Config::AutoConf->lang_build_program( "const char hw[] = \"Hello, World\\n\";",
                                               "fputs (hw, stdout);" )

       will create

         const char hw[] = "Hello, World\n";

         /* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
         #ifdef __cplusplus
         extern "C" {
         #endif

         int
         main (int argc, char **argv)
         {
           (void)argc;
           (void)argv;
           fputs (hw, stdout);;
           return 0;
         }

         #ifdef __cplusplus
         }
         #endif

   lang_call( [prologue], function )
       Builds program which simply calls given function.  When given, prologue
       is prepended otherwise, the default includes are used.

   lang_builtin( [prologue], builtin )
       Builds program which simply proves whether a builtin is known to
       language compiler.

   lang_build_bool_test (prologue, test, [@decls])
       Builds a static test which will fail to compile when test evaluates to
       false. If @decls is given, it's prepended before the test code at the
       variable definition place.

   push_includes
       Adds given list of directories to preprocessor/compiler invocation.
       This is not proved to allow adding directories which might be created
       during the build.

   push_preprocess_flags
       Adds given flags to the parameter list for preprocessor invocation.

   push_compiler_flags
       Adds given flags to the parameter list for compiler invocation.

   push_libraries
       Adds given list of libraries to the parameter list for linker
       invocation.

   push_library_paths
       Adds given list of library paths to the parameter list for linker
       invocation.

   push_link_flags
       Adds given flags to the parameter list for linker invocation.

   compile_if_else( $src, \%options? )
       This function tries to compile specified code and returns a boolean
       value containing check success state.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.

   link_if_else( $src, \%options? )
       This function tries to compile and link specified code and returns a
       boolean value containing check success state.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.

   check_cached( $cache-key, $check-title, \&check-call, \%options? )
       Retrieves the result of a previous "check_cached" invocation from
       "cache-key", or (when called for the first time) populates the cache by
       invoking "\&check_call".

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed on every call to
       check_cached (not just the first cache-populating invocation),
       respectively.

   cache_val
       This function returns the value of a previously check_cached call.

   check_decl( $symbol, \%options? )
       This method actually tests whether symbol is defined as a macro or can
       be used as an r-value, not whether it is really declared, because it is
       much safer to avoid introducing extra declarations when they are not
       needed.  In order to facilitate use of C++ and overloaded function
       declarations, it is possible to specify function argument types in
       parentheses for types which can be zero-initialized:

         Config::AutoConf->check_decl("basename(char *)")

       This method caches its result in the "ac_cv_decl_<set lang>"_symbol
       variable.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.

   check_decls( symbols, \%options? )
       For each of the symbols (with optional function argument types for C++
       overloads), run check_decl.

       Contrary to GNU Autoconf, this method does not declare
       "HAVE_DECL_symbol" macros for the resulting "confdefs.h", because it
       differs as "check_decl" between compiling languages.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.  Given callbacks for
       action_on_symbol_true or action_on_symbol_false are called for each
       symbol checked using "check_decl" receiving the symbol as first
       argument.

   check_func( $function, \%options? )
       This method actually tests whether $funcion can be linked into a
       program trying to call $function.  This method caches its result in the
       ac_cv_func_FUNCTION variable.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  If
       any of action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both
       callbacks are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or
       action_on_false to "check_cached", respectively.

       Returns: True if the function was found, false otherwise

   check_funcs( \@functions-list, $action-if-true?, $action-if-false? )
       The same as check_func, but takes a list of functions in
       \@functions-list to look for and checks for each in turn. Define
       HAVE_FUNCTION for each function that was found.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  If
       any of action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both
       callbacks are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or
       action_on_false to "check_cached", respectively.  Given callbacks for
       action_on_function_true or action_on_function_false are called for each
       symbol checked using "check_func" receiving the symbol as first
       argument.

   check_builtin( $builtin, \%options? )
       This method actually tests whether $builtin is a supported built-in
       known by the compiler. Either, by giving us the type of the built-in or
       by taking the value from "__has_builtin".  This method caches its
       result in the ac_cv_builtin_FUNCTION variable.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  If
       any of action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both
       callbacks are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or
       action_on_false to "check_cached", respectively.

       Returns: True if the function was found, false otherwise

   check_type( $symbol, \%options? )
       Check whether type is defined. It may be a compiler builtin type or
       defined by the includes.  In C, type must be a type-name, so that the
       expression "sizeof (type)" is valid (but "sizeof ((type))" is not).

       If type type is defined, preprocessor macro HAVE_type (in all capitals,
       with "*" replaced by "P" and spaces and dots replaced by underscores)
       is defined.

       This method caches its result in the "ac_cv_type_"type variable.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.

   check_types( \@type-list, \%options? )
       For each type in @type-list, call check_type is called to check for
       type and return the accumulated result (accumulation op is binary and).

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.  Given callbacks for action_on_type_true
       or action_on_type_false are called for each symbol checked using
       "check_type" receiving the symbol as first argument.

   compute_int( $expression, @decls?, \%options )
       Returns the value of the integer expression. The value should fit in an
       initializer in a C variable of type signed long.  It should be possible
       to evaluate the expression at compile-time. If no includes are
       specified, the default includes are used.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.

   check_sizeof_type( $type, \%options? )
       Checks for the size of the specified type by compiling and define
       "SIZEOF_type" using the determined size.

       In opposition to GNU AutoConf, this method can determine size of
       structure members, e.g.

         $ac->check_sizeof_type( "SV.sv_refcnt", { prologue => $include_perl } );
         # or
         $ac->check_sizeof_type( "struct utmpx.ut_id", { prologue => "#include <utmpx.h>" } );

       This method caches its result in the "ac_cv_sizeof_<set lang>"_type
       variable.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.

   check_sizeof_types( type, \%options? )
       For each type check_sizeof_type is called to check for size of type.

       If action-if-found is given, it is additionally executed when all of
       the sizes of the types could determined. If action-if-not-found is
       given, it is executed when one size of the types could not determined.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.  Given callbacks for action_on_size_true
       or action_on_size_false are called for each symbol checked using
       "check_sizeof_type" receiving the symbol as first argument.

   check_alignof_type( type, \%options? )
       Define ALIGNOF_type to be the alignment in bytes of type. type must be
       valid as a structure member declaration or type must be a structure
       member itself.

       This method caches its result in the "ac_cv_alignof_<set lang>"_type
       variable, with * mapped to "p" and other characters not suitable for a
       variable name mapped to underscores.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.

   check_alignof_types (type, [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found],
       [prologue = default includes])
       For each type check_alignof_type is called to check for align of type.

       If action-if-found is given, it is additionally executed when all of
       the aligns of the types could determined. If action-if-not-found is
       given, it is executed when one align of the types could not determined.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.  Given callbacks for action_on_align_true
       or action_on_align_false are called for each symbol checked using
       "check_alignof_type" receiving the symbol as first argument.

   check_member( member, \%options? )
       Check whether member is in form of aggregate.member and member is a
       member of the aggregate aggregate.

       which are used prior to the aggregate under test.

         Config::AutoConf->check_member(
           "struct STRUCT_SV.sv_refcnt",
           {
             action_on_false => sub { Config::AutoConf->msg_failure( "sv_refcnt member required for struct STRUCT_SV" ); },
             prologue => "#include <EXTERN.h>\n#include <perl.h>"
           }
         );

       This function will return a true value (1) if the member is found.

       If aggregate aggregate has member member, preprocessor macro
       HAVE_aggregate_MEMBER (in all capitals, with spaces and dots replaced
       by underscores) is defined.

       This macro caches its result in the "ac_cv_"aggr_member variable.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.

   check_members( members, \%options? )
       For each member check_member is called to check for member of
       aggregate.

       This function will return a true value (1) if at least one member is
       found.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be favored over
       "default includes" (represented by "_default_includes"). If any of
       action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks
       are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to
       "check_cached", respectively.  Given callbacks for
       action_on_member_true or action_on_member_false are called for each
       symbol checked using "check_member" receiving the symbol as first
       argument.

   check_header( $header, \%options? )
       This function is used to check if a specific header file is present in
       the system: if we detect it and if we can compile anything with that
       header included. Note that normally you want to check for a header
       first, and then check for the corresponding library (not all at once).

       The standard usage for this module is:

         Config::AutoConf->check_header("ncurses.h");

       This function will return a true value (1) on success, and a false
       value if the header is not present or not available for common usage.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  When
       a prologue exists in the optional hash at end, it will be prepended to
       the tested header. If any of action_on_cache_true,
       action_on_cache_false is defined, both callbacks are passed to
       "check_cached" as action_on_true or action_on_false to "check_cached",
       respectively.

   check_headers
       This function uses check_header to check if a set of include files
       exist in the system and can be included and compiled by the available
       compiler.  Returns the name of the first header file found.

       Passes an optional \%options hash to each "check_header" call.

   check_all_headers
       This function checks each given header for usability and returns true
       when each header can be used -- otherwise false.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  Each
       of existing key/value pairs using prologue, action_on_cache_true or
       action_on_cache_false as key are passed-through to each call of
       "check_header".  Given callbacks for action_on_header_true or
       action_on_header_false are called for each symbol checked using
       "check_header" receiving the symbol as first argument.

   check_stdc_headers
       Checks for standard C89 headers, namely stdlib.h, stdarg.h, string.h
       and float.h.  If those are found, additional all remaining C89 headers
       are checked: assert.h, ctype.h, errno.h, limits.h, locale.h, math.h,
       setjmp.h, signal.h, stddef.h, stdio.h and time.h.

       Returns a false value if it fails.

       Passes an optional \%options hash to each "check_all_headers" call.

   check_default_headers
       This function checks for some default headers, the std c89 headers and
       sys/types.h, sys/stat.h, memory.h, strings.h, inttypes.h, stdint.h and
       unistd.h

       Passes an optional \%options hash to each "check_all_headers" call.

   check_dirent_header
       Check for the following header files. For the first one that is found
       and defines 'DIR', define the listed C preprocessor macro:

         dirent.h      HAVE_DIRENT_H
         sys/ndir.h    HAVE_SYS_NDIR_H
         sys/dir.h     HAVE_SYS_DIR_H
         ndir.h        HAVE_NDIR_H

       The directory-library declarations in your source code should look
       something like the following:

         #include <sys/types.h>
         #ifdef HAVE_DIRENT_H
         # include <dirent.h>
         # define NAMLEN(dirent) strlen ((dirent)->d_name)
         #else
         # define dirent direct
         # define NAMLEN(dirent) ((dirent)->d_namlen)
         # ifdef HAVE_SYS_NDIR_H
         #  include <sys/ndir.h>
         # endif
         # ifdef HAVE_SYS_DIR_H
         #  include <sys/dir.h>
         # endif
         # ifdef HAVE_NDIR_H
         #  include <ndir.h>
         # endif
         #endif

       Using the above declarations, the program would declare variables to be
       of type "struct dirent", not "struct direct", and would access the
       length of a directory entry name by passing a pointer to a "struct
       dirent" to the "NAMLEN" macro.

       For the found header, the macro HAVE_DIRENT_IN_${header} is defined.

       This method might be obsolescent, as all current systems with directory
       libraries have "<dirent.h>". Programs supporting only newer OS might
       not need to use this method.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  Each
       of existing key/value pairs using prologue, action_on_header_true (as
       action_on_true having the name of the tested header as first argument)
       or action_on_header_false (as action_on_false having the name of the
       tested header as first argument) as key are passed-through to each call
       of "_check_header".  Given callbacks for action_on_cache_true or
       action_on_cache_false are passed to the call of "check_cached".

   _check_perlapi_program
       This method provides the program source which is suitable to do basic
       compile/link tests to prove perl development environment.

   _check_compile_perlapi
       This method can be used from other checks to prove whether we have a
       perl development environment or not (perl.h, reasonable basic checks -
       types, etc.)

   check_compile_perlapi
       This method can be used from other checks to prove whether we have a
       perl development environment or not (perl.h, reasonable basic checks -
       types, etc.)

   check_compile_perlapi_or_die
       Dies when not being able to compile using the Perl API

   check_linkable_xs_so
       Checks whether a dynamic loadable object containing an XS module can be
       linked or not. Due the nature of the beast, this test currently always
       succeed.

   check_linkable_xs_so_or_die
       Dies when "check_linkable_xs_so" fails.

   check_loadable_xs_so
       Checks whether a dynamic loadable object containing an XS module can be
       loaded or not. Due the nature of the beast, this test currently always
       succeed.

   check_loadable_xs_so_or_die
       Dies when "check_loadable_xs_so" fails.

   _check_link_perlapi
       This method can be used from other checks to prove whether we have a
       perl development environment including a suitable libperl or not
       (perl.h, reasonable basic checks - types, etc.)

       Caller must ensure that the linker flags are set appropriate ("-lperl"
       or similar).

   check_link_perlapi
       This method can be used from other checks to prove whether we have a
       perl development environment or not (perl.h, libperl.la, reasonable
       basic checks - types, etc.)

   check_lib( lib, func, @other-libs?, \%options? )
       This function is used to check if a specific library includes some
       function. Call it with the library name (without the lib portion), and
       the name of the function you want to test:

         Config::AutoConf->check_lib("z", "gzopen");

       It returns 1 if the function exist, 0 otherwise.

       In case of function found, the HAVE_LIBlibrary (all in capitals)
       preprocessor macro is defined with 1 and $lib together with @other_libs
       are added to the list of libraries to link with.

       If linking with library results in unresolved symbols that would be
       resolved by linking with additional libraries, give those libraries as
       the other-libs argument: e.g., "[qw(Xt X11)]".  Otherwise, this routine
       may fail to detect that library is present, because linking the test
       program can fail with unresolved symbols.  The other-libraries argument
       should be limited to cases where it is desirable to test for one
       library in the presence of another that is not already in LIBS.

       This method caches its result in the "ac_cv_lib_"lib_func variable.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  If
       any of action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both
       callbacks are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or
       action_on_false to "check_cached", respectively.

       It's recommended to use search_libs instead of check_lib these days.

   search_libs( function, search-libs, @other-libs?, @extra_link_flags?,
       \%options? )
           Config::AutoConf->search_libs("gethostent", "nsl", [qw(socket net)], {
               action_on_true => sub { ... }
           });
           Config::AutoConf->search_libs("log4cplus_initialize", ["log4cplus"],
               [[qw(stdc++)], [qw(stdc++ unwind)]],
               [qw(-pthread -thread)]
           );

       Search for a library defining function if it's not already available.
       This equates to calling

           Config::AutoConf->link_if_else(
               Config::AutoConf->lang_call( "", "$function" ) );

       first with no libraries, then for each library listed in search-libs.
       search-libs must be specified as an array reference to avoid confusion
       in argument order.

       Prepend -llibrary to LIBS for the first library found to contain
       function.

       If linking with library results in unresolved symbols that would be
       resolved by linking with additional libraries, give those libraries as
       the other-libraries argument: e.g., "[qw(Xt X11)]" or "[qw(intl),
       qw(intl iconv)]". Otherwise, this method fails to detect that function
       is present, because linking the test program always fails with
       unresolved symbols.

       The result of this test is cached in the ac_cv_search_function variable
       as "none required" if function is already available, as 0 if no library
       containing function was found, otherwise as the -llibrary option that
       needs to be prepended to LIBS.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  If
       any of action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both
       callbacks are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or
       action_on_false to "check_cached", respectively.  Given callbacks for
       action_on_lib_true or action_on_lib_false are called for each library
       checked using "link_if_else" receiving the library as first argument
       and all @other_libs subsequently.

   check_lm( \%options? )
       This method is used to check if some common "math.h" functions are
       available, and if "-lm" is needed. Returns the empty string if no
       library is needed, or the "-lm" string if libm is needed.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  Each
       of existing key/value pairs using action_on_func_true (as
       action_on_true having the name of the tested functions as first
       argument), action_on_func_false (as action_on_false having the name of
       the tested functions as first argument), action_on_func_lib_true (as
       action_on_lib_true having the name of the tested functions as first
       argument), action_on_func_lib_false (as action_on_lib_false having the
       name of the tested functions as first argument) as key are passed-
       through to each call of "search_libs".  Given callbacks for
       action_on_lib_true, action_on_lib_false, action_on_cache_true or
       action_on_cache_false are passed to the call of "search_libs".

       Note that action_on_lib_true and action_on_func_lib_true or
       action_on_lib_false and action_on_func_lib_false cannot be used at the
       same time, respectively.

   pkg_config_package_flags($package, \%options?)
         use Config::AutoConf

         my $c = Config::AutoConf->new;
         $c->pkg_config_package_flags('log4cplus');
         WriteMakefile(
           ...
           INC  => $c->_get_extra_compiler_flags,
           LIBS => $c->_get_extra_linker_flags,
         );

       Search for "pkg-config" flags for package as specified. The flags which
       are extracted are "--cflags" and "--libs". The extracted flags are
       appended to the global "extra_preprocess_flags", "extra_link_flags" or
       "extra_libs", respectively. Distinguishing between "extra_link_flags"
       and "extra_libs" is essential to avoid conflicts with search_libs
       function and family.  In case, no package configuration matching given
       criteria could be found, return a "false" value (0).

       The "pkg-config" flags are taken from environment variables
       "${package}_CFLAGS" or "${package}_LIBS" when defined, respectively.
       It will be a nice touch to document the particular environment
       variables for your build procedure - as for above example it should be

         $ env log4cplus_CFLAGS="-I/opt/coolapp/include" \
               log4cplus_LIBS="-L/opt/coolapp/lib -Wl,-R/opt/coolapp/lib -llog4cplus" \
           perl Makefile.PL

       Call "pkg_config_package_flags" with the package you're looking for and
       optional callback whether found or not.

       To support stage compiling properly ("rpath" vs. library file
       location), the internal representation is a moving target. Do not use
       the result directly - the getters _get_extra_compiler_flags and
       _get_extra_linker_flags are strongly encouraged. In case this is not
       possible, please open a ticket to get informed on invasive changes.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.  If
       any of action_on_cache_true, action_on_cache_false is defined, both
       callbacks are passed to "check_cached" as action_on_true or
       action_on_false to "check_cached", respectively.

   _check_mm_pureperl_build_wanted
       This method proves the "_argv" attribute and (when set) the
       "PERL_MM_OPT" whether they contain PUREPERL_ONLY=(0|1) or not. The
       attribute "_force_xs" is set as appropriate, which allows a compile
       test to bail out when "Makefile.PL" is called with PUREPERL_ONLY=0.

   _check_mb_pureperl_build_wanted
       This method proves the "_argv" attribute and (when set) the
       "PERL_MB_OPT" whether they contain --pureperl-only or not.

   _check_pureperl_required
       This method calls "_check_mm_pureperl_build_wanted" when running under
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker ("Makefile.PL") or
       "_check_mb_pureperl_build_wanted" when running under a "Build.PL"
       (Module::Build compatible) environment.

       When neither is found ($0 contains neither "Makefile.PL" nor
       "Build.PL"), simply 0 is returned.

   check_pureperl_required
       This check method proves whether a pure perl build is wanted or not by
       cached-checking "$self->_check_pureperl_required".

   check_produce_xs_build
       This routine checks whether XS can be produced. Therefore it does
       following checks in given order:

       •   check pure perl environment variables ("check_pureperl_required")
           or command line arguments and return false when pure perl is
           requested

       •   check whether a compiler is available ("check_valid_compilers") and
           return false if none found

       •   check whether a test program accessing Perl API can be compiled and
           die with error if not

       When all checks passed successfully, return a true value.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.

   check_produce_loadable_xs_build
       This routine proves whether XS should be built and it's possible to
       create a dynamic linked object which can be loaded using Perl's
       Dynaloader.

       The extension over "check_produce_xs_build" can be avoided by adding
       the "notest_loadable_xs" to $ENV{PERL5_AC_OPTS}.

       If the very last parameter contains a hash reference, "CODE" references
       to action_on_true or action_on_false are executed, respectively.

   _set_argv
       Intended to act as a helper for evaluating given command line
       arguments.  Stores given arguments in instances "_argv" attribute.

       Call once at very begin of "Makefile.PL" or "Build.PL":

         Your::Pkg::Config::AutoConf->_set_args(@ARGV);

   _default_includes
       returns a string containing default includes for program prologue taken
       from "autoconf/headers.m4":

         #include <stdio.h>
         #ifdef HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H
         # include <sys/types.h>
         #endif
         #ifdef HAVE_SYS_STAT_H
         # include <sys/stat.h>
         #endif
         #ifdef STDC_HEADERS
         # include <stdlib.h>
         # include <stddef.h>
         #else
         # ifdef HAVE_STDLIB_H
         #  include <stdlib.h>
         # endif
         #endif
         #ifdef HAVE_STRING_H
         # if !defined STDC_HEADERS && defined HAVE_MEMORY_H
         #  include <memory.h>
         # endif
         # include <string.h>
         #endif
         #ifdef HAVE_STRINGS_H
         # include <strings.h>
         #endif
         #ifdef HAVE_INTTYPES_H
         # include <inttypes.h>
         #endif
         #ifdef HAVE_STDINT_H
         # include <stdint.h>
         #endif
         #ifdef HAVE_UNISTD_H
         # include <unistd.h>
         #endif

   _default_includes_with_perl
       returns a string containing default includes for program prologue
       containing _default_includes plus

         #include <EXTERN.h>
         #include <perl.h>

   add_log_fh
       Push new file handles at end of log-handles to allow tee'ing log-output

   delete_log_fh
       Removes specified log file handles. This method allows you to shoot
       yourself in the foot - it doesn't prove whether the primary nor the
       last handle is removed. Use with caution.

   _get_extra_compiler_flags
       Returns the determined flags required to run the compile stage as
       string

   _get_extra_linker_flags
       Returns the determined flags required to run the link stage as string

NEXT STEPS
       Although a lot of work needs to be done, these are the next steps I
       intend to take.

         - detect flex/lex
         - detect yacc/bison/byacc
         - detect ranlib (not sure about its importance)

       These are the ones I think not too much important, and will be
       addressed later, or by request.

         - detect an 'install' command
         - detect a 'ln -s' command -- there should be a module doing
           this kind of task.

BUGS
       A lot. Portability is a pain. <Patches welcome!>.
