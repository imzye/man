GSS_DUPLICATE_NAME(3)                   FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_duplicate_name – Create a copy of an internal name

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_duplicate_name(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_name_t src_name,
         gss_name_t *dest_name);

DESCRIPTION
     Create an exact duplicate of the existing internal name src_name.  The
     new dest_name will be independent of src_name (i.e.  src_name and
     dest_name must both be released, and the release of one shall not affect
     the validity of the other).

PARAMETERS
     minor_status      Mechanism specific status code.

     src_name          Internal name to be duplicated.

     dest_name         The resultant copy of src_name. Storage associated with
                       this name must be freed by the application after use
                       with a call to gss_release_name().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE      Successful completion

     GSS_S_BAD_NAME      The src_name parameter was ill-formed
