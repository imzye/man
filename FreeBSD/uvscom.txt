NAME
     uvscom – USB support for SUNTAC Slipper U VS-10U serial adapters driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device uvscom

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           uvscom_load="YES"

HARDWARE
     The uvscom driver supports the following adapters:

     •   DDI Pocket Air H" C@rd
     •   DDI Pocket Air H" C@rd 64
     •   NTT P-in
     •   NTT P-in m@ster

DESCRIPTION
     The uvscom driver provides support for the SUNTAC Slipper U VS-10U chip.
     Slipper U is a PC Card to USB converter for data communication card
     adapters.

     The device is accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
     like a tty(4).
