DESCRIPTION
       HTML::Table is used to generate HTML tables for CGI scripts.  By using
       the methods provided fairly complex tables can be created, manipulated,
       then printed from Perl scripts.  The module also greatly simplifies
       creating tables within tables from Perl.  It is possible to create an
       entire table using the methods provided and never use an HTML tag.

       HTML::Table also allows for creating dynamically sized tables via its
       addRow and addCol methods.  These methods automatically resize the
       table if passed more cell values than will fit in the current table
       grid.

       Methods are provided for nearly all valid table, row, and cell tags
       specified for HTML 3.0.

       A Japanese translation of the documentation is available at:

               http://member.nifty.ne.jp/hippo2000/perltips/html/table.htm

METHODS
         [] indicate optional parameters. default value will
            be used if no value is specified

         row_num indicates that a row number is required.
               Rows are numbered from 1.  To refer to the last row use the value -1.

         col_num indicates that a col number is required.
               Cols are numbered from 1.  To refer to the last col use the value -1.

   Sections
           From version 2.07 onwards HTML::Table supports table sections
           (THEAD, TFOOT & TBODY).

           Each section can have its own attributes (id, class, etc) set, and
           will contain 1 or more rows.  Section numbering starts at 0, only
           tbody is allowed to have more than one section.

           Methods for manipultaing sections and their data are available and
           have the general form:

             setSectionCell ( section, section_num, row_num, col_num, data );

             For example, the following adds a row to the first body section:

             addSectionRow ( 'tbody', 0, "Cell 1", "Cell 2", "Cell 3" );

           For backwards compatibility, methods with Section in their name
           will default to manipulating the first body section.

             For example, the following sets the class for the first row in the
             first body section:

             setRowClass ( 1, 'row_class' );

             Which is semantically equivalent to:

             setSectionRowClass ( 'tbody', 0, 1, 'row_class' );

   Creation
       new HTML::Table([num_rows, num_cols])
           Creates a new HTML table object.  If rows and columns are
           specified, the table will be initialized to that size.  Row and
           Column numbers start at 1,1.  0,0 is considered an empty table.

       new HTML::Table([-rows=>num_rows, -cols=>num_cols,
       -border=>border_width, -align=>table_alignment, -style=>table_style,
       -class=>table_class, -evenrowclass=>'even', -oddrowclass=>'odd',
       -bgcolor=>back_colour, -width=>table_width, -spacing=>cell_spacing,
       -padding=>cell_padding])
           Creates a new HTML table object.  If rows and columns are
           specified, the table will be initialized to that size.  Row and
           Column numbers start at 1,1.  0,0 is considered an empty table.

           If evenrowclass or oddrowclass is specified, these classes will be
           applied to even and odd rows, respectively, unless those rows have
           a specific class applied to it.

   Table Level Methods
       setBorder([pixels])
           Sets the table Border Width

       setWidth([pixels|percentofscreen])
           Sets the table width

                   $table->setWidth(500);
             or
                   $table->setWidth('100%');

       setCellSpacing([pixels])
       setCellPadding([pixels])
       setCaption("CaptionText" [, top|bottom])
       setBGColor([colorname|colortriplet])
       autoGrow([1|true|on|anything|0|false|off|no|disable])
           Switches on (default) or off automatic growing of the table if row
           or column values passed to setCell exceed current table size.

       setAlign ( [ left , center , right ] )
       setRules ( [ rows , cols , all, both , groups  ] )
       setStyle ( 'css style' )
           Sets the table style attribute.

       setClass ( 'css class' )
           Sets the table class attribute.

       setEvenRowClass ( 'css class' )
           Sets the class attribute of even rows in the table.

       setOddRowClass ( 'css class' )
           Sets the class attribute of odd rows in the table.

       setAttr ( 'user attribute' )
           Sets a user defined attribute for the table.  Useful for when
           HTML::Table hasn't implemented a particular attribute yet

       sort ( [sort_col_num, sort_type, sort_order, num_rows_to_skip] )
                   or
             sort( -sort_col => sort_col_num,
                   -sort_type => sort_type,
                   -sort_order => sort_order,
                   -skip_rows => num_rows_to_skip,
                   -strip_html => strip_html,
                   -strip_non_numeric => strip_non_numeric,
                   -presort_func => \&filter_func )

               sort_type in { ALPHA | NUMERIC },
               sort_order in { ASC | DESC },
               strip_html in { 0 | 1 }, defaults to 1,
               strip_non_numeric in { 0 | 1 }, defaults to 1

             Sort all rows on a given column (optionally skipping table header rows
             by specifiying num_rows_to_skip).

             By default sorting ignores HTML Tags and &nbsp, setting the strip_html parameter to 0
             disables this behaviour.

             By default numeric Sorting ignores non numeric chararacters, setting the strip_non_numeric
             parameter to 0 disables this behaviour.

             You can provide your own pre-sort function, useful for pre-processing the cell contents
             before sorting for example dates.

       setLastRow*
           All of the setRow methods have a corresponding setLastRow method
           which does not accept the row_num parameter, but automatically
           applies to the last row of the table.

           NB.  Only works on the setRow* methods, not on the setSectionRow*
           methods.

       getRowStyle(row_num)
           Returns row's style attribute.

       getSectionRowStyle([tbody|thead|tfoot], section_num, row_num)
           Same as getRowStyle, but able to specify which section to act on.

   Output Methods
       getTable
           Returns a string containing the HTML representation of the table.

           The same effect can also be achieved by using the object reference
           in a string scalar context.

           For example...

                   This code snippet:

                           $table = new HTML::Table(2, 2);
                           print '<p>Start</p>';
                           print $table->getTable;
                           print '<p>End</p>';

                   would produce the same output as:

                           $table = new HTML::Table(2, 2);
                           print "<p>Start</p>$table<p>End</p>";

       print
           Prints HTML representation of the table to STDOUT

HISTORY
       This module was originally created in 1997 by Stacy Lacy and whose last
       version was uploaded to CPAN in 1998.  The module was adopted in July
       2000 by Anthony Peacock in order to distribute a revised version.  This
       adoption took place without the explicit consent of Stacy Lacy as it
       proved impossible to contact them at the time.  Explicit consent for
       the adoption has since been received.
