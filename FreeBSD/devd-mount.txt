devd-mount(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          devd-mount(8)






SYNOPSIS
       devd-mount [/dev/]partition


ARGUMENTS
       device  Name of device node, with or without /dev/ prefix


DESCRIPTION
       devd-mount is a script for mounting external media on FreeBSD.  It is
       normally invoked by /usr/local/etc/devd/devd-mount.conf, which is run
       by the devd(8) service upon creation of a new device node such as
       /dev/da0.  This typically occurs when a USB drive is inserted, for
       example.

       The device name should contain a filesystem recognized by FreeBSD or by
       fusefs, such as EXFAT, FAT32, FAS16, NTFS, ISO 9660 (CDs), UDF (DVDs),
       of UFS (FreeBSD native).

       The mount point for a device is /media/device-name, e.g.  /dev/da0p1 is
       mounted on /media/da0p1.

       The configuration file /usr/local/etc/devd-mount.conf can be used to
       control ownership and permissions on the mount point, and the program
       invoked upon a successful mount.  Defaults are shown below.

       MEDIA_MANAGER=/usr/local/bin/qmediamanager
       GROUP=operator
       MODE=775

       The auto-automount-setup(1) script, part of sysutils/auto-admin will
       configure a FreeBSD system to use devd-mount.


RETURN VALUES
       0 upon successful mount, non-zero error codes otherwise
