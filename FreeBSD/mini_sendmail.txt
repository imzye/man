mini_sendmail(8)        FreeBSD System Manager's Manual       mini_sendmail(8)

NAME
       mini_sendmail - accept email on behalf of real sendmail

SYNOPSIS
       mini_sendmail [-f<name>] [-t] [-s<server>] [-p<port>] [-T<timeout>]
       [-v] address ...

DESCRIPTION
       With no flags, mini_sendmail reads its standard input up to an end-of-
       file and sends a copy of the message found there to all of the
       addresses listed.

       The message is sent by connecting to a local SMTP server.  This means
       mini_sendmail can be used to send email from inside a chroot(2) area.

       -f     Sets the name of the "from" person (i.e. the sender of the
              mail).

       -t     Read message for recipients.  To:, Cc:, and Bcc: lines will be
              scanned for recipient addresses.  The Bcc: line will be deleted
              before transmission.

       -s     Specifies the SMTP server to use.  Without this it uses
              localhost.

       -p     Specifies the port to use.  Without this it uses 25, the
              standard SMTP port.

       -T     Specifies timeout - defaults to one minute.

       -v     Verbose mode - shows the conversation with the SMTP server.
