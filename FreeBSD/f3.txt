NAME
       f3write, f3read - test real flash memory capacity

SYNOPSIS
       f3write [--start-at=NUM] [--end-at=NUM] <PATH>
       f3read  [--start-at=NUM] [--end-at=NUM] <PATH>

DESCRIPTION
       F3 (Fight Flash Fraud or Fight Fake Flash) tests the full capacity of a
       flash card (flash drive, flash disk, pendrive). It writes to the card
       and then checks if can read it. It will assure you haven't been sold a
       card with a smaller capacity than stated.

       When writing to flash drive, f3write fills the filesystem with 1GB
       files named N.h2w, where N is a number (i.e. /[0-9]+/).

       WARNING: all data on the tested disk might be lost!

OPTIONS
       --start-at=NUM
              Initial number of file names. Default value is 1.

       --end-at=NUM
              Final number of file names. Default value is "infinity".

EXAMPLE
       To write over a flash drive mounted at /media/TEST:

             $ f3write /media/TEST

       To read this flash drive:

             $ f3read /media/TEST
