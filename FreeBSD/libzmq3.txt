ZMQ_BIND(3)                       0MQ Manual                       ZMQ_BIND(3)

NAME
       zmq_bind - accept incoming connections on a socket

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_bind (void *socket, const char *endpoint);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_bind() function binds the socket to a local endpoint and then
       accepts incoming connections on that endpoint.

       The endpoint is a string consisting of a transport:// followed by an
       address. The transport specifies the underlying protocol to use. The
       address specifies the transport-specific address to bind to.

       0MQ provides the the following transports:

       tcp
           unicast transport using TCP, see zmq_tcp(7)

       ipc
           local inter-process communication transport, see zmq_ipc(7)

       inproc
           local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport, see
           zmq_inproc(7)

       pgm, epgm
           reliable multicast transport using PGM, see zmq_pgm(7)

       Every 0MQ socket type except ZMQ_PAIR supports one-to-many and
       many-to-one semantics. The precise semantics depend on the socket type
       and are defined in zmq_socket(3).

       The ipc and tcp transports accept wildcard addresses: see zmq_ipc(7)
       and zmq_tcp(7) for details.

           Note

           the address syntax may be different for zmq_bind() and
           zmq_connect() especially for the tcp, pgm and epgm transports.

           Note

           following a zmq_bind(), the socket enters a mute state unless or
           until at least one incoming or outgoing connection is made, at
           which point the socket enters a ready state. In the mute state, the
           socket blocks or drops messages according to the socket type, as
           defined in zmq_socket(3). By contrast, following a
           libzmq:zmq_connect[3], the socket enters the ready state.

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_bind() function returns zero if successful. Otherwise it
       returns -1 and sets errno to one of the values defined below.

ERRORS
       EINVAL
           The endpoint supplied is invalid.

       EPROTONOSUPPORT
           The requested transport protocol is not supported.

       ENOCOMPATPROTO
           The requested transport protocol is not compatible with the socket
           type.

       EADDRINUSE
           The requested address is already in use.

       EADDRNOTAVAIL
           The requested address was not local.

       ENODEV
           The requested address specifies a nonexistent interface.

       ETERM
           The 0MQ context associated with the specified socket was
           terminated.

       ENOTSOCK
           The provided socket was invalid.

       EMTHREAD
           No I/O thread is available to accomplish the task.

EXAMPLE
       Binding a publisher socket to an in-process and a TCP transport.

           /* Create a ZMQ_PUB socket */
           void *socket = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_PUB);
           assert (socket);
           /* Bind it to a in-process transport with the address 'my_publisher' */
           int rc = zmq_bind (socket, "inproc://my_publisher");
           assert (rc == 0);
           /* Bind it to a TCP transport on port 5555 of the 'eth0' interface */
           rc = zmq_bind (socket, "tcp://eth0:5555");
           assert (rc == 0);
