DESCRIPTION
       Morla is a multiplatform editor of RDF documents. It is based on
       libnxml and librdf libraries. With Morla you can manage more RDF
       documents simultaneously, visualize graphs and use templates for quick
       writing.

       With Morla you can import RDFS documents and use its content to write
       new RDF triples. Templates are also RDF documents and they make Morla
       easily personalizeble and expandable.

       You can also use Morla as RDF navigator, wandering among the net knots
       of the RDF documents present on internet exactly as we are used to do
       with normal browsers.

       Morla is a FreeSoftware project released under license GPL v2.0.
