NAME
       APR::Request - wrapper for libapreq2's module/handle API.

SYNOPSIS
         use APR::Request;

         $req = APR::Request::Custom->handle($pool,
                                             "foo=arg1&bar=arg2",
                                             "apache=quux",
                                              $parser, 1e6, $bb);
         $param = $req->param("foo");
         $cookie = $req->jar("apache");

DESCRIPTION
       The "APR::Request" module provides the base methods for interfacing
       with libapreq2's module API.  It also provides a few utility functions
       and constants.

       This manpage documents version 2.17 of the APR::Request,
       APR::Request::Custom, APR::Request::Cookie::Table, and
       APR::Request::Param::Table packages.

METHODS
       APR::Request::Custom - derived from APR::Request.

   handle
           APR::Request::Custom->handle($pool,
                                        $query_string,
                                        $cookie_header,
                                        $parser,
                                        $read_limit,
                                        $brigade)

       Creates a new APR::Request::Custom object.  The $query_string and
       $cookie_headers are immediately parsed into the "args" and "jar"
       tables.  The $parser is an APR::Request::Parser object which is invoked
       when fetching "body" entries from the $brigade.  The $read_limit
       represents the maximum number of bytes this handle may feed into the
       parser.

METHODS
       APR::Request

   pool
           $req->pool()

       Returns the APR::Pool object associated to this handle.

   bucket_alloc
           $req->bucket_alloc()

       Returns the APR::BucketAlloc object associated to this handle.

   jar_status
           $req->jar_status()

       Returns the final status code of the handle's cookie header parser.

   args_status
           $req->args_status()

       Returns the final status code of the handle's query-string parser.

   body_status
           $req->body_status()

       Returns the final status code of the handle's body parser.

   param_status
           $req->param_status()

       Returns "($req->args_status, $req->body_status)" in list context;
       otherwise returns "$req->args_status || $req->body_status".

   parse
           $req->parse()

       Parses the jar, args, and body tables. Returns "$req->jar_status,
       $req->args_status, $req->body_status".

           @status = $req->parse;
           ok @status == 3;
           ok $status[0] == $req->jar_status;
           ok $status[1] == $req->args_status;
           ok $status[2] == $req->body_status;

   jar
           $req->jar()
           $req->jar($key)

       With no arguments, this method returns a tied
       APR::Request::Cookie::Table object (or undef if the "Cookie" header is
       absent) in scalar context, or the names (in order, with repetitions) of
       all the parsed cookies.

       With the $key argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
       matching cookie.  In list context it returns all matching cookies.  The
       returned cookies are the values as they appeared in the incoming Cookie
       header.

       jar() will throw an APR::Request::Error object whenever jar_status() is
       non-zero and the return value is potentially invalid (eg "scalar
       $req->jar($key)" will not die if the desired cookie was successfully
       parsed).

           $jar = $req->jar;
           @cookie_names = $req->jar;
           ok $jar->isa("APR::Request::Cookie::Table");
           ok shift @cookie_names eq $_ for keys %$jar;

           $cookie = $req->jar("apache");
           @cookies = $req->jar("apache");

   args
           $req->args()
           $req->args($key)

       With no arguments, this method returns a tied
       APR::Request::Param::Table object (or undef if the query string is
       absent) in scalar context, or the names (in order, with repetitions) of
       all the parsed query-string arguments.

       With the $key argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
       matching query-string arg.  In list context it returns all matching
       args.

       args() will throw an APR::Request::Error object whenever args_status()
       is non-zero and the return value is potentially invalid (eg "scalar
       $req->args($key)" will not die if the desired query argument was
       successfully parsed).

          $args = $req->args;
          @arg_names = $req->args;
          ok $args->isa("APR::Request::Param::Table");
          ok shift @arg_names eq $_ for keys %$args;

          $foo = $req->args("foo");
          @bar = $req->args("bar");

   body
           $req->body()
           $req->body($key)

       With no arguments, this method returns a tied
       APR::Request::Param::Table object (or undef if the request body is
       absent) in scalar context, or the names (in order, with repetitions) of
       all the parsed cookies.

       With the $key argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
       matching body param.  In list context it returns all matching body
       params.

       body() will throw an APR::Request::Error object whenever body_status()
       is non-zero and the return value is potentially invalid (eg "scalar
       $req->body($key)" will not die if the desired body param was
       successfully parsed).

           $body = $req->body;
           @body_names = $req->body;
           ok $body->isa("APR::Request::Param::Table");
           ok shift @body_names eq $_ for keys %$body;

           $alpha = $req->body("alpha");
           @beta = $req->body("beta");

   param
           $req->param()
           $req->param($key)

       With no arguments, this method returns a tied
       APR::Request::Param::Table object (or undef, if the query string and
       request body are absent) in scalar context, or the names (in order,
       with repetitions) of all the incoming (args + body) params.

       With the $key argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
       matching param.  In list context it returns all matching params.

       param() will throw an APR::Request::Error object whenever
       param_status() is non-zero and the return value is potentially invalid
       (eg "scalar $req->param($key)" will not die if the desired param was
       successfully parsed).

           $param = $req->param;
           @param_names = $req->param;
           ok $param->isa("APR::Request::Param::Table");
           ok shift @param_names eq $_ for keys %$param;

           $foo = $req->param("foo");
           @foo = $req->param("foo");

   upload
           $req->upload()
           $req->upload($key)

       With no arguments, this method returns a tied
       APR::Request::Param::Table object (or undef if the request body is
       absent) in scalar context (whose entries are APR::Request::Param
       objects), or the names (in order, with repetitions) of all the incoming
       uploads.

       With the $key argument, in scalar context this method fetches the first
       matching upload.  In list context it returns all matching uploads.  The
       return values are APR::Request::Param objects.

       upload() will throw an APR::Request::Error object whenever
       body_status() is non-zero.

           $uploads = $req->upload;
           @upload_names = $req->upload;
           ok $uploads->isa("APR::Request::Param::Table");
           ok shift @upload_names eq $_ for keys %$uploads;
           ok $_->upload for values %$uploads;

           $up = $req->upload("beta");
           @ups = $req->upload("beta");
           ok $_->isa("APR::Request::Param") for $up, @ups;
           ok $_->upload for $up, @ups;

   read_limit
           $req->read_limit()
           $req->read_limit($set)

       Get/set the read limit, which controls the total amount of bytes that
       can be fed to the current parser.

   brigade_limit
           $req->brigade_limit()
           $req->brigade_limit($set)

       Get/set the brigade_limit for the current parser.  This limit
       determines how many bytes of a file upload that the parser may spool
       into main memory.  Uploads exceeding this limit are written directly to
       disk.

   temp_dir
           $req->temp_dir()
           $req->temp_dir($set)

       Get/set the spool directory for uploads which exceed the configured
       brigade_limit.

   disable_uploads
           $req->disable_uploads()

       Engage the disable_uploads hook for this request.

   upload_hook
           $req->upload_hook($callback)

       Add an upload hook callback for this request.  The arguments to the
       $callback sub are ($upload, $new_data).

   import
       Exports a list of subs into the caller's package.

SUBROUTINES
       APR::Request

   encode
           encode($string)

       Exportable sub which returns the url-encoded form of $string.

   decode
           decode($string)

       Exportable sub which returns the url-decoded form of $string.

SUBCLASSING
       APR::Request

       If the instances of your subclass are hash references then you can
       actually inherit from APR::Request as long as the APR::Request object
       is stored in an attribute called "r" or "_r". (The APR::Request class
       effectively does the delegation for you automagically, as long as it
       knows where to find the APR::Request object to delegate to.)  For
       example:

               package MySubClass;
               use APR::Request::Custom;
               our @ISA = qw(APR::Request);
               sub new {
                   my($class, @args) = @_;
                   return bless { r => APR::Request::Custom->handle(@args) }, $class;
               }

METHODS
         APR::Request::Cookie::Table - read-only version of APR::Table.

       Tables in this class normally arise from calls to APR::Request::jar().

   cookie_class
           $table->cookie_class()
           $table->cookie_class($set)

       Get/set the class each table element is blessed into during a get or
       FETCH call.  If defined, the class must be derived from
       APR::Request::Cookie.  When called with $set, it returns the $table.
       Otherwise it returns the name of the current class, or undef if no
       cookie class is defined.

   get
           $table->get($key)

       Same as FETCH.

   FETCH
           $table->FETCH($key)

       In scalar context, this returns the first value matching $key (note:
       see NEXTKEY for additional notes).  The match is always case-
       insensitive.  In list context, this returns all matching values.  Note:
       the type of the return values depends on the table's current
       cookie_class.

   EXISTS
       Synonym for "defined"; these tables are not allowed to contain
       undefined values. Since these are constant tables, they don't
       autovivify either.

   FIRSTKEY
           $table->FIRSTKEY()

       Returns the first key in the table.

   NEXTKEY
           $table->NEXTKEY()

       Returns the next key in the table.  For perl 5.8+, if the key is
       multivalued, a subsequent FETCH on this key will return the
       corresponding value, until either NEXTKEY or FIRSTKEY is invoked again.
       For perl 5.6, FETCH always returns the first value.

   do
           $table->do($callback, @keys)

       Same as APR::Table::do; iterates over the table calling
       $callback->($key, $value) for each matching @keys.  If @keys is empty,
       this iterates over the entire table.

       Note: The type of $value inserted into the callback depends on the
       table's current cookie_class.

METHODS
       APR::Request::Param::Table

   param_class
           $table->param_class()
           $table->param_class($set)

       Get/set the class each table element is blessed into during a "get" or
       "FETCH" call.  If defined, the class must be derived from
       APR::Request::Param.  When called with $set, it returns the $table.
       Otherwise it returns the name of the current class, or undef if no
       param class is defined.

   get
           $table->get($key)

       Same as FETCH.

   FETCH
           $table->FETCH($key)

       In scalar context, this returns the first value matching $key (see
       NEXTKEY for additional notes on this).  The match is always case-
       insensitive.  In list context, this returns all matching values.  Note:
       the type of the return values depends on the table's current
       param_class.

   EXISTS
       Synonym for "defined"; these tables are not allowed to contain
       undefined values. Since these are constant tables, they don't
       autovivify either.

   NEXTKEY
           $table->NEXTKEY()

       Returns the next key in the table.  For perl 5.8+, if the key is
       multivalued, a subsequent FETCH on this key will return the
       corresponding value, until either NEXTKEY or FIRSTKEY is invoked again.
       For perl 5.6, FETCH always returns the first value.

   FIRSTKEY
           $table->FIRSTKEY()

       Returns the first key in the table.

   do
           $table->do($callback, @keys)

       Same as APR::Table::do; iterates over the table calling
       $callback->($key, $value) for each matching @keys.  If @keys is empty,
       this iterates over the entire table.

       Note: The type of $value inserted into the callback depends on the
       table's current value_class.
