GETLOADAVG(3)          FreeBSD Library Functions Manual          GETLOADAVG(3)

NAME
     getloadavg – get system load averages

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     int
     getloadavg(double loadavg[], int nelem);

DESCRIPTION
     The getloadavg() function returns the number of processes in the system
     run queue averaged over various periods of time.  Up to nelem samples are
     retrieved and assigned to successive elements of loadavg[].  The system
     imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages over the last 1, 5,
     and 15 minutes, respectively.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the load average was unobtainable, -1 is returned; otherwise, the
     number of samples actually retrieved is returned.
