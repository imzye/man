NAME
       MathML::Entities - Convert XHTML+MathML Named Entities to Numeric
       Character References

SYNOPSIS
        use MathML::Entities;

        $html    = '<b>&copy;</b> by me';

        # convert named HTML entities to character references:
        $numeric = name2numbered($html);    # <b>&#x000A9;</b> by me

        # convert named HTML entities to character references:
        $utf8 = name2utf8($html);    # utf8

DESCRIPTION
       MathML::Entities a content conversion filter for named XHTML+MathML
       entities. There are over two thousand named entities in the
       XHTML+MathML DTD. All the Entities defined in the XHTML+MathML DTD
       except the five "safe" ones ("&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", "&quot;",
       "&apos;"), will be converted to the equivalent numeric character
       references or to utf-8 characters.  Named entities which are not in the
       XHTML+MathML DTD are escaped. This makes the resulting XHTML (or
       XHTML+MathML) safe for consumption by non-validating XML parsers.

       Unlike, HTML::Entities, the mapping between MathML named entities and
       codepoints is many-to-one. Therefore, there's no particular sense in
       having an inverse function, which takes codepoints to named entities.

       Based on: HTML::Entities by Koichi Taniguchi <taniguchi@livedoor.jp>

FUNCTIONS
       The following functions are exported by default.

       •   name2numbered

           XHTML+MathML named entities (except for the five "safe" XML named
           entities) in the argument of name2numbered() are replaced by the
           corresponding numbered character references.

       •   name2utf8

           XHTML+MathML named entities (except for the five "safe" XML named
           entities) in the argument of name2utf8() are replaced by the
           corresponding utf-8 characters.
