ACPI_TOSHIBA(4)        FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual        ACPI_TOSHIBA(4)

NAME
     acpi_toshiba – Toshiba HCI interface

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device acpi_toshiba

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           acpi_toshiba_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     HCI is Toshiba's Hardware Control Interface which is somewhat uniform
     across their models.  The acpi_toshiba driver allows the user to
     manipulate HCI-controlled hardware using a number of sysctl(8) variables.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following sysctls are currently implemented:

     hw.acpi.toshiba.force_fan
             Causes active cooling to be forcibly enabled (‘1’) or disabled
             (‘0’) regardless of the current temperature.

     hw.acpi.toshiba.video_output
             Sets the active display to use according to a bitwise OR of the
             following:

             0       No display
             1       LCD
             2       CRT
             4       TV-Out

             Only some systems (i.e., the Libretto L5) support video switching
             via this hardware-specific driver.  Use the acpi_video(4) driver
             for generic video output support.

     hw.acpi.toshiba.lcd_brightness
             Makes the LCD backlight brighter or dimmer (higher values are
             brighter).

     hw.acpi.toshiba.lcd_backlight
             Turns the LCD backlight on and off.

     hw.acpi.toshiba.cpu_speed
             Sets the CPU speed to the specified speed.  This provides
             functionality similar to the hw.acpi.cpu.throttle_state variable.
             Higher sysctl values mean lower CPU speeds.

     Defaults for these variables can be set in sysctl.conf(5), which is
     parsed at boot-time.

LOADER TUNABLES
     The hw.acpi.toshiba.enable_fn_keys tunable enables or disables the
     function keys on the keyboard.  Function keys are enabled by default.

     This behaviour can be changed at the loader(8) prompt or in
     loader.conf(5).
