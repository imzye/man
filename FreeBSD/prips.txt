PRIPS(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               PRIPS(1)

NAME
     prips – print the IP addresses in a given range

SYNOPSIS
     prips [-c] [-d delim] [-e exclude] [-f format] [-i incr] start end
     prips [-c] [-d delim] [-e exclude] [-f format] [-i incr] CIDR-block
     prips -h

DESCRIPTION
     The prips tool can be used to print all of the IP addresses in a given
     range.  It can enhance tools that only work on one host at a time, e.g.
     whois(1).

     The prips tool accepts the following command-line options:

     -c      Print the range in CIDR notation.

     -d delim
             Set the delimiter to the character with ASCII code delim where 0
             <= delim <= 255.

     -e <x.x.x,x.x>
             Exclude ranges from the output.

     -f format
             Set the format of addresses (hex, dec, or dot).

     -h      Show summary of options.

     -i incr
             Set the increment to 'x'.

ENVIRONMENT
     The prips tool's operation is not influenced by any environment
     variables.

FILES
     The prips tool's operation is not influenced by any files.

EXAMPLES
     Display all the addresses in a reserved subnet:

           prips 192.168.32.0 192.168.32.255

     The same, using CIDR notation:

           prips 192.168.32.0/24

     Display only the usable addresses in a class A reserved subnet using a
     space instead of a newline for a delimiter:

           prips -d 32 10.0.0.1 10.255.255.255

     Display every fourth address in a weird block:

           prips -i 4 192.168.32.7 192.168.33.5

     Determine the smallest CIDR block containing two addresses:

           prips -c 192.168.32.5 192.168.32.11

DIAGNOSTICS
     The prips utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
