TITS(8)                 FreeBSD System Manager's Manual                TITS(8)

NAME
     tits Tiny Terminal Server

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/local/sbin/tits [config-file]

DESCRIPTION
     The tits command is a server process which provides telnet(1) or raw
     access to one or more tty ports as specified in config-file (or
     /usr/local/etc/tits.conf if no configuration file is specified on the
     command line).

     Any number of telnet(1) or raw clients may connect to a single tits port.
     Each client will see exactly the same output as well as being able to
     send keystrokes simultaneously.

     tits implements access control using the hosts_access(5) framework to
     filter incoming network connections.  The service name used to look up
     each port in the hosts_access(5) database is dependent on how the port is
     specified in the config-file.  If a numerical port is specified, the
     service name is the final component of the pathname used to invoke the
     program. Thus, this will be tits in normal operation.  If the port is
     specified using a service which needs to be looked up in /etc/services,
     this service name is used when checking the host_access(5) database.

     tits multiplexes the data streams between all configured tty ports and
     connected clients within a single process. Thus, it minimises system
     context switching overhead when there is a high I/O load.

     tits also features a reverse telnet server which can be used to multiplex
     telnet(1) connections to another terminal server which is limited to a
     single telnet(1) connection at any one time. In conjunction with a
     masterpty client, the reverse telnet server can connect a remote terminal
     server to a psuedo-tty device on the local system.

BUGS
     Only a tiny subset of the telnet protocol specified in the above RFCs is
     implemented.

     At this time, there is no `Control Port' providing supervisory functions
     for managing a tits process at runtime.
