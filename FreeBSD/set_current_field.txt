form_page(3X)                                                    form_page(3X)



NAME
       form_page - set and get form page number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>
       int set_current_field(FORM *form, FIELD *field);
       FIELD *current_field(const FORM *);
       int unfocus_current_field(FORM *form);
       int set_form_page(FORM *form, int n);
       int form_page(const FORM *form);
       int field_index(const FIELD *field);

DESCRIPTION
       The function set_current_field sets the current field of the given
       form; current_field returns the current field of the given form.

       The function unfocus_current_field removes the focus from the current
       field of the form.  In such state, inquiries via current_field shall
       return a NULL pointer.

       The function set_form_page sets the form's page number (goes to page n
       of the form).

       The function form_page returns the form's current page number.

       The function field_index returns the index of the field in the field
       array of the form it is connected to.  It returns ERR if the argument
       is the null pointer or the field is not connected.

RETURN VALUE
       Except for form_page, each routine returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
            Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_BAD_STATE
            Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.

       E_INVALID_FIELD
            Contents of a field are not valid.

       E_REQUEST_DENIED
            The form driver could not process the request.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
            System error occurred (see errno(3)).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The header file <form.h> automatically includes the header file
       <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
       supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

       The unfocus_current_field function is an ncurses extension.
