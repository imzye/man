NAME
       Browser::Open - open a browser in a given URL

VERSION
       version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
           use Browser::Open qw( open_browser );

           ### Try commands specific to the current Operating System
           my $ok = open_browser($url);
           # ! defined($ok): no recognized command found
           # $ok == 0: command found and executed
           # $ok != 0: command found, error while executing

           ### Try all known commands
           my $ok = open_browser($url, 1);

DESCRIPTION
       The functions optionaly exported by this module allows you to open URLs
       in the user browser.

       A set of known commands per OS-name is tested for presence, and the
       first one found is executed. With an optional parameter, all known
       commands are checked.

       The "open_browser" uses the system() function to execute the command.
       If you want more control, you can get the command with the
       "open_browser_cmd" or "open_browser_cmd_all" functions and then use
       whatever method you want to execute it.

API
       All functions are not exported by default. You must ask for them
       explicitly.

   open_browser
           my $ok = open_browser($url, $all);

       Find an appropriate command and executes it with your $url. If $all is
       false, the default, only commands that match the current OS will be
       tested. If true, all known commands will be tested.

       If no command was found, returns "undef".

       If a command is found, returns the exit code of the execution attempt,
       0 for success. See the system() for more information about this exit
       code.

       If no $url is given, an exception will be thrown: "Missing required
       parameter $url".

   open_browser_cmd
           my $cmd = open_browser_cmd();

       Returns the best command found to open a URL on your system.

       If no command was found, returns "undef".

   open_browser_cmd_all
           my $cmd = open_browser_cmd_all();

       Returns the first command found to open a URL.

       If no command was found, returns "undef".
