alevtd(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              alevtd(1)

NAME
       alevtd - webserver for videotext pages

SYNOPSIS
       alevtd [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       alevtd is http daemon which serves videotext pages as HTML.  Tune in
       some station with a utility like v4lctl or some TV application.  Then
       start it and point your browser to http://localhost:5654/

       Pages may be requested either in HTML format
       (http://localhost:5654/<page>/ or
       http://localhost:5654/<page>/<subpage>.html) or in ASCII text format
       (http://localhost:5654/<page>/<subpage>.txt).  Subpage "00" can be used
       for pages without subpages.

OPTIONS
       -h     print a short help text and the default values for all options.

       -v dev set vbi device (default: /dev/vbi0).

       -d     enable debug output.

       -s     Write a start/stop notice and serious errors to the syslog.
              Specify this option twice to get a verbose log (additional log
              events like dropped connections).

       -t sec set network timeout to >sec< seconds.

       -c n   set the number of allowed parallel connections to >n<.  This is
              a per-thread limit.

       -p port
              listen on port >port< for incoming connections.  Default 5654.

       -n hostname
              set the hostname which the server should use (required for
              redirects).

       -i ip  bind to IP-address >ip<.

       -l log log all requests to the logfile >log< (common log format).
              Using "-" as filename makes alevtd print the access log to
              stdout, which is only useful together with the -F switch (see
              below).

       -L log same as above, but additional flush every line.  Useful if you
              want monitor the logfile with tail -f.

       -u user
              set uid to >user< (after binding to the tcp port).  This option
              is allowed for root only.

       -g group
              set gid to >group< (after binding to the tcp port).  This option
              is allowed for root only.

       -F     don't run as daemon.  alevtd will not fork into background, not
              detach from terminal and report errors to stderr.

       -r     poll tv frequency, clear vtx page cache if a frequency change
              was detected.
