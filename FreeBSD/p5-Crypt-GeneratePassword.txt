Crypt::GeneratePassword(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Crypt::GeneratePassword - generate secure random pronounceable
       passwords

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::GeneratePassword qw(word chars);
         $word = word($minlen,$maxlen);
         $word = chars($minlen,$maxlen);
         *Crypt::GeneratePassword::restrict = \&my_restriction_filter;
         *Crypt::GeneratePassword::random_number = \&my_random_number_generator;

DESCRIPTION
       Crypt::GeneratePassword generates random passwords that are (more or
       less) pronounceable. Unlike Crypt::RandPasswd, it doesn't use the
       FIPS-181 NIST standard, which is proven to be insecure. It does use a
       similar interface, so it should be a drop-in replacement in most cases.

       If you want to use passwords from a different language than english,
       you can use one of the packaged alternate unit tables or generate your
       own. See below for details.

       For details on why FIPS-181 is insecure and why the solution used in
       this module is reasonably secure, see "A New Attack on Random
       Pronounceable Password Generators" by Ravi Ganesan and Chris Davies,
       available online in may places - use your favourite search engine.

       This module improves on FIPS-181 using a true random selection with the
       word generator as mere filter. Other improvements are better
       pronounceability using third order approximation instead of second
       order and multi-language support.  Drawback of this method is that it
       is usually slower. Then again, computer speed has improved a little
       since 1977.

Functions
   chars
         $word = chars($minlen, $maxlen [, $set [, $characters, $maxcount ] ... ] );

       Generates a completely random word between $minlen and $maxlen in
       length.  If $set is given, it must be an array ref of characters to
       use. You can restrict occurrence of some characters by providing
       ($characters, $maxcount) pairs, as many as you like. $characters must
       be a string consisting of those characters which may appear at most
       $maxcount times in the word.

       Note that the length is determined via relative probability, not
       uniformly.

   word
         $word = word($minlen, $maxlen [, $lang [, $numbers [, $caps [, $minfreq, $avgfreq ] ] ] );
         $word = word3($minlen, $maxlen [, $lang [, $numbers [, $caps [, $minfreq, $avgfreq ] ] ] );

       Generates a random pronounceable word. The length of the returned word
       will be between $minlen and $maxlen. If you supply a non-zero value for
       $numbers, up to that many numbers and special characters will occur in
       the password. If you specify a non-zero value for $caps, up to this
       many characters will be upper case. $lang is the language description
       to use, loaded via load_language or built-in. Built-in languages are:
       'en' (english) and 'de' (german). Contributions welcome. The default
       language is 'en' but may be changed by calling load_language with a
       true value as third parameter. Pass undef as language to select the
       current default language. $minfreq and $minsum determine quality of the
       password: $minfreq and $avgfreq are the minimum frequency each
       quad/trigram must have and the average frequency that the quad/trigrams
       must have for a word to be selected. Both are values between 0.0 and
       1.0, specifying the percentage of the maximum frequency. Higher values
       create less secure, better pronounceable passwords and are slower.
       Useful $minfreq values are usually between 0.001 and 0.0001, useful
       $avgfreq values are around 0.05 for trigrams (word3) and 0.001 for
       quadgrams (word).

   analyze
         $ratio = analyze($count,@word_params);
         $ratio = analyze3($count,@word_params);

       Returns a statistical(!) security ratio to measure password quality.
       $ratio is the ratio of passwords chosen among all possible ones, e.g. a
       ratio of 0.0149 means 1.49% of the theoretical password space was
       actually considered a pronounceable password. Since this analysis is
       only statistical, it proves absolutely nothing if you are deeply
       concerned about security - but in that case you should use chars(), not
       word() anyways. In reality, it says a lot about your chosen parameters
       if you use large values for $count.

   generate_language
         $language_description = generate_language($wordlist);

       Generates a language description which can be saved in a file and/or
       loaded with load_language. $wordlist can be a string containing
       whitespace separated words, an array ref containing one word per
       element or a file handle or name to read words from, one word per
       line7.  Alternatively, you may pass an array directly, not as
       reference.  A language description is about 1MB in size.

       If you generate a general-purpose language description for a language
       not yet built-in, feel free to contribute it for inclusion into this
       package.

   load_language
         load_language($language_description, $name [, $default]);

       Loads a language description which is then available in words().
       $language_description is a string returned by generate_language, $name
       is a name of your choice which is used to select this language as the
       fifth parameter of words(). You should use the well-known ISO two
       letter language codes if possible, for best interoperability.

       If you specify $default with a true value, this language will be made
       global default language. If you give undef as $language_description,
       only the default language will be changed.

   random_number
         $number = random_number($limit);

       Returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and $limit (exclusive).
       Change this to a function of your choice by doing something like this:

           sub my_rng ($) {
               ...
           }

           {
             # suppress warning about function being redefined
             no warnings 'redefine';
             *Crypt::GeneratePassword::random_number = \&my_rng;
           }

       The default implementation uses perl's rand(), which might not be
       appropriate for some sites.

   restrict
         $forbidden = restrict($word,$language);

       Filters undesirable words. Returns false if the $word is allowed in
       language $lang, false otherwise. Change this to a function of your
       choice by doing something like this:

           sub my_filter ($$) {
               ...
           }

           {
             no warnings 'redefine';
             *Crypt::GeneratePassword::restrict = \&my_filter;
           }

       The default implementation scans for a few letter sequences that
       english or german people might find offending, mostly because of their
       sexual nature. You might want to hook up a regular password checker
       here, or a wordlist comparison.
