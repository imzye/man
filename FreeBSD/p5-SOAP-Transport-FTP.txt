SOAP::Transport::FTP(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


SOAP::Transport::FTP
       FTP Client support for SOAP::Lite.

       The SOAP::Transport::FTP module is automatically loaded by the
       SOAP::Transport portion of the client structure. It is brought in when
       an endpoint is specified via the proxy method that starts with the
       characters, ftp://. This module provides only a client class.

   SOAP::Transport::FTP::Client
       Inherits from: SOAP::Client.

       Support is provided for clients to connect to FTP servers using SOAP.
       The methods defined within the class are just the basic new and
       send_receive.

BUGS
       This module is currently unmaintained, so if you find a bug, it's yours
       - you probably have to fix it yourself. You could also become
       maintainer - just send an email to mkutter@cpan.org
