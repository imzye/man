DEVMATCH(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            DEVMATCH(8)

NAME
     devmatch – print information about unattached devices

SYNOPSIS
     devmatch [-adhpuv] [--all] [--dump] [--hints file] [--nomatch event]
              [--unbound] [--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
     The devmatch utility, without any arguments, prints all the kernel
     modules it has found for all the unattached, enabled devices in the
     system.

     -a --all              Include all devices, not just the ones that are
                           unattached.

     -d --dump             Produce a human readable dump of the linker.hints
                           file.

     -h --hints file       Use the named file instead of linker.hints guessed
                           from the current module load path.

     -p --nomatch event    Parse and use a standard NOMATCH event from devd(8)
                           for matching instead of searching the device tree.

     -u --unbound          Attempt to produce a list of those drivers with PNP
                           info whose driver tables with that PNP info can't
                           be found.

     -v --verbose          Produce more verbose output.

BUGS
     The kernel has hints in it, but we exclude it from the list of modules to
     suggest for unmatched devices.  We exclude it when suggesting drivers,
     but include it when looking for unbound devices or producing a full dump
     of linker.hints.  This can be confusing.

     Some modules are hard links in /boot/kernel and will be reported twice.

     The PNP string's attributes are evaluated once per PNP entry on that bus
     rather than once.

     The term PNP is overloaded in FreeBSD.  It means, generically, the
     identifying data the bus provides about a device.  While this include old
     ISA PNP identifiers, it also includes the logical equivalent in USB, PCI,
     and others.

     Many drivers currently lack proper PNP table decorations and need to be
     updated.
