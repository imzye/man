DESCRIPTION
       Swatchdog is designed to monitor system activity.  In order for
       Swatchdog to be useful, it requires a configuration file which contains
       pattern(s) to look for and action(s) to perform when each pattern is
       found.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       --awk-field-syntax
           Use this option only if you want to overide regular expression
           backreferencing in favor of awk(1) style field referencing.
           Included for backward compatability.

       --config-file|-c filename
           Tells swatchdog where to find its configuration file. The default
           is ${HOME}/.swatchdogrc.

       --daemon
           This tells swatchdog to run in the background and disassociate
           itself from any terminal.

       --extra-include-dir|-I path
           This tells swatchdog where to look for custom action modules.

       --extra-module|-M module_name
           This tells swatchdog what custom action modules to load in.

       --help|-h
           Prints usage information and exits.

       --input-record-separator=regular_expression
           Tells swatchdog to use regular_expression to delineate the boundary
           of each input record. The default is a carriage return.

       --old-style-config|-O
           This tells swatchdog that your configuration file is written using
           the syntax that was abandoned back in the 1990's.

       --pid-file file
           Writes the process ID to file. Useful when running in daemon mode.

       --restart-time=[+]hh:mm[am|pm] or -r [+]hh:mm[am|pm]
           Restart at the specified time where hh is hours and mm is minutes.
           If the am/pm indicator is omitted, then a 24-hour clock is assumed.
           If the time is preceded by the "+" character, then the restart time
           will be set to the current time plus the specified time and the
           am/pm indicator will be ignored.

       --script-dir=/path/to/directory
           This switch causes the temporary watcher script to be written to a
           file in the specified directory rather than the user's home
           directory. It is highly advised that you do NOT use directories
           that are writable by others such as /tmp.

       --tail-args arguments_for_tail_program
           Pass specific options to the tail(1) program.

       --tail-program-name filename
           Runs an alternate tail(1) like program instead of the system
           default.

       --version or -V
           Prints version information and exits.

       --use-cpan-file-tail
           Use CPAN's File::Tail module to read the log file instead of the
           tail(1) command.

       You may specify only one of the following options:

       --tail-file=filename or -t filename
           Examine lines of text as they are added to filename.

       --read-pipe=command or -p command
           Examine input piped in from the command.

       --examine=filename or -f filename
           Use filename as the file to examine.  Swatchdog will do a single
           pass through the named file.

       The following options are purely for debugging purposes, but are
       documented here for completeness:

       --debug[=level]
           Spew out various levels of debugging for swatchdog developers.

       --dump-script[=filename]
           Instead of running the watcher script after it is generated, it is
           written to filename or to STDOUT.

       If swatchdog is called with no options, it is the same as typing the
       command line

               swatchdog --config-file=~/.swatchdogrc --tail-file=/var/log/syslog

       or if /var/log/messages exists

               swatchdog --config-file=~/.swatchdogrc --tail-file=/var/log/messages

THE CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file is used by the swatchdog(8) program to determine
       what types of expression patterns to look for and what type of
       action(s) should be taken when a pattern is matched.

       Each line should contain a keyword and a, sometimes optional, value for
       that keyword. The keyword and value are separated by a space or an
       equal (=) sign.

       watchfor regex

       ignore regex

       echo [modes]
           Echo the matched line. The text mode may be normal, bold,
           underscore, blink, inverse, black, red, green, yellow, blue,
           magenta, cyan, white, black_h, red_h, green_h, yellow_h, blue_h,
           magenta_h, cyan_h, and/or white_h. The _h colors specify a
           highlighting color. The other colors are assigned to the letters.
           Some modes may not work on some terminals. Normal is the default.

       bell [N]
           Echo the matched line, and send a bell N times (default = 1).

       exec command
           Execute command. The command may contain variables which are
           substituted with fields from the matched line. A $N will be
           replaced by the Nth field in the line. A $0 or $* will be replaced
           by the entire line.

       mail [addresses=address:address:...][,subject=your_text_here]
           Send mail to address(es) containing the matched lines as they
           appear (default address is the user who is running the program).

       pipe command[,keep_open]
           Pipe matched lines into command. Use the keep_open option to force
           the pipe to stay open until a different pipe action is run or until
           swatchdog exits.

       write [user:user:...]
           Use write(1) to send matched lines to user(s).

       throttle hours:minutes:seconds,[key=message|regex|<regexE]>
           This action has been depreciated. Use threshold instead For
           example,

               throttle 15:00,key="foo"

           would look like this

               threshold track_by="foo",type=limit,count=1,seconds=900

       threshold track_by=key, type=<limit|threshold|both, count=number,
       seconds=number>
           Thresholding can be done for the complete watchfor block and/or for
           individual actions. Add "threshold=on" as an option along with the
           other threshold options when thresholding an individual action.

           track_by
               The value of this should be something that is unique to the
               watchfor regular expression. Tip: enclose unique parts of the
               regular expression in parentheses, then use the sub matches as
               part of the value (e.g. track_by="$2:$4").

           type
               There are three types of thresholding. They are as follows:

               limit
                   Perform action(s) for the first "count" matches during the
                   time interval specified by "seconds", then ignore events
                   for the rest of the time interval (kind of like throttle)

               threshold
                   Perform action(s) on each match for up to count matches
                   during the time interval specified by seconds

               both
                   Perform actions(s) once per time interval after "count"
                   matches occur, then ignore additional matches during the
                   time interval specified by "seconds"

       continue
           Use this action to cause swatchdog to continue to try to match
           other pattern/action groups after it is done with the current
           pattern/action block.

       quit
           Use this action to cause swatchdog to clean up and quit
           immediately.

SPECIAL OPTION
       The following may be used as an option for any of the above actions
       except for throttle and threshold.

       when=day_of_week:hour_of_day
           Use this option to specify windows of time and days when the action
           can be performed.  For example:

               mail=sysad-pager@somehost.somedomain,when=1-6:8-17

FOR PERL HACKS ONLY
       perlcode [depth] arbitrary_Perl_code
           This permits you to easily insert random Perl code into your
           swatchdogrc file.  The optional depth value tells swatchdog how
           deep into the code to put the perl code. (0=outside the main loop,
           1=inside the main loop (default), 2=just inside the conditional
           used by the current watchfor statement, and 3=inside the throttle
           block).

           Its intended use is to permit variable substitution. For example:

               perlcode $syslog="^\w{3}\s+\d{1,2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.*";

               watchfor /$syslog hostname pppd/>

           but any valid Perl is permitted.  Remember the semicolon, and make
           judicious use of the --dump-script option if you run into trouble.

CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE
       In this example, a line which contains the string "file system full"
       will be echoed and the screen bell will sound.  Also, threshold will
       use what is matched within the parentheses as its key rather than
       trying to use the log message with its time stamp cut out. Multiple
       instances of the message will not be echoed if they appear within a
       minute of the first one. Instead the following message will be acted
       upon after the time interval has expired.

       signal(3), perl(1), perlre(1)

NOTES
       Upon receiving an ALRM or HUP signal swatchdog will re-read the
       configuration file and restart, except when used with the --daemon
       command line option where it will simply exit.  Swatchdog will
       terminate gracefully when it receives a QUIT, TERM, or INT signal.
