NAME
       multiwatch - forks and watches multiple instances of a program in the
       same environment

SYNOPSIS
       multiwatch [options] -- <application> [app arguments]

       multiwatch -v

       multiwatch --help | -?

DESCRIPTION
       multiwatch is used to fork and watch multiple FastCGI backends.

OPTIONS
       -f, --forks=children
               Number of children to fork and watch (default 1)

       -r, --retry=retries
               Number of retries to fork a single child (default 3)

       -t, --timeout=msecs
               Retry timeout in ms; if the child dies after the timeout the
               retry counter is reset (default 10000 ms = 10 s)

       -s, --signal=signame
               Signal to send to children to signal 'graceful' termination
               (HUP,INT,QUIT,TERM,USR1,USR2, default is USR1)

       -?, --help
               General usage instructions

       -v, --version
               Show version and exit

SIGNAL HANDLING
       multiwatch will forward the signal USR2; if it receives
       HUP,INT,QUIT,TERM or USR1, it will send the signal from --signal to the
       children; if it receives another signal from that group, it will
       forward the signal again.

       A signal of the group HUP,INT,QUIT,TERM and USR1 tells multiwatch to go
       into "shutdown" mode, so it won't restart children after receiving it.

EXAMPLE
       Spawn 2 rails instances on the same FastCGI socket (and supervise
       them):
               spawn-fcgi -s /tmp/fastcgi-rails.sock -n -- /usr/bin/multiwatch
               -f 2 /home/rails/public/dispatch.fcgi
