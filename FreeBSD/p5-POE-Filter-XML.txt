NAME
       POE::Filter::XML - XML parsing for the POE framework

VERSION
       version 1.140700

SYNOPSIS
        use POE::Filter::XML;
        my $filter = POE::Filter::XML->new();

        my $wheel = POE::Wheel:ReadWrite->new(
               Filter          => $filter,
               InputEvent      => 'input_event',
        );

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Filter::XML provides POE with a completely encapsulated XML
       parsing strategy for POE::Wheels that will be dealing with XML streams.

       The parser is XML::LibXML

PUBLIC_ATTRIBUTES
   not_streaming
           is: ro, isa: Bool, default: false

       Setting the not_streaming attribute to true via new() will put this
       filter into non-streaming mode, meaning that whole documents are parsed
       before nodes are returned. This is handy for XMLRPC or other short
       documents.

PRIVATE_ATTRIBUTES
   buffer
           is: ro, isa: ArrayRef, traits: Array

       buffer holds the raw data to be parsed. Raw data should be split on
       network new lines before being added to the buffer. Access to this
       attribute is provided by the following methods:

           handles =>
           {
               has_buffer => 'count',
               all_buffer => 'elements',
               push_buffer => 'push',
               shift_buffer => 'shift',
               join_buffer => 'join',
           }

   callback
           is: ro, isa: CodeRef

       callback holds the CodeRef to be call in the event that there is an
       exception generated while parsing content. By default it holds a
       CodeRef that simply calls Carp::confess.

   handler
           is: ro, isa: POE::Filter::XML::Handler

       handler holds the SAX handler to be used for processing events from the
       parser.  By default POE::Filter::XML::Handler is instantiated and used.

       The "not_streaming" attribute is passed to the constructor of Handler.

   parser
           is: ro, isa: XML::LibXML

       parser holds an instance of the XML::LibXML parser. The "handler"
       attribute is passed to the constructor of XML::LibXML.

PUBLIC_METHODS
   get_one_start
           (ArrayRef $raw?)

       This method is part of the POE::Filter API. See "get_one_start" in
       POE::Filter for an explanation of its usage.

   get_one
           returns (ArrayRef)

       This method is part of the POE::Filter API. See "get_one" in
       POE::Filter for an explanation of its usage.

   put
           (ArrayRef $nodes) returns (ArrayRef)

       This method is part of the POE::Filter API. See "put" in POE::Filter
       for an explanation of its usage.

PROTECTED_METHODS
   reset
       reset() is an internal method that gets called when either a
       stream_start(1) POE::Filter::XML::Node gets placed into the filter via
       "put", or when a stream_end(1) POE::Filter::XML::Node is pulled out of
       the queue of finished Nodes via "get_one". This facilitates automagical
       behavior when using the Filter within the XMPP protocol that requires
       many new stream initiations.  This method is also called after every
       document when not in streaming mode.  Useful for handling XMLRPC
       processing.

       This method really should never be called outside of the Filter, but it
       is documented here in case the Filter is used outside of the POE
       context.

PRIVATE_METHODS
   BUILD
       A BUILD method is provided to parse the initial buffer (if any was
       included when constructing the filter).
