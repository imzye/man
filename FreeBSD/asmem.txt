DESCRIPTION
       The asmem is a X11 application that acts as a memory utilization
       monitor. It shows the current amount of memory and swap space, the free
       amounts of those, and the bars representing graphically the different
       types of memory.

       The display consists of two areas. The one above shows utilization of
       the memory, the one below - the utilization of the swap space. Each
       area contains a graphical bar that represents the percentage of the
       occupied space. For the memory utilization there are three bars:
       user/system memory used, buffer memory and cache memory. For the swap
       space only one bar showing the used space. Above each bar is the total
       amount of space, below the bar - the available space in kbytes and
       percents. If the memory amount is above 999999 kbytes the displays
       switches to Mbytes instead of kbytes.

       It is possible to force the display into Mbytes. You can also ask asmem
       to display the occupied memory amounts and percentages rather than
       those still available.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       -h or -H
              Prints a short description and usage message.

       -V
              Version control. Prints out the version of the program.

       -position [+|-]x[+|-]y
              Displays the window at the specified location on the screen.
              This works like the standard X Windows geometry option. (See
              XParseGeometry (3x)).

       -iconic
              Starts the asmem application in the iconized mode.  The icon has
              the same appearance with the main window.  When this option is
              given, the -position refers to the position of the icon window
              as well as the main window.

       -withdrawn
              Starts the asmem application in the withdrawn mode.  This option
              is necessary to be able to dock the asmem in the WindowMaker
              dock.  When this option is given, the -position refers to the
              position of the icon window as well as the main window.  asmem
              ignores the -iconic option when started in withdrawn mode.

       -standout
              This changes the appearance of the asmem display from "pushed-
              in" to "popped-out". The first is the default look.  The
              "popped-out" applets look much better in WindowMaker's dock
              according to some opinions. Give it a try in any case.

       -used
              By default asmem displays the amount of memory or swap space
              still left unused. This switch tells asmem to display the
              amounts of memory and swap space already in use.  This switch
              affects the percentages displayed in accordance.

       -asis
              Uses an alternative number for the display of the free memory.
              Or, rather, by default an alternative amount is used. When this
              switch is specified, the applet displays the amount of memory
              free as reported by the /proc/meminfo. Sometimes this is not
              really helpful since the occupied memory includes the file
              system cache and the buffers space. When this switch is not
              specified asmem will add the cache space and the buffer space to
              the amount of the actual free memory since both of those may be
              discarded by the OS to free up some memory for the programs.

       -free
              Exactly the same as -asis. Provided for backward compatibility.
              Obsolete. Do not use. Use -asis instead.

       -mb
              Force the display in MBytes instead of kilobytes even if the
              numbers would fit into the window.

       -u <update rate>
              Changes the polling rate for updating the memory utilization
              information.  The update rate is specified in seconds. The value
              of 1 is the minimum. Default value is 1 second.

       -dev <device>
              The device that should be polled for the memory utilization
              information. On Linux, this defaults to /proc/meminfo

       -display <name>
              The name of the display to start the window in.  It works just
              as X Windows display option.

       -bg <color>
              Changes the color of the background of the applet.  Default
              colour is #303030.

       -fg <color>
              Changes the color of the foreground of the applet.  Default
              colour is #20b2aa.

       -memory <color>
              Changes the color of the bar that represents the used memory
              amount.  Default colour is #4141d7.

       -buffer <color>
              Changes the color of the bar that represents the memory used for
              buffers.  Default colour is #aa80aa.

       -cache <color>
              Changes the color of the bar that represents the memory used for
              caching.  Default colour is #bebebe.

       -swap <color>
              Changes the color of the bar that represents the swap space
              utilization level.  Default colour is #ffa649.

INVOCATION
       asmem can be called in different ways.  The most common invocation is
       the command line:

            user@host[1]% asmem -bg blue -fg white &

       Another way to call asmem is from the window manager:

            *Wharf "asmem" nil Swallow "asmem" asmem &

       This line, when placed in the wharf file in the user's Afterstep
       configuration directory will cause asmem to be a button on the Wharf
       (1) button bar under the afterstep (1) window manager.

       If you run WindowMaker then you should use the "-withdrawn" option:

            user@host[1]% asmem -withdrawn -standout &

       and then drag the icon to the dock.

BUGS
       My programs do not have bugs, they just develop random features ;-)

       Well, there are limitations. All the strings for the color names,
       display name, and the geometry have the length limit of 50 characters
       (terminating zero included).  The string copying routine cuts the names
       that are longer.
