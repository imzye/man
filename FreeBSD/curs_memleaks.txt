NAME
       _nc_freeall, _nc_free_and_exit, _nc_free_tinfo - curses memory-leak
       checking

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       void exit_curses(int);
       void exit_terminfo(int);

       /* deprecated */
       void _nc_freeall(void);
       void _nc_free_and_exit(int);
       void _nc_free_tinfo(int);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions are used to simplify analysis of memory leaks in the
       ncurses library.

       Any implementation of curses must not free the memory associated with a
       screen, since (even after calling endwin), it must be available for use
       in the next call to refresh(3X).  There are also chunks of memory held
       for performance reasons.  That makes it hard to analyze curses
       applications for memory leaks.  When using the specially configured
       debugging version of the ncurses library, applications can call
       functions which free those chunks of memory, simplifying the process of
       memory-leak checking.

       Some of the functions are named with a “_nc_” prefix because they are
       not intended for use in the non-debugging library:

       _nc_freeall
            This frees (almost) all of the memory allocated by ncurses.

       _nc_free_and_exit
            This frees the memory allocated by ncurses (like _nc_freeall), and
            exits the program.  It is preferred over _nc_freeall since some of
            that memory may be required to keep the application running.
            Simply exiting (with the given exit-code) is safer.

       _nc_free_tinfo
            Use this function if only the low-level terminfo functions (and
            corresponding library) are used.  Like _nc_free_and_exit, it exits
            the program after freeing memory.

       The functions prefixed “_nc” are normally not available; they must be
       configured into the library at build time using the --disable-leaks
       option.  That compiles-in code that frees memory that normally would
       not be freed.

       The exit_curses and exit_terminfo functions call _nc_free_and_exit and
       _nc_free_tinfo if the library is configured to support memory-leak
       checking.  If the library is not configured to support memory-leak
       checking, they simply call exit.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions do not return a value.

PORTABILITY
       These functions are not part of X/Open Curses; nor do other
       implementations of curses provide a similar feature.
