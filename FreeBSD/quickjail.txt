QUICKJAIL(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           QUICKJAIL(1)

NAME
     quickjail, quickshell – Utility to spawn transient single-command jails

SYNOPSIS
     quickjail [-c] [param=value ...] command=command ...
     quickshell [-s] path

DESCRIPTION
     The quickjail command is used to create transient single-command jails in
     a reasonably secure manner.

     The key advantage to quickjail over jail(8) is the model that quickjail
     uses to execute command.  quickjail will fork and execute command in a
     non-persistent jail, while jail(8) will mark the jail as persistent and
     remove the jail when the child process is gone.  For some use-cases, this
     behavior is not ideal as it may potentially leave the jail behind
     depending on how the child command exits.

     If a path param is specified to quickjail, then quickjail will chdir(2)
     to this path before creating the jail with the same path.

     An optional flag, -c, is allowed if specified before any other
     parameters.  The -c flag is otherwise ignored.  This allows quickjail to
     maintain an interface compatible with jail(8) for the purposes of other
     tools, like bectl(8).

     The quickshell command is a simplified interface to quickjail
     specifically for running a shell in the alien path.  It defaults to
     sh(1), but that may be overridden by the QUICKSHELL environment variable.

     If the -s argument is supplied to quickshell, then it will use the SHELL
     environment variable instead of QUICKSHELL.

     quickshell explicitly does not use the user's current shell because it is
     assumed that the path we are creating a jail at does not have the user's
     current shell.  This is the common case for the author of quickshell.

EXAMPLES
     quickjail path=/mnt command=/bin/sh

     quickjail name=qemu0 path=/mnt command=/bin/sh

     quickshell /mnt

SEE ALSO
     jail(8)

HISTORY
     quickjail was a quick-and-dirty hack to facilitate the author's testing
     of qemu usermode emulation.
