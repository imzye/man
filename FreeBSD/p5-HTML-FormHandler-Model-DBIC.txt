HTML::FormHandler::Generator::DBIC(3)      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       HTML::FormHandler::Generator::DBIC - form generator for DBIC

VERSION
       version 0.29

SYNOPSIS
          form_generator.pl --rs_name=Book --schema_name=BookDB::Schema::DB
                   --db_dsn=dbi:SQLite:t/db/book.db > BookForm.pm

DESCRIPTION
       Options:

         rs_name       -- Resultset Name
         schema_name   -- Schema Name
         db_dsn        -- dsn connect info
         class_prefix  -- [OPTIONAL] Prefix for generated classes (Default: '')
         label         -- [OPTIONAL] Flag to toggle generation of form labels (Default: 0)
         label_column  -- [OPTIONAL] Flag to toggle generation of dummy form labels_columns for type: 'select' (Default: 0)

       This package should be considered still experimental since the output,
       of the generated classes will be changed from time to time.  This
       should not impact the main usage for this module that we had in mind,
       that is generating the initial version of a FormHandler form class,
       copying it to the project and modifying it.

       This script is installed into the system with the rest of FormHandler.
