FENCE_ACK_MANUAL(8)                 cluster                FENCE_ACK_MANUAL(8)



NAME
       fence_ack_manual - a program to override fenced fencing operations


SYNOPSIS
       fence_ack_manual [OPTIONS] nodename


DESCRIPTION
       When fenced(8) fails to fence a node, it retries indefinately.
       fence_ack_manual(8) tells fenced to stop retrying and consider the node
       fenced.


       It is important that this only be done after the node has been manually
       turned off or prevented from writing to shared storage.  Without this
       manual action and verification, the storage that fencing protects may
       become corrupted.


       When fenced fences a node that has no fence devices defined in the
       cluster configuration, the fencing operation fails.  This failure will
       be repeated indefinately until fence_ack_manual is run by an operator
       to indicate the node is in a safe state to proceed.  (Defining no
       fencing devices for node is the equivalent of using the fence_manual
       agent in previous versions.)


OPTIONS
       -h     Print a help message describing available options, then exit.
