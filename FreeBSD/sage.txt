NAME
       sage -  The SDL library for OpenGL extensions.


DESCRIPTION
       #include <sage/sage.h>

       Sage is a small C library providing Open GL extensions to applications
       using SDL. It has been automatically generated from the glext.h header
       file from the OpenGL website. The Sage source package comes with the
       Perl scripts to generate new sources from updated glext.h files.

       Additionally, it provides a way of accessing the standard GL and GLU
       headers in a cross platform method. sage/GL.h and sage/GLU.h should be
       used in place of gl/GL.h and gl/GLU.h (or the equivalent on other
       platforms.)

       To use Sage, an application must first call sage_init once the OpenGL
       context has been created. This checks for the existence of each
       extension it knows about and links up the appropriate function
       pointers. The array sage_ext sets each exension that is found to 1, and
       0 otherwise. Applications should check the existence of the extension
       in sage_ext before using it.

       Extensions can then be used by their name as defined in the spec.

BUGS
       Sage does not check to see of the OpenGL context is valid.

       On some systems, the standard Open GL header causes problems with sage
       (namespace conflicts).

       Apparently some broken GL implmentations may report the existence of an
       extension, but not actually provide it. Sage will not detect this.
