HOSTS.EQUIV(5)            FreeBSD File Formats Manual           HOSTS.EQUIV(5)

NAME
     hosts.equiv, .rhosts – trusted remote host and user name data base

DESCRIPTION
     The hosts.equiv and .rhosts files contain information regarding trusted
     hosts and users on the network.  For each host a single line should be
     present with the following information:

     simple

           hostname [username]

     or the more verbose

           [+-][hostname|@netgroup] [[+-][username|@netgroup]]

     A “@” indicates a host by netgroup or user by netgroup.  A single “+”
     matches all hosts or users.  A host name with a leading “-” will reject
     all matching hosts and all their users.  A user name with leading “-”
     will reject all matching users from matching hosts.

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A “#”
     indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of the
     line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.

     Host names are specified in the conventional Internet DNS dotted-domains
     “.” (dot) notation using the inet_addr(3) routine from the Internet
     address manipulation library, inet(3).  Host names may contain any
     printable character other than a field delimiter, newline, or comment
     character.

     For security reasons, a user's .rhosts file will be ignored if it is not
     a regular file, or if it is not owned by the user, or if it is writable
     by anyone other than the user.

FILES
     /etc/hosts.equiv     The hosts.equiv file resides in /etc.
     $HOME/.rhosts        .rhosts file resides in $HOME.

EXAMPLES
           bar.com foo

     Trust user “foo” from host “bar.com”.

           +@allclient

     Trust all hosts from netgroup “allclient”.

           +@allclient -@dau

     Trust all hosts from netgroup “allclient” and their users except users
     from netgroup “dau”.
