Algorithm::MarkovChain(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Algorithm::MarkovChain - Object oriented Markov chain generator

SYNOPSIS
         use Algorithm::MarkovChain;

         my $chain = Algorithm::MarkovChain::->new();

         # learn about things from @symbols
         $chain->seed(symbols => \@symbols,
                      longest => 6);

         # attempt to tell me something about the sky
         my @newness = $chain->spew(length   => 20,
                                    complete => [ qw( the sky is ) ]);

DESCRIPTION
       Algorithm::MarkovChain is an implementation of the Markov Chain
       algorithm within an object container.

       It is implemented as a base class, "Algorithm::MarkovChain::Base", with
       storage implementations of a hash ("Algorithm::MarkovChain"), and an
       fairly memory efficent implementation using "glib"
       ("Algorithm::MarkovChain::GHash").  DBI and MLDBM-friendly versions are
       planned.

       Deriving alternate representations is intended to be straightforward.

METHODS
       Algorithm::MarkovChain::->new() or $obj->new()
           Creates a new instance of the Algorithm::MarkovChain class.

           Takes one optional parameter: "recover_symbols"

           "recover_symbols" has meaning if your symbols differ from their
           true values when stringifyed.  With this option enabled steps are
           taken to ensure that the original values for symbols are returned
           by the spew method.

       $obj->seed()
           Seeds the markov chains from an example symbol stream.

           Takes two parameters, one required "symbols", one optional
           "longest"

           "symbols" presents the symbols to seed from

           "longest" sets an upper limit on the longest chain to construct.
           (defaults to 4)

       $obj->spew()
           Uses the constructed chains to produce symbol streams

           Takes four optional parameters "complete", "length",
           "longest_subchain", "force_length", "stop_at_terminal" and
           "strict_start"

           "complete" provides a starting point for the generation of output.
           Note: the algorithm will discard elements of this list if it does
           not find a starting chain that matches it, this is infinite-loop
           avoidance.

           "length" specifies the minimum number of symbols desired (default
           is 30)

           "stop_at_terminal" directs the spew to stop chaining at the first
           terminal point reached

           "force_length" ensures you get exactly "length" symbols returned
           (note this overrides the behaviour of "stop_at_terminal")

           "strict_start" makes the spew operation always take a known start
           state rather than selecting a sequence at random

       $obj->increment_seen($sequence, $symbol)
           Increments the seeness of a symbol following a sequence.

       $obj->recompute($sequence)
           Recompute the probabilities for a branch of the tree.  Called
           towards the end of the seed operation for 'dirty' sequences.

   $obj->get_options($sequence)
       Returns possible next symbols and probablities as a hash.

TODO
       Documentation
           I need to explain Markov Chains, and flesh out the examples some
           more.

       Fix bugs/respond to feature requests
           Just email me <richardc@unixbeard.net> and I'll hit it with
           hammers...

BUGS
       Hopefully not, though if they probably arise from my not understanding
       Markov chaining as well as I thought I did when coding commenced.

       That or they're jst stupid mistakes :)

POD ERRORS
       Hey! The above document had some coding errors, which are explained

       Around line 180:
           You forgot a '=back' before '=head2'
