NAME
       arbitron - arbitron mailboxes

SYNOPSIS
       arbitron [ -C config-file ] [ -o ] [ -u ] [ -l ] [ -p months ]
                [ -d days | -D mmddyyyy[:mmddyyyy] ] mailbox...

DESCRIPTION
       Arbitron collects and reports readership statistics for mailboxes on
       the server.  It also optionally prunes the mailboxes of \Seen state for
       dormant users.

       Arbitron produces one line of output per mailbox, reporting the mailbox
       name followed by a space, followed by the number of readers (and if -u
       is specified, followed by a colon and a comma-separated list of the
       readers userids), and if -o is not specified, another space and the
       number of subscribers (and if -u is specified, followed by a colon and
       a comma-separated list of the subscribers userids).  IMPORTANT: This
       format is subject to change in future versions.

       Each "reader" is a distinct authentication identity which has "s"
       rights to the mailbox and which has SELECTed the mailbox within either
       the past days days or the specified date range.  Users are not counted
       as reading their own personal mailboxes.  Personal mailboxes are not
       reported unless there is at least one reader other than the mailboxes
       owner.

       Arbitron reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file
       unless specified otherwise by -C.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Read configuration options from config-file.

       -o     "old way" -- do not report subscribers.

       -u     Report userids in addition to the count(s).

       -l     Enable long reporting (comma delimited table consisting of mbox,
              userid, r/s, start time, end time).

       -d days
              Count as a reader an authentication identity which has SELECTed
              the mailbox within days days.  Default is 30.

       -D mmddyyyy[:mmddyyyy]
              Count as a reader an authentication identity which has SELECTed
              the mailbox within the given date range.  The start date and
              optional end date are specified as 2-digit month of the year,
              2-digit day of the month, and 4-digit year.  If the end date is
              not specified, then the current system time is used as the end
              time.

       -p months
              Prune \Seen state for users who have not SELECTed the mailbox
              within months months.  Default is infinity.
