NAME
       bbftp - transfer files using compression and parallel streams

SYNOPSIS
       bbftp -v

       bbftp [Options] [-u RemoteUsername] -i ControlFile [RemoteHost]

       bbftp [Options] [-u RemoteUsername] -e ControlCommands [RemoteHost]

DESCRIPTION
       Use the bbftp command to transfer files between the local host and a
       remote host. In order to get better performance on a loaded Wide Area
       Network than transferring with the standard ftp command, use the bbftp
       command. bbftp has been designed to take advantage of the RFC 1323 and
       uses multiple streams is order to speed up transfer. It also implements
       an automatic retry in case of failure of commands contained in the
       ControlFile or in the ControlCommands.

       bbftp allows two methods of connection to the remote host, a direct
       connection on the control port of the remote bbftpd daemon or the
       ability to remotely start a bbftpd daemon through an ssh tunnel. For
       the first method, the bbftpd daemon has to be started (by inetd or as a
       standalone daemon) on the remote host and all user information
       (username, password) are transmitted encrypted to the daemon; for the
       second the bbftpd binary has to be accessible somewhere on the remote
       host and all control data are transmitted through the ssh tunnel.

       A third additionnal authenticate mode allows to use certificates to log
       on.  This mode is based on the Grid Security Infrastructure and
       requires Globus software to be installed. The client side needs a
       certificate to identify itself and the daemon needs a host certificate.

       The behaviour of bbftp is controled by the ControlFile which contains
       the commands to be executed (option -i) or by commands separated by
       semicolons (option -e). The format of these commands are given in
       CONTROL COMMANDS.

       bbftp may be used in one of the following ways:

       % bbftp

       to print a short help

       % bbftp -v

       to write the version of the software and default values to standard
       output.

       % bbftp [Options] -i ControlFile [-u RemoteUsername] [RemoteHost]

       % bbftp [Options] -e ControlCommands [-u RemoteUsername] [RemoteHost]

       to request the execution of commands contained in the control file
       ControlFile or the ControlCommands using RemoteUsername on RemoteHost.

       Depending on the Options a password for the RemoteUsername on
       RemoteHost may be requested interactively (see OPTIONS section, for a
       full description of the Options).

       The RemoteUsername value is ignored in the certificate authentication
       mode.  The remote user is automatically detected by the daemon using
       the Globus gridmap file.

OPTIONS
       Options can be separated into two classes, those describing the way
       bbftp connects to the bbftpd daemon and those modifying the behaviour
       of the control commands.

       CONNECTION OPTIONS

       -u  Use this option to specify the user on the remote host. In SSH mode
           (see below) this option is optional: if not specified, the user in
           SSH config file will be used, or the local user if not in the SSH
           config file.  When compiled with the certificates authentication
           module, the use of this option will determine the way the
           authentication is done: if -u is used, the classical user/password
           will be used, otherwise the certificate will be used.

       -s  Use this option to use ssh to remotely start a bbftpd daemon. It
           usually starts the binary "bbftpd -s", but this can be changed
           througth the -E option.

       -S  Same as -s but ask ssh to run without asking a question (no
           password, no host key checking). It implies the usage of the
           identity file (for those familiar to ssh, this in done in setting
           the ssh options BatchMode to yes and the option
           StrictHostKeyChecking to no).

       -E Server command to run
           This option has to be used if the binary to be started on the
           remote host is not the default one (usually "bbftpd -s"). This
           option also implies the usage of the ssh mode (no need to add the
           -s option)

       -I SSH identity file
           This option has to be used if the ssh identity file is not the
           default one (usually $HOME/.ssh/identity).  This option also
           implies the usage of the ssh mode (no need to add the -s option)

       -L SSH command
           If your ssh command is not the default one (usually "ssh -q"), use
           this option to change it.  This option also implies the usage of
           the ssh mode (no need to add the -s option)

       -P Private authentication string
           If your client have been compiled with a private authentication
           schema, this option allow to pass an arbitrary string to the
           authentication module. You can determine if your client is using a
           private authentication module with the -v option.

       -w Control port number
           Use this option to change the control port for connection to on the
           RemoteHost.  This option is meaningless in ssh mode.

       PROTOCOL OPTIONS

       -D[min:max] Domain for ephemeral ports
           Use this option to use protocol V2 (non-passive mode) instead of V3
           (passive mode).  min and max are the range of ports used for data
           sockets. If min and max are not specified, free ports will be used
           (or built-in ports at compilation time).

       BEHAVIOUR OPTIONS

       -b  Use this option to run bbftp in the background after all
           interactive requests.

       -c  Use this option to gzip the data during transmission. Compression
           and uncompression are done "on the fly" and do not require any
           additionnal disk space.  Do not use it if the files to transmit are
           not compressible, as this will only lead to a waste of CPU and
           time. This option can be overridden by the control command
           setoption gzip

       -f ErrorFile
           Use this option to redirect the data generated on the standard
           error to ErrorFile

       -g Globus service name
           Use this option in certificate mode if the server does not use a
           host server.  The service name will be the subject of the
           certificate the server is actually using.

       -m  Use to special output on file transfer. The ouput is in the
           following format:

           Direction NumberOfBytes NumberOfSeconds BuffersizePerStream
           SendWinSize RecvWinSize NumberOfStreams Compression

           BuffersizePerStream, SendWinSize, RecvWinSize are expressed in
           KiloBytes

           For example :

           get 10000 10 256 256 256 2 gzip

           means that 10000 Bytes have been transfered in 10 seconds in
           compressed mode using 2 streams, a buffer size per stream of 256
           KBytes, a TCP send window size of 256 KBytes and a TCP receive
           window size of 256 KBytes.

           This option is useful when trying to choose the best parameters
           between two sites.

           When this option is set -V, -W and -t options are not available.

       -n  Use this option to simulate the transfer. All commands will be
           executed but no data will be transfered with the get, mget put and
           mput commands. Output is the same as a real transfer.  OutputFile

       -o OutputFile
           Use this option to redirect the data generated on the standard
           output to OutputFile

       -q  Use this option to mark packets for QBSS (QBone Scavenger Service)

       -p NumberOfParallelStreams
           Use this option to increase the number of streams to use during the
           file transfer. Default is 1.  This option can be overridden by the
           control command setnbstream

       -r NumberOfTries
           Use this option to change the number of tries to use when a
           transfer fails.  The default is usually 5.

       -R .bbftprc file
           After a successful connection to the daemon the client is going to
           execute all control commands located in the "$HOME/.bbftprc" file.
           The location of this file can be changed with this option. Take
           care, not all control commands are allowed in the .bbftprc file
           (See CONTROL COMMANDS to know the authorized one) If this option is
           not provided and "$HOME/.bbftprc" does not exists, the client tries
           to execute all commands in "/etc/bbftp.conf".

       -t  Use this option to have a timestamp on all output (overridden by -m
           option).

       -V  Use this option to set the client in verbose mode (overridden by -m
           option).

       -W  Use this option to print warnings to stderr (overridden by -m
           option).

CONTROL COMMANDS
       The control commands are either contained by an ASCII file ( -i option)
       or written on the bbftp line ( -e option). They can be divided into two
       classes, the "File related commands" and the "Behaviour commands".

       All "Behaviour commands" may be put in a .bbftprc file, but all "File
       related commands" are forbiden in that file.

       IMPORTANT NOTE

       Under the RFIO mode (see setoption remoterfio and setoption localrfio )
       all file related commands have to be given in absolute mode.

       FILE RELATED COMMANDS

       cd "RemoteDirectory"
           Change the current directory of the daemon on the remote host.

           If the RemoteDirectory is given in relative mode (not beginning by
           a /), it is supposed to be relative to the directory where the
           daemon is currently running. After the first connection, the
           current directory is the home directory of the RemoteUsername .

           The client keeps in mind the current remote directory so in case of
           broken connection during a transfer, it can reset the current
           directory of the daemon to the correct directory.

           If the daemon has been set in RFIO mode (see setoption remoterfio )
           this option is unavailable.

       get " RemoteFile LocalFile"
           Transfer the remote file RemoteFile to the local host with the name
           LocalFile.  If the local file already exists it is overwritten
           (only in case of successful transfer if the setoption tmpfile has
           been set). Under some circumstances (No space left on device,
           Access denied, File is a directory ...), no retry is done and the
           next command is processed.

           If the RemoteFile is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /),
           it is supposed to be relative to the current directory on the
           remote host (which is set to the home directory of the
           RemoteUsername at the beginning).  If the LocalFile is given in
           relative mode (not beginning by a /) the file is created relative
           to the directory where the bbftp command is running (which may have
           been changed with the lcd command).

       get " RemoteFile LocalDir/"
           Transfer the remote file RemoteFile to the local host with the name
           RemoteFile (without path) in the LocalDir directory.

           If the local file already exists it is overwritten (only in case of
           successful transfer if the setoption tmpfile has been set). Under
           some circumstances (No space left on device, Access denied, File is
           a directory ...), no retry is done and the next command is
           processed.

           If the RemoteFile is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /),
           it is supposed to be relative to the current directory on the
           remote host (which is set to the home directory of the
           RemoteUsername at the beginning).

           If the LocalDir is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /)
           the file is created relative to the directory where the bbftp
           command is running (which may have been changed with the lcd
           command).

       get " RemoteFile"
           Transfer the remote file RemoteFile to the local host with the name
           RemoteFile.

           If the RemoteFile is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /),
           it is supposed to be relative to the current directory on the
           remote host (which is set to the home directory of the
           RemoteUsername at the beginning) and created on the local host
           relative to the directory where the bbftp command is running (which
           may have been changed with the lcd command).

       lcd " LocalDirectory"
           Change the current directory on the local host.  If the
           LocalDirectory is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /), it
           is supposed to be relative to the directory where the client is
           currently.

           If the client has been set into RFIO mode (see  setoption localrfio
           ) this option is unavailable.

       mget " RemoteFiles LocalDirectory"
           Expand the  RemoteFiles on the remote machine and do a "get" for
           each file name thus produced.  Files are transferred into the
           LocalDirectory.

       mget " RemoteFiles"
           Expand the  RemoteFiles on the remote machine and do a "get" for
           each file name thus produced.  Files are transferred into the local
           working directory, which can be changed with the lcd command.

       mkdir " RemoteDirectory"
           Create the directory RemoteDirectory on the remote host. If the
           directory already exist no retry is done and the next command of
           the file is processed. If the RemoteDirectory is given in relative
           mode (not beginning by a /) the directory is created relative to
           the current remote directory.

           If one directory in the given path does not exist the command will
           fail if the setoption nocreatedir is set. If the setoption
           createdir has been set all unexisting directories will be created.

       mput " LocalFiles RemoteDirectory"
           Expand wild cards in the list of local files  given  as arguments
           and  do a "put" for each file in the resulting list. Files are
           transfered into the  RemoteDirectory.

       mput " LocalFiles"
           Expand wild cards in the list of local files  given  as arguments
           and  do a "put" for each file in the resulting list. Files are
           transfered into the  current remote directory which can be changed
           with the  cd command.

       put " LocalFile RemoteFile"
           Transfer the local file LocalFile to the remote host with the name
           RemoteFile.  If the remote file already exists it is overwritten.
           Under some circumstances (No space left on device, Access denied
           ...), no retry is done and the next command of the file is
           processed.

           If the LocalFile is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /)
           the file is supposed to be relative to the directory where the
           bbftp command is running (which may have been changed with the lcd
           command).

           If the RemoteFile is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /),
           it is created relative to the current directory on the remote host
           (which is set to the home directory of the RemoteUsername at the
           beginning).

       put " LocalFile RemoteDir/"
           Transfer the local file LocalFile to the remote host with the name
           LocalFile (without the path) in the RemoteDir directory

           If the remote file already exists it is overwritten. Under some
           circumstances (No space left on device, Access denied ...), no
           retry is done and the next command of the file is processed.

           If the LocalFile is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /)
           the file is supposed to be relative to the directory where the
           bbftp command is running (which may have been changed with the lcd
           command).

           If the RemoteDir is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /),
           it is created relative to the current directory on the remote host
           (which is set to the home directory of the RemoteUsername at the
           beginning).

       put " LocalFile"
           Transfer the local file LocalFile to the remote host with the name
           LocalFile.

           If the LocalFile is given in relative mode (not beginning by a /)
           the file is supposed to be relative to the directory where the
           bbftp command is running (which may have been changed with the lcd
           command) and created relative to the current directory on the
           remote host (which is set to the home directory of the
           RemoteUsername at the beginning).

       dir " RemoteDir"
           If used with '-m', lists the content of the remote directory. Each
           line has the following format:

           LINE: <LINK_CHAR><TYPE_CHAR><SP><FILE_NAME>

           LINK_CHAR: 'l' if file is a link else blank

           TYPE_CHAR: 'd' if file is a directory, 'f' if it is a reguler file
           or 'u' if it is an invalid link

           SP: ' '

           FILE_NAME: STRING

           If -m is not used, the result will be only 'OK' or 'FAILED'. This
           can be used to test the existence of a directory without printing
           its content.

       rm " RemoteFile"
           Deletes the remote file RemoteFile

       stat " RemoteFile"
           If used with '-m', print statistics about the file or the directory
           in the following format:

           device inode mode size block_size blocks uid gid (access time)
           (modification time) (change time)

       df " RemoteDir"
           If used with '-m', print statistics about the file system that
           contains the directory RemoteDir in the following format:

           total_blocks blocks_available block_size total_inode
           inode_available filename_max_length

       BEHAVIOUR COMMANDS

           setoption " Option"

           To negate an option just add "no" before the option (ie setoption
           nocreatedir).  The options are the following :

           createdir

           All file-related commands will create missing directories if needed
           (default createdir).

           gzip

           All file transfers will be compressed using the gzip algorythm
           (default nogzip).

           keepaccess

           The access time and modify time will be kept on each file
           transferred (default keepaccess).

           keepmode

           The file mode will be kept on each file transferred (default
           keepmode).

           localrfio

           All local files will be created with RFIO functions (default
           nolocalrfio).

           remoterfio

           All remote files will be created with RFIO functions (default
           noremoterfio).

           qbss

           All the packets will be marked for QBSS (default noqbss).

           tmpfile

           All files will be created under a temporary name
           (FileName.bbftp.tmp.HostName.Pid) and renamed to the correct file
           name if transfer is successful (default tmpfile)

           setbuffersize " Buffersize"

           Set the size in Kbytes of the buffer used for reading or writing
           the files. This command set the local and remote buffer size. (Each
           stream will use the same buffer size)

           setlocalcos " LocalCos"

           Set the local COS to the value specified by LocalCos.  This COS
           will be used for further rfio funtions. It is used if the
           setoption localrfio has been set and if the file is a HPSS file.  A
           value of 0 allows to select the COS according to the file size.  A
           negative value allows to not set the COS.  The default value is 0.

           setlocalumask " LocalUmask"

           Set the local umask to the value specified by LocalUmask.  This
           umask will be used for further i/o funtions. The LocalUmask has to
           be given in  OCTAL

           setnbstream " NumberOfParallelStreams"

           Set the number of parallel streams to NumberOfParallelStreams.
           This number will be used for further transfer commands.

           setremotecos " RemoteCos"

           Set the remote COS to the value specified by RemoteCos.  This COS
           will be used for further rfio funtions. It is used if the
           setoption remoterfio has been set and if the file is a HPSS file.
           A value of 0 allows to select the COS according to the file size.
           A negative value allows to not set the COS.  The default value is
           0.

           setremoteumask " RemoteUmask"

           Set the remote umask to the value specified by RemoteUmask.  This
           remote umask will be used for further i/o funtions. The RemoteUmask
           has to be given in  OCTAL

           setrecvwinsize " WindowSize"

           Set size in Kbytes of the receive TCP window of each stream of the
           bbftpd daemon. This also set the send window size of the client to
           the same value.

           setsendwinsize " WindowSize"

           Set size in Kbytes of the send TCP window of each stream of the
           bbftpd daemon. This also set the receive window size of the client
           to the same value.

           setackto " Acknowledge time-out" Set time-out (in seconds) to wait
           for an acknowledge. Default value is 100

           setrecvcontrolto " Input control time-out"

           Set time-out (in seconds) to wait while reading on the control
           socket. Default value is 180

           setsendcontrolto " Output control time-out"

           Set time-out (in seconds) to wait while writing on the control
           socket. Default value is 180

           setdatato " Data time-out"

           Set time-out (in seconds) to wait while reading on the data socket.
           Default value is 300

       NOTES If the option tmpfile is used then if the new file ( RemoteFile
       for a put or LocalFile for a get) did not exist before, bbftp ensures
       that the file transfer was correct if the file exists.

       In case of an already existing file, if the size, the last access and
       modification time are correct (if option  keepaccess has been set)
       bbftp ensures that the file transfer was correct.

TURL NOTATION
       The TURL notation can be used with commands relatives to files and
       directory.

       If you use this notation, you should not specify the server name in
       command.

       BBFTP support 3 types of TURL:

       Remote TURL

       bbftp://bbftp_servername/path_to_file_or_directory

       The path to file can be relative or absolute (start with '/')

       For example:

       "mkdir bbftp://bbftp.domain/dir"
           is the command to create a directory dir on the remote bbftp server
           under the user's home directory

       "cd bbftp://bbftp.domain//tmp"
           is the command to change into /tmp on the remote bbftp server

       Local TURL

       file://path_to_file

       The path to file can be relative or absolute (start with '/')

       For example:

       "put file://file bbftp://bbftp.domain//tmp/file"
           is the command to transfer the file file located on the local host
           server under the current directory to the remote host bbftp.domain
           under the /tmp directory

       Local rfio TURL

       rfio://path_to_file

       The path to file can be relative or absolute (start with '/')

       For example:

       "put rfio:///path/to/MSS/file bbftp://bbftp.domain//tmp/file"
           is the command to transfer a file retrived via the rfio path
           /path/to/MSS/file into the remote host bbftp.domain under the /tmp
           directory

       When the 'rfio://' notation is used, the option 'localrfio' is no
       longer necessary.

       Remote TURL with rfio

       It is possible to use rfio on the remote side using mixed TURL like:

       bbftp://bbftp_servername/rfio://path_to_rfio_file

       When the 'bbftp://bbftp_servername/rfio://' notation is used, the
       option 'remoterfio' is no longer necessary.

RETURN VALUES
       The following exit values are returned:

       "0" if all commands were successfuly executed

       ">0"
           if one command failed.

       It may happend that a non-zero value is returned even if all files were
       correctly transfered, if during one transfer a retry was needed. This
       will be corrected in future releases.

MESSAGES AND ERRORS
       All informative messages are written to the standard ouput (or to the
       OutputFile ).  All error messages are written to the standard error (or
       to the ErrorFile ).

WARNING
       The bbftp client version 2.0.0 is unable to talk with a daemon in
       release 1.x.x.

       The rfioxxx or xxxrfio commands are no longer supported, use instead
       the options localrfio or remoterfio in conjunction with put and get
       commands to obtain the same result.

RESULT FILE
       If the -i option was used a result file will be created in the same
       directory as the ControlFile.  Its name is ControlFile with the
       extension ".res". It contains the same lines as the ControlFile plus
       the keyword "OK", in case of success, or "FAILED", in case of failure.

       If the -e option was used and the -V option was not used, the software
       will print the command executed plus the keyword "OK", in case of
       success, or "FAILED", in case of failure to standard output.

CONNECTION EXAMPLES
       bbftp -i ctrlfile -u jon -p 5 -c cchost.in2p3.fr

       means that bbftp is going to connect to remote host cchost.in2p3.fr
       using username jon.  If the connection is successful then the commands
       in ctrlfile will be executed. All transfer commands will use five
       streams and gzip compression.

       bbftp -i ctrlfile -u phg -s cchost.in2p3.fr

       means that bbftp is going to start a remote bbftp via sshd on host
       cchost.in2p3.fr using username phg.  ssh will first try an
       RSAAuthentication if it is allowed by cchost.in2p3.fr; otherwise ssh
       will ask for a password for user phg on cchost.in2p3.fr. Then the sshd
       on cchost.in2p3.fr will log user phg and try to start the command
       "bbftpd -s"

       bbftp -i ctrlfile -u jon -E '/tmp/bbftpd -s' cchost.in2p3.fr

       Same behaviour as preceding, except that the remote command will be
       "/tmp/bbftpd -s"

       bbftp -i ctrlfile -u gilles -S cchost.in2p3.fr

       means that bbftp is going to start using ssh a remote bbftpd on host
       cchost.in2p3.fr using username gilles.  ssh will try an
       RSAAuthentication if it is allowed by cchost.in2p3.fr, otherwise the
       connection will be broken.

       bbftp -e 'setrecvwinsize 1024 ; put file1 file2'  -u jon
       cchost.in2p3.fr

       means that bbftp is going to connect to remote host cchost.in2p3.fr
       using jon username.  If the connection is successful then the commands
       setrecvwinsize 1024 and  put file1 file2 will be executed. All tranfer
       commands will use one stream.

       bbftp -e 'put file1 file2' cchost.in2p3.fr

       means (in the certification authentication mode) that bbftp is going to
       connect to remote host cchost.in2p3.fr using a certificate.  The remote
       user will be detected by the daemon which will check for the
       certificate provided and will accept or not the connection.

       Using SSH to start a BBFTPD daemon linked with dynamic libraries

       If you have linked the daemon with dynamic libraries with
       -L/path/to/lib option, you need to specify this location in
       $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. To be taken into account by SSHD, this environment
       variable must be modified in the $HOME/.ssh/environment  file.

       See your SSH or SSHD manual for more details.

EXAMPLES
       User jon want to transfer files from host localhost to remotehost on
       the account bbrdist. The bbrdist account has /home/babar/bbrdist as
       default directory on remotehost but has no subdirectories. We are going
       to study a control file in order to understand bbftp behaviour (we do
       not care here about the connection method; see  CONNECTION EXAMPLES for
       that).

       User jon on the local host is on the /home/babar/jon directory and has
       the following control file (all lines have a number which must not
       exists but which are there just for clarity) :

       1 setnbstream 20

       2 setremoteumask 022

       3 setoption nocreatedir

       4 put /home/babar/jon/f1 /home/babar/bbrdist/newfiles/f1

       5 setoption createdir

       6 put /home/babar/jon/f1 /home/babar/bbrdist/newfiles/f1

       7 setnbstream 5

       8 setrecvwinsize 1024

       9 setoption gzip

       10 put /home/babar/jon/f2 /home/babar/bbrdist/newfiles/f2

       Command 1 just sets the number of parallel streams to 20 for further
       get or put commands.

       Command 2 sets the remote umask for further put commands.

       Command 3 indicates that no directory has to be created on further put
       or get commands.

       Command 4 tries to send the local file /home/babar/jon/f1 to
       /home/babar/bbrdist/newfiles/f1. This command will fail because bbrdist
       has no subdirectory and directory creation is inhibed.

       Command 5 resets the createdir option.

       Command 6 will be successful (if the connection does not break),
       because the creation of the directory /home/babar/bbrdist/newfiles has
       been authorized by the createdir option.

       Command 7 reduces the number of streams to 5

       Command 8 sets the receive TCP window size to 1024 Kbytes on remotehost
       and the send TCP window size to 1024 Kbytes on localhost.

       Command 9 sets the gzip option for further get or put commands.

       Command 10 will transfer file /home/babar/jon/f2 to
       /home/babar/bbrdist/newfiles/f2 with 5 streams in compressed mode.
