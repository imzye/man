B2SUM(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               B2SUM(1)

NAME
     b2sum – generate checksums using the BLAKE2 hash function

SYNOPSIS
     b2sum [-a algorithm] [-l length] [--tag] [file ...]
     b2sum [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     The b2sum command generates checksums for files using the BLAKE2
     cryptographic hash function and writes them to standard output.

     When [file ...] is empty or -, b2sum reads from standard input.

     -a algorithm  Specify a variant of BLAKE2 to use when generating
                   checksums. The variants are listed under the algorithms
                   section, and the default is blake2b.

     -l length     Specify the digest length in bits. It must not exceed the
                   maximum for the variant of BLAKE2 being used, and must be a
                   multiple of 8.

     --tag         Prepend the checksums with "ALGORITHM-NAME (file) =", a
                   format common on BSD systems.

     --help        Display usage.

ALGORITHMS
     blake2b   optimized for 64-bit platforms and NEON-enabled ARMs, produces
               digests of any size between 1 and 64 bytes

     blake2s   optimized for 8 to 32-bit platforms, produces digests of any
               size between 1 and 32 bytes

     blake2bp  4-way parallel BLAKE2b

     blake2sp  8-way parallel BLAKE2s

AUTHORS
     b2sum is part of the BLAKE2 official implementation. BLAKE2 was designed
     by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, and
     Christian Winnerlein.

     BLAKE2 is based on the SHA-3 proposal BLAKE which was designed by
     Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Luca Henzen, Willi Meier, and Raphael C.-W. Phan.

     BLAKE2, like BLAKE, relies on the ChaCha20 stream cipher, designed by
     Daniel J. Bernstein.

     A mailing list for BLAKE2 can be subscribed to by sending an empty
     message to info-subscribe@blake2.net.

     The four designers of BLAKE2 can be contacted at contact@blake2.net.
