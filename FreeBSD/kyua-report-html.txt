KYUA-REPORT-HTML(1)     FreeBSD General Commands Manual    KYUA-REPORT-HTML(1)

NAME
     kyua report-html – Generates an HTML report with the results of a test
     suite run

SYNOPSIS
     kyua report-html [--force] [--output path] [--results-file file]
                      [--results-filter types]

DESCRIPTION
     The kyua report-html command provides a simple mechanism to generate HTML
     reports of the execution of a test suite.  The command processes a
     results file and then populates a directory with multiple HTML and
     supporting files to describe the results recorded in that results file.

     The HTML output is static and self-contained, so it can easily be served
     by any simple web server.  The command expects the target directory to
     not exist, because it would overwrite any contents if not careful.

     The following subcommand options are recognized:

     --force
         Forces the deletion of the output directory if it exists.  Use care,
         as this effectively means a ‘rm -rf’.

     --output directory
         Specifies the target directory into which to generate the HTML files.
         The directory must not exist unless the --force option is provided.
         The default is ./html.

     --results-file path, -s path
         Specifies the results file to operate on.  Defaults to ‘LATEST’,
         which causes kyua report-html to automatically load the latest
         results file from the current test suite.

         The following values are accepted:

         ‘LATEST’
             Requests the load of the latest results file available for the
             test suite rooted at the current directory.

         Directory
             Requests the load of the latest results file available for the
             test suite rooted at the given directory.

         Test suite name
             Requests the load of the latest results file available for the
             given test suite.

         Results identifier
             Requests the load of a specific results file.

         Explicit file name (aka everything else)
             Load the specified results file.

         See Results files for more details.

     --results-filter types
         Comma-separated list of the test result types to include in the
         report.  The ordering of the values is respected so that you can
         determine how you want the list of tests to be shown.

         The valid values are: ‘broken’, ‘failed’, ‘passed’, ‘skipped’ and
         ‘xfail’.  If the parameter supplied to the option is empty, filtering
         is suppressed and all result types are shown in the report.

         The default value for this flag includes all the test results except
         the passed tests.  Showing the passed tests by default clutters the
         report with too much information, so only abnormal conditions are
         included.

   Results files
     Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the
     execution of a test suite.  Each test suite executed by kyua-test(1)
     generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later
     on by inspection commands such as kyua-report(1) to analyze their
     contents.

     Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name
     lookups.  The differences between the two are described below.

     The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support
     for identifier-based lookups and historical recording of test suite runs.
     Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test suite that
     generated it and the time the test suite was run.  Kyua can later look up
     results files by these fields.

     The identifier follows this pattern:

           <test_suite>.<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>-<uuuuuu>

     where ‘test_suite’ is the path to the root of the test suite that was run
     with all slashes replaced by underscores and ‘YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu’ is
     a timestamp with microsecond resolution.

     When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in the
     ~/.kyua/store/ subdirectory and each file holds a name of the form:

           ~/.kyua/store/results.<identifier>.db

     Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in
     the /usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql files.  For details on the
     schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL file.

EXIT STATUS
     The kyua report-html command always returns 0.

     Additional exit codes may be returned as described in kyua(1).

EXAMPLES
   Workflow with results files
     If one runs the following command twice in a row:

           kyua test -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile

     the two executions will generate two different files with names like:

           ~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
           ~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db

     Taking advantage of the default naming scheme, the following commands
     would all generate a report for the results of the latest execution of
     the test suite:

           cd /usr/tests && kyua report-html
           cd /usr/tests && kyua report-html --results-file=LATEST
           kyua report-html --results-file=/usr/tests
           kyua report-html --results-file=usr_tests
           kyua report-html --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451

     But it is also possible to explicitly load data for older runs or from
     explicitly-named files:

           kyua report-html \
               --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784
           kyua report-html \
               --results-file=~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
