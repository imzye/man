B::Hooks::EndOfScope(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       B::Hooks::EndOfScope - Execute code after a scope finished compilation

VERSION
       version 0.28

SYNOPSIS
           on_scope_end { ... };

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to execute code when perl finished compiling the
       surrounding scope.

FUNCTIONS
   on_scope_end
           on_scope_end { ... };

           on_scope_end $code;

       Registers $code to be executed after the surrounding scope has been
       compiled.

       This is exported by default. See Sub::Exporter on how to customize it.

LIMITATIONS
   Pure-perl mode caveat
       This caveat applies to any version of perl where Variable::Magic is
       unavailable or otherwise disabled.

       While Variable::Magic has access to some very dark sorcery to make it
       possible to throw an exception from within a callback, the pure-perl
       implementation does not have access to these hacks. Therefore, what
       would have been a compile-time exception is instead converted to a
       warning, and your execution will continue as if the exception never
       happened.

       To explicitly request an XS (or PP) implementation one has two choices.
       Either to import from the desired implementation explicitly:

        use B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS
          or
        use B::Hooks::EndOfScope::PP

       or by setting $ENV{B_HOOKS_ENDOFSCOPE_IMPLEMENTATION} to either "XS" or
       "PP".

   Perl 5.8.0 ~ 5.8.3
       Due to a core interpreter bug
        <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=27040#txn-82797>
       present in older perl versions, the implementation of
       B::Hooks::EndOfScope deliberately leaks a single empty hash for every
       scope being cleaned. This is done to avoid the memory corruption
       associated with the bug mentioned above.

       In order to stabilize this workaround use of Variable::Magic is
       disabled on perls prior to version 5.8.4. On such systems
       loading/requesting B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS explicitly will result in a
       compile-time exception.

   Perl versions 5.6.x
       Versions of perl before 5.8.0 lack a feature allowing changing the
       visibility of "%^H" via setting bit 17 within $^H. As such the only way
       to achieve the effect necessary for this module to work, is to use the
       "local" operator explicitly on these platforms. This might lead to
       unexpected interference with other scope-driven libraries relying on
       the same mechanism. On the flip side there are no such known
       incompatibilities at the time this note was written.

       For further details on the unavailable behavior please refer to the
       test file t/02-localise.t included with the distribution.
