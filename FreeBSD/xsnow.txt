XSNOW(6)                         User Commands                        XSNOW(6)

NAME
       xsnow - Snow and Santa on your desktop

SYNOPSIS
       xsnow [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Xsnow shows an animation of Santa and snow on your desktop.  Xsnow can
       also run in one or more windows, see options -xwininfo, -id .  (These
       options only work satisfactorily in an X11 environment.)  Xsnow depends
       on an X11 environment. This is forced by setting the environment
       variable GDK_BACKEND=x11 before initializing the GTK.  Hopefully, this
       will ensure that xsnow also runs in a Wayland environment for some
       time.

       If xsnow is misbehaving, try to remove the file $HOME/.xsnowrc.

   General options:
       Below:
       <n> denotes an unsigned decimal (e.g 123) or octal (e.g. 017) or hex
       (e.g. 0x50009) number.
       <c> denotes a string like "red" or "#123456".
       <f> denotes a file name, like "/home/rick/Pictures/background.jpg".

              or from the command line, e.g:
                 nohup xscreensaver &

   LANGUAGES
       Xsnow comes with some translations to non-english languages.
       The translations are done with the aid of translate.google.com
       (implemented in package 'trans'), so there will be room for
       improvement. Any suggestions are welcome: contact@ratrabbit.nl .

   FILES
       $HOME/.xsnowrc
              Settings are read from and written to this file.  See flags
              -noconfig and -defaults how to influence this behaviour.
                  NOTE: the following settings are not read or written:
                        -above  -defaults  -desktop  -fullscreen -noconfig -id
                        -nomenu -stopafter -xwininfo -display    -noisy
              -checkgtk
                  NOTE: the file also contains the screen locations of a
              number of buttons,
                        which can be used for testing purposes.


       $HOME/.xsnowstop
              Xsnow checks regularly the existence of this file.  If present,
              xsnow will remove the file and stop.


       $HOME/xsnow/pixmaps/tree.xpm
              If present, xsnow will try this file for displaying the trees.
              The format must be xpm (X PixMap) format, see
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap .


       $HOME/xsnow/pixmaps/santa<n>.xpm
              where <n> = 1,2,3,4.  If present, xsnow will try this files (4
              of them) for displaying Santa. The format must be xpm (X PixMap)
              format, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap .
                  NOTE: To show: activate the first Santa in the menu.


   SIGNALS
       On receiving the SIGUSR1 signal, xsnow writes the file ~/.xsnowrc.

   EXAMPLES
           $ xsnow -defaults        # run with defaults.
           $ xsnow                  # run using values from the config file.
           $ xsnow -treetype 1,2    # use tree types 1 and 2.

   WINDOW MANAGER ISSUES
       In general, xsnow works better when using a compositing window manager
       like xcompmgr, compton or picom.  However, with some window managers
       (FVWM for example), the xsnow-window is transparent, but not
       click-through.  Flags to be tried in this case include: -root,
       -doublebuffer, -xwininfo, -id.
       Here follow some window managers with their issues:


       Tiling window managers
              Here you need to float windows with class=Xsnow.

       AWESOME
              Without compositor: no issues.
              With compositor: no click-through xsnow window, and issues with
              multi-monitor setup.

       BSPWM  No issues if you add to your bspwmrc (the bspwm configuration
              file):
                  bspc rule -a Xsnow state=floating border=off

       CINNAMON
              No issues.

       DWM    No issues, except the "Below Windows" setting in the "settings"
              panel.

       ENLIGHTENMENT
              With one monitor: no issuses.
              With more montors: probems with showing in 'all monitors'

       FLUXBOX
              Without compositor: no issues.
              With compositor: no click-through xsnow window

       FVWM   Without compositor: no issues.
              With compositor: no click-through xsnow window

       GNOME on Xorg
              No issues.

       GNOME on Wayland
              Most windows don't catch snow.

       HERBSTLUFTWM
              No issues.

                  for_window [class="Xsnow"] floating enable;border none
              With compositor: unworkable.

       TWM    Without compositor: no issues.
              With compositor: no click-through xsnow window and
              you need to tweak settings->lift snow on windows.

       XMONAD No issues if you add to your xmonad.hs:
               import XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops
               xmonad $ ewmh $ defaultConfig
               in the ManageHook section:
                  className = ? "Xsnow" --> doFloat

   BUGS
       - Xsnow needs a complete rewrite: the code is a mess.
       - The flags are not consistent, caused by trying to be
           compatible with older versions.
       - Xsnow stresses the Xserver too much.
       - Xsnow does run in Wayland, but will not snow on all windows.
       - Xsnow tries to create a click-through window. This is not successful
         in for example FVWM/xcompmgr. In that case, xsnow tries to keep
         the snow window below all others, resulting in a transient effect
         when you click on the desktop. Sadly, no FVWM menu will appear...
       - Remnants of fluffy snow can persist after removing the
           fallen snow. These will gradually disappear, so no big deal.
       - Remnants of meteors can persist after passage of Santa.
           These will eventually be wiped out by snow or Santa.
       - Xsnow tries to adapt its snowing window if the display
           settings are changed while xsnow is running.
           This does not function always well.
       - Xsnow does not play well with 'xcompmgr -a'. In some environments
           (Raspberry 64 bit) xcompmgr is started with the flag '-a',
           resulting in a black snow window. Remedy:
           In a terminal window type:
             killall xcompmgr
             nohup xcompmgr -n &
           and try again.
       - In XFCE, compositing must be enabled for xsnow.
           Settings -> Window Manager Tweaks -> Compositor -> Enable display
       compositing
       - In multi-screen environments, it depends on the display settings
           if it is snowing on all screens. Experiment!
