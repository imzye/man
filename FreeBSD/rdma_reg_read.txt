RDMA_REG_READ(3)         Librdmacm Programmer's Manual        RDMA_REG_READ(3)



NAME
       rdma_reg_read - register data buffer(s) for remote RDMA read access.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       struct ibv_mr * rdma_reg_read (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void *addr,
       size_t length);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier where the message
                   buffer(s) will be used.

       addr        The address of the memory buffer(s) to register.

       length      The total length of the memory to register.

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a memory buffer that will be accessed by a remote RDMA read
       operation.  Memory buffers registered using rdma_reg_read may be
       targeted in an RDMA read request, allowing the buffer to be specified
       on the remote side of an RDMA connection as the remote_addr of
       rdma_post_read, or similar call.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns a reference to the registered memory region on success, or NULL
       on error.  If an error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the
       failure reason.

NOTES
       rdma_reg_read is used to register a data buffer that will be the target
       of an RDMA read operation on a queue pair associated with an
       rdma_cm_id.  The memory buffer is registered with the proteection
       domain associated with the idenfier.  The start of the data buffer is
       specified through the addr parameter, and the total size of the buffer
       is given by length.

       All data buffers should be registered before being posted as a work
       request.  Users must deregister all registered memory by calling
       rdma_dereg_mr.
