NAME
       Term::Form - Read lines from STDIN.

VERSION
       Version 0.562

SYNOPSIS
           my $aoa = [
               [ 'name'           ],
               [ 'year'           ],
               [ 'color', 'green' ],
               [ 'city'           ]
           ];

           # Object-oriented interface:

           use Term::Form;

           my $new = Term::Form->new();

           my $modified_list = $new->fill_form( $aoa );

           # Functional interface:

           use Term::Form qw( fill_form );

           $modified_list = fill_form( $aoa );

DESCRIPTION
       "fill_form" reads a list of lines from STDIN.

       To close the form and get the modified list (reference to an array of
       arrays) as a return value, select the confirm menu item. If the back
       menu item is chosen instead to close the form, "fill_form" returns
       nothing.

       The output is removed after leaving the method, so the user can decide
       what remains on the screen.

       "readline" has been moved to Term::Form::ReadLine.

   Keys
       "BackSpace" or "Ctrl-H": Delete the character behind the cursor.

       "Delete" or "Ctrl-D": Delete the character at point.

       "Ctrl-U": Delete the text backward from the cursor to the beginning of
       the line.

       "Ctrl-K": Delete the text from the cursor to the end of the line.

       "Right-Arrow" or "Ctrl-F": Move forward a character.

       "Left-Arrow" or "Ctrl-B": Move back a character.

       "Home" or "Ctrl-A": Move to the start of the line.

       "End" or "Ctrl-E": Move to the end of the line.

       "Up-Arrow" or "Ctrl-S": Move up one row.

       "Down-Arrow" or "Ctrl-T": Move down one row.

       "Ctrl-X": Delete the text of the line.

       "Page-Up" or "Ctrl-P": Move to the previous page.

       "Page-Down" or "Ctrl-N": Move to the next page.

METHODS
   new
       The "new" method returns a "Term::Form" object.

           my $new = Term::Form->new();

       To set the different options it can be passed a reference to a hash as
       an optional argument.

   fill_form
       "fill_form" reads a list of lines from STDIN.

           $new_list = $new->fill_form( $aoa, { prompt => 'Required:' } );

       The first argument is a reference to an array of arrays. The arrays
       have 1 or 2 elements: the first element is the key and the optional
       second element is the value. The key is used as the prompt string for
       the "readline", the value is used as the default value for the
       "readline" (initial value of input).

       Strings that have been shortened to fit into the terminal width are
       marked with a trailing "~". This does not affect the returned data.

       When $aoa is return values of rows where nothing has been entered are
       set to the empty string.

       The optional second argument is a hash-reference. The hash-keys/options
       are:

       auto_up

       0 - if the cursor is on a data row (that means not on the "back" or
       "confirm" menu entry), pressing "ENTER" moves the cursor to the next
       row. If "ENTER" is pressed when the cursor is on the last data row, the
       cursor jumps to the first data row. The initially cursor position is on
       the first data row.

       1 - if the cursor is on a data row, pressing "ENTER" moves the cursor
       to the next row unless the cursor is on the last data row. Then
       pressing "ENTER" moves the cursor to the "back" menu entry (the menu
       entry on the top of the menu). The initially cursor position is on the
       "back" menu entry.

       2 - if the cursor is on a data row, pressing "ENTER" moves the cursor
       to the "back" menu entry. The initially cursor position is on the
       "back" menu entry.

       default: 1

       back

       Set the name of the "back" menu entry.

       The "back" menu entry can be disabled by setting back to an empty
       string.

       default: "Back"

       clear_screen

       If enabled, the screen is cleared before the output.

       0 - off

       1 - on

       default: 0

       codepage_mapping

       This option has only meaning if the operating system is MSWin32.

       If the OS is MSWin32, Win32::Console::ANSI is used. By default
       "Win32::Console::ANSI" converts the characters from Windows code page
       to DOS code page (the so-called ANSI to OEM conversion). This
       conversation is disabled by default in "Term::Choose" but one can
       enable it by setting this option.

       Setting this option to 1 enables the codepage mapping offered by
       Win32::Console::ANSI.

       0 - disable automatic codepage mapping (default)

       1 - keep automatic codepage mapping

       default: 0

       color

       Enables the support for color and text formatting escape sequences for
       the form-keys, the "back"-string, the "confirm"-string, the info text
       and the prompt text.

       0 - off

       1 - on

       default: 0

       confirm

       Set the name of the "confirm" menu entry.

       default: "Confirm"

       hide_cursor

       0 - disabled

       1 - enabled

       default: 1

       info

       Expects as is value a string. If set, the string is printed on top of
       the output of "fill_form".

       prompt

       If prompt is set, a main prompt string is shown on top of the output.

       default: undefined

       read_only

       Set a form-row to read only.

       Expected value: a reference to an array with the indexes of the rows
       which should be read only.

       default: empty array

       skip_items

       When navigating the form, lines whose key string matches the regex
       pattern passed with this option will be skipped.  Passed values are
       ignored. It's up to the user to remove these elements from the returned
       array.

       The expected value is a regex quoted with the "qr" operator.

REQUIREMENTS
   Perl version
       Requires Perl version 5.10.1 or greater.

   Terminal
       It is required a terminal which uses a monospaced font.

       Unless the OS is MSWin32 the terminal has to understand ANSI escape
       sequences.

   Encoding layer
       It is required to use appropriate I/O encoding layers. If the encoding
       layer for STDIN doesn't match the terminal's character set, "fill_from"
       will break if a non ascii character is entered.

SUPPORT
       You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.
