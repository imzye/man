NAME
       restic-backup - Create a new backup of files and/or directories



SYNOPSIS
       restic backup [flags] [FILE/DIR] ...



DESCRIPTION
       The "backup" command creates a new snapshot and saves the files and
       directories given as the arguments.



EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if the command was successful.  Exit status is 1 if
       there was a fatal error (no snapshot created).  Exit status is 3 if
       some source data could not be read (incomplete snapshot created).  Exit
       status is 10 if the repository does not exist.  Exit status is 11 if
       the repository is already locked.  Exit status is 12 if the password is
       incorrect.
