NAME
       amigadepacker - Tool for depacking some compressed Amiga formats


SYNTAX
       amigadepacker [-c] [-h] [-o outfile] [-p] [-v] FILE ...


DESCRIPTION
       amigadepacker depacks compressed Amiga formats. PowerPacker, XPK SQSH,
       MMCMP and StoneCracker 4.04 (S404) formats are supported.
       Amigadepacker will automatically determine the compressed format by
       content.  Among other things, the tool is useful for playing packed
       Amiga music formats with uade (1).

       If no files are given for the amigadepacker, the data is read from
       stdin.  If some files are given, it tries to unpack them inplace, i.e.
       overwriting the given files with unpacked data. If a single file and
       "-c" is given, unpacked data is written to stdout. If a single file and
       "-o outfile" is given, unpacked data is written to file named "out".

       The tool can also be used to decrypt powerpacker encrypted files. That
       operation will take a few hours.


OPTIONS
       -c     Unpack to stdout (when regular files have been given as
              parameters)

       -h     Display help

       -o outfile, --output-file outfile
              Write decrunched data into outfile instead of overwriting the
              packed file

       -p     Pretend to unpack, but do not. Prints names of packed files to
              stderr. Pretend mode always returns success if arguments are
              valid. This is useful for searching packed files.

       -v     Display version information


EXAMPLES
       Unpack a file:
       amigadepacker foo

       Unpack a file from stdin to stdout:
       amigadepacker < foo > foo.depacked

       Find all packed files under /path, but do not unpack anything (--pretend):
       find /path/ -type f -print0 |xargs -0 amigadepacker --pretend --
