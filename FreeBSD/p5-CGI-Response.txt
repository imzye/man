NAME
       CGI::Response - Respond to CGI requests

SYNOPSIS
   Simple Interface
         use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);
         print ContentType;
         print "<html><head>\n"; # .....

   Full Interface
         use CGI::Response;
         $response = new CGI::Response;
         $response->content_type;
         print $response->as_string;
         print "<html><head>\n"; # .....

DESCRIPTION
       CGI::Response is a Perl5 module for constructing responses to Common
       Gateway Interface (CGI) requests.  It is designed to be light-weight
       and efficient for the most common tasks, and also to provide access to
       all HTTP response features for more advanced CGI applications.

       There are two ways to use CGI::Response.  For basic applications, the
       Simple Interface provides a number of plain functions that cover the
       most commonly-used CGI response headers.  More advanced applications
       may employ the Full Interface object methods to access any HTTP header,
       or to add experimental or non-standard headers.  Both interfaces try to
       generate reasonable defaults whenever possible.

       For efficiency, just the Simple Interface functions are compiled on
       start-up.  Full Interface methods are compiled only when they are
       called.  This helps to make CGI::Response usable in a variety of
       applications.  [See SelfLoader for more information.]

   Simple Interface
       The Simple Interface methods are not exported by default.  In order to
       use them, you must import them explicitly.  You can import all of the
       methods at once by saying:

          use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);

       Or, you can import just one function by listing it by name, as in:

          use CGI::Response qw(ContentType);

       Only one Simple Interface function should be called in a response,
       since all of these functions terminate the response header (that is,
       send the blank line denoting the end of the header) immediately upon
       execution.  If you need to use a combination of headers not provided by
       the Simple Interface, use the Full Interface instead.

       All of the Simple Interface functions force a flush on the currently-
       selected output channel (that is, they set "$| = 1").  This is done to
       prevent a common probelm in CGI scripts, where a system() or exec()
       call causes output before the response header, and generates a server
       error.  If you do not want "$| = 1", you should either set it back to 0
       after using the Simple Interface, or you should employ the Full
       Interface, which does not have this side effect.

       For reference, below is a list of the headers sent by each function,
       and the default header values, if any.  Arguments are listed in the
       order they should appear.  Square brackets ([]) indicate optional
       arguments; angled brackets (<>) indicate required arguments.

          Function      Argument(s)      Header(s)      Default(s)
          --------      -----------      ---------      ----------
          &ContentType  [content-type]   Content-Type   text/html

          &Redirect     <Location/URI>   Location       [none]
                        [permanent?]     URI            [none]
                                         Content-Type   text/html
                                         Status         302 Moved Temporarily

          &NoCache      [content-type]   Content-Type   text/html
                                         Pragma         no-cache
                                         Expires        [now]

          &NoContent                     Status         204 No Content

       Each of these functions is documented more completely below, and
       examples for each are provided.

       &ContentType
           This is the most commonly-used function.  It identifies the
           Internet Media Type of the entity that follows.  If you call it
           without an argument, it will send "text/html" as the content-type.

              use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);
              print &ContentType;   # defaults to text/html

           Otherwise, you can specify some other content-type:

              use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);
              print &ContentType('image/gif');

           This function should be called as early as possible to prevent
           server errors (see the note on $| above).

       &Redirect
           A redirect causes the user-agent to make a follow-up request for
           some other resource.  Some user-agents will be better than others
           at complying with a redirect, so this function tries to be as
           explicit as possible.

           You are required to give one argument, specifying the URL which the
           user-agent should request.  A second argument is accepted as a
           Boolean value -- if any second argument is present, the browser
           will be told that the requested resource has moved permanently to a
           new URL (that is, future requests for the document should be to the
           new URL, not to the one which was first requested).

              use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);
              print &Redirect('http://www.company.com/', 'permanent');
              # this resource has moved permanently, status 301

           If no second argument is given, the redirect will be specified as
           temporary.

              use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);
              print &Redirect('http://www.company.com/');
              # this resource has moved temporarily, status 302

           A brief HTML page is output after the header so that users whose
           user-agents fail to recognize the redirect will get an informative
           message with a link to the redirect.  Use the Full Interface to
           supply some other page or none at all.

       &NoCache
           This function tries to inform user-agents and proxy servers that
           the included resource should not be cached.  It does so by sending
           both an "Expires" header, set for immediate expiration, and a
           "Pragma: no-cache" header, which older user-agents and servers
           might not recognize.

           Preventing caching is important to CGI applications which produce
           output based on some factor of the request (such as which user-
           agent made the request).  For instance, a shopping-basket
           application would not want to allow caching of an order information
           page, which may contain user-specific information.

           It must be noted, however, that caches prevent excess network load
           and cache-friendly applications are always preferable to use of the
           &NoCache function.  This function should only be used when there is
           no other alternative.

           &NoCache takes one optional argument, the content-type of the
           entity to follow.  Therefore, its call is nearly identical to the
           &ContentType function, and the two functions may be interchanged
           easily.  As with &ContentType, if you call &NoCache without an
           argument, it will send "text/html" as the content-type.

              use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);
              print &NoCache;   # defaults to text/html

           Otherwise, you can specify some other content-type:

              use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);
              print &NoCache('image/gif');

           As noted earlier, this function should be called as early as
           possible to prevent server errors (see the note on $| above).

       &NoContent
           &NoContent allows a script to accept input without changing the
           current page in the user-agent's view.  This may be useful for a
           successful form input that requires no response, or for an imagemap
           click that does not have a defined link.

           A No Content response does not reset form fields after submission.
           HTTP/1.1 will include a "205 Reset Document" status for this
           purpose, and a future version of this module will provide a &Reset
           function to support this status.

           This function sends only one header, "Status: 204 No Content", and
           it takes no arguments.

              use CGI::Response qw(:Simple);
              print &NoContent;

   Full Interface
       The Full Interface is still under development and is not currently
       documented.

NOTES
       Please note that future versions are not guaranteed to be backwards-
