BAYESOL(1)                                                          BAYESOL(1)



NAME
       bayesol - a Bayes solution calculator for use with dbacl.

SYNOPSIS
       bayesol [-DVNniv] -c riskspec [FILE]...

       bayesol -V

DESCRIPTION
       bayesol is a Bayes solution calculator designed to combine the output
       of dbacl(1) with a prior distribution and a risk specification, and
       calculate the optimal Bayesian decision (which minimizes the posterior
       risk).

       The risk specification is read from the text file riskspec and must be
       written in a simple format described below. The dbacl(1) output can
       either be read from FILE or from STDIN.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, bayesol returns a positive integer corresponding to the
       category with the lowest risk.  In case of a problem, bayesol returns
       zero.

OPTIONS
       -c     Classify using riskspec.  See the section RISK SPECIFICATION.

       -i     Fully internationalized mode. Forces the use of wide characters
              internally, which is necessary in some locales. This incurs a
              noticeable performance penalty.

       -n     Print risk scores for each category.  Each score is
              (approximately) the logarithm of the expected risk under that
              category. The lowest score (ie closest to -infinity) is best,
              etc.

       -N     Print recursive risk scores for each category.  Each score is
              (approximately) the logarithm of the best score based on the
              remaining categories, after the previously best scoring
              categories have been removed, and a normalizing factor was
              added. A full description is given in the technical report
              listed at the end of this manpange. The largest score (ie
              closest to +infinity) is best, etc.

       -v     Verbose mode. Prints to STDOUT the category with minimum
              posterior risk.  In case several categories are possible, prints
              the first category in the order in which they appear in the
              categories section of riskpspec.

       -D     Print debug output. Do not use.

       -V     Print the program version number and exit.

RISK SPECIFICATION
       bayesol needs to read a text file riskspec containing a risk
       specification. The format of this text file is as follows

              categories { cat1, cat2,..., catN}
              prior { p1, p2,..., pN}
              loss_matrix {
              "regex1" c1 [ formula11, formula12,..., formula1N]
              "regex2" c2 [ formula21, formula22,..., formula2N]
               .
               .
              "regexM" cM [ formulaM1, formulaM2,..., formulaMN]
              }

       In the above, cat1, cat2,..., catN, are category names, p1, p2,..., pN,
       are non-negative numbers, regex1, regex2,..., regexM, are (possibly
       empty) regular expression strings, c1, c2,..., cM, are instances of the
       category names cat1, cat2,..., catN, and the formulas are numbers or
       mathematical expressions.

       Every category which appears in the categories section must appear at
       least once in the loss_matrix section, with an empty "" regular
       expression.  To construct the actual loss matrix used in the decision
       calculations, bayesol selects, for each category appearing in the
       categories section, the first row whose regular expression is matched
       within FILE or STDIN, or the first row with empty regular expression if
       there are no matches.

       Each formula can be either a single number, or an algebraic combination
       of the operators exp(), log(), +, -, *, /, ^ and parentheses (). The
       string "inf" is parsed as the value infinity. Also, the string
       "complexity" is recognized, and converted to the complexity for that
       category as reported by dbacl(1).  Finally, if the corresponding
       regular expression contains submatches delimited by parentheses, their
       numerical values can be used inside the formulas as the special
       variables $1, ..., $9. Note that submatches which aren't numerical are
       converted to the value zero.

       Case is important. Spaces and newlines can be liberally inserted.
       Comments must start with a # and extend to the end of the line.

USAGE
       Typically, bayesol is used together with dbacl(1).  An invocation looks
       like this:

       % dbacl -c one -c two -c three sample.txt -vna | bayesol -c toy.risk -v

       See /usr/local/share/dbacl/doc/costs.ps for a description of the
       algorithm used.  See also /usr/local/share/dbacl/doc/tutorial.html for
       a more detailed overview.
