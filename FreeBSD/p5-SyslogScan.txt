SyslogScan::ByGroup(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       SyslogScan::ByGroup -- Organizes a Summary of mail statistics into
       Groups of related e-mail users

SYNOPSIS
           # $summary is a SyslogScan::Summary object

           # default is to organize by internet host
           my $byGroup = new SyslogScan::ByGroup($summary);
           print $byGroup -> dump();

           # group by whether users use 'jupiter' or 'satellife' as
           # their machine name, and discard users who use neither

           my $pointerToGroupingRoutine = sub {
               my $address = shift;

               return 'jupiter' if $address =~ /jupiter.healthnet.org$/;
               return 'satellife' if $address =~ /satellife.healthnet.org$/;

               # ignore all others
               return undef;
           }

           my $groupByMachine = new SyslogScan::ByGroup($summary,
                                                        $pointerToGroupingRoutine);
           print $groupByMachine -> dump();

           # Extract a SyslogScan::Group object
           my $jupiterGroup = $$groupByMachine{jupiter};
           print $jupiterGroup -> dump();

           # Extract a SyslogScan::Summary object
           my $summaryOfJupiter = $jupiterGroup{byAddress};
           print $summaryOfJupiter -> dump();

           # Create a summary by group, rather than a summary by address
           my $summaryByMachine = $groupByMachine -> createSummary();

DESCRIPTION
       A SyslogScan::ByGroup object is a hash table of SyslogScan::Group
       objects, each indexed by the group name as returned by the sorting
       algorithm fed to 'new'.

       A SyslogScan::Group is a hash table with two members: 'byAddress',
       which is a SyslogScan::Summary of each address which is a member of the
       Group, and 'groupUsage', which is a SyslogScan::Usage object containing
       the total usage of the group.
