NAME
       Crypt::RC5 - Perl implementation of the RC5 encryption algorithm.

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::RC5;

         $ref = Crypt::RC5->new( $key, $rounds );
         $ciphertext = $ref->encrypt( $plaintext );

         $ref2 = Crypt::RC5->new( $key, $rounds );
         $plaintext2 = $ref2->decrypt( $ciphertext );

DESCRIPTION
       RC5 is a fast block cipher designed by Ronald Rivest for RSA Data
       Security (now RSA Security) in 1994. It is a parameterized algorithm
       with a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number
       of rounds. This particular implementation is 32 bit. As such, it is
       suggested that a minimum of 12 rounds be performed.

       Core logic based on "RC5 in 6 lines of perl" at
