NAME
       norsnet - identifies unstructured loops from sequence

SYNOPSIS
       norsnet <FASTA_FILE> <RDBPROF_FILE> <HSSP_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE> <PROTEIN_NAME> <PROFBVAL_FILE> <OUTPUT_MODE> <DEBUG>

DESCRIPTION
       NORSnet is a neural network based method that focuses on the identification of unstructured loops.

       NORSnet was trained to distinguish between very long contiguous segments with non-regular secondary structure (NORS regions) and well-folded proteins. NORSnet was trained on predicted information
       rather than on experimental data. Therefore, it was optimized on a large data, which is not biased by today's experimental means of capturing disorder. Thus, NORSnet reached into regions in
       sequence space that are not covered by the specialized disorder predictors. One disadvantage of this approach is that it is not optimal for the identification of the "average" disordered region.

   Conversion of PSI-BLAST alignment to HSSP format
       The most up-to-date procedure can be found at <https://www.rostlab.org/owiki/index.php/How_to_generate_an_HSSP_file_from_alignment#Generating_an_HSSP_profile>.

       1. Convert BLAST output to a Single Alignment Format (SAF):
            /usr/share/librg-utils-perl/blast2saf.pl fasta=<query_fasta_file> maxAli=3000 eSaf=1 \
             saf=<saf_formatted_file> <blast_output>

       2. Convert SAF format to HSSP:
            /usr/share/librg-utils-perl/copf.pl <saf_formatted_file> formatIn=saf formatOut=hssp \
             fileOut=<hssp_formatted_file> exeConvertSeq=convert_seq

       3. Filter results to 80% redundancy:
            /usr/share/librg-utils-perl/hssp_filter.pl red=80 <hssp_formatted_file> fileOut=<filtered_hssp_formatted_file>

   Output format
       Output mode 1

       Tabular output, columns:

        pos            amino acid number (1..)
        res            residue 1-letter code
        node1          output of neural network node 1
        node2          output of neural network node 2
        pred           node1 / ( node1 + node2 )
        n40            pred < 0.40 ? '-' : 'N'
        n40fil         at least 31 AA long stretches of 'N' in n40
        n59            pred < 0.59 ? '-' : 'N'
        n59fil         at least 31 AA long stretches of 'N' in n59

       'N' is for non-regular secondary structure.

OPTIONS
       FASTA_FILE
           File containing protein amino-acid sequence in fasta format.

       RDBPROF_FILE
           Secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction by PROF in rdb format.

       HSSP_FILE
           PSI-BLAST alignment profile file converted to HSSP format.

       OUTPUT_FILE
           The name of the final NORSnet output file.

       PROFBVAL_FILE
           Flexible/rigid residues prediction by profbval(1) in rdb format (mode 5).

       OUTPUT_MODE
           NORSnet can create output files in different formats for different purposes. Valid modes are `1', `2' or `3'. Default mode: 1.

           -   Default mode. Use this when you do not want to give a value here but you want to specify debug.

           1   for metadisorder(1)

       DEBUG
           Set to 1 for debugging messages

OUTPUT
       number -
           residue number

       residue -
           residue type

       raw -
           raw value of the different between the two output nodes

EXAMPLES
        norsnet /usr/share/doc/norsnet/examples/cad23.f /usr/share/doc/norsnet/examples/cad23-fil.rdbProf /usr/share/doc/norsnet/examples/cad23-fil.hssp cad23.norsnet cad23 /usr/share/doc/norsnet/examples/cad23.profbval

ENVIRONMENT
       NORSNET_ROOT
           Overrides /usr/share/norsnet, the path to helper scripts and data files.

FILES
       *.norsnet
           default output file extension

       /usr/share/doc/norsnet/examples
           default precomputed input files directory

NOTES
       1. It is recommended to create the profiles using 3 iteration of PSI-BLAST against big database
       2. It is also recommended to filter the hssp files using hssp_filter.pl from the Prof package using the following command: perl hssp_filter.pl hssp_file red=80
