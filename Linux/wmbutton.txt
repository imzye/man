NAME
       wmbutton - dockable launcher application

SYNOPSIS
       wmbutton [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmbutton command.

       wmbutton  is  a 64x64 pixel application that displays nine buttons and can be used as dockapp for X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment. Each of these but‐
       tons can be configured via a configuration file to run just about any application you would like to. Basically, if you can type it in a shell command, wmbutton can run it.

       wmbutton is configured using a configuration file, ~/.wmbutton (or /etc/wmbutton.conf). Its format is documented in the "Configuration" section below.

OPTIONS
       -g <geometry>
              Window Geometry - ie: 64x64+10+10

       -d <display>
              Display -  ie: 127.0.0.1:0.0

       -f <filename>
              Full path to configuration file.

       -F <font>
              Custom tooltip font (e.g. -bh-lucidatypewriter-medium-*-*-*-12-*)

       -v     Verbose Mode, gives extra debug output.

       -h     Quick overview of available options.

       -s     Swap tooltip colors.

       -n     Turn off tooltips.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file is case sensitive. A # starts a comment, and lines consisting entirely of whitespace are ignored. The syntax is simply:

       <buttonnumber> <command>

       command can be anything you can type in as a shell command.

       Buttons are numbered as follows:

       Left button
                    1 2 3
                   4 5 6
                   7 8 9

       Middle button
                   11 12 13
                   14 15 16
                   17 18 19

       Right button
                   21 22 23
                   24 25 26
                   27 28 29
