DESCRIPTION
       nedit-client is the client interface to the NEdit text editor. A server
       can be started explicitly by running NEdit in server mode:

        nedit -server

       If no server is running, nedit-client will start one unless configured
       otherwise.  Client/server mode is useful for integrating NEdit with
       software development environments, mailers, and other programs; or just
       as a quick way to open files from the shell command line without
       starting a new NEdit session.

OPTIONS
       -read
           Open the file read-only regardless of the actual file protection.

       -create
           Don't warn about file creation when a file doesn't exist.

       -line n, +n
           Go to line number n.

       -do command
           Execute an NEdit macro or action on the file following the -do
           argument on the command line.

           If you use this command without a filename, nedit-client would
           randomly choose one window to focus and execute the macro in.

       -ask, -noask
           Instructs nedit-client whether to automatically start a server if
           one is not available. This overrides the X resource `nc.autoStart'.

       -svrname name
           Explicitly instructs nedit-client which server to connect to, an
           instance of nedit(1) with a corresponding -svrname argument.  By
           naming servers, you can run several simultaneously, and direct
           files and commands specifically to any one.

       -svrcmd command
           The command which nedit-client uses to start an NEdit server. It is
           also settable via the X resource `nc.serverCommand', by default,
           "nedit -server".

       -lm languagemode
           Initial language mode used for editing succeeding files.

       -geometry geometry, -g geometry
           The initial size and/or location of editor windows. The argument
           geometry has the form:

             [<width>x<height>][+|-][<xoffset>[+|-]<yoffset>]

           where `<width>' and `<height>' are the desired width and height of
           the window, and `<xoffset>' and `<yoffset>' are the distance from
           the edge of the screen to the window, + for top or left, - for
           bottom or right. -geometry can be specified for individual files on
           the command line.

       -icon, -iconic
           Initial window state for succeeding files.

       -display [host]:server[.screen]
           The name of the X server to use. host specifies the machine, server
           specifies the display server number, and screen specifies the
           screen number.  host or screen can be omitted and default to the
           local machine, and screen 0.

       -timeout seconds
           Basic time-out period (in seconds) used in communication with an
           NEdit server.  Default: 10 seconds. Also settable via the X
           resource `nc.timeOut'.

           Under rare conditions (such as a slow connection), it may be
           necessary to increase the time-out period. In most cases, the
           default is fine.

       -wait
           Instructs nedit-client not to return to the shell until all files
           given are closed.

           Normally, nedit-client returns once the files given in its command
           line are opened by the server. When this option is given, nedit-
           client returns only after the last file given in this call is
           closed.  Note that this option affects all files, not only the ones
           following this option in the command line.

       -xrm resourcestring
           Set the value of an X resource to override a default value.

       -tabbed
           Open all subsequent files in new tabs. Resets -group option.

       -untabbed
           Open all subsequent files in new windows. Resets -group option.

       -group
           Open all subsequent files as tabs in a new window.

       -V, -version
           Prints version and build information, to be mentioned when
           reporting bugs and problems.

       -h, -help
           Prints the command line help and then exits.

       --  Treats all subsequent arguments as file names, even if they start
           with a dash.  This is so NEdit can access files that begin with the
           dash character.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY
           NEdit requires an X-based workstation or X-Terminal. If you have
           used telnet or rlogin to access the host Unix system, set the Unix
           environment variable for your display:

               % setenv DISPLAY devicename:0

NOTES
       Communication between nedit-client(1) and nedit(1) is through the X
       display. So as long as X windows is set up and working properly, nedit-
       client will work properly as well. nedit-client uses the `DISPLAY'
       environment variable, the machine name and your user name to find the
       appropriate server, meaning, if you have several machines sharing a
       common file system, nedit-client will not be able to find a server that
       is running on a machine with a different host name, even though it may
       be perfectly appropriate for editing a given file.

       In typical Unix style, arguments affect the files which follow them on
       the command line, for example:

       incorrect:
             nedit-client file.c -line 25

       correct:
             nedit-client -line 25 file.c

       distribution kit.
