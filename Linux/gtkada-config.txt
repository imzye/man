NAME
       gtkada-config - script to get information about the installed version of GTKADA

SYNOPSIS
       gtkada-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags] [--static]

DESCRIPTION
       gtkada-config is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use GTKADA.

OPTIONS
       gtkada-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of GTKADA on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a GTKADA program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a GTKADA program.

       --static
               Print the flags that are necessary to statically build a GTKADA program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified,  use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that GTKADA was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option must be specified before any
               --libs or --cflags options.
