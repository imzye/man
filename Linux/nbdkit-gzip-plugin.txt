NAME
       nbdkit-gzip-plugin - nbdkit gzip plugin

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit gzip [file=]FILENAME.gz

DESCRIPTION
       "nbdkit-gzip-plugin" is a file serving plugin for nbdkit(1).

       It serves the named "FILENAME.gz" over NBD, uncompressing it on the fly.  The plugin only supports read-only connections.

       Note that gzip files are not very good for random access in large files because seeking to a position in the gzip file involves uncompressing lots of data.  A more practical method to compress large
       disk images is to use the xz(1) format and nbdkit-xz-plugin(1).

PARAMETERS
       [file=]FILENAME.gz
           Serve the compressed file named "FILENAME.gz".

           This parameter is required.

           "file=" is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.  See "Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).

FILES
       $plugindir/nbdkit-gzip-plugin.so
           The plugin.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $plugindir.

VERSION
       "nbdkit-gzip-plugin" first appeared in nbdkit 1.0.
