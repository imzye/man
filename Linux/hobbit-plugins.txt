NAME
       xynagios - adaptor for using Nagios checks with Xymon

SYNOPSIS
       xynagios [options --] plugin [options ...]

DESCRIPTION
       xynagios runs a Nagios check, and reports its output in a way compatible with the Xymon (Hobbit, BB) monitoring system.

       The Xymon test name is taken from the plugin output if it starts with test_name OK|WARNING|CRITICAL|ERROR|UNKNOWN:. Otherwise, the basename of the plugin filename is used. A check_ prefix is
       removed for brevity.

OPTIONS
       --hostname=host
           Report tests as this host.

       --strip=prefix
           Remove  prefix  (regexp)  from  test  names.  The  prefix  "check_"  is  always  removed  before  stripping  other  prefixes.  Useful  for  trimming down overly verbose Nagios test names, e.g.
           "check_postgres_database_size" to "database_size".

       --test=name
           Test name to submit. Per default, the test name is derived from the plugin output, or from the plugin name, if the output doesn't indicate the name.

       --help
       --version
           Print help text and version, and exit.

       Options for sending RRD trends messages. If any of these is set, a data host.trends message is sent.

       --trends
           In addition to printing performance data in the status report (suitable for the NCV/SPLITNCV xymond_rrd modules), send in a data report for hostname.trends. This rrd module is more robust.

       --ds=name
           The data source (DS) name used in the RRD files, defaults to lambda.

       --dst=type
           The data source type used in the RRD files. Useful values are GAUGE (the default), COUNTER, DCOUNTER, DERIVE, DDERIVE, and ABSOLUTE. See rrdcreate(1) for details.

       --heartbeat=secs
           RRD heartbeat in seconds, default is 600.

       --min=N
           Data source minimum value, default is U for unknown.

       --max=N
           Data source maximum value, default is U for unknown.
