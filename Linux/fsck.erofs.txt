NAME
       fsck.erofs - tool to check the EROFS filesystem's integrity

SYNOPSIS
       fsck.erofs [OPTIONS] IMAGE

DESCRIPTION
       fsck.erofs  is used to scan an EROFS filesystem IMAGE and check the in‐
       tegrity of it.

OPTIONS
       -V     Print the version number of fsck.erofs and exit.

       -d #   Specify the level of debugging messages. The default is 2, which
              shows basic warning messages.

       -p     Print  total compression ratio of all files including compressed
              and non-compressed files.

       --device=path
              Specify an extra device to be used together.  You may give  mul‐
              tiple `--device' options in the correct order.

       --extract
              Check  if all files are well encoded. This will induce more I/Os
              to read compressed file data, so it might take too much time de‐
              pending on the image.

       --help Display this help and exit.
