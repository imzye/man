NAME
       Time::Warp - control over the flow of time

SYNOPSIS
           use Time::Warp qw(scale to time);

           to(time + 5);  # 5 seconds ahead
           scale(2);      # make time flow twice normal

DESCRIPTION
       Our external experience unfolds in 3 1/2 dimensions (time has a dimensionality of 1/2).  The Time::Warp module offers developers control over the measurement of time.

API
       •   to($desired_time)

           The  theory  of  relativity  asserts that all physical laws are enforced relative to the observer.  Since the starting point of time is arbitrary, it is permissible to change it.  This has the
           effect of making it appear as if time is moving forwards or backward instanteously.  For example, on some types of operating systems time starts at Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 1969 (this  will  likely
           change as we approach 2030 and with the acceptance of 64-bit CPUs).

             to(time + 60*60);       # 1 hour ahead

       •   scale($factor)

           Changes the speed at which time is progressing.

             scale(scale * 2);   # double the speed of time

           Note that it is not possible to stop time or cause it to reverse since this is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics.
