NAME
       Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin::Ping - "ping" various services when nodes are written

SYNOPSIS
         use Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin::Ping;
         my $ping = Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin::Ping->new(
                   node_to_url => 'http://mywiki/$node',
                   services => {
                           "geourl" => 'http://geourl.org/ping?p=$url'
                   },
                   agent    => "My Wiki ping agent",
         );
         $wiki->register_pugin( plugin => $ping );

DESCRIPTION
       A plug-in for Wiki::Toolkit sites, which will "ping" various external services when a node is written. A list of the services to ping, and where in their URLs to add the URL of the node, are
       supplied when the plugin is created.

       You need to tell it how to turn a node into a URL (node_to_url), and what services to ping (services). You can optionally pass a custom user-agent string
