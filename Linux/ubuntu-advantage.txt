NAME
       ubuntu-advantage - Manage Ubuntu Advantage services from Canonical

SYNOPSIS
       ua <command> [<args>]
       ubuntu-advantage <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       Ubuntu  Advantage  is  a collection of services offered by Canonical to Ubuntu users. The Ubuntu Advantage command line tool is used to attach a system to an
       Ubuntu Advantage contract to then enable and disable services from Canonical. The available commands and services are described in more detail below.

COMMANDS
       attach [--no-auto-enable] <token>
              Connect an Ubuntu Advantage support contract to this machine.

              The token parameter can be obtained from https://auth.contracts.canonical.com/.

              The optional --no-auto-enable flag will disable the automatic enablement of recommended entitlements which usually happens immediately  after  a  suc‐
              cessful attach.

       collect-logs [-o <file>| --output <file>]
              Create a tarball with all relevant UA logs and debug data.

              The --output parameter defines the path to the tarball. If not provided, the file is saved as ua_logs.tar.gz in the current directory.

       detach Remove the Ubuntu Advantage support contract from this machine. This also disables all enabled services that can be.

       disable [cc-eal|cis|esm|fips|fips-updates|livepatch|ros|ros-updates]
              Disable this machine's access to an Ubuntu Advantage service.

       enable [cc-eal|cis|esm|fips|fips-updates|livepatch|ros|ros-updates]
              Activate and configure this machine's access to an Ubuntu Advantage service.

       fix <security_issue>
              Fix a CVE or USN on the system by upgrading the appropriate package(s).

              <security_issue> can be any of the following formats: CVE-yyyy-nnnn, CVE-yyyy-nnnnnnn, or USN-nnnn-dd.

              The exit code can be 0, 1, or 2.
                  0: the fix was successfully applied
                  1: the fix cannot be applied
                  2: the fix was applied but requires a reboot before it takes effect

       refresh
              Refresh contract and service details from Canonical.

       security-status
              Show security updates for packages in the system, including all available ESM related content.

       status [--format=tabular|json|yaml]
              Report current status of Ubuntu Advantage services on system.

              This  shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Advantage support contract. When attached, the report includes the specific support contract
              details including contract name, expiry dates, and the status of each service on this system.

              The attached status output has four columns:

              SERVICE: name of the service

              ENTITLED: whether the contract to which this machine is attached entitles use of this service. Possible values are: yes or no

              STATUS: whether the service is enabled on this machine.  Possible values are: enabled, disabled, n/a (if your contract entitles you  to  the  service,
              but it isn't available for this machine) or — (if you aren't entitled to this service)

              DESCRIPTION: a brief description of the service

              The unattached status output instead has three columns. SERVICE and DESCRIPTION are the same as above, and there is the addition of:

              AVAILABLE: whether this service would be available if this machine were attached.  The possible values are yes or no.

       version
              Show version of the Ubuntu Advantage package.

TIMER JOBS
       UA client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need to be executed recurrently. The timer itself ticks every 5 minutes on average, and decides which jobs
       need to be executed based on their intervals.

       Jobs are executed by the timer script if the script has not yet run successfully, or their interval since last successful run is already exceeded.  There  is
       a  random  delay  applied to the timer, to desynchronize job execution time on machines spinned at the same time, avoiding multiple synchronized calls to the
       same service.

       Current jobs being checked and executed are:

       update_messaging
              Makes sure that the MOTD and APT messages match the available/enabled services on the system, showing information about available packages or security
              updates.

       update_status
              Makes sure the `ua status` command will have the latest information even when executed by a non-root user, updating the /var/lib/ubuntu-advantage/sta‐
              tus.json file.

       gcp_auto_attach
              Only operable on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) generic Ubuntu VMs without an active Ubuntu Advantage license. It polls GCP metadata every 5  minutes  to
              discover if a license has been attached to the VM through Google Cloud and will perform `ua auto-attach` in that case.

CONFIGURATION
       By default, Ubuntu Advantage client configuration options are read from /etc/ubuntu-advantage/uaclient.conf.

       The following configuration options are available:

       contract_url
              The ubuntu advantage contract server URL

       security_url
              The ubuntu advantage security server URL

       data_dir
              Where Ubuntu Advantage client stores its data files

       log_level
              The logging level used when writing to log_file

       log_file
              The log file for the Ubuntu Advantage client

       timer_log_file
              The log file for the Ubuntu Advantage timer and timer jobs

       license_check_log_file
              The log file for the Ubuntu Advantage license check job (only used on GCP)

       The following options must be nested under the "ua_config" key:

       http_proxy
              If set, ua will use the specified http proxy when making any http requests

       https_proxy
              If set, ua will use the specified https proxy when making any https requests

       apt_http_proxy
              If set, ua will configure apt to use the specified http proxy by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy

       apt_https_proxy
              If set, ua will configure apt to use the specified https proxy by writing a apt config file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage-aptproxy

       <job_name>_timer
              Sets the timer running interval for a specific job. Those intervals are checked every time the systemd timer runs.

       If needed, authentication to the proxy server can be performed by setting username and password in the URL itself, as in:

         http_proxy: http://<username>:<password>@<fqdn>:<port>

       Additionally, some configuration options can be overridden in the environment by setting an environment variable prefaced by UA_<option_name>. Both uppercase
       and lowercase environment variables are allowed. The configuration options that support this are: data_dir, log_file, timer_log_file, license_check_log_file,
       log_level, and security_url.

       For example, the following overrides the log_level found in uaclient.conf:

         UA_LOG_LEVEL=info ua attach

SERVICES
       Common Criteria EAL2 Provisioning (cc-eal)
              Enables and install the Common Criteria artifacts.

              The  artifacts  include  a  configure  script,  a  tarball  with  additional  packages,  and  post install scripts. The artifacts will be installed in
              /usr/lib/common-criteria directory and the README and configuration guide are available in /usr/share/doc/ubuntu-commoncriteria directory.

       CIS Audit (cis)
              Enables and installs the CIS Audit artifacts.

       Extended Security Maintenance (esm)
              Extended Security Maintenance ensures the ongoing security and integrity of systems running Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases through Ubuntu Ad‐
              vantage for Infrastructure.

       FIPS 140-2 certified modules (fips)
              Install, configure, and enable FIPS 140-2 certified modules.

              After successfully enabling FIPS, the system MUST be rebooted. Failing to reboot will result in the system not running the updated FIPS kernel.

              Disabling FIPS is not currently supported.

       FIPS 140-2 certified modules with updates (fips-updates)
              Install,  configure,  and  enable FIPS 140-2 certified modules with updates. Enabling FIPS with updates will take the system out of FIPS compliance as
              the updated modules are not FIPS certified.

              After successfully enabling FIPS with updates, the system MUST be rebooted. Failing to reboot will result in the system not running the  updated  FIPS
              kernel.

              Disabling FIPS with updates is not currently supported.
