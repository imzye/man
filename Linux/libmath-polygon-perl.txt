Math::Polygon::Surface(3pm)                                                         User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                         Math::Polygon::Surface(3pm)

NAME
       Math::Polygon::Surface - Polygon with exclusions

SYNOPSIS
         my $outer   = Math::Polygon->new( [1,2], [2,4], [5,7], [1,2] );
         my $surface = Math::Polygon::Surface->new($outer);

DESCRIPTION
       A surface is one polygon which represents the outer bounds of an array, plus optionally a list of polygons which represent exclusions from that outer polygon.

METHODS
   Constructors
       $any->new( [%options], [@polygons], %options )
           You may merge %options with @polygons.  You may also use the "outer" and "inner" options.

           Each polygon is a references to an ARRAY of points, each an ARRAY of X and Y, but better pass Math::Polygon objects.

            -Option--Default
             inner   []
             outer   undef

           inner => \@polygons
             The inner @polygons, zero or more Math::Polygon objects.

           outer => $polygon
             The outer $polygon, a Math::Polygon.

   Attributes
       $obj->inner()
           Returns a list (often empty) of inner polygons.

       $obj->outer()
           Returns the outer polygon.

   Simple calculations
       area()
           Returns the area enclosed by the outer polygon, minus the areas of the inner polygons.  See method Math::Polygon::area().

       $obj->bbox()
           Returns a list with four elements: (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax), which describe the bounding box of the surface, which is the bbox of the outer polygon.  See method Math::Polygon::bbox().

       $obj->perimeter()
           The length of the border: sums outer and inner perimeters.  See method Math::Polygon::perimeter().

   Clipping
       $obj->fillClip1($box)
           Clipping a polygon into rectangles can be done in various ways.  With this algorithm, the parts of the polygon which are outside the $box are mapped on the borders.

           All polygons are treated separately.

       $obj->lineClip($box)
           Returned is a list of ARRAYS-OF-POINTS containing line pieces from the input surface.  Lines from outer and inner polygons are undistinguishable.  See method Math::Polygon::lineClip().

       $obj->string()
           Translate the surface structure into some string.  Use Geo::WKT if you need a standardized format.

           Returned is a single string possibly containing multiple lines.  The first line is the outer, the other lines represent the inner polygons.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Error: surface requires outer polygon
           Cast by new()
