AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              VPtoVF is an extended version of the program PLtoTF, which is part of the standard TeXware library.  OVP2OVF is an extended version of VPtoVF that al‐
              lows much larger fonts.  The idea of a virtual font was inspired by the work of David R. Fuchs who designed a similar set of conventions in 1984 while
              developing a device driver for ArborText, Inc.  He wrote a somewhat similar program called PLFONT.
