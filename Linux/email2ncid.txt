DESCRIPTION
       The email2ncid gateway sends the contents of an email to the NCID server as one line.  It is called from a .procmailrc file when an email contains the line: Subject: NCID Message

       The email2ncid gateway has an option to only send an email subject line to the NCID server.  It is called from a .procmailrc file when the email address or name matches on the email "From:" line.

       The email must be in either plain text, or HTML and plain text.  The output of email2ncid is a one line NCID message sent to an NCID server.

OPTIONS
       -C, --configfile <filename>
           Specifies the configuration file to use.  The program will still run if a configuration file is not found.

       -H <0|1>, --hostname-flag <0|1>
           When the hostname flag is set to 1, the IDENT string sent to a server will include the hostname with the program name.

           Default: 0

       -h, --help
           Displays the help message and exits.

       -m, --man

       -N <0|1>, --notify <0|1>
           This option sends a message to NCID containing only the subject line instead of the email contents as one line.  It is a notification of some type:

               * visitor arrived at a gate in a gated community
               * an important email arrived

       -n <[host][:port]>, --ncidserver <[host][:port]>
           Specifies the NCID server.  Port may be specified by suffixing the hostname with :<port>.

           Input must be <host:port> or <host>, or <:host>

       -t <1-9>, --test <1-9>
           Test mode connects to the server and displays some information and the message.  It does not send the message to the server.  Set the level to a higher number for more information.  Levels range
           from 1 to 9, but not all levels are used.

               test = 1: show some variables and generated message
               test = 2: additionally show 2 or 3 lines returned by server
               test = 3: additionally show the email message

           Default: no test mode

       -V, --version
