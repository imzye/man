SMP_REP_PHY_SATA(8)                                                                                SMP_UTILS                                                                                SMP_REP_PHY_SATA(8)

NAME
       smp_rep_phy_sata - invoke REPORT PHY SATA SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_rep_phy_sata [--affiliation=AC] [--help] [--hex] [--interface=PARAMS] [--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] [--zero] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a  SAS  Serial  Management  Protocol  (SMP)  REPORT  PHY SATA request function to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the
       SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify an HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between HBAs  if  there  are  multiple
       present.

       -a, --affiliation=AC
              where AC is the affiliation context relative identifier that is placed in request (new in sas2r08). Defaults to 0.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -p, --phy=ID
              phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and 254. Default is 0.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies  the  SAS  address  of the SMP target device. Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the target's SAS address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in
              decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

       -z, --zero
              zero the Allocated Response Length field in the request. This option also zeros the Request Length field in the request. This is required for strict  SAS-1.1  compliance.  However  this  option
              should not be given in SAS-2 and later; if it is given an abridged response may result.

EXAMPLES
       See "Examples" section in http://sg.danny.cz/sg/smp_utils.html

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP REPORT PHY SATA function was introduced in SAS-1 .  The "Expander change count", "STP I_T nexus loss occurred" and several other fields were added in SAS-2 .
