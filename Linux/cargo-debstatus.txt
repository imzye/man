NAME
       cargo-debstatus - cargo-tree for debian packaging

SYNOPSYS
       cargo-debstatus OPTIONS

       cargo-debstatus –all-features

       cargo-debstatus -h

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cargo-debstatus command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       cargo-debstatus  should  be  run in a rust project folder.  It will then print a dependency graph showing dependencies already in debian and dependencies still missing for packaging.  Dependencies
       already in the Debian archive will show up green; those not in Debian yet white.  Packages currently in the NEW queue will show up in turquoise.

OPTIONS
       -p, --package <SPEC>
              Package to be used as the root of the tree

       --target <TARGET>

       -f, --format <FORMAT>
              Format string used for printing dependencies [default: {p}]

       -v, --verbose
              Use verbose output (-vv very verbose/build.rs output)

       -q, --quiet
              No output printed to stdout other than the tree

       --color <WHEN>
              Coloring: auto, always, never
