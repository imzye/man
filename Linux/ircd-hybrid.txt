NAME
       ircd - ircd-hybrid: an advanced, lightweight Internet Relay Chat Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ircd   [-configfile filename] [-klinefile filename] [-dlinefile filename] [-xlinefile filename] [-resvfile filename] [-logfile filename] [-pidfile filename] [-foreground] [-version] [-help]

DESCRIPTION
       ircd  is  the  server  (daemon)  program  for  the Internet Relay Chat Program. The ircd is a server in that its function is to "serve" the client program irc(1) and other compatible programs with
       messages and commands. All commands and user messages are passed directly to the ircd for processing and relaying to other IRC servers.

       This is ircd-hybrid, the highly modified (and hopefully improved) variant of the original ircd program by Jarkko Oikarinen.

OPTIONS
       -configfile filename
              Specifies the ircd.conf file to be used for this ircd. The option is used to override the default ircd.conf given at compile time. By default, this is "etc/ircd.conf" within the prefix  you
              installed the ircd in.

       -klinefile filename

       -dlinefile filename

       -xlinefile filename

       -resvfile filename
              Specifies  the  database files to be used for D-lines (host bans), K-lines (hostmask bans), X-lines (gecos bans) and RESVs (jupes) which by default are within the var/lib/ directory of your
              installation prefix as dline.db, kline.db, xline.db and resv.db.

       -logfile filename
              Specifies an alternative logfile to be used than that specified in include/defaults.h

       -pidfile filename
              Specifies the file used by the ircd to store its process ID. The option is used to override the default ircd.pid given at compile time.

       -foreground
              Makes ircd run in the foreground.

       -version
              Makes ircd print its version and exit.

       -help  Makes ircd print available options and exit.

USAGE
       If you plan to connect your IRC server to an existing IRC network, you will need to alter your local IRC configuration  file  (typically  named  "ircd.conf")  so  that  it  will  accept  and  make
       connections to other IRC servers.  This file contains the hostnames, IP addresses and sometimes passwords for connections to other ircds around the world.

       The example reference.ircd.conf in the doc/ directory documents itself. Read it carefully or you may expose a risk on your network simply by having your ircd running!

BOOTING THE SERVER
       It  is  sufficient  to  type  ircd  at  the  command  line to start ircd-hybrid into the background. If you wish to run ircd in the foreground (perhaps for debugging purposes), use the -foreground
       parameter.

       The ircd-hybrid package in your distribution may ship with an rc-script which handles this for you. In Debian, it is /etc/init.d/ircd-hybrid.

EXAMPLE
       # ircd -configfile /usr/share/ircd/ircd.conf -logfile /var/log/ircd.log

       Starts ircd with the config file /usr/share/ircd/ircd.conf and with a log file /var/log/ircd.log. It implicitly forks back to the console -- to prevent this, use -foreground.

       Many of the above paths are hard-coded at compile time in the include/defaults.h file, so it may be convenient to edit these to suit your needs before you compile the ircd.
