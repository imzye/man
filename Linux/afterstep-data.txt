NAME
       Feel - AfterStep feel configuration

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       AnimateDeskChange

              That setting requests nice animation to be drawn over the desktop, during desktop switching.Comment it out to speed up desktop switching.

       AppsBackingStore

              Specifies  that  app  windows  should  request backing store. X-terminals and low memory systems should avoid this as redrawing will be quicker than pulling the saved image from swap space.
              Backing store will always be faster than redraw on machines that have enough memory. This causes non-ICCCM compliance.

       AutoFocus

              Do not use. Obsolete.

       AutoRaise delay

              Specifies the delay in milliseconds of focus a window must attain before being raised.

       AutoReverse 0|1|2

              Specifies the window Warping (also called alt-tabbing) style. 0 (the default) causes switching among windows in one direction. 1  causes  a  closed  loop  switching  -  #1->#2->#3->#4  then
              #4->#3->#2->#1. 2 causes an open loop switching - #1->#2->#3->#4 then #4->#1->#2->#3 etc.

       AutoTabThroughDesks

              In conjunction with AutoReverse, this will Warp (alt-tab) through windows on all desks.

       BackingStore

              Specifies that decorations should request backing store. Refer to AppsBackingStore for further details.

       CenterOnCirculate

              Specifies that when Warping (alt-tabbing), the desktop page containing the window to which the pointer is moving will be automatically selected and afterstep will attempt to center the tar‐
              get window in the desktop viewport, rather than just flipping to the desktop the window resides in.

       CirculateSkipIcons

              Specifies that all icons should be skipped when Warping (alt- tabbing) between windows.

       ClickTime

              Specifies that afterstep should consider two mouse clicks made within delay milliseconds to be a double mouse click, and not two single mouse clicks. The default delay is 150 milliseconds.

       ClickToFocus

              Specifies that the keyboard input (aka focus) stays with one window until a new window's TitleBar is clicked on, or gains focus through Warping or de-iconification.

              AfterStep will not switch focus following mouse pointer, but instead will switch it when window is explicitly clicked. This is the same as before. The only difference is that AfterStep will
              not Raise window automagically, unless some other settings are set. Possible way to Raise window on focusing include:

              - set AutoRaise 0 in feel file ( delay of 0 )

              - bind mouse clicks to Raise or RaiseLower function in feel file.

              - set ClickToRaise flag in feel file.

       ClickToRaise

              Specifies  that windows should be raised when a button is clicked in the titlebar, handle (low bar), or application area. buttons specifies the list of buttons which triggers this function.
              In AutoRaise mode this will simply raise the window if the click is before the delay specified in AutoRaise. In ClickToFocus mode, this will raise the window and give it focus.

       CoverAnimationSteps steps count

              CoverAnimationSteps is the number of animation steps to take while removing blue-tinted cover window.

       CoverAnimationType type

              CoverAnimationType determines what type of animation to use while removing blue-tinted desktop cover - use values from 0 to 13.

       Cursor cursor_number cursor_type

              Specifies the cursor_type for the given cursor_number . Valid cursor_numbers are 0 though 10 and listed in all the shipped feel.name files. The  cursor_types  are  listed  in  the  /usr/in‐
              clude/X11/cursorfont.h file.

       CustomCursor path

              Adds  a  custom  cursor from the search paths. AfterStep searches the following paths in addition to the system Xorg/Xfree paths: ~/.afterstep/desktop/cursors/ and $SHAREDIR/afterstep/desk‐
              top/cursors/.

              Note: under Xorg, this is probably depreciated. Current Xorg uses the Xcursor library to load cursor data from a single file.

       DecorateTransients

              Specifies that transient windows (pop-up dialog boxes), which are normally not decorated, should be given the usual title and low bars. Note: some pop-up windows and menus are  not  managed
              by the window manager, so do not get these decorations.

       DefaultWindowBox "windowbox_name"

              Window  boxes are processed in order they were listed in config. If suitable windowbox could not be found for the window in the database file - then windowbox named in DefaultWindowBox will
              be forced.

       DeskAnimationSteps steps

              Specifies how many animation steps should be rendered while switching desktops/removing blue cover. Reduce that number to speedup animation.

       DeskAnimationType value

              This requests particular type of animation to be rendered while switching desktops. Available values are in range of 0 to 12.

       DontMoveOff

              Specifies that windows should not be moved off or initially placed off of the desktop. A few programs will not work cor- rectly if you use this option. This only keeps  windows  from  being
              completely lost off the edge of the desktop. It insists on keeping 16 pixels on the desktop, but does not attempt to keep the entire window on the desk.

       DontRestoreFocus

              Will not restore focus to the recently focused application wile switching desktops.

       EdgeResistance delay pixels

              Specifies how hard it should be to change views within a desktop by moving the mouse over the edge of the screen, and how hard it hould be to move a window over the edge of a screen.

              The  delay  in milliseconds, defines how long the pointer must spend at the screen edge before that view becomes current. This is useful in conjunction with EdgeScroll 100 100, so the views
              don't get switched accidently.

              The pixels defines how far over the edge a window must "appear" to move before it actually moves partially off the screen.

              Note that with EdgeScroll 0 0, it is still possible to move or resize windows across the edge of the current screen. By setting the pixels parameter of EdgeResistance to 10000, this type of
              motion is impossible. However, with EdgeResistances less than 10000, but greater than 0, moving over pages becomes difficult but not impossible.

       EdgeScroll horizontal vertical

              Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor hits the edge of a page. Setting EdgeScroll to 0 0 will disable scrolling. Setting this option to  100  100  will  scroll  whole
              pages. Set to 1000 1000, scrolling will wrap around at the edge of the desktop. Both horizontal and vertical should be positive numbers.

       FollowTitleChanges

              That will force AfterStep to reread and merge all the hints and settings from the database files, whenever window changes either its name or icon name.

       Function

              Specifies a complex function definition and is covered in the built-in command/function.

              See Also: AS Function for further details.

       IconTitle

              Specifies  that  a  title should be displayed under an iconified app. The colors used are the ForeColor and BackColor of the ButtonTitleFocus in the look.name file. Note: less space is left
              for the app's icon, so it will be resized acordingly. Only a portion of the icon title will be displayed until the icon gains focus, and then the title "box" will expand to reveal the  win‐
              dow's entire name.

        KeepIconWindows

              Specifies that applications should be allowed to specify their own icon windows.

       Key keyname  context  modifier  Command

              Specifies  a  key-stroke  binding  definition, similar to Mouse . keyname is the keyboard key name. Valid keyname 's are found in the /usr/X11/include/X11/keysymdef.h file and are specified
              here without the leading "XK_". The context describes where the mouse is resting when the keyname is pressed and can be any combination of the following: R = Root window (main background) F
              = Window Frame (the BottomBar handle corners) S = Window TitleBar or BottomBar I = Iconified Button (minimized window icon) T = Window TitleBar W = Application Window A = Any of  the  above
              except for TitleButtons 1-10 = TitleButton number of the TitleBar [ not very useful here ]
               modifier is the key-stroke combination associated with the context entry, to issue the Command . Valid modifier 's are:

                 N = No modifiers
                 C = Control
                 S = Shift
                 M = Meta
                 A = Any modifier

               Command can be any afterstep  Built-in command/ function, Popup or user defined Function .

              See Also: AS Function for further details.

       MenusHigh

              Specifies that any pop-up menu's submenu should appear at the top of the parent menu instead of starting at the point in the parent window where the submenu item lies.

       Mouse button  context  modifier  Command

              Specifies  a  mouse  binding definition. button is the mouse button number [0, 1, 2, or 3]. If button is zero, then any mouse button invoked issues the Command . context describes where the
              mouse click occurred and can be any combination of the following:

                 R = Root window (main background)
                 F = Window Frame (the BottomBar handle corners)
                 S = Window TitleBar or BottomBar
                 I = Iconified Button (minimized window icon)
                 T = Window TitleBar
                 W = Application Window
                 A = Any of the above except for TitleButtons 1-10 = TitleButton number of the TitleBar, corresponds to the
                     entry in the  look.name  file

              The action to be taken by the defined TitleButton is defined in the feel.name file. Defining a TitleButton without having a corresponding entry in the feel.name file will cause  the  Title‐
              Button icon to be displayed, but not react when pressed.

               modifier is the key-stroke combination associated with the context entry, to issue the Command . Valid modifier 's are:

                 N = No modifiers
                 C = Control
                 S = Shift
                 M = Meta
                 A = Any modifier

               Command can be any afterstep  Built-in command/ function, Popup or user defined Function .

              See Also: AS Function for further details.

       NoPPosition

              Species  that  afterstep  should ignore the PPosition field when placing new windows, in other words, windows can't choose where to place themselves. Adherence to the PPosition field is re‐
              quired for some applications.

       NoSnapKey key

              AfterStep now has a feature that "snaps" windows to different desktop features, such as edges of other windows and edge of the screen. To disable it temorarily you can press and hold  Shift
              key. Use this setting to request different modifier key instead of Shift.

       OpaqueMove %

              Specifies  the  maximum size window where opaque window movement should be used. % is percent of the total screen area. Set to 0, all windows will be moved using the traditional rubber-band
              outline. Set to 100, all windows will be move as solid windows. The default is 5 which allows small windows to be moved in an opaque manner, but large windows to be moved  as  rubber-bands.
              Using this option with large values can slow down video response on slower systems.

       OpaqueResize %

              Specifies  the  maximum size window where opaque resizing should be used. % is percent of the total screen area. Set to 0, all windows will be resized using the traditional rubber-band out-
              line. Set to 100, all windows will be resized as solid windows. The default is 5 which allows small windows to be resized in an opaque manner, but  large  windows  to  be  resized  as  rub‐
              ber-bands. Using this option with large values can slow down video response on slower systems.

       PagingDefault 0|1

              Specifies if Paging should be enabled (1) or disabled (0). Paging is set to enabled by default.

       PersistentMenus

              Right now if you try to open a menu when its already opened - that will cause menu to close. To disable this behaviour and instead pop-up a menu again - use this setting.

       Popup

              Specifies a menu popup definition and is covered in the built-in command/function.

              See Also: AS Function for further details.

       RandomPlacement

              Specifies that windows which would normally require user inter- vention for placement be automagically placed in ever-so- slightly random locations.

       RecentSubmenuItems number_of_items

              Defines maximum number of recently used submenu items to be listed under menu item. Set to 0 to disable feature. Default is 4.

       SaveUnders

              Specifies  that afterstep frames should request saveunders. This will cause afterstep to save those portions of windows that are not visible to system memory. This can significantly improve
              the performance during opaque moves, but it causes a significant increase in memory usage. This can also cause garbled display with some applications.

       ScreenEdgeAttraction distance

              Defines distance from which window will be attracted to the screen edge, while being interactively moved/resized.

       ShadeAnimationSteps steps

              Defines how many steps to use to render animation when window gets shaded/unshaded.

       ShadeAnimationSteps steps

              Defines how many steps to use to render animation when window gets shaded/unshaded.

       SloppyFocus

              Specifies that windows retain focus until the mouse moves to another window, or Warping causes another window to gain focus.

              SloppyFocus has no effect if ClickToFocus is also specified.

       SmartPlacement

              Specifies that windows be placed in areas that no other windows occupy, otherwise user intervention becomes required for placement. Have fun, try specifying both. :-)

       StickyIcons

              Specifies that icons should stick to the screen's glass and fol- low it from desk/view to desk/view.

       StubbornIconPlacement

              Specifies that icons should avoid being hidden behind windows placed over the IconBox by moving themselves around (dancing icons).

       StubbornIcons

              Specifies that icons should uniconify to their original desk. By default, icons uniconify to the current desk.

       StubbornPlacement

              Specifies that new windows should avoid being placed over icons.

       SuppressIcons

              Specifies that no icon should be shown for any window being iconified, similar to NoIcon.

       WinListHideIcons

              When set, Icons in internal WindowList ( the window that pops up if you right click on root window) will not be shown.

       WinListSortOrder 0/1/2/3

              Arranges WinList entries based-on the following qualifiers: 0 - circulations order (default), 1 - Alpha order, 2 - Stacking order (unimplemented), 3 - creation order (unimplemented).

       WindowBox "windowbox_name"

              WindowBox defines an area on the screen/virtual desktop into which a window will be placed on startup.

              See Also: Feel WindowBox definition for further details.

       WindowEdgeAttraction distance

              Defines distance from which window will be attracted to the other window's edge, while being interactively moved/resized.

        XorValue value

              Specifies the value with which bits are XOR'ed when doing rubber-band window moving or resizing. Setting this value is a trial-and-error process.

        Xzap number

              Specifies the horizontal offset of the cursor when warping. This offset is relative to the upper-left corner of the window being warped to.

        Yzap number

              Specifies the vertical offset of the cursor when warping. This offset is relative to the upper-left corner of the window being warped to.
