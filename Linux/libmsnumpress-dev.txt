NAME
       libmsnumpress        —             Implementations of two compression schemes for numeric data from mass spectrometers.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the libmsnumpress software package.

       The  library  provides implementations of 3 different algorithms, 1 designed to compress first order smooth data like retention time or M/Z arrays, and 2 for compressing non smooth data with lower
       requirements on precision like ion count arrays.

Useful reading
       The  library  is  documented  fully  in  the   developer  documentation,  that is packaged in the libmsnumpress-dev-doc package. That documentation is available in the form of HTML-formatted files
       (/usr/share/doc/libmsnumpress-dev-doc.pdf).
