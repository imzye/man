NAME
       kraken2-build - assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences

SYNOPSIS
       kraken2-build [task option] [options]

DESCRIPTION
   Task options (exactly one must be selected):
       --download-taxonomy
              Download NCBI taxonomic information

       --download-library TYPE
              Download partial library (TYPE = one of "archaea", "bacteria", "plasmid", "viral", "human", "fungi", "plant", "protozoa", "nr", "nt", "env_nr", "env_nt", "UniVec", "UniVec_Core")

       --special TYPE
              Download and build a special database (TYPE = one of "greengenes", "silva", "rdp")

       --add-to-library FILE
              Add FILE to library

       --build
              Create DB from library (requires taxonomy d/l'ed and at least one file in library)

       --clean
              Remove unneeded files from a built database

       --standard
              Download and build default database

       --help Print this message

       --version
              Print version information

OPTIONS
       --db NAME
              Kraken 2 DB/library name (mandatory except for --help/--version)

       --threads #
              Number of threads (def: 1)

       --kmer-len NUM
              K-mer length in bp/aa (build task only; def: 35 nt, 15 aa)

       --minimizer-len NUM
              Minimizer length in bp/aa (build task only; def: 31 nt, 15 aa)

       --minimizer-spaces NUM
              Number of characters in minimizer that are ignored in comparisons (build task only; def: 6 nt, 0 aa)

       --protein
              Build a protein database for translated search

       --no-masking
              Used  with  --standard/--download-library/  --add-to-library  to  avoid masking low-complexity sequences prior to building; masking requires dustmasker or segmasker to be installed in PATH,
              which some users might not have.

       --max-db-size NUM
              Maximum number of bytes for Kraken 2 hash table; if the estimator determines more would normally be needed, the reference library will be downsampled  to  fit.  (Used  with  --build/--stan‐
              dard/--special)
