OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
   General Options
       "--verbose"
           Requests informative output as processing proceeds. Can be repeated to increase the amount of information.

       "--VERSION"
           Shows the version number of the LaTeXML package..

       "--help"
           Shows this help message.

   Source Options
       "--sourcedirectory"=source
           Specifies the directory where the original latex source is located.  Unless latexmlpost is run from that directory, or it can be determined from the xml filename, it may be necessary to specify
           this option in order to find graphics and style files.

       "--validate", "--novalidate"
           Enables (or disables) the validation of the source XML document (the default).

   Format Options
       "--format"="(html|html5|html4|xhtml|xml)"
           Specifies the output format for post processing.  By default, it will be guessed from the file extension of the destination (if given), with html implying "html5", xhtml implying "xhtml" and the
           default being "xml", which you probably don't want.

           The "html5" format converts the material to html5 form with mathematics as MathML; "html5" supports SVG.  "html4" format converts the material to the earlier html form, version 4, and the
           mathematics to png images.  "xhtml" format converts to xhtml and uses presentation MathML (after attempting to parse the mathematics) for representing the math.  "html5" similarly converts math to
           presentation MathML. In these cases, any graphics will be converted to web-friendly formats and/or copied to the destination directory. If you simply specify "html", it will treat that as "html5".

           For the default, "xml", the output is left in LaTeXML's internal xml, although the math can be converted by enabling one of the math postprocessors, such as --pmml to obtain presentation MathML.
           For html, html5 and xhtml, a default stylesheet is provided, but see the "--stylesheet" option.

       "--destination="destination
           Specifies the destination file and directory.  The directory is needed for mathimages, mathsvg and graphics processing.

       "--omitdoctype", "--noomitdoctype"
           Omits (or includes) the document type declaration.  The default is to include it if the document model was based on a DTD.

       "--numbersections", "--nonumbersections"
           Includes (default), or disables the inclusion of section, equation, etc, numbers in the formatted document and crossreference links.

       "--stylesheet"=xslfile
           Requests the XSL transformation of the document using the given xslfile as stylesheet.  If the stylesheet is omitted, a `standard' one appropriate for the format (html4, html5 or xhtml) will be
           used.

       "--css"=cssfile
           Adds cssfile as a css stylesheet to be used in the transformed html/html5/xhtml.  Multiple stylesheets can be used; they are included in the html in the order given, following the default
           "ltx-LaTeXML.css".  The stylesheet is copied to the destination directory, unless it is an absolute url.

           Some stylesheets included in the distribution are
             --css=navbar-left   Puts a navigation bar on the left.
                                 (default omits navbar)
             --css=navbar-right  Puts a navigation bar on the left.
             --css=theme-blue    A blue coloring theme for headings.
             --css=amsart        A style suitable for journal articles.

       "--javascript"=jsfile
           Includes a link to the javascript file jsfile, to be used in the transformed html/html5/xhtml.  Multiple javascript files can be included; they are linked in the html in the order given.  The
           javascript file is copied to the destination directory, unless it is an absolute url.

       "--icon"=iconfile
           Copies iconfile to the destination directory and sets up the linkage in the transformed html/html5/xhtml to use that as the "favicon".

       "--nodefaultresources"
           Disables the copying and inclusion of resources added by the binding files; This includes CSS, javascript or other files.  This does not affect resources explicitly requested by the "--css" or
           "--javascript" options.

       "--timestamp"=timestamp
           Provides a timestamp (typically a time and date) to be embedded in the comments by the stock XSLT stylesheets.  If you don't supply a timestamp, the current time and date will be used.  (You can
           use "--timestamp=0" to omit the timestamp).

       "--xsltparameter"=name:value
           Passes parameters to the XSLT stylesheet.  See the manual or the stylesheet itself for available parameters.

   Site & Crossreferencing Options
       "--split", "--nosplit"
           Enables or disables (default) the splitting of documents into multiple `pages'.  If enabled, the the document will be split into sections, bibliography, index and appendices (if any) by default,
           unless "--splitpath" is specified.

       "--splitat="unit
           Specifies what level of the document to split at. Should be one of "chapter", "section" (the default), "subsection" or "subsubsection".  For more control, see "--splitpath".

       "--splitpath="xpath
           Specifies an XPath expression to select nodes that will generate separate pages. The default splitpath is
             //ltx:section | //ltx:bibliography | //ltx:appendix | //ltx:index

           Specifying

             --splitpath="//ltx:section | //ltx:subsection
                    | //ltx:bibliography | //ltx:appendix | //ltx:index"

           would split the document at subsections as well as sections.

       "--splitnaming"="(id|idrelative|label|labelrelative)"
           Specifies how to name the files for subdocuments created by splitting.  The values "id" and "label" simply use the id or label of the subdocument's root node for it's filename.  "idrelative" and
           "labelrelative" use the portion of the id or label that follows the parent document's id or label. Furthermore, to impose structure and uniqueness, if a split document has children that are also
           split, that document (and it's children) will be in a separate subdirectory with the name index.

       "--scan", "--noscan"
           Enables (default) or disables the scanning of documents for ids, labels, references, indexmarks, etc, for use in filling in refs, cites, index and so on.  It may be useful to disable when
           generating documents not based on the LaTeXML doctype.

       "--crossref", "--nocrossref"
           Enables (default) or disables the filling in of references, hrefs, etc based on a previous scan (either from "--scan", or "--dbfile") It may be useful to disable when generating documents not
           based on the LaTeXML doctype.

       "--urlstyle"="(server|negotiated|file)"
           This option determines the way that URLs within the documents are formatted, depending on the way they are intended to be served.  The default, "server", eliminates unnecessary trailing
           "index.html".  With "negotiated", the trailing file extension (typically "html" or "xhtml") are eliminated.  The scheme "file" preserves complete (but relative) urls so that the site can be
           browsed as files without any server.

       "--navigationtoc"="(context|none)"
           Generates a table of contents in the navigation bar; default is "none".  The `context' style of TOC, is somewhat verbose and reveals more detail near the current page; it is most suitable for
           navigation bars placed on the left or right.  Other styles of TOC should be developed and added here, such as a short form.

       "--index", "--noindex"
           Enables (default) or disables the generation of an index from indexmarks embedded within the document.  Enabling this has no effect unless there is an index element in the document (generated by
           \printindex).

       "--splitindex", "--nosplitindex"
           Enables or disables (default) the splitting of generated indexes into separate pages per initial letter.

       "--bibliography="pathname
           Specifies a bibliography generated from a BibTeX file to be used to fill in a bibliography element.  Hand-written bibliographies placed in a "thebibliography" environment do not need this.  The
           option has no effect unless there is an bibliography element in the document (generated by \bibliography).

           Note that this option provides the bibliography to be used to fill in the bibliography element (generated by "\bibliography"); latexmlpost does not (currently) directly process and format such a
           bibliography.

       "--splitbibliography", "--nosplitbibliography"
           Enables or disables (default) the splitting of generated bibliographies into separate pages per initial letter.

       "--prescan"
           By default "latexmlpost" processes a single document into one (or more; see "--split") destination files in a single pass.  When generating a complicated site consisting of several documents it
           may be advantageous to first scan through the documents to extract and store (in "dbfile") cross-referencing data (such as ids, titles, urls, and so on).  A later pass then has complete
           information allowing all documents to reference each other, and also constructs an index and bibliography that reflects the entire document set.  The same effect (though less efficient) can be
           achieved by running "latexmlpost" twice, provided a "dbfile" is specified.

       "--dbfile"=file
           Specifies a filename to use for the crossreferencing data when using two-pass processing.  This file may reside in the intermediate destination directory.

       "--sitedirectory="dir
           Specifies the base directory of the overall web site.  Pathnames in the database are stored in a form relative to this directory to make it more portable.

   Math Options
       These options specify how math should be converted into other formats.  Multiple formats can be requested; how they will be combined depends on the format and other options.

       "--mathimages", "--nomathimages"
           Requests or disables the conversion of math to images (png by default).  Conversion is the default for html4 format.

       "--mathsvg", "--nomathsvg"
           Requests or disables the conversion of math to svg images.

       "--mathimagemagnification="factor
           Specifies the magnification used for math images (both png and svg), if they are made. Default is 1.75.

       "--presentationmathml", "--nopresentationmathml"
           Requests or disables conversion of math to Presentation MathML.  Conversion is the default for xhtml and html5 formats.

       "--linelength"=number
           (Experimental) Line-breaks the generated Presentation MathML so that it is no longer than number `characters'.

       "--plane1"
           Converts the content of Presentation MathML token elements to the appropriate Unicode Plane-1 codepoints according to the selected font, when applicable (the default).

       "--hackplane1"
           Converts the content of Presentation MathML token elements to the appropriate Unicode Plane-1 codepoints according to the selected font, but only for the mathvariants double-struck, fraktur and
           script.  This gives support for current (as of August 2009) versions of Firefox and MathPlayer, provided a sufficient set of fonts is available (eg. STIX).

       "--contentmathml", "--nocontentmathml"
           Requests or disables conversion of math to Content MathML.  Conversion is disabled by default.  Note that this conversion is only partially implemented.

       "--openmath"
           Requests or disables conversion of math to OpenMath.  Conversion is disabled by default.  Note that this conversion is only partially implemented.

       "--keepXMath"
           By default, when any of the MathML or OpenMath conversions are used, the intermediate math representation will be removed; this option preserves it; it will be used as secondary parallel markup,
           when it follows the options for other math representations.

   Graphics Options
       "--graphicimages", "--nographicimages"
           Enables (default) or disables the conversion of graphics to web-appropriate format (png).

       "--graphicsmap="sourcetype.desttype
           Specifies a mapping of graphics file types. Typically, graphics elements specify a graphics file that will be converted to a more appropriate file target format; for example, postscript files used
           for graphics with LaTeX will be converted to png format for use on the web.  As with LaTeX, when a graphics file is specified without a file type, the system will search for the most appropriate
           target type file.

           When this option is used, it overrides and replaces the defaults and provides a mapping of sourcetype to desttype.  The option can be repeated to provide several mappings, with the earlier formats
           preferred.  If the desttype is omitted, it specifies copying files of type sourcetype, unchanged.

           The default settings is equivalent to having supplied the options:

             --graphicsmap=svg
             --graphicsmap=png
             --graphicsmap=gif
             --graphicsmap=jpg
             --graphicsmap=jpeg
             --graphicsmap=eps.png
             --graphicsmap=ps.png
             --graphicsmap=ai.png
             --graphicsmap=pdf.png

           The first formats are preferred and used unchanged, while the latter ones are converted to png.

       "--pictureimages", "--nopictureimages"
           Enables (default) or disables the conversion of picture environments and pstricks material into images.

       "--svg", "--nosvg"
           Enables or disables (default) the conversion of picture environments and pstricks material to SVG.
