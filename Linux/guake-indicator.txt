NAME
       guake-indicator — A simple Appindicator that lets you send custom commands to Guake.

SYNOPSIS
       guake-indicator

DESCRIPTION
       guake-indicator lets you manage your favorite customized commands establishing a new connection with Guake dropdown terminal.

       guake-indicator sticks to your "System Tray" and displays data retrieved from the Guake indicator configuration file (see FILES section for more details)

FILES
       guake-indicator builds the menu according to ~/.guake.indicator/guake-indicator.xml XML file

       If this configuration file does not exist a default one will be created.

       Although  Guake  indicator  has  a built-in menu editor, you can customize this file according to your needs with your favorite text editor, just use this schema as a base to add new entries.  The
       fields are self-explanatory, however, I'm going to give you a more in-depth description of each one:

       menu_name
              The name that will show up in the indicator itself

       tab_name
              the name of the guake terminal tab once it is opened (leave black if you don't want automatic autorenaming)

       command_after_login
              command to send to Guake through his DBUS interface

       dont_show_guake
              If set to yes, Guake indicator won't ask Guake to display his main window.  open_in_tab The index of the Guake tab where guake-indicator will execute the command.Guake assigns  index  0  to
              the  first tab so put in this field the nth tab-1 number.  If this tag has the attribute named="yes" it contains the name of the Guake tab lfcr If set to yes a LF (Line Feed) + CR (Carriage
              return) is sent to Guake after each line (by default only a line feed (ascii code 10) is sent.  guakeindicatorscript If set to yes enables the Guake indicator scripting function

       The above xml field are all optional (except menu_name) and must be stored within a XML Host parent field which in turn is enclosed within a HostGroup field.You can find more information and a xsd
       validation file at http://guake-indicator.ozzyboshi.com.
