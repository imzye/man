NAME
       eflite - a speech server for Festival lite

SYNOPSIS
       eflite

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the eflite command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documen‐
       tation in /usr/share/doc/eflite/README*

       eflite  is a program that is used as a backend for screen reader applications.  It is usually not called by the user, instead it is invoked by the application which needs to output information via
       Festival Lite's speech synthesis engine.

OPTIONS
       This program does not have any options at this time.  Instead, it's controlled by the data received via STDIN.
