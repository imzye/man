NAME
       shputils - shapefile utility

SYNOPSIS
       shputils in_shp_file out_shp_file args

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  will append to an existing shape file or it will create a new file if needed. Only the items in the first output file will be preserved. When an item does not match with the append theme
       then the item might be placed to an existing item at the same position and type.

       OTHER FUNCTIONS:

       ·   Describe all items in the dbase file (Use ALL for more than 5000 recs.)

       ·   Select a group of shapes from a comma separated selection list.

       ·   UnSelect a group of shapes from a comma separated selection list.

       ·   Clip boundary extent or by theme boundary. Touch writes all the shapes that touch the boundary. Inside writes all the shapes that are completely within the boundary. Boundary clips  are  only  the
           min and max of a theme boundary.

       ·   Erase boundary extent or by theme boundary. Erase is the direct opposite of the Clip function.

       ·   Change  coordinate  value  units between meters and feet. There is no way to determine the input unit of a shape file. Skip this function if the shape file is already in the correct unit. Clip and
           Erase will be done before the unit is changed. A shift will be done after the unit is changed.

       ·   Shift X and Y coordinates.

       Finally,

       There can only be one select or unselect in the command line.

       There can only be one clip or erase in the command line. There can only be one unit and only one shift in the command line.

       Examples:

       shputils in.shp out.shp SELECT countycode 3,5,9,13,17,27

       shputils in.shp out.shp CLIP 10 10 90 90 Touch FACTOR Meter Feet

       shputils in.shp out.shp FACTOR Meter 3.0

       shputils in.shp out.shp CLIP clip.shp Boundary Touch SHIFT 40 40

       shputils in.shp out.shp SELECT co 112 CLIP clip.shp Boundary Touch

       USAGE: shputils DescribeShape {ALL}

       USAGE: shputils InputShape OutShape|AppendShape

       { FACTOR FEET|MILES|METERS|KM FEET|MILES|METERS|KM|factor }

       { SHIFT xshift yshift }

       { SELECT|UNSEL Item valuelist }

       { CLIP|ERASE xmin ymin xmax ymax TOUCH|INSIDE|CUT }

       { CLIP|ERASE theme BOUNDARY TOUCH|INSIDE|CUT }

       Note: CUT is not complete and does not create intersections. For more information read programmer comment.
