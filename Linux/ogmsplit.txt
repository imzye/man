NAME
       ogmsplit - Split OGG/OGM files into sevaral smaller OGG/OGM files

SYNOPSIS
       ogmsplit [options] inname

DESCRIPTION
       ogmsplit can be used to easily split an OGM file after a given size.  Several OGM files will be created that each start with a keyframe.

       inname Use 'inname' as the source.

       -o, --output out
              Use 'out' as the base name. Ascending part numbers will be appended to it. Default is 'inname'. Examples:
              1) If -o output.ogg is given on the command line then ogmsplit will create output-000001.ogg, output-000002.ogg and so on.
              2) If no -o option is given and the input's name is movie.ogm then ogmsplit will create movie-000001.ogm and so on.

       The operation mode can be set with exactly one of -s, -t, -c or -p. The default mode is to split by size (-s).

       -s, --size size
              Size in MiB ( = 1024 * 1024 bytes) after which a new file will be opened (approximately). Default is 700MiB.  Size can end in 'B' to indicate 'bytes' instead of 'MiB'.

       -t, --time time
              Split after the given elapsed time (approximately).  'time' takes the form HH:MM:SS.sss or simply SS(.sss), e.g. 00:05:00.000 or 300.000 or simply 300.

       -c, --cuts cuts
              Produce  output  files  as  specified  by cuts, a list of slices of the form "start-end" or "start+length", separated by commas. If start is omitted, it defaults to the end of the previous cut.
              start and end take the same format as the arguments to -t.

       -n, --num num
              Don't create more than num separate files. The last one may be bigger than the desired size. Default is an unlimited number of files.  Can only be used with -s or -t.

       --frontend
              Frontend mode. Progress output will be terminated by \n instead of \r.

       -p, --print-splitpoints
              Only print the key frames and the number of bytes encountered before each. Useful to find the exact splitting point.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose and show each OGG packet.  Can be used twice to increase verbosity.

       -h, --help
              Show this help.

       -V, --version
              Show version information.

CHAPTER INFORMATION
       ogmsplit correctly handles chapter information. During the first pass the chapter information, if any is present, will be adjusted to match the output files generated. Chapters that are not  contained
       in the current output file are removed entirely. The other chapters are renumbered to start at 1, and their timestamps will be recalculated.
       Example: If your source file contains these four chapters:

       CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000
       CHAPTER01NAME=Chapter 01
       CHAPTER02=00:10:00.000
       CHAPTER02NAME=Chapter 02
       CHAPTER03=00:20:00.000
       CHAPTER03NAME=Chapter 03
       CHAPTER04=00:25:00.000
       CHAPTER04NAME=Chapter 04

       and you split after 15 minutes, then the first output file will only contain the first two chapters as shown above, and the second output file will contain the following two chapters and the remaining
       part of the first:

       CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000
       CHAPTER01NAME=Chapter 02 (continued)
       CHAPTER02=00:05:00.000
       CHAPTER02NAME=Chapter 03
       CHAPTER03=00:10:00.000
       CHAPTER03NAME=Chapter 04

       Note that only variable names are changed, not the chapter names themselves.  The exception is the first chapter of the second and following files where "(continued)" is appended in order to  indicate
       that this is not the start of this chapter. If you want to change them as well you'll have to remerge the resulting file with a new chapter file.
