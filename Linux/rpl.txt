NAME

SYNOPSIS
       rpl [OPTION...] OLD-TEXT NEW-TEXT [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       Search and replace text in files.

       Text matching the pattern OLD-TEXT is replaced by NEW-TEXT in each FILE. The pattern may match multiple lines.

       -h, --help
              Print help and exit

              Print help, including hidden options, and exit

       -V, --version

       OLD-TEXT matches at most once in each position, even when it matches the empty string.

       --encoding=ENCODING
              specify character set encoding

       -w, --whole-words

              rename original FILE to FILE~ before replacing (default=off)

       -q, --quiet
              quiet mode  (default=off)

       -v, --verbose
              verbose mode  (default=off)

       -s, --dry-run
              simulation mode  (default=off)

       -F, --fixed-strings
              treat OLD-TEXT and NEW-TEXT as fixed strings, not regular expressions  (default=off)

       --files
              OLD-TEXT and NEW-TEXT are file names to read patterns from  (default=off)

       -x, --glob=GLOB
              modify only files matching the given glob (may be given more than once)  (default=`*')

       -R, --recursive
              search recursively  (default=off)

       -p, --prompt
              prompt before modifying each file  (default=off)

       -f, --force
              ignore errors when trying to preserve attributes (default=off)

       -d, --keep-times
              keep the modification times on modified files (default=off)

       -i, --ignore-case
              search case-insensitively

       -m, --match-case
              ignore case when searching, but try to match case of replacement to case of original, either capitalized, all upper-case, or mixed

EXAMPLES
       Replace all occurrences of the word ‘funny’ with ‘annoying’ in all files with extension .txt under the reports/ directory:

              rpl --glob '*.txt' -R -w funny annoying reports
