NAME
       sphinx_fe - Convert audio files to acoustic feature files

SYNOPSIS
       sphinx_fe [ options ]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  converts audio files (in either Microsoft WAV, NIST Sphere, or raw format) to acoustic feature files for input to batch-mode speech recognition.  The resulting files are also useful for
       various other things.  A list of options follows:

       -alpha Preemphasis parameter

       -argfile
              file (e.g. feat.params from an acoustic model) to read parameters from.  This will override anything set in other command line arguments.

       -blocksize
              Number of samples to read at a time.

       -build_outdirs
              Create missing subdirectories in output directory

       -c     file for batch processing

       -cep2spec
              Input is cepstral files, output is log spectral files

       -di    directory, input file names are relative to this, if defined

       -dither
              Add 1/2-bit noise

       -do    directory, output files are relative to this

       -doublebw
              Use double bandwidth filters (same center freq)

       -ei    extension to be applied to all input files

       -eo    extension to be applied to all output files

       -example
              Shows example of how to use the tool

       -lifter
              Length of sin-curve for liftering, or 0 for no liftering.

       -logspec
              Write out logspectral files instead of cepstra

       -lowerf
              Lower edge of filters

       -mach_endian
              Endianness of machine, big or little

       -mswav Defines input format as Microsoft Wav (RIFF)

       -ncep  Number of cep coefficients

       -nchans

       -npart Number of parts to run in (supersedes -nskip and -runlen if non-zero)

       -nskip If a control file was specified, the number of utterances to skip at the head of the file

       -o     cepstral output file

       -ofmt  Format of output files - one of sphinx, htk, text.

       -part  Index of the part to run (supersedes -nskip and -runlen if non-zero)

       -raw   Defines input format as raw binary data

       -remove_dc
              Remove DC offset from each frame

       -remove_noise
              Remove noise with spectral subtraction in mel-energies

       -remove_silence

              Round mel filter frequencies to DFT points

       -runlen
              If a control file was specified, the number of utterances to process, or -1 for all

       -samprate
              Sampling rate

       -sph2pipe
              Input is NIST sphere (possibly with Shorten), use sph2pipe to convert

       -transform
              Which type of transform to use to calculate cepstra (legacy, dct, or htk)

       -unit_area
              Normalize mel filters to unit area

       -upperf
              Upper edge of filters

       -vad_startspeech
              Num of speech frames to trigger vad from silence to speech.

       -vad_threshold
              Threshold for decision between noise and silence frames. Log-ratio between signal level and noise level.

       -verbose
              Show input filenames

       -warp_params
              defining the warping function

       -wlen  Hamming window length

       Currently the only kind of features supported are MFCCs (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients).  There are numerous options which control the properties of the output features.  It  is  VERY  important
       that  you document the specific set of flags used to create any given set of feature files, since this information is NOT recorded in the files themselves, and any mismatch between the parameters used
       to extract features for recognition and those used to extract features for training will cause recognition to fail.
