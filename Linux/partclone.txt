DESCRIPTION
       partclone.dd is a part of Partclone project to clone unsupported file system with dd method. It will backup all block from partition. Partclone provide utilities to backup used blocks and design
       for higher compatibility of the file system by using existing library, e.g. e2fslibs is used to read the used block of ext2 partition.

       Partclone supported file system include btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs, reiser4, xfs and jfs for LINUX. Also support some non-linux operation system, ex: NTFS and FAT (for Windows), HFS
       plus(APPLE MAC OS), UFS2(FreeBSD), VMFS(VMWare Vsphere). All partclone utils could be run like partclone.xxx is very smiliar fsck or mkfs. For example, for backup/restore hfsplus, just run
       partclone.hfsp.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

       -s FILE, --source FILE
           Source FILE. The FILE could be a image file (made by partclone) or device depend on your action. Normally, backup source is device, restore source is image file.

           Receving data from pipe line is supported ONLY for restoring, just ignore -s option or use '-' means receive data from stdin.

       -o FILE, --output FILE
           Output FILE. The FILE could be a image file (partclone will generate) or device depend on your action. Normally, backup output to image file and restore output to device.

           Sending data to pipe line is also supported ONLY for back-up, just ignore -o option or use '-' means send data to stdout.

       -O FILE, --overwrite FILE
           Overwrite FILE, overwriting if exists.

       -W FILE, --restore_raw_file FILE
           create special raw file for loop device.

       -D, --domain
           Create GNU Ddrescue domain log file from source device. This is a human readable file in which + marks used block areas and ? marks free areas.

       --offset_domain=X
           Add X (in bytes) to all positions reported in the domain log file

       --restore_raw_file
           Creating special raw file for loop device.

       -L FILE, --logfile FILE
           put special path to record partclone log information. (default /var/log/partclone.log)

       -R, --rescue
           Continue after disk read errors.

       -C, --no_check
           Don't check device size and free space.

       -N, --ncurses
           Using Ncurses Text User Interface.

       -I, --ignore_fschk
           Ignore filesystem check.

       -i, --ignore_crc
           Ignore crc check error.

       -F, --force
           Force progress.

       -f sec, --UI-fresh sec
           put special second to different interval.

       -z size, --buffer_size size
           Read/write buffer size (default: 1048576)

       -q, --quiet
           Disable progress message.

       -dlevel, --debug level
           Set the debug level [1|2|3]

       -aX, --checksum-mode=X
           Checksum formula to use to add error detection

           where X:

           0: No checksum (no slowdown, smallest image)

           1: CRC32 (Fast to compute, basic detection)

       -kX, --blocks-per-checksum=X
           Write one checksum for every X blocks

       -w, --skip_write_error
           Continue restore while write errors

       --write-direct-io
           Writing data to TARGET partition without cache

       --read-direct-io
           Reading data from SOURCE partition without cache

       -B, --no_block_detail
           Show progress message without block detail

       --binary-prefix
           Show progress with bit size (default is MB, GB...)

       --prog-second
           Show progress in seconds (default is minute)

       -E, --offset=X
           Add offset X (bytes) to OUTPUT

       -T, --btfiles
           Restore block as file for ClonezillaBT.

       -t, --btfiles_torrent
           Restore block as file for ClonezillaBT but only generate torrent.

       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
           Show version of program.

FILES
       /var/log/partclone.log
           The log file of partclone.dd

EXAMPLES
            clone /dev/hda1 to hda1.dd.img and display debug information.
              partclone.dd -d -s /dev/hda1 -o hda1.dd.img

            restore /dev/hda1 from hda1.dd.img and display debug information.
              partclone.dd -d -s hda1.dd.img -o /dev/hda1

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

       partclone.dd provides some return codes, that can be used in scripts:
