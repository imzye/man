NAME
       DBIx::FullTextSearch - Indexing documents with MySQL as storage

SYNOPSIS
       DBIx::FullTextSearch uses a MySQL database backend to index files, web documents and database fields.  Supports must include, can include, and cannot include words and phrases.  Support for
       boolean (AND/OR) queries, stop words and stemming.

           use DBIx::FullTextSearch;
           use DBI;
           # connect to database (regular DBI)
           my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:mysql:database', 'user', 'passwd');

           # create a new stoplist
           my $sl = DBIx::FullTextSearch::StopList->create_default($dbh, 'sl_en', 'English');

           # create a new index with default english stoplist and english stemmer
           my $fts = DBIx::FullTextSearch->create($dbh, 'fts_web_1',
                       frontend => 'string', backend => 'blob',
                       stoplist => 'sl_en', stemmer => 'en-us');
           # or open existing one
           # my $fts = DBIx::FullTextSearch->open($dbh, 'fts_web_1');

           # index documents
           $fts->index_document('krtek', 'krtek leze pod zemi');
           $fts->index_document('jezek', 'Jezek ma ostre bodliny.');

           # search for matches
           my @docs = $fts->contains('foo');
           my @docs = $fts->econtains('+foo', '-Bar');
           my @docs = $fts->search('+foo -Bar');
           my @docs = $fts->search('foo AND (bar OR baz)');

DESCRIPTION
       DBIx::FullTextSearch is a flexible solution for indexing contents of documents.  It uses the MySQL database to store the information about words and documents and provides Perl interface for
       indexing new documents, making changes and searching for matches.  For DBIx::FullTextSearch, a document is nearly anything -- Perl scalar, file, Web document, database field.

       The basic style of interface is shown above. What you need is a MySQL database and a DBI with DBD::mysql. Then you create a DBIx::FullTextSearch index -- a set of tables that maintain all
       necessary information. Once created it can be accessed many times, either for updating the index (adding documents) or searching.

       DBIx::FullTextSearch uses one basic table to store parameters of the index. Second table is used to store the actual information about documents and words, and depending on the type of the index
       (specified during index creation) there may be more tables to store additional information (like conversion from external string names (eg. URL's) to internal numeric form). For a user, these
       internal thingies and internal behaviour of the index are not important. The important part is the API, the methods to index document and ask questions about words in documents. However, certain
       understanding of how it all works may be usefull when you are deciding if this module is for you and what type of index will best suit your needs.

   Frontends
       From the user, application point of view, the DBIx::FullTextSearch index stores documents that are named in a certain way, allows adding new documents, and provides methods to ask: "give me list
       of names of documents that contain this list of words". The DBIx::FullTextSearch index doesn't store the documents itself. Instead, it stores information about words in the documents in such a
       structured way that it makes easy and fast to look up what documents contain certain words and return names of the documents.

       DBIx::FullTextSearch provides a couple of predefined frontend classes that specify various types of documents (and the way they relate to their names).

       default
           By default, user specifies the integer number of the document and the content (body) of the document. The code would for example read

                   $fts->index_document(53, 'zastavujeme vyplaty vkladu');

           and DBIx::FullTextSearch will remember that the document 53 contains three words.  When looking for all documents containing word (string) vklad, a call

                   my @docs = $fts->contains('vklad*');

           would return numbers of all documents containing words starting with 'vklad', 53 among them.

           So  here  it's user's responsibility to maintain a relation between the document numbers and their content, to know that a document 53 is about vklady. Perhaps the documents are already stored
           somewhere and have unique numeric id.

           Note that the numeric id must be no larger than 2^"doc_id_bits".

       string
           Frontend string allows the user to specify the names of the documents as strings, instead of numbers. Still the user has to specify both the name of the document and the content:

                   $fts->index_document('foobar',
                                   'the quick brown fox jumped over lazy dog!');

           After that,

                   $fts->contains('dog')

           will return 'foobar' as one of the names of documents with word 'dog' in it.

       file
           To index files, use the frontend file. Here the content of the document is clearly the content of the file specified by the filename, so in a call to index_document, only the name is needed --
           the content of the file is read by the DBIx::FullTextSearch transparently:

                   $fts->index_document('/usr/doc/FAQ/Linux-FAQ');
                   my @files = $fts->contains('penguin');

       url Web document can be indexed by the frontend url. DBIx::FullTextSearch uses LWP to get the document and then parses it normally:

                   $fts->index_document('http://www.perl.com/');

           Note that the HTML tags themselves are indexed along with the text.

       table
           You can have a DBIx::FullTextSearch index that indexes char or blob fields  in  MySQL  table.  Since  MySQL  doesn't  support  triggers,  you  have  to  call  the  "index_document"  method  of
           DBIx::FullTextSearch any time something changes in the table. So the sequence probably will be

                   $dbh->do('insert into the_table (id, data, other_fields)
                           values (?, ?, ?)', {}, $name, $data, $date_or_something);
                   $fts->index_document($name);

           When  calling "contains", the id (name) of the record will be returned. If the id in the_table is numeric, it's directly used as the internal numeric id, otherwise a string's way of converting
           the id to numeric form is used.

           When creating this index, you'll have to pass it three additionial options, "table_name", "column_name", and "column_id_name".  You may use the optional column_process  option  to  pre-process
           data in the specified columns.

       The structure of DBIx::FullTextSearch is very flexible and adding new frontend (what will be indexed) is very easy.

   Backends
       While  frontend  specifies what is indexed and how the user sees the collection of documents, backend is about low level database way of actually storing the information in the tables. Three types
       are available:

       blob
           For each word, a blob holding list of all documents containing that word is stored in the table, with the count (number of occurencies) associated with each document number. That makes it  for
           very  compact  storage.  Since  the document names (for example URL) are internally converted to numbers, storing and fetching the data is fast. However, updating the information is very slow,
           since information concerning one document is spread across all table, without any direct database access.  Updating a document (or merely reindexing it) requires update of all blobs, which  is
           slow.

           The  list of documents is stored sorted by document name so that fetching an information about a document for one word is relatively easy, still a need to update (or at least scan) all records
           in the table makes this storage unsuitable for collections of documents that often change.

       column
           The column backend stores a word/document pair in database fields, indexing both, thus allowing both fast retrieval and updates -- it's easy to delete all records describing one  document  and
           insert new ones.  However, the database indexes that have to be maintained are large.

           Both  blob  and  column backends only store a count -- number of occurencies of the word in the document (and even this can be switched off, yielding just a yes/no information about the word's
           presence).  This allows questions like

                   all documents containing words 'voda' or 'Mattoni'
                           but not a word 'kyselka'

           but you cannot ask whether a document contains a phrase 'kyselka Mattoni' because such information is not maintained by these types of backends.

       phrase
           To allow phrase matching, a phrase backend is available. For each word and document number it stores a blob of lists of positions of the word in the document. A query

                   $fts->contains('kyselk* Mattoni');

           then only returns those documents (document names/numbers) where word kyselka (or kyselky, or so) is just before word Mattoni.

   Mixing frontends and backends
       Any frontend can be used with any backend in one DBIx::FullTextSearch index. You can index Web documents with "url" frontend and "phrase" backend to be able to find phrases in the  documents.  And
       you  can  use the default, number based document scheme with "blob" backend to use the disk space as efficiently as possible -- this is usefull for example for mailing-list archives, where we need
       to index huge number of documents that do not change at all.

       Finding optimal combination is very important and may require some analysis of the document collection and manipulation, as well as the speed  and  storage  requirements.  Benchmarking  on  actual
       target platform is very useful during the design phase.

METHODS
       The following methods are available on the user side as DBIx::FullTextSearch API.

       create
                   my $fts = DBIx::FullTextSearch->create($dbh, $index_name, %opts);

           The  class  method "create" creates index of given name (the name of the index is the name of its basic parameter table) and all necessary tables, returns an object -- newly created index. The
           options that may be specified after the index name define the frontend and backend types, storage parameters (how many bits for what values), etc. See below for  list  of  create  options  and
           discussion of their use.

       open
                   my $fts = DBIx::FullTextSearch->open($dbh, $index_name);

           Opens  and  returns  object,  accessing  specifies  DBIx::FullTextSearch index. Since all the index parameters and information are stored in the $index_name table (including names of all other
           needed tables), the database handler and the name of the parameter table are the only needed arguments.

       index_document
                   $fts->index_document(45, 'Sleva pri nakupu stribra.');
                   $fts->index_document('http://www.mozilla.org/');
                   $fts->index_document('http://www.mozilla.org/','This is the mozilla web site');

           For the "default" and "string" frontends, two arguments are expected -- the name (number or string) of the document and its content. For "file", "url", and "table"  frontends  the  content  is
           optional.  Any content that you pass will be appended to the content from the file, URL, or database table.

       delete_document
                   $fts->delete_document('http://www.mozilla.org/');

           Removes information about document from the index. Note that for "blob" backend this is very time consuming process.

       contains
                   my @docs = $fts->contains('sleva', 'strib*');

           Returns list of names (numbers or strings, depending on the frontend) of documents that contain some of specified words.

       econtains
                   my @docs = $fts->contains('foo', '+bar*', '-koo');

           Econtains stands for extended contains and allows words to be prefixed by plus or minus signs to specify that the word must or mustn't be present in the document for it to match.

       search
            my @docs = $fts->search(qq{+"this is a phrase" -koo +bar foo});
            my @docs = $fts->search("(foo OR baz) AND (bar OR caz)");

           This  is  a  wrapper  to  econtains  which  takes a user input string and parses it into can-include, must-include, and must-not-include words and phrases.  It also can handle boolean (AND/OR)
           queries.

       contains_hashref, econtains_hashref, search_hashref
           Similar to "contains", "econtains" and "search", only instead of list of document names, these methods return a hash reference to a hash where keys are the document names and  values  are  the
           number of occurencies of the words.

       drop
           Removes all tables associated with the index, including the base parameter table. Effectivelly destroying the index form the database.

            $fts->drop;

       empty
           Emptys the index so you can reindex the data.

            $fts->empty;

INDEX OPTIONS
       Here we list the options that may be passed to "create" method.  These allow to specify the style and storage parameters in great detail.

       backend
           The backend type, default "blob", possible values "blob", "column" and "phrase" (see above for explanation).

       frontend
           The  frontend  type.  The  "default"  frontend requires the user to specify numeric id of the document together with the content of the document, other possible values are "string", "file" and
           "url" (see above for more info).

       word_length
           Maximum length of words that may be indexed, default 30.

       data_table
           Name of the table where the actual data about word/document relation is stored. By default, the name of the index (of the base table) with _data suffix is used.

       name_length
           Any frontend that uses strings as names of documents needs to maintain a conversion table from these names to internal integer ids. This value specifies maximum length of  these  string  names
           (URLs, file names, ...).

       blob_direct_fetch
           Only  for "blob" backend. When looking for information about specific document in the list stored in the blob, the blob backend uses division of interval to find the correct place in the blob.
           When the interval gets equal or shorter that this value, all values are fetched from the database and the final search is done in Perl code sequentially.

       word_id_bits
           With "column" or "phase" backends, DBIx::FullTextSearch maintains a numeric id for each word to optimize the space requirements. The word_id_bits parameter specifies  the  number  of  bits  to
           reserve for this conversion and thus effectively limits number of distinct words that may be indexed. The default is 16 bits and possible values are 8, 16, 24 or 32 bits.

       word_id_table
           Name of the table that holds conversion from words to their numeric id (for "column" and "phrase" backends). By default is the name of the index with _words suffix.

       doc_id_bits
           A  number  of  bits  to hold a numeric id of the document (that is either provided by the user (with "default" frontend) or generated by the module to accomplish the conversion from the string
           name of the document). This value limits the maximum number of documents to hold. The default is 16 bits and possible values are 8, 16 and 32 bits for "blob" backend and 8, 16, 24 and 32  bits
           for "column" and "phrase" backends.

       doc_id_table
           Name of the table that holds conversion from string names of documents to their numeric id, by default the name of the index with _docid suffix.

       count_bits
           Number of bits reserved for storing number of occurencies of each word in the document. The default is 8 and possible values are the same as with doc_id_bits.

       position_bits
           With  "phrase backend", DBIx::FullTextSearch stores positions of each word of the documents. This value specifies how much space should be reserved for this purpose. The default is 32 bits and
           possible values are 8, 16 or 32 bits. This value limits the maximum number of words of each document that can be stored.

       index_splitter
           DBIx::FullTextSearch allows the user to provide any Perl code that will be used to split the content of the document to words when indexing documents.  The code will be evalled inside  of  the
           DBIx::FullTextSearch code. The default is

                   /(\w{2,$word_length})/g

           and  shows that the input is stored in the variable $data and the code may access any other variable available in the perl_and_index_data_* methods (see source), especially $word_length to get
           the maximum length of words and $backend to get the backend object.

           The default value also shows that by default, the minimum length of words indexed is 2.

       search_splitter
           This is similar to the "index_splitter" method, except that it is used in the "contains_hashref" method when searching for documents instead of when indexing documents.  The default is

                  /(\w{2,$word_length}\*?)/g

           Which, unlike the default "index_splitter", allows for the wild card character (*).

       filter
           The output words of splitter (and also any parameter of (e)contains* methods) are send to filter that may do further processing. Filter is again a Perl code, the default is

                   map { lc $_ }

           showing that the filter operates on input list and by default does conversion to lowercase (yielding case insensitive index).

       init_env
           Because user defined splitter or filter may depend on other things that it is reasonable to set before the actual procession of words, you can use yet another Perl hook to set things  up.  The
           default is no initialization hook.

       stoplist
           This is the name of a DBIx::FullTextSearch::StopList object that is used for stop words.

       stemmer
           If this option is set, then word stemming will be enabled in the indexing and searching.

           The value is the name of a Lingua::Stem recognized locale.  Currently, 'en', 'en-us' and 'en-uk' are the only recognized locales.  All locale identifiers are converted to lowercase.

       table_name
           For "table" frontend; this is the name of the table that will be indexed.

       column_name
           For  "table"  frontend; this is a reference to an array of columns in the "table_name" that contains the documents -- data to be indexed. It can also have a form table.column that will be used
           if the "table_name" option is not specified.

       column_id_name
           For "table" frontend; this is the name of the field in "table_name" that holds names (ids) of the records. If not specified, a field that has primary key on  it  is  used.  If  this  field  is
           numeric, it's values are directly used as identifiers, otherwise a conversion to numeric values is made.

NOTES
       To handle internationalization, it may help to use the following in your code (for example Spanish in Chile):

         use POSIX;
         my $loc = POSIX::setlocale( &POSIX::LC_ALL, "es_CL" );

       I haven't tested this, so I would be interested in hearing whether this works.

ERROR HANDLING
       The create and open methods return the DBIx::FullTextSearch object on success, upon failure they return undef and set error message in $DBIx::FullTextSearch::errstr variable.

       All  other  methods  return reasonable (documented above) value on success, failure is signalized by unreasonable (typically undef or null) return value; the error message may then be retrieved by
       "$fts->errstr" method call.

VERSION
       This documentation describes DBIx::FullTextSearch module version 0.73.

BUGS
       Error handling needs more polishing.

       We do not check if the stored values are larger that specified by the *_bits parameters.

       No CGI administration tool at the moment.

       No scoring algorithm implemented.

OTHER PRODUCTS and why I've written this module
       I'm aware of DBIx::TextIndex and DBIx::KwIndex modules and about UdmSearch utility, and about htdig and glimpse on the non-database side of the world.

       To me, using a database gives reasonable maintenance benefits. With products that use their own files to store the information (even if the storage algorithms are efficient and well  thought  of),
       you always struggle with permissions on files and directories for various users, with files that somebody accidently deleted or mungled, and making the index available remotely is not trivial.

       That's  why I've wanted a module that will use a database as a storage backend. With MySQL, you get remote access and access control for free, and on many web servers MySQL is part of the standard
       equipment. So using it for text indexes seemed natural.

       However, existing DBIx::TextIndex and UdmSearch are too narrow-aimed to me. The first only supports indexing of data that is stored in the database, but you may not always want or  need  to  store
       the documents in the database as well. The UdmSearch on the other hand is only for web documents, making it unsuitable for indexing mailing-list archives or local data.

       I  believe  that  DBIx::FullTextSearch  is  reasonably flexible and still very efficient. It doesn't enforce its own idea of what is good for you -- the number of options is big and you can always
       extend the module with your own backend of frontend if you feel that those provided are not sufficient. Or you can extend existing by adding one or two parameters that will add  new  features.  Of
       course, patches are always welcome.  DBIx::FullTextSearch is a tool that can be deployed in many projects. It's not a complete environment since different people have different needs. On the other
       hand, the methods that it provides make it easy to build a complete solution on top of this in very short course of time.
