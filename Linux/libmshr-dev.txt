NAME
       mshrable — Generate mesh from surface file

SYNOPSIS
       mshrable [-f FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       mshrable generates a mesh from a surface file.  It uses mshr, which is the mesh generation component of FEniCS. It generates simplicial DOLFIN meshes in 2D and 3D from geometries described by Con‐
       structive Solid Geometry (CSG) or from surface files, utilizing CGAL and Tetgen as mesh generation backends.

OPTIONS
       -o [--outfile] arg
                 Filename of generated Dolfin mesh.

       -r [--resolution] arg (=15)
                 Resolution of result mesh.

       -s [--stats]
                 Write some statistics of the mesh to stdout.

       --polyout arg
                 Write the polyhedron to .poly which Tetgen can read (and do not create a mesh).

       --polystats
                 Write statistics of polyhedron (and do not create a mesh).

       -b [--backend] arg (=cgal)
                 Use 3D mesh generation backend [tetgen|cgal].

       --degenerate_tolerance arg (=9.9999999999999998e-13)
                 Tolerance for considering a facet as degenerate. Set to 0 to not remove degenerate facets.

       --check-mesh
                 Check consistency of output mesh (most for debugging/testing.

       -v [--verbose]
                 Output more information about what is going on.

       -h [--help]
                 write help message.
