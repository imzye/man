NAME
       mode2 - Show kernel output available for LIRC drivers

SYNOPSIS
       mode2 --driver <driver> [--device <device>] [other options]

       mode2 --raw --device <device> [other options]

       mode2 --driver <driver>  --list-devices

DESCRIPTION
       The  original  purpose  of  this program has been to check operation of
       home-brew LIRC receiver hardware and to see  the  IR  waveform  of  the
       remote  controller without an expensive oscilloscope.  Over time, mode2
       has evolved to a generic tool to check what kind of output  the  kernel
       makes available for lirc.

       mode2  will  simply print pulse and space lengths to stdout for drivers
       supporting LIRC_MODE_MODE2. For drivers  supporting  LIRC_MODE_LIRCCODE
       such  as TV-cards and the irman driver writes the decoded, integer val‐
       ues.

       From version 0.9.4, mode2 can also list the  devices  available  for  a
       given  driver.  This requires enumeration support which is available in
       most but not all drivers.

       When given the correct driver  mode2  should  always  work.  Without  a
       driver,  the --raw option should always work for /dev/lirc* devices. At
       the time of writing, usb devices also works  in  most  cases.  However,
       since  it  is  tricky  to get the path to the usb device, such ones are
       normally best accessed using a driver.

       Not all drivers requires a device.

OPTIONS
       -d --device=device
              Read from given device.

       -H --driver=driver
              Use given driver.

       -m --mode
              Write pulse/space data as raw config files. Does not affect LIR‐
              CCODE drivers.

       -s --scope=time
              Enable  'scope  like  display  with  time  us per char. Does not
              affect lirccode drivers.

       -k --keep-root
              Don't drop root privileges after opening device. See RUNNING  AS
              ROOT.

       -l --list-devices
              List  all  available  devices for given driver. Requires support
              not present in all drivers.

       -g --gap=time
              Treat spaces longer than time as the gap. Time is  in  microsec‐
              onds.

       -r --raw
              Access  device  directly.  This is primarely intended to be used
              with kernel rc drivers i .e., when accessing /dev/lirc* devices.
              Using other devices might work, but is in general undefined.

       -A --driver-options=key:value[|key:value...]
              Set driver-specific option named key to given value.

       -U --plugindir=directory
              Load drivers from directory. See DRIVER LOADING.

       -O, --options-file <path>
              File  containing default values for all options. A relative path
              is interpreted from current directory. See [FILES] below.

       -D --loglevel=level
              Determine the amount of logging information. [level]  can  be  a
              symbolic  syslog  level:  'error','warning,  'info', 'notice' or
              'debug'. lirc also  defines  three  additional  levels  'trace',
              'trace1'  and  'trace2' which gives even more messages ('trace2'
              bringing the most). However,  in  the  log  these  messages  are
              marked  as  'debug'.   The  level  can also be an integer in the
              range 3 (almost no messages) to 10.

       -h --help
              Display usage summary.

       -v --version
              Display version.

RUNNING AS ROOT
       In many cases mode2 needs to run as root to access devices  not  avail‐
       able to regular users. On the other hand, running as root creates prob‐
       lems such as log files owned by root, security concerns etc.

       In order to cope with this, mode2  by  default  drops  root  privileges
       after opening the input device. This support is based on that root per‐
       missions are accquired using sudo(1) e. g., using

               $ sudo mode2 --raw /dev/lirc0

       If not using sudo, the same behaviour could be accomplished  using  the
       SUDO_USER environment variable e. g.,

               # SUDO_USER=$LOGNAME mode2 --raw /dev/lirc0

       The  --keep-root option will make mode2 to keep root privileges for the
       complete run.

EXAMPLES
       Invoked with a MODE2 type driver with mode2 prints space/mark timings:
            al@snorken $ ./mode2 --driver default --device /dev/lirc0
            Using driver default on device /dev/lirc0
            Trying device: /dev/lirc0
            Using device: /dev/lirc0
            pulse 2750
            space 800
            pulse 500
            space 350
            pulse 550
            space 350
            pulse 550
            ...

       Invoked with a LIRCCODE type driver mode2 prints decoded values:

            $ ./mode2 --driver atilibusb
            Using driver atilibusb on device /dev/lirc0
            Trying device: /dev/bus/usb/001/007
            Using device: /dev/bus/usb/001/007
            code: 0x14709b0000
            code: 0x14709b0000
            code: 0x14709b0000
            code: 0x14709b0000
            code: 0x14709b0000
            ...

       Invoked using mode2 --list-devices for the devinput driver with a
       single X10 RF usb device plugged in:
           $ ./mode2 --list-devices --driver devinput
           /dev/input/event12 [0bc7:0006] X10 WTI RF receiver vers:  1.10 serial: ?
           /dev/input/by-id/usb-X10_WTI_RF_receiver-event-if00 -> ../event12
           /dev/input/by-path/pci-0000:0b:00.0-usb-0:1:1.0-event -> ../event12

DRIVER LOADING
       Drivers are loaded dynamically. The search path used for this is deter‐
       mined by (falling priority):

       - The --plugindir option.

       - The    'plugindir'   entry   in    the   [lircd]   section   of   the
         lirc_options.conf file.

       - The environment variable LIRC_PLUGINDIR.

       - A hardcoded default (/usr/lib64/lirc/plugins).

ENVIRONMENT
       LIRC_LOGLEVEL
           Used as fallback when there is no --loglevel option present. Syntax
           is the same as for --loglevel, see OPTIONS.

FILES
       /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf
           The options file holding default values for command line options in
           the [mode2] section. For some values  including  debug,  plugindir,
           driver  and  device  mode2 falls back to the [lircd] section if not
           found in [mode2].

           The location of this file can be changed  using  the  -O/--options-
           file   command-line   option  or  using  the  environment  variable
           LIRC_OPTIONS_PATH.

       ~/.cache/mode2.log
           Debug log. Setting the XDG_CACHE_HOME  environment  variable  relo‐
           cates this file to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/mode2.log. The amount of logging
           respects the LIRC_LOGLEVEL environment variable, defaulting to  the
           debug value in lirc_options.conf.
