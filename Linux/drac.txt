NAME
       rpc.dracd - Dynamic Relay Authorization Control server

SYNOPSIS
       rpc.dracd [-i ] [ -e expire ] [ dbfile ]

AVAILABILITY
       ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca:/src

DESCRIPTION
       rpc.dracd  is the Dynamic Relay Authorization Control server.  It uses the Berkeley db package to maintain a relay authorization map for sendmail, by default
       /etc/drac/dracd.db.  POP and IMAP mail servers make an RPC call to add an entry to the authorization cache after they have authenticated each user.  The dae‐
       mon,  rpc.dracd,  adds  or  updates  entries in the cache, and periodically expires old entries.  Only trusted mail servers are permitted to communicate with
       rpc.dracd, as controlled by /etc/drac/dracd.allow.  If this file does not exist, all local IP addresses are permitted.

   Allow File Format
       The Allow File file consists of entries of the form:

              netmask netaddr

       where both netmask and netaddr must be dotted quads.

OPTIONS
       -i             Initialize the database on startup.

       -e expire      Set the expire time limit.  expire is the number of minutes the entries will remain in the database.  It defaults to 30 minutes.

       dbfile         Use a different database file name.

FILES
       /etc/drac/dracd.db            default database file
       /etc/drac/dracd.allow         default allow file.

TCP_WRAPPERS SUPPORT
       This rpc.dracd version is protected by the tcp_wrapper library. You have to give the clients access to rpc.dracd if they should be allowed to use it. To  al‐
       low connects from clients of the .bar.com domain you could use the following line in /etc/hosts.allow:

       dracd: .bar.com

       You have to use the daemon name dracd for the daemon name (even if the binary has a different name).

       For further information please have a look at the tcpd(8) and hosts_access(5) manual pages.
