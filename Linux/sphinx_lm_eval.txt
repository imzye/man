NAME
       sphinx_lm_eval - Evaluate perplexity of a transcription

SYNOPSIS
       sphinx_lm_eval [ options ]...

DESCRIPTION
       This program evaluates the perplexity of a text file according to a given language model.  The text file is assumed to be in transcript format, i.e. one utterance per line, delimited by <s> and </s>.

       -help  Shows the usage of the tool

       -lm    model file

       -lmctlfn
              file listing a set of language models

       -lmname
              of language model in -lmctlfn to use for all utterances

       -logbase
              Base in which all log-likelihoods calculated

       -lsn   file to evaluate

       -lw    Language model weight

       -mmap  Use memory-mapped I/O for reading binary LM files

       -probdef
              definition file for classes in LM

       -text  string to evaluate

       -uw    Unigram probability weight (interpolated with uniform distribution)

       -verbose
              Print details of perplexity calculation

       -wip   Word insertion probability
