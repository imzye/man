NAME
       "FCGI::Async::PSGI" - use "PSGI" applications with "FCGI::Async"

SYNOPSIS
        use FCGI::Async::PSGI;
        use IO::Async::Loop;

        my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

        my $fcgi = FCGI::Async::PSGI->new(
           port => 12345,
           app => sub {
              my $env = shift;

              return [
                 200,
                 [ "Content-Type" => "text/plain" ],
                 [ "Hello, world!" ],
              ];
           },
        );

        $loop->add( $fcgi );

        $loop->loop_forever;

DESCRIPTION
       This subclass of FCGI::Async allows a FastCGI responder to use a PSGI application to respond to requests. It acts as a gateway between the FastCGI connection from the webserver, and the "PSGI"
       application. Aside from the use of "PSGI" instead of the "on_request" callback, this class behaves similarly to "FCGI::Async".

PARAMETERS
       The following named parameters may be passed to "new" or "configure":

       app => CODE
               Reference to the actual "PSGI" application to use for responding to requests

PSGI ENVIRONMENT
       The following extra keys are supplied to the environment of the "PSGI" app:

       "fcgi.async"
               The "FCGI::Async::PSGI" object serving the request

       "fcgi.async.req"
               The FCGI::Async::Request object representing this particular request

       "io.async.loop"
               The  IO::Async::Loop  object  that the "FCGI::Async::PSGI" object is a member of. This is also provided as "fcgi.async.loop" for backward-compatibility with version 0.21, but at some point
               will be removed.
