NAME
       itksnap - semi-automatic segmentation of structures in 3D images

SYNOPSIS
       itksnap [options] [grey_image]

DESCRIPTION
       SNAP  provides  semi-automatic  segmentation  of structures in medical images (e.g.  magnetic resonance images of the brain) using active contour methods, as
       well as manual delineation and image navigation.  Noteworthy features are:

       * Linked cursor for seamless 3D navigation

       * Manual segmentation in three orthogonal planes at once

       * Support for many different 3D image formats, including NIfTI

       * Support for concurrent, linked viewing and segmentation of multiple images

       * Limited support for color images (e.g., diffusion tensor maps)

       * 3D cut-plane tool for fast post-processing of segmentation results

OPTIONS
       --grey, -g FILE
              Load greyscale image FILE (optional)

       --segmentation, -s FILE
              Load segmentation image FILE

       --labels, -l FILE
              Load label description file FILE

       --rgb FILE
              Load RGB image FILE (as overlay if combined with -g)
