   Example
          $ pipreqs /home/project/location
          Successfully saved requirements file in /home/project/location/requirements.txt

       Contents of requirements.txt

          wheel==0.23.0
          Yarg==0.1.9
          docopt==0.6.2

   Why not pip freeze?
       • pip freeze only saves the packages that are installed with pip install in your environment.

       • pip freeze saves all packages in the environment including those that you don't use in your current project. (if you don't have virtualenv)

       • and sometimes you just need to create requirements.txt for a new project without installing modules.

INSTALLATION
       At the command line:

          $ easy_install pipreqs

       Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed:

          $ mkvirtualenv pipreqs
          $ pip install pipreqs

USAGE
       To use pipreqs in a project:

          import pipreqs

CONTRIBUTING
       Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

       You can contribute in many ways:

   Types of Contributions
   Report Bugs
       Report bugs at https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs/issues.

       If you are reporting a bug, please include:

       • Your operating system name and version.

       • Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.

       • Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

   Fix Bugs
       Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

   Implement Features
       Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "feature" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

   Write Documentation
       pipreqs could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official pipreqs docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

   Submit Feedback
       The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs/issues.

       If you are proposing a feature:

       • Explain in detail how it would work.

       • Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

       • Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

   Get Started!
       Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up pipreqs for local development.

       1. Fork the pipreqs repo on GitHub.

       2. Clone your fork locally:

             $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/pipreqs.git

       3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

             $ mkvirtualenv pipreqs
             $ cd pipreqs/
             $ python setup.py develop

       4. Create a branch for local development:

             $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

          Now you can make your changes locally.

       5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:

             $ flake8 pipreqs tests
             $ python setup.py test
             $ tox

          To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

       6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

             $ git add .
             $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
             $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

       7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

   Pull Request Guidelines
       Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

       1. The pull request should include tests.

       2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.rst.

       3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and PyPy. Check https://travis-ci.org/bndr/pipreqs/pull_requests and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

   Tips
       To run a subset of tests:

          $ python -m unittest tests.test_pipreqs
