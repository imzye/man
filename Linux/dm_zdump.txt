DM_ZDUMP(1)           User Contributed Perl Documentation          DM_ZDUMP(1)

NAME
       dm_zdump - timezone dumper

SYNOPSIS
       This performs the same operation as the unix 'zdump' command, but using
       the Date::Manip module.

          dm_zdump [-v] [-c YEAR] [ZONE ZONE ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This displays the current time in each ZONE named on the command line
       unless the -v option is given.

       -h, --help
           Print online help.

       -v, --verbose
           This displays all critical dates (i.e. the times when a time change
           occurs due to the timezone description) for each of the timezones
           listed (or the local timezone if none are listed).

           Each critical date is printed as two lines of output: the last
           second before the change occurs, and the first second of the new
           time.

           By default, all critical dates from Jan 1, 0001 until the year 20
           years in the future are printed, but this can be changed with the
           -c option.

       -c, --cutoff YEAR
           This specifies the cutoff year. All critical dates up to the start
           of YEAR are given. The GMT time Jan 01, YEAR at 00:00:00 is the
           cutoff time.

KNOWN BUGS
       None known.
