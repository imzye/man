NAME
       Chemistry::File::SDF - MDL Structure Data File reader/writer

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::File::SDF;

           # Simple interface (all at once)
           # read all the molecules in the file
           my @mols = Chemistry::Mol->read('myfile.sdf');

           # assuming that the file includes a <PKA> data item...
           print $mols[0]->attr("sdf/data")->{PKA};

           # write a bunch of molecules to an SDF file
           Chemistry::Mol->write('myfile.sdf', mols => \@mols);

           # or write just one molecule
           $mol->write('myfile.sdf');

           # Low level interface (one at a time)
           # create reader
           my $reader = Chemistry::Mol->file('myfile.sdf');
           $reader->open('<');
           while (my $mol = $reader->read_mol($reader->fh)) {
               # do something with $mol
           }

DESCRIPTION
       MDL SDF (V2000) reader.

       This module automatically registers the 'sdf' format with Chemistry::Mol.

       The parser returns a list of Chemistry::Mol objects.  SDF data can be accessed by the $mol->attr method. Attribute names are stored as a hash ref at the "sdf/data" attribute, as shown in the
       synopsis. When a data item has a single line in the SDF file, the attribute is stored as a string; when there's more than one line, they are stored as an array reference. The rest of the
       information on the line that holds the field name is ignored.

       This module is part of the PerlMol project, <https://github.com/perlmol>.

CAVEATS
       Note that by storing the SDF data as a hash, there can be only one field with a given name. The SDF format description is not entirely clear in this regard.  Also note that SDF data field names
       are considered to be case-sensitive.
