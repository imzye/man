NAME
       dh-make-elpa - helper for creating Debian packages from ELPA packages

SYNOPSIS
       dh-make-elpa [--pkg-emacsen] [make]
       dh-make-elpa help

DESCRIPTION
       dh-make-elpa will try to create the files required to build a Debian source package from an unpacked GNU Emacs ELPA package.

       dh-make-elpa is an experimental script that performs a lot of guesswork.  You should throughly verify the contents of the debian/ directory before uploading

   TYPICAL USAGE
           # Set your name and email address (these will be used in debian/control) % export DEBFULLNAME="Jane Bloggs" % export DEBEMAIL=j.s.bloggs@example.com

           % git clone -o upstream https://foo.org/foo.git

           % cd foo

           % git reset --hard 1.0.0      # package latest stable release

           % git branch --unset-upstream # detaches master branch from upstream remote

           % dh-make-elpa --pkg-emacsen

           % git add debian && git commit -m "initial Debianisation"

           % git deborig

           % dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

   COMMANDS
       make
           Default command if no command is given. Creates debianisation from scratch.  Fails with an error if debian/ directory already exists.

       help
           Displays short usage information.

   OPTIONS
       --pkg-emacsen
           Sets "Maintainer", "Uploaders", "Vcs-Git" and "Vcs-Browser" fields in debian/control according to the Team's conventions.

           This option is useful when preparing a package for the Debian Emacs Addon Packaging Team <https://pkg-emacsen.alioth.debian.org>.

       --version
           Specify the ELPA package version.  Useful when upstream failed to include either a Package-Version: header or a -pkg.el file.

   TIPS
       Upstream remote
           The remote for upstream's git repository should be called 'upstream'.  You can use:

               % git clone -o upstream https://foo/bar
