NAME
       tomboy - A simple note-taking application for Gnome

SYNOPSIS
       tomboy [OPTION] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tomboy command.

       Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux and Unix. Simple and easy to use, but with potential to help you organize the ideas and information you deal with every day.

       Tomboy's usefulness lies in the ability to relate notes and ideas together, using a WikiWiki-like linking system.

       When run without any options, the Tomboy note menu appears in the Gnome Panel's notification tray area.  Selecting a note from the menu displays the note's spatial window.

       Changes  to  notes  are  saved automatically.  Links to URLs, files, and other notes are detected as you type.  Rich editing such as highlighting, bold, italics, undo/redo, and variable font sizes are
       supported.

       Global keybindings exist to allow fast access to Tomboy notes and dialogs.  These keybindings are set in GConf (see below) and may be activated from any application.
