NAME
       Version - daemon for ''lcd'' display devices

SYNOPSIS
       lcd4linux [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       LCD4Linux is a small program that grabs information from the kernel and some subsystems and displays it on an external liquid crystal display.

       If started without any options, it will try to read its configuration from /etc/lcd4linux.conf and daemonize. Please make sure your configuration file is owned by the user you run lcd4linux (typi‐
       cally root) and has permissions 600.

       -f     Alternate configuration file to read. Use this switch to make lcd4linux read another file than /etc/lcd4linux.conf.

       -F     Run in forground and don't daemonize. Useful for debugging.

       -c arg allows one to overwrite entries in the config-file from the command line. arg is 'key=value'

       -h     shows a really short usage of lcd4linux

       -i     starts lcd4linux in interactive mode. Can be used multiple times

       -l     Prints a list of supported displays

       -o     Specifies an output file (see http://ssl.bulix.org/projects/lcd4linux/ for details)

       -q     makes lcd4linux more quiet. Can be used multiple times

       -v     increases verbose level. Can be used multiple times
