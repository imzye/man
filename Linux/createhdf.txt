NAME
       createhdf — Create a blank IDE hard disk image in .hdf format

SYNOPSIS
       createhdf [ -c ] [ -s ] [-v version] cylinders heads sectors file

DESCRIPTION
       createhdf  creates a blank image of an IDE hard disk in .hdf format for
       use with Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulators.

OPTIONS
       -c     specifies that the .hdf image should  be  created  in  `compact'
              mode, where only the low byte of every word is stored in the im‐
              age. This is useful for saving space if the hard disk  image  is
              for  use  with  an interface which accesses only the low byte of
              every word.

       -s     specifies that the .hdf image should not be created as a  sparse
              file.  Normally,  createhdf will attempt to create the hard disk
              image as a `sparse file', where the operating system knows  that
              the  file consists mostly of zero bytes and fills those in with‐
              out using any space in the  file.  This  option  disables  this.
              (There's  nothing  `magic' about this: if data is written to the
              file, it will take up space just like any other data; it's  only
              empty space which is synthesised by the operating system).

       -v version
              specifies  the version of .hdf image to be created. Valid values
              are `1.0' for a version 1.0 file and `1.1'  for  a  version  1.1
              file. Defaults to creating version 1.1 files.

       -h, --help
              give brief usage help, listing available options.

       -V, --version
              output version information.

       cylinders
              specifies the number of cylinders in the image.

       heads  specifies the number of heads in the image.

       sectors
              specifies the number of sectors in the image.

       file   specifies the file to which the image should be written.

BUGS
       None known.
