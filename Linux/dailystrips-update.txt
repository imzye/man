NAME
       dailystrips-update - download updated dailystrips definitions

SYNOPSIS
       dailystrips-update [OPTIONS] DAYS

WARNING
       This  script  is  intended to use under the assumption that the development version of strips.def is the latest and best.  Unfortunately, at the time of this
       writing (August, 2007) upstream development seems to have ceased, so using this script will likely result in a more out-of-date strips definiton than is  in‐
       cluded in the distribution.

WARNING
       Due to the above, as of November 2009, dailystrips-update has been neutered to exit immediately on execution, and it is expected that it will be removed in a
       future version of this package.

DESCRIPTION
       The dailystrips-update script is provided to automatically retrieve updated strip definitions from a central server, eliminating the need to  manually  down‐
       load and install new versions of the entire program.

       It  is  recommened  that the dailystrips-update script be run before each execution of the main dailystrips program. The dailystrips-update script has provi‐
       sions to only check for updates if the current file has reached a certain age, which maximizes efficiency and should allow users to run the update script be‐
       fore each execution of dailystrips without overtaxing the update server.

USAGE
       Operation is straightforward. Simply execute dailystrips-update and the updated definitions will be saved to ~/.dailystrips-updates.def, which will automati‐
       cally be loaded by the main dailystrips program.
