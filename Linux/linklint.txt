VERSION
       2.3.5 August 13, 2001

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the Linklint program, which is an Open Source Perl program that checks local and remote HTML links.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the HTML format; see below.

OPTIONS
   Input File Selection
       Whether you are doing a local site check or an HTTP site check, you specify which directories (presumably containing HTML files) to check with one or more linksets. A linkset uses two wildcard
       characters @ and #.  Each linkset specifies one or more directories much like the standard * and ? wildcard characters are used to specify the characters in the * names of files in one directory.

       The @ character matches any string of characters (this kind of acts like "*"), and the # character (which is kind of like "?") matches any string of characters except "/" . The best way to
       understand how @ and # work is to look at a few examples:

                                 the entire site /@
                     the homepage only (default) /
                files in the root directory only /#
                    . . . and one directory down /#/#
                 files in the sub directory only /sub/#
            files in the sub directory and below /sub/@
                                  specific files /file1 /file2 ...
                         specific subdirectories /sub1/@ /sub2/@ ...

       If you specify more than one linkset, files matching any of the linksets will be checked. HTML files that don't match any of the linksets will be skipped. Linklint will see if they exist but won't
       check any of their links.

   Other File Selection Options
       -skip skipset
           Skips  HTML files that match skipset.  "Linklint" will make sure these files exist but won't add any of their links to the list of files to check.  Multiple skipsets are allowed, but each must
           be preceded with -skip on the command line. Skipsets use the same wildcard characters as linksets.

       -ignore ignoreset
           Ignores files matching ignoreset.  "Linklint" doesn't even check to see if these files exist.  Multiple ignoresets are allowed, but each must be preceded with  -ignore  on  the  command  line.
           Ignoresets use the same wildcard characters as linksets.

       -limit n
           Limits checking to n HTML files (default 500).  All HTML files after the first n are skipped.

   Local Site Checking
       If you are developing HTML pages on a computer that does not have an http server, or if you are developing a simple site that does not use Server Redirection or extensive CGI, you should use local
       site checking.

            linklint /@

       Checks  all HTML files in the current directory and below. Assumes that the current directory is the server root directory so links starting with "/" default to this directory. You must specify /@
       to check the entire site. See Which Files to Check for details.

            linklint -root dir /@

       Checks all HTML files in dir and below. This is useful if you want to check several sites on the same machine or if you don't want to run Linklint in your public HTML directory.

   Other Local Site Options
       -host hostname
           By default "Linklint" assumes all links on your site that start with "http://" are remote links to other sites.  If you have absolute links to your own site, give "Linklint" your hostname  and
           links starting with "http://hostname" will be treated as local files.  If you specify -host hostname:port, only http links to this hostname and port will be treated as local files.

       -case
           Makes  sure  that the filename (upper/lower) case used links inside of html tags matches the case used by the file system.  This is for Windows only and is very handy if you are porting a site
           to a Unix host.

       -orphan
           Checks all directories that contain files used on the site for unused (orphan) files.

       -index file
           Uses file as the default index file instead of the default list used by "Linklint". You can specify more than one file but each one must be preceded by  -index  on  the  command  line.   If  a
           default index file is not found, "Linklint" uses a listing of the entire directory. See the Default File section for details.

       -map /a=[/b]
           Substitutes leading /a with /b.  For server-side image maps or to simulate Server Redirection.

       -no_warn_index
           Turns of the "index file not found" warning.  Applies to local site checking only.

       -no_anchors
           Tells "Linklint" to ignore named anchors.  This could ease memory problems for people with large sites who are primarily interested in missing pages and not missing named anchors.  This option
           works for both HTTP and local site checks.

   HTTP Site Checking
       If  you  have  a  complicated site that uses lots of CGI or Server Redirection, you should use HTTP site checking. Even though an HTTP site check reads pages via your HTTP server, you will get the
       best performance if you do your checking on a machine that has a high speed connection to your server.

            linklint -http -host www.site.com /@

       The -http flag tells "Linklint" to check HTML files on the site www.site.com via a remote http connection. You must specify a -host whenever you do an HTTP site  check  (otherwise  Linklint  won't
       where to get your pages). You can specify /@ to check the entire site.  See Which Files to Check for details.

   HTTP Site Check Options
       -http
           This flag tells Linklint to perform an HTTP site check instead of a local site check.  All files (except server side image maps) will be read via the HTTP protocol from your web server.

       -host hostname:port
           If you include :port at the end of your hostname, Linklint uses this port for the HTTP site check.

       -password realm user:password
           Uses  user  and  password  as  authorization to enter password protected realm. Realms are named areas of a site that share a common set of usernames and passwords.  If passwords are needed to
           check your site, Linklint will tell you which realms need passwords in warning messages.  Enclose the realm in double quotes if it contains spaces.  If no password  is  given  for  a  specific
           realm, Linklint will try using the password for the ""DEFAULT"" realm if it was provided.

       -timeout t
           Times  out  after t seconds (default 15) when getting files via http.  Once data is received, an additional t seconds is allowed.  The timeout is disabled on Windows machines since the Windows
           port of Perl does not support the alarm() function.

       -delay d
           Delays d seconds between requests to the same host (default 0).  This is a friendly thing to do especially if you are checking many links on the same host.

       -local linkset
           Gets files that match linkset locally.  The default -local linkset is @.map (which matches any link ending in .map).  This allows Linklint to follow links through server-side image maps.   The
           default is ignored if you specify your own -local expressions.  You need to specify the -root directory for this option to work propery.

       -map /a=[/b]
           Substitutes leading /a with /b.  For server-side image maps or to simulate Server Redirection.

       -no_anchors
           Tells "Linklint" to ignore named anchors.

       -no_query_string
           Up  until  version 2.3.4, Linklint did not use query strings while doing HTTP site checks.  Query strings were removed before making HTTP requests.  As of 2.3.4 query strings in links are used
           in the requests.  Use the -no_query_string flag to get back the "old" behavior.

       -http_header Name:value
           Adds the HTTP header Name: value to all HTTP requests generated by Linklint.  You will need to use quotation marks to hide spaces in the header line from the command line interpreter. Linklint
           will automatically add a space after the first colon if there is not one there already.  Multiple (unique) header lines are allowed.

       -language zz
           This option is only useful if you are checking a site that uses content negotiation to present the same URL in different languages.

           Creates an HTTP Request header of the form Accept-Language: zz that is included as part of all HTTP requests generated by Linklint.  Multiple -language specifications are allowed.   This  will
           result  in  a  single  Accept-Language:  header  that  lists all of the languages you have specified in alphabetical order.  Some web sites can use this information to return pages to you in a
           specific language.

           If you need to get more complicated than this, use the more general purpose -http_header to create your own header.  There is a partial list  of  language  abbreviations  (taken  from  Debian)
           included as part of the Linklint documentation.

   Remote URL Checking
       A remote URL check is used to see if a remote URL exists (or has been recently modified). Links in the remote pages are not checked nor does Linklint look for named anchors in remote URLs.

       Remote  URL  checking  can be used to check all of the "remote" links on your site (those that link to pages on other sites) or it can check a list of URLs. There are several ways to specify which
       remote URLs to check:

            linklint http://somehost/file.html

       Checks to see if /file.html exists on somehost. Multiple URLs can be entered on the command line, in an @commandfile, or in an @@httpfile.  Every URL to be checked must begin with "http://".  This
       will disable site checking.

            linklint @@httpfile

       Checks  all the remote http URLs found in httpfile. Anything in the file starting with "http://" is considered to be a URL. If the file looks like a remoteX.txt file generated by Linklint then all
       failed URLs will be cross referenced.

            linklint @@ -doc linkdoc

       Assuming you have already done a site check and used -doc linkdoc to put all of your output files in the linkdoc directory, Linklint will check all the remote links that were found  on  your  site
       and cross reference all failed URLs without doing a site check. You can use the -netmod or -netset flags to enable the status-cache.

            linklint -net [site check options]

       The  -net  flag tells Linklint to check all remote links after doing either a local or HTTP site check site. If you are having memory problems, don't use the -net option, instead use one of the @@
       options above.

   Other Remote URL Options
       -timeout t
           Times out after t seconds (default 15) when getting files via http.  Once data is received, an additional t seconds is allowed.  The timeout is disabled on Windows machines since  the  Windows
           port of Perl does not support the alarm() function.

       -delay d
           Delays d seconds between requests to the same host (default 0).  This is a friendly thing to do especially if you are checking many links on the same host.

       -redirect
           Checks for <meta> redirects in the headers of remote  URLs that are html files.  If a redirect is found it is followed.  This feature is disabled if the status cache is used.

       -proxy hostname[:port]
           Sends  all  remote  HTTP  requests  through  the  proxy  server hostname and the optional port.  This allows you to check remote URLs or (new with version 2.3.1) your entire site from within a
           firewall that has an http proxy server.  Some error messages (relating to host errors) may not be available through a proxy server.

       -concise_url
           Turns off printing successful URLs to STDOUT during remote link checking.

   Status Cache Options
       The Status Cache is a very powerful feature. It allows you to keep track of recent changes in all of the remote (off-site) pages you link to. You can then use the Linklint output files to  quickly
       check changed pages to see if they still meet your needs.

       The flags below make use of the status cache file linklint.url (kept in your HOME or LINKLINT directory). This file keeps track of the modification dates of all the remote URLs that you check.

       -netmod
           Operates just like -net but makes use of the status cache.  Newly checked URLs will be entered in the cache.  Linklint will tell you which (previously cached) URLs have been modified since the
           last -netset.

       -netset
           Like -netmod but also resets the last modified status in the cache for all URLs that checked ok.  If you always use -netset, modified URLs will be reported just once.

       -retry
           Only  checks  URLs  that  have a host fail status in the cache.  Sometimes a URL fails because its host is temporarily down.  This flag enables you to recheck just those links.  An easy way to
           recheck all the cached URLs with host failures is "linklint @@ -retry".  Use "linklint @@linkdoc/remoteX.txt -retry" if you want failed URLs to be cross referenced.

       -flush
           Removes all URLs from the cache that are not currently being checked.  The -retry flag has no effect on which URLs are flushed.

       -checksum
           Ensures that every URL that has been modified is reported as such.  This flag can make the remote checking take longer.  Many of the pages that require a checksum are dynamically generated and
           will always be reported as modified.

       -cache directory
           Reads and writes the linklint.url cache file in this directory.  The default directory is set by your LINKLINT or HOME environment variables.

   Output Options
       No output files are generated by default, only progress and a brief summary of the results are printed to the screen. You can produce complete documentation (split up into  separate  files)  in  a
       -doc  directory  or  put  selected  output in a single -out file or by redirecting the standard output to a file. See the Output File Specification section for a detailed description of all output
       files.

   Multi File Output
       -doc linkdoc
           Sends all output to the linkdoc directory.  The output is divided into separate .txt and .html files.  Complete documentation is always produced regardless of the single file flags.

           The file index.txt contains an index to all the other files; index.html is an HTML version of the index.  The index files for remote URL checking are ur_lindex.txt and url_index.html.

       -textonly
           Prevents any HTML files from being created in the -doc directory.

       -htmlonly
           Erases redundant text files in the -doc directory after they have been used to create the HTML output files.  The files remote.txt and remoteX.txt are not erased since  they  can  be  used  by
           Linklint to recheck remote URLs.

       -docbase base
           Overrides  the default base expression used for directing a browser to the resources listed in the output HTML files.  The base is prepended to local links in the output HTML files.  This only
           affects the links in HTML output files, it has no effect on what is displayed in these files.  Ordinarily this flag would  only  be  used  during  a  local  site  check  to  set  the  base  to
           "http://host".

       -output_frames
           All  HTML  output  data  files  are linked to from index.html.  If you use this flag then the the data files will be opened up in a new frame (window) which can be handy in some cases since it
           always leaves the index.html file open in its own window.

       -output_index filename
           The output index files were previously named linklint.txt and linklint.html.  These have now been changed to index.txt and index.html.  You can use the -output_index option to change this name
           back to "linklint" or to something else.

       -url_doc_prefix url/
           By default, the output files associate with remote URL checking all start with "url".  You can change this with the -url_doc_prefix option.  If the url_doc_prefix contains a "/" character then
           the appropriate directory will be created (as a subdirectory of the -doc directory).

       -dont_output xxxx
           Don't create output files that contain "xxxx".  Can be repeated.  Example:

                   -dont_output "X$"

           will supress the output of all cross reference files.

   Single File Output
       -error
           Lists missing files and other errors.

       -out file
           Sends list output and summary information to file.

       -list
           Lists all found files, links, directories etc.

       -warn
           Lists all warnings.

       -xref
           Adds cross references to the lists.

       -forward
           Sorts lists by referring file.

   Debug and other Flags
       -db1
           Debugs command line input and linkset expressions.

       -db2
           Prints the name of every file that gets checked (not just HTML files).

       -db3
           Debugs HTML parser, prints out tags and resulting links.

       -db4
           Debugs socket connection (kind of).

       -db5
           Not used.
