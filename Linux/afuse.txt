AFUSE(1)                                                                                  General Commands Manual                                                                                  AFUSE(1)

NAME
       AFUSE - automounting file system implemented in user-space using FUSE

DESCRIPTION
       usage: afuse mountpoint [options]

   general options:
       -o opt,[opt...]
              mount options

       -h   --help
              print help

       -V   --version
              print FUSE version information

   AFUSE options:
       -o  mount_template=CMD
              template for CMD to execute to mount (*)

       -o  unmount_template=CMD
              template for CMD to execute to unmount (*) (**)

       (*) - When executed, %r and %m are expanded in templates to the root
              directory name for the new mount point, and the actual directory to mount onto respectively to mount onto. Both templates are REQUIRED.

       (**)- The unmount command must perform a lazy unmount operation. E.g. the
              -u -z options to fusermount, or -l for regular mount.

   FUSE options:
       -d   -o debug
              enable debug output (implies -f)

       -f     foreground operation

       -s     disable multi-threaded operation

       -o allow_other
              allow access to other users

       -o allow_root
              allow access to root

       -o nonempty
              allow mounts over non-empty file/dir

       -o default_permissions enable permission checking by kernel

       -o fsname=NAME
              set filesystem name

       -o large_read
              issue large read requests (2.4 only)

       -o max_read=N
              set maximum size of read requests

       -o hard_remove
              immediate removal (don't hide files)

       -o use_ino
              let filesystem set inode numbers

       -o readdir_ino
              try to fill in d_ino in readdir

       -o direct_io
              use direct I/O

       -o kernel_cache
              cache files in kernel

       -o umask=M
              set file permissions (octal)

       -o uid=N
              set file owner

       -o gid=N
              set file group

       -o entry_timeout=T
              cache timeout for names (1.0s)

       -o negative_timeout=T
              cache timeout for deleted names (0.0s)
