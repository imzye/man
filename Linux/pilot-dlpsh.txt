NAME
       pilot-dlpsh - An interactive Desktop Link Protocol (DLP) Shell for your Palm device.

SECTION
       pilot-link: Tools

SYNOPSIS
        pilot-dlpsh [-p|--port <port>] [-c|--command  STRING] [-i|--interactive] [--version]

OPTIONS
   pilot-dlpsh options
                               -c,
                               --command STRING

       Execute cmd and exit immediately.

                               -i, --interactive

       Enter interactive mode

   Conduit Options
                               -p,
                               --port <
                               port>

       Use device file <port> to communicate with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-dlpsh will look for the $PILOTPORT environment variable. If the port is missing and $PILOTPORT is not set,
       pilot-dlpsh will print the usage information.

                               --version

       Display the copyright information, version number, license details and build details and exit without connecting.

DESCRIPTION
        pilot-dlpsh allows the user to connect to a Palm handheld and execute arbitrary DLP commands.

       pilot-dlpsh can query many different types of information from your Palm device, such as username, memory capacity, set the time, as well as other useful functions.

       Once connected, the user may execute most of the built-in DLP commands. (See BUILT-IN COMMANDS  below for more detail on currently supported options).

       The connection to the Pilot is kept alive by sending a PadTickle packet to the Pilot after a small period of non-activity. (7 seconds by default)

BUILT-IN COMMANDS
       There are many options available while connected to your Palm handheld via pilot-dlpsh, including the following:

        user, u

       Print the currently set User information, including Username, UserID, PCid, and ViewerID. You may also set these values from this command as well. To set these values, simply pass the value to the op‐
       tion, such as 'user John Q. Public' for example.

        ls

       Used with -l and -r to provide long and RAM and ROM file lists, similar to (but slightly different from) the Unix 'ls' command. This does not yet allow you to narrow your listing to a certain range of
       files. It will simply list them all.

        df

       Display how much RAM and ROM is free on your device, again similar to the Unix 'df' command. This does not accept arguments at this time.

        ntp, time, dtp

       Set the time on the Palm from the currently-set desktop time. This does not work on OS version 3.3, due to a bug in PalmOS at that time.

        rm, del

       Remove a file and delete it entirely from the Palm device. This is an irrevokable process, and you cannot "undelete" a file, once it has been deleted with this command.

        quit, q, exit, bye

       Exit the DLP Protocol Shell

OPTIONS
       Passing commandline options to pilot-dlpsh will allow you to interact with it in unattended mode, for example: 'pilot-dlpsh -p usb: -c user' will connect and display the user information, just  as  if
       you had connected interactively and typed 'user' at the DLP shell prompt.

USAGE
       The program will connect to your Palm handheld and give the user an interactive prompt (a "shell") for executing commands across the DLP HotSync protocol.
