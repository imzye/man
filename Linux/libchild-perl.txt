HISTORY
       Most of this was part of Parallel::Runner intended for use in the Fennec project. Fennec is being broken into multiple parts, this is one such part.

FENNEC PROJECT
       This module is part of the Fennec project. See Fennec for more details.  Fennec is a project to develop an extendable and powerful testing framework.  Together the tools that make up the Fennec
       framework provide a potent testing environment.

       The tools provided by Fennec are also useful on their own. Sometimes a tool created for Fennec is useful outside the greater framework. Such tools are turned into their own projects. This is one
       such project.

       Fennec - The core framework
         The primary Fennec project that ties them all together.
