NAME
       cryptest - Test Driver for Crypto++, a C++ Class Library of Cryptographic Primitives

SYNOPSIS
       cryptest [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       cryptest takes the following options

       g      generate an RSA key

       h      display usage information

       r      encrypt and decrypt a string using RSA

       rs privatekeyfile messagefile signaturefile
              sign a file using RSA

       rv publickeyfile messagefile signaturefile
              verify a signature of a file using RSA

       m file calculate MD5, SHA, and RIPEMD-160 message digests

       t      encrypt and decrypt a string using DES-EDE in CBC mode

       e|d input output
              encrypt or decrypt a file

       ss <threshold> <number-of-shares> file
              secret share a file (shares will be named file.000, file.001, etc)

       sr file share1 share2 [....]
              reconstruct a secret-shared file (number of shares given must be equal to threshold)

       id <threshold> <number-of-shares> file
              information disperse a file (shares will be named file.000, file.001, etc)

       ir file share1 share2 [....]
              reconstruct an information-dispersed file (number of shares given must be equal to threshold)

       z <compression-level> input output
              gzip a file

       u input output
              gunzip a file

       ae input output
              encrypt a file with AES in CTR mode

       e64 input output
              base64 encode a file

       d64 input output
              base64 decode a file

       e16 input output
              hex encode a file

       d16 input output
              hex decode a file

       ft source-port destination-host destination-port
              forward a TCP connection

       fips   run the FIPS 140-2 sample application

       fips-rand
              generate 100000 random files using FIPS Approved X.917 RNG

       mt input
              run Maurer's randomness test on a file

       v      run validation tests

       V      display version number

       b [time for each benchmark in seconds] [frequency of CPU in gigahertz]
              run benchmarks

       tv filename
              run test vector file (available in TestVectors example subdirectory)
