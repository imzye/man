NAME
       wait-for-it - script to test and wait on the availability of a TCP host and port

SYNOPSIS
       wait-for-it host:port [-s] [-t timeout] [-- command args]

DESCRIPTION
       wait-forit is a pure bash script that will wait on the availability of a host and TCP port. It is useful for synchronizing the spin-up of interdependent services, such as linked docker containers.
       Since it is a pure bash script, it does not have any external dependencies.

       -p PORT, --port=PORT
              TCP port under test

       -s, --strict
              Only execute subcommand if the test succeeds

       -q, --quiet
              Don't output any status messages

       -t TIMEOUT, --timeout=TIMEOUT
              Timeout in seconds, zero for no timeout

       -- COMMAND ARGS
              Execute command with args after the test finishes
