NAME
       Array::IntSpan::IP - a Module for arrays using IP addresses as indices

SYNOPSIS
         use Array::IntSpan::IP;

         my $foo = Array::IntSpan::IP->new(['123.45.67.0',   '123.45.67.255', 'Network 1'],
                                           ['123.45.68.0',   '123.45.68.127', 'Network 2'],
                                           ['123.45.68.128', '123.45.68.255', 'Network 3']);

         print "The address 123.45.68.37 is on network ".$foo->lookup("\173\105\150\45").".\n";
         unless (defined($foo->lookup(((123*256+45)*256+65)*256+67))) {
           print "The address 123.45.65.67 is not on a known network.\n";
         }

         print "The address 123.45.68.177 is on network ".$foo->lookup("123.45.68.177").".\n";

         $foo->set_range('123.45.68.128', '123.45.68.255', 'Network 4');
         print "The address 123.45.68.177 is now on network ".$foo->lookup("123.45.68.177").".\n";

DESCRIPTION
       "Array::IntSpan::IP" brings the advantages of "Array::IntSpan" to IP address indices.  Anywhere you use an index in "Array::IntSpan", you can use an IP address in one of three forms in
       "Array::IntSpan::IP".  The three accepted forms are:

       Dotted decimal
           This is the standard human-readable format for IP addresses.  The conversion checks that the octets are in the range 0-255.  Example: '123.45.67.89'.

       Network string
           A four character string representing the octets in network order. Example: "\173\105\150\131".

       Integer
           A integer value representing the IP address. Example: "((123*256+45)*256+67)*256+89" or 2066563929.

       Note  that  the  algorithm  has no way of distinguishing between the integer values 1000 through 9999 and the network string format.  It will presume network string format in these instances.  For
       instance, the integer 1234 (representing the address '0.0.4.210') will be interpreted as "\61\62\63\64", or the IP address '49.50.51.52'.  This is unavoidable since Perl  does  not  strongly  type
       integers  and strings separately and there is no other information available to distinguish between the two in this situation.  I do not expect that this will be a problem in most situations. Most
       users will probably use dotted decimal or network string notations, and even if they do use the integer notation  the  likelihood  that  they  will  be  using  the  addresses  '0.0.3.232'  through
       '0.0.39.15' as indices is relatively low.

METHODS
   ip_as_int
       The class method "Array::IntSpan::IP::ip_as_int" takes as its one parameter the IP address in one of the three formats mentioned above and returns the integer notation.
