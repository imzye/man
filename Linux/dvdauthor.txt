NAME
       video_format - Proposal For A Video Format Preference Specification

DESCRIPTION
       A  number of different programs that create or work with video material need to know whether to generate their output in NTSC or PAL format. The ones that I’ve seen seem to have a hard-coded pref‐
       erence for one unless the user specifies the other. Overriding the default every time you want to use these programs gets tiresome.

       Therefore, there needs to be a way for the user to configure a single default that will apply to all these programs. This default should be settable on a per-user basis  and  a  systemwide  basis,
       with  the  per-user  setting  overriding  the  systemwide  one,  as  is  usual.  It makes sense to avoid dotfile clutter by following, at least to some extent, the XDG Base Directory Specification
       http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/.

       The preference setting shall consist of the single word “NTSC” or “PAL” (without quotes, might as well be case-insensitive). This can be specified in the following ways,  in  order  of  decreasing
       priority:

       • As the value of the environment variable VIDEO_FORMAT

       • As the contents of the user-specific file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/video_format, with $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaulting to $HOME/.config if not defined.

       • As  the contents of a systemwide file dir/video_format, where dir is taken in turn from the colon-separated items in the value of $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS until the file is found, or if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
         is not defined, then the single directory /etc.

       The application should use the first of these settings that it finds, searching in the specified order.

       Note: the XDG Base Dir spec says systemwide config files should go in /etc/xdg. I'm not sure why this is, since lots of other apps put systemwide config in other places in /etc. Particularly since
       the spec doesn’t similarly restrict shared read-only data to just one subdirectory of /usr/share.

DISCUSSION
       Can this spec apply to both standard-definition and high-definition video? For standard definition, there is a difference of frame size, being 720 by 480 for NTSC and 720 by 576 for PAL  (in  both
       cases, the aspect ratio of the displayed image is always 4:3). But this doesn’t seem to matter for high definition. For both standard-definition and high-definition, there is a difference of frame
       rates, based around 29.97 fps for NTSC and 25 fps for PAL.

       Note  also  that  if a config file earlier in the search contains an invalid setting, the search does not continue even if another, later config file might contain a valid setting. This allows the
       user to override a system default with “no default”. Is this important? I think it could be.

REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION
       The following Python code implements a routine called get_default_video_format that returns either one of the strings “NTSC” or “PAL” indicating the user/system-configured default  format  as  per
       the spec above, or None if the default is invalid or not configured.
