NAME
       tree-ppuzzle - Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood (parallelized version)

SYNOPSIS
       tree-ppuzzle

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tree-ppuzzle command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       TREE-PPUZZLE is the new name for the program previously known as PPUZZLE!

       tree-puzzle  is an interactive console program that implements a fast tree search algorithm, quartet puzzling, that allows analysis of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations of sup‐
       port to each internal branch. TREE-PPUZZLE also computes pairwise maximum likelihood distances as well as branch lengths for user specified trees. Branch lengths can also be calculated  under  the
       clock-assumption. In addition, TREE-PPUZZLE offers a novel method, likelihood mapping, to investigate the support of a hypothesized internal branch without computing an overall tree and to visual‐
       ize the phylogenetic content of a sequence alignment.

       This program is the paralelized version of tree-puzzle.
