NAME
       nihstro-assemble — Utility for assembling SHBIN files from human-readable 3DS shader source code

SYNOPSIS
       nihstro-assemble [-e | --entrypoint label_name] [-g | --geo_shader] [-h | --help] [-o | --output output_filename] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       nihstro-assemble  is  a standalone assembler for assembling 3DS shader binaries from human-readable source code (the syntax of which is called "nihcode"). It is perfectly suitable for homebrew de‐
       velopment. Shader source needs to follow the nihcode specification.

       Options:

       -e, --entrypoint label_name
               label name in the input source at which shader execution should start (defaults to "main")

       -g, --geo_shader
               Compile shader source as a geometry shader

       -h, --help
               Show command line usage

       -o, --output output_filename
               Filename of output shader binary
