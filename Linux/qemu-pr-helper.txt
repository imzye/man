NAME
       qemu-pr-helper - QEMU persistent reservation helper

SYNOPSIS
       qemu-pr-helper [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Implements the persistent reservation helper for QEMU.

       SCSI  persistent  reservations allow restricting access to block devices to specific initiators in a shared storage setup.  When implementing clustering of virtual machines, it is a common requirement
       for virtual machines to send persistent reservation SCSI commands.  However, the operating system restricts sending these commands to unprivileged programs because incorrect usage can disrupt  regular
       operation  of  the  storage  fabric.  QEMU's  SCSI  passthrough  devices  scsi-block  and  scsi-generic  support  passing guest persistent reservation requests to a privileged external helper program.
       qemu-pr-helper is that external helper; it creates a socket which QEMU can connect to to communicate with it.

       If you want to run VMs in a setup like this, this helper should be started as a system service, and you should read the QEMU manual section on "persistent reservation managers" to find out how to con‐
       figure QEMU to connect to the socket created by qemu-pr-helper.

       After connecting to the socket, qemu-pr-helper can optionally drop root privileges, except for those capabilities that are needed for its operation.

       qemu-pr-helper can also use the systemd socket activation protocol.  In this case, the systemd socket unit should specify a Unix stream socket, like this:

          [Socket]
          ListenStream=/var/run/qemu-pr-helper.sock

OPTIONS
       -d, --daemon
              run in the background (and create a PID file)

       -q, --quiet
              decrease verbosity

       -v, --verbose
              increase verbosity

       -f, --pidfile=PATH
              PID file when running as a daemon. By default the PID file is created in the system runtime state directory, for example /var/run/qemu-pr-helper.pid.

       -k, --socket=PATH
              path to the socket. By default the socket is created in the system runtime state directory, for example /var/run/qemu-pr-helper.sock.

       -T, --trace [[enable=]PATTERN][,events=FILE][,file=FILE]
              Specify tracing options.

              [enable=]PATTERN
                 Immediately enable events matching PATTERN (either event name or a globbing pattern).  This option is only available if QEMU has been compiled with the simple, log or ftrace tracing backend.
                 To specify multiple events or patterns, specify the -trace option multiple times.

                 Use -trace help to print a list of names of trace points.

              events=FILE
                 Immediately enable events listed in FILE.  The file must contain one event name (as listed in the trace-events-all file) per line; globbing patterns are accepted too.  This  option  is  only
                 available if QEMU has been compiled with the simple, log or ftrace tracing backend.

              file=FILE
                 Log output traces to FILE.  This option is only available if QEMU has been compiled with the simple tracing backend.

       -u, --user=USER
              user to drop privileges to

       -g, --group=GROUP
              group to drop privileges to

       -h, --help
              Display a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.
