NAME
       iwatch - realtime filesystem monitoring program using inotify

SYNOPSIS
       iwatch [-d] [-f <config file>] [-v] [-p <pid file>]
       iwatch [-c command] [-C charset] [-e event[,event[,..]]] [-h|--help] [-m <email address>]
              [-r] [-s <on|off>] [-t <filter string>] [-v] [--version] [-x exception]
              [-X <regex string as exception>] <target>

DESCRIPTION
       inotify (inode notify) is a Linux kernel subsystem that monitors events in filesystems and reports those events to applications in real time.

       inotify can be used to monitor individual files or directories. When a directory is monitored, inotify will return events for the directory itself, and for files inside this directory. The inotify
       support was added to Linux Kernel 2.6.13.

       Do not forget to consider directories as "special files". See more details at http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html

       iWatch is a Perl wrap to inotify to monitor changes in specific directories or files, sending alarms to the system administrator in real time. So, iWatch can do:

              •  Send notifications via email about changes.

              •  Take programmable actions immediately, as emit alerts via XMPP messengers, WhatsApp or execute a local program or script.

              •  Act as HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System) or an integrity checker, complementing the local firewall systems.

       iWatch  can  run  as  daemon,  as well a simple command. The daemon mode uses a XML configuration file, and put a list of directories and files (targets) to monitor. The command line mode will run
       without a configuration file. You just need to put the necessary information (target to watch, email, exception, recursivity, events to monitor and command to execute) in the command line. The op‐
       tions for both modes cannot be mixed together.

       In the XML configuration file, each target can have its own email contact point. This contact point will get an email notification for any changes in the monitored targets. You can monitor  a  di‐
       rectory  recursively,  and  you can also setup a list of exceptions where you do not want to monitor directory/file inside a monitored directory. It is also possible to disable email notification,
       and instead setup a command to be executed if an event occurs. Per default iWatch only monitor following events: close_write, create, delete, move, delete_self and move_self. But you  can  specify
       any possible events, like access, attrib, modify or all_events. See the EVENTS section for more details.

       A  good  example  of iWatch usage is to monitor the pages directory in webservers to notify, in real time, about defacements or file insertions. Other example is to synchronize configuration files
       between machines, when they are changed, as in DHCP servers acting in failover mode. You also use to synchronize files, via rsync when these files are changed.

OPTIONS
       Usage for daemon mode (background) of iWatch:

              -d     Execute the application as daemon. iWatch will run in foreground without this option.

              -f <config_file.xml>
                     Specify alternative configuration file. Default is /etc/iwatch/iwatch.xml.

              -p <pid_file>
                     Specify an alternate pid file. Default: /var/run/iwatch.pid.

              -v     Be verbose.

       Usage for command line mode (foreground) of iWatch:

              -c <command>
                     You can specify a command to be executed if an event occurs. For details about the available strings, take a look at STRINGS FOR COMMAND section.

              -C <charset>
                     Specify the charset (default is utf-8).

              -e <event[,event[,..]]>
                     Specify a list of events that you want to watch. For details about possible events, take a look at EVENTS section.

              -h, --help
                     Print help message.

              -m <email_address>
                     Contact point's email address. Without this option, iWatch will not send any email notification.

              -r     Recursivity when watching a directory.

              -s on|off
                     Enable or disable reports to the syslog (default is off/disabled).

              -t <filter>
                     Specify a filter string (regex) to compare with the filename or directory name. It will report events only if the file/directory name matches the filter string. It is useful  if  you
                     want  watch  a  file  like  /etc/passwd  or  /etc/shadow.  Instead watching this single file, just watch the /etc directory with filter="passwd|shadow", because if you watch only the
                     passwd/shadow file, the watcher will be deleted after one change of this file and you will not get another notification. This is caused by the  application  that  changes  passwd  or
                     shadow  (e.g. passwd or chfn), they do not change the files directly, but create a new file and move it to passwd or shadow file. So, this command will remove the inode and therefore
                     the watcher.

              -v     Verbose mode. This option will show the main current action.

              --version
                     Print the version number.

              -x <exception file or directory>
                     Specify the file or directory which should not be watched.

              -X <regex string as exception>
                     Similar to -x but specifying a regex string as exception.

STRINGS FOR COMMANDS
       When using the '-c <command>' option, these strings will be available:

       %c     Event cookie number.

       %e     Event name. (e.g.: IN_CLOSE_WRITE)

       %f     Full path of the filename that gets an event. (e.g.: /var/www/index.html)

       %F     The old filename in case moved_to event.

       %p     Program name, always "iWatch".

       %v     Version number. (e.g.: 0.2.2)

EVENTS
       Following are the possible events you can use with the '-e' option:

       access file/directory was accessed.

       attrib file/directory attributes changed.

       close  file/directory closed, regardless of read/write mode.

       close_nowrite
              file/directory closed, after being opened in read-only mode.

       close_write
              file/directory closed, after being opened in writable mode.

       create a file/directory was created within watched directory.

       delete a file/directory was deleted within watched directory.

       delete_self
              the watched file/directory was deleted.

       ignored
              file was ignored.

       isdir  event occurred against a directory.

       modify a file content was modified.

       move   a file/directory within watched directory was moved.

       moved_from
              a file was moved away from.

       moved_to
              a file was moved to.

       oneshot
              only send event once.

       open   a file/directory was opened.

       q_overflow
              event queued overflowed.

       unmount
              file system on which watched file exists was unmounted.

       default
              close_write, create, delete, move, delete_self and move_self.

       all_events
              all possible events.

COMMAND LINE USAGE EXAMPLES
       $ iwatch /tmp
              Monitor changes in /tmp directory, using default events, without recursivity.

       $ iwatch -r -e access,create -m root@example.com -x /etc/mail /etc
              Monitor only access and create events in /etc directory, recursively, with /etc/mail as exception, and send email notification to root@example.com if a listed event occurs.

       $ iwatch -r -c '(w; ps -aux)' | mail -s '%f was changed' root@localhost /bin
              Monitor /bin directory, recursively, and execute the commands 'w' and 'ps -aux', sending the results to root@localhost, using '<path_filename> was changed' as subject.  To  see  about  '%f'
              take a look at STRINGS FOR COMMANDS section.

       $ iwatch -r -X '.svn' ~/projects
              Monitor ~/projects directory, recursively, but exclude any .svn directories inside. This cannot be done with a normal '-x' option since '-x' can only exclude the defined path.

CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE
       The default configuration file is /etc/iwatch/iwatch.xml. See an example:

           <?xml version="1.0" ?>
           <!DOCTYPE config SYSTEM "/etc/iwatch/iwatch.dtd" >

           <config>
            <guard email="root@example.com" name="iWatch"/>
            <watchlist>
            <title>WEB server integrity monitoring</title>
            <contactpoint email="someone@example.com" name="Administrator"/>
               <path type="recursive" syslog="off" alert="off" exec="echo %p: %e %f | /usr/bin/sendxmpp -t foo@jabber-br.org">/var/www</path>
               <path type="exception">/var/www/counter</path>
            </watchlist>
           </config>

       The two first lines will define the XML version and the file that defines the pattern used by iWatch (the default is /etc/iwatch/iwatch.dtd). These lines needn't be changed.

       The  <config>  statement is used to mark the configuration start point. The last line of the configuration must be </config>. The 'guard email' line is used to specify the sender email and name to
       be used when sending notifications by email. In other words, this line defines the 'From:' email field. The <watchlist></watchlist> delimits a block of definitions about a watch  or  some  watches
       procedures.

       The  <config></config> place can have several <watchlist></watchlist> blocks. Inside these blocks (<watchlist></watchlist>), the <title></title> space is used to add a title that will identify the
       purpose of the block. This field is a visual text to indicate what the block does. The <title></title> does nothing. It is a tag for people reading the configuration file. The 'contactpoint'  line
       contains the destination email address (To:) and name when sending notifications by email.

       Each  <path></path>  line can monitor a file/directory and execute actions. The first path line showed will monitor recursively the directory /var/www. As no events was defined, iWatch will employ
       the default event (close_write, create, delete, move, delete_self and move_self events). If an event occurs, the syslog will not register it and a message reporting the program name (%p = iWatch),
       the event (%e) and the monitored file/directory name (%f) will be sent via XMPP protocol (sendxmpp external program) to foo@jabber-br.org. Note that alert="off" will  disable  any  sending  email.
       Other way to avoid an email message is drop the line "contactpoint". Another important point is that a second line is excluding the /var/www/counter file/directory from observation.

       The showed example uses the sendxmpp command. Other good possibility is to apply the yowsup-cli command to send WhatsApp messages.

       A new example. With configuration showed below, iWatch will work over three <watchlist> blocks.

           <?xml version="1.0" ?>
           <!DOCTYPE config SYSTEM "iwatch.dtd">

           <config>
            <guard email="admin@localhost" name="iWatch"></guard>
            <watchlist>
            <title>Public Website</title>
            <contactpoint email="webmaster@example.com" name="WebMaster"/>
               <path type="single">/var/www/localhost/htdocs</path>
               <path type="recursive">/var/www/localhost/htdocs/Photos</path>
            </watchlist>
            <watchlist>
            <title>Operating System</title>
            <contactpoint email="admin@localhost" name="Administrator"/>
               <path type="recursive">/etc/apache2</path>
               <path type="recursive">/etc/mail</path>
               <path type="exception">/etc/mail/statistics</path>
               <path type="single" filter="shadow|passwd">/etc</path>
            </watchlist>
            <watchlist>
            <title>Only a test</title>
            <contactpoint email="root@localhost" name="Administrator"/>
                <path type="single" alert="off" exec="(w;ps -aux) | mail -s %f root@localhost">/tmp/dir1</path>
                <path type="single" events="access,close" alert="off" exec="(w;ps -aux) | mail -s %f root@localhost">/tmp/dir2</path>
                <path type="single" events="default,access" alert="off" exec="(w;ps -aux) | mail -s '%f is accessed' root@localhost">/tmp/dir3</path>
                <path type="single" events="all_events">/tmp/dir4</path>
            </watchlist>
           </config>

       The first <watchlist> block monitors a directory and has special actions for a file but no execute a command for it.  The first path is a single (non recursive) directory /var/www/localhost/htdocs
       and any notification will be sent to the contact point webmaster@example.com. Note that have no events specified. So, the default events (close_write,

       create, delete, move, delete_self
              and  move_self) will be used. The second path will monitor, recursively, the directory /var/www/localhost/htdocs/Photos (also inside of the first directory). Default events will be notified
              via mail.

       The second block has four monitoring. All notification will be sent to admin@localhost. The main novelty over the first block is that a path uses a 'filter' instruction to  watch  /etc/shadow  and
       /etc/passwd at the same time. To understand better this situation, see the '-t' at OPTIONS section.

       The last block monitors default events in first line and several non default events in the following three lines.  In several lines the 'alert' is defined as 'off'. So, iWatch will not send emails
       using the builtin mail engine.  However, in three lines the external command 'mail' was used to send personalized emails.

LEARNING ABOUT EVENTS
       A tip to learn about events is watch the iWatch command executing with '-e all_events' option. The following example will monitor a 'ls /tmp' command.

           $ iwatch -e all_events /tmp
           [17/Jun/2014 11:22:59] IN_ISDIR,IN_OPEN /tmp
           [17/Jun/2014 11:22:59] IN_ISDIR,IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE /tmp

       Another example, that monitors the creating of a file inside /tmp:

           $ iwatch -e all_events /tmp
           [17/Jun/2014 11:29:43] IN_MODIFY /tmp/file.txt
           [17/Jun/2014 11:29:43] IN_OPEN /tmp/file.txt
           [17/Jun/2014 11:29:43] IN_MODIFY /tmp/file.txt
           [17/Jun/2014 11:29:43] IN_CLOSE_WRITE /tmp/file.txt
           [17/Jun/2014 11:29:43] * /tmp/file.txt is closed

       So, in the last example occurred modify, open and close_write actions.

RULES VALIDATION
       Since version 0.2.0 iWatch checks the validity of XML file if it has following entry in the first two lines:

           <?xml version="1.0" ?>
           <!DOCTYPE config SYSTEM "iwatch.dtd">

       The check will be made over a pattern described by /etc/iwatch/iwatch.dtd file. Without the showed two lines, iWatch will just give a warning that you have to use DTD file, and it continues to run
       as normal without XML validation. The iWatch's XML format is very simple and easy to understand, and it uses following DTD :

           <!ELEMENT config (guard,watchlist+)>
           <!ATTLIST config
              charset CDATA "utf-8"
           >
           <!ELEMENT guard (#PCDATA)>
           <!ATTLIST guard
              email  CDATA #REQUIRED
              name   CDATA #IMPLIED
           >
           <!ELEMENT watchlist (title,contactpoint,path+)>
           <!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
           <!ELEMENT contactpoint (#PCDATA)>
           <!ATTLIST contactpoint
              email  CDATA #REQUIRED
              name   CDATA #IMPLIED
           >
           <!ELEMENT path (#PCDATA)>
           <!ATTLIST path
              type   CDATA          #REQUIRED
              alert  (on|off) "off"
              events CDATA          #IMPLIED
              exec   CDATA          #IMPLIED
              filter CDATA          #IMPLIED
              syslog (on|off) "off"

CAVEATS
       On Debian systems, when running iwatch as a daemon via systemd, it will work under the root user. Be sure that your system is ready to make all things via root user. E.g. if you are using sendxmpp
       command, you will need a .sendxmpprc file under the /root/ directory.
