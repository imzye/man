NAME
       gtkpool - simple GTK+ pool billiard game

SYNOPSIS
       gtkpool

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the gtkpool command.  It was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       gtkpool brings that classic favourite of lounge lizards to a Linux box near you. It currently has a rather simple playing interface, but supports a really nifty customizable physics system.

OPTIONS
       There are no options. Just start the game under X by running gtkpool.
