ELVI(1sr)                                                                                                                                                                                             ELVI(1sr)

NAME
       elvi - surfraw(1) search tools

SYNOPSIS
       surfraw elviname [options] search words ...
       sr elviname [options] search words ...
       sr elviname -help
       sr -elvi

DESCRIPTION
       This is the man page for the elvi, a set of search tools that form part of surfraw(1).

       Surfraw  provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims google, altavista, dejanews, freshmeat, research index, slash‐
       dot and many others from the false‐prophet, pox‐infested heathen lands of html‐forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.

       To search using this elvis, do:

        sr elvisname [options] search terms.

       For example, to search google for information on Debian ports, using the "I'm feeling lucky" option:

        sr google -l debian ports

       To find out about options specific to this elvis, do:

        sr elvisname -local-help

       To find out about surfraw, see the man page for surfraw(1).  To see the full list of elvi, do:

        sr -elvi

   Adding the elvi to your path
       If you are a regular user of surfraw, you will probably get sick of typing sr or surfraw each time. You can regain the old behaviour of running the elvi  directly  by  adding  the  elvi  directory  (‐
       /usr/libexec/surfraw) to your path, either manually or using surfraw-update-path(1).

OPTIONS
       Use  sr elviname -local-help for elvi‐specific options.

       The following options work with all elvi.

       -help  Show summary of options (including elvi‐specific options).

       -local-help
              Show elvi‐specific options.

       -version
              Show version of program.

       -browser=EXECUTABLE
              Set browser (default: sensible-browser).

       -elvi  Display a list of other Surfraw mechanisms for conquering evil.

       -escape-url-args=yes|no
              Apply url escaping to arguments (default: yes)

       -q|-quote
              Bracket arguments with " characters (default: no) Note that putting quotes round arguments works now, so you can do, for example:

               sr google foo "bar baz" bam

              and the quoting is passed on to the search engine

EXAMPLES
        $ sr ask why is jeeves gay?
        $ surfraw google -results=100 RMS, GNU, which is sinner, which is sin?
        $ sr austlii -method=phrase dog like
        $ /usr/libexec/surfraw/rhyme -method=perfect Julian
