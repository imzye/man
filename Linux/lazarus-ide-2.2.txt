Lazarus(1)                                                                                Free Pascal RAD IDE                                                                               Lazarus(1)

NAME
       Lazarus - is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) for the Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) including an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

SYNOPSIS
       lazarus

DESCRIPTION
       This binary is an integrated development environment for the Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) which is an advanced Turbo Pascal and Delphi (7.0) compatible multi-target Pascal compiler.

       The IDE uses FPC(1)

       The current main supported targets are Linux, Mac OS X, Freebsd, and Windows.

       The other targets are either based on older versions of the compiler or are still in development.

       This manpage is meant for quick-reference only. Lazarus comes with an online manual, which is updated constantly, while this man page can be out of date.

Usage
       The  user interface of the IDE has been designed to be similar to Delphi.  It provides the user with a user friendly, but rather powerful editor, a form editor, an extensive on-line help sys‐
       tem and a debugger.

       A windowing system is the base of the user interface. The user will usually open a few text editor windows in which he will design his program, during which he can regularly check  and  debug
       through the use of hot keys. The high speed of the compiler ensures that programmers can do this often and therefore allows speedy development of code.

Help files
       No  help  files are provided by default. The user must download the Lazarus and Free Pascal documentation in HTML format and install it into the IDE using the Help->Configure Help.  Files can
       also be installed in this menu and can be useful for source code that ships with HTML files as documentation.
