NAME
       xevil - An evil game

SYNOPSIS
       xevil [argument-list]

DESCRIPTION
       XEvil is a 3rd person, side-view, fast-action, kill-them-before-they-kill-you game. Fight against either computer-controlled enemies, or another player.

       You  sinned in life. And now you must pay. Satan pits the recently deceased against each other to fight for rank in Hell. Your skill determines your fate for all eternity. This contest is known as
       XEvil.

Security and Stability
       xevil is not stable. You can play for hours, but it may occasionally crash. Networking is especially quircky. Upstream is no longer maintaining xevil. Email  sent  to  satan@xevil.com  goes  unan‐
       swered. Xevil likely has security holes. I recommend being wary in regards to playing xevil with strangers. Patches for the Debian version are welcome.

MORE INFO
       Type  xevil  -help  at  the  command  line  for  a  list  of  common options. For more options and complete instructions, visit http://www.xevil.com/docs/instructions.html, or, on a debian system,
