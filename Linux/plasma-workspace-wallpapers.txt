NAME
       PlopFolio - Personal dashboard for GNUstep

SYNOPSIS
       PlopFolio

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the PlopFolio command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not
       have a manual page.

       PlopFolio is a free replacement of Serence's proprietary KlipFolio application.  PlopFolio supports Klips available from KlipFarm. PlopFolio is developed us‐
       ing the Objective-C language and works well with GNUstep (on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and more) and Cocoa on Mac OS X.

       Klip files can be downloaded from http://klipfarm.com.
