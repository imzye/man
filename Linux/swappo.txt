NAME
       swappo - swap msgid and msgstr fields in a PO file

SYNOPSIS
       swappo [filename.po]

DESCRIPTION
       swappo reads the given PO-file and swaps the msgid and msgstr fields for every message. The result is a new PO-file that translates in the opposite direction. For example, if PO-file translates from
       English to French, the new PO-file will translate from French to English.

       The new PO-file will be written to standard output. The old PO-file will remain untouched.

       This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit
