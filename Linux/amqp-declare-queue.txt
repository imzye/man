AMQP-DECLARE-QUEUE(1)                                                                          RabbitMQ C Client                                                                          AMQP-DECLARE-QUEUE(1)

NAME
       amqp-declare-queue - Declare (create or assert the existence of) a queue on an AMQP server

SYNOPSIS
       amqp-declare-queue [OPTION...] [-d] {-q queue name}

DESCRIPTION
       amqp-declare-queue attempts to create a queue on an AMQP server, and exits. If the empty-string is supplied as the queue name, a fresh queue name is generated by the server and returned. In all cases,
       if a queue was successfully declared, the (raw binary) name of the queue is printed to standard output, followed by a newline.

OPTIONS
       -q, --queue=queue name
           The name of the queue to declare. If the empty string is supplied, a fresh queue name is generated by the server.

       -d, --durable
           Causes the queue to be declared with the "durable" flag set. Durable queues survive server restarts. By default, queues are declared in "transient" mode.

EXIT STATUS
       If the queue was successfully declared, the exit status is 0. If an error occurs, the exit status is 1.

EXAMPLES
       Declare the durable queue “myqueue”, and display the name of the queue on standard output:

               $ amqp-declare-queue -d -q myqueue
               myqueue

       Declare a fresh, server-named transient queue, and display the name of the queue on standard output (use amqp-delete-queue(1) to delete it from the server once you're done):

               $ amqp-declare-queue -q ""
               amq.gen-BW/wvociA8g6LFpb1PlqOA==
