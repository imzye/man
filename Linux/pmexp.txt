NAME
       pmexp - show a module's exports

DESCRIPTION
       Given a module name, this program identifies which symbols are
       automatically exported (in that package's @EXPORT), those which are
       optionally exported (in that package's @EXPORT_OK), and also lists out
       the import groups (in that package's %EXPORT_TAGS hash).

EXAMPLES
           $ pmexp Text::ParseWords
           Text::ParseWords automatically exports shellwords, quotewords, nested_quotewords, and parse_line
           Text::ParseWords optionally exports old_shellwords

           $ pmexp Text::Wrap
           Text::Wrap automatically exports wrap and fill
           Text::Wrap optionally exports $columns, $break, and $huge

           $ pmexp Fcntl
           Fcntl automatically exports FD_CLOEXEC, F_DUPFD, F_EXLCK, F_GETFD, F_GETFL, F_GETLK, F_GETLK64, F_GETOWN, F_POSIX, F_RDLCK, F_SETFD, F_SETFL, F_SETLK, F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW, F_SETLKW64, F_SETOWN, F_SHLCK, F_UNLCK, F_WRLCK, O_ACCMODE, O_APPEND, O_ASYNC, O_BINARY, O_CREAT, O_DEFER, O_DSYNC, O_EXCL, O_EXLOCK, O_LARGEFILE, O_NDELAY, O_NOCTTY, O_NONBLOCK, O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, O_RSYNC, O_SHLOCK, O_SYNC, O_TEXT, O_TRUNC, and O_WRONLY

           Fcntl optionally exports FAPPEND, FASYNC, FCREAT, FDEFER, FEXCL, FNDELAY, FNONBLOCK, FSYNC, FTRUNC, LOCK_EX, LOCK_NB, LOCK_SH, and LOCK_UN
           Fcntl export tag 'Fcompat' includes FAPPEND, FASYNC, FCREAT, FDEFER, FEXCL, FNDELAY, FNONBLOCK, FSYNC, and FTRUNC
           Fcntl export tag 'flock' includes LOCK_SH, LOCK_EX, LOCK_NB, and LOCK_UN

BUGS
       The output formatting should be nicer, perhaps using "format" and
       "write".
