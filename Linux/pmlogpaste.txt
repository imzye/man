PMLOGPASTE(1)               General Commands Manual              PMLOGPASTE(1)

NAME
       pmlogpaste - paste text into a metric in a PCP archive

SYNOPSIS
       pmlogpaste  [-?]   [-f  file]  [-h hostname] [-l label] [-m metric] [-o
       outfile] [-t timezone]

DESCRIPTION
       pmlogpaste takes input text from a file or the command line, and writes
       it as a metric value in a new PCP archive.  This metric value is times‐
       tamped with the current time, and is stored as a string type metric.

       The main purpose of this tool is to take captured output  and  preserve
       this  in  a  PCP  archive.   This  allows, for example, the output of a
       benchmark run to be stored along with performance metrics captured dur‐
       ing  that  run,  in a single archive.  Archives can be merged using the
       pmlogextract(1) utility.

       pmlogpaste uses the LOGIMPORT(3) library interfaces  internally,  which
       support  the  creation of archives from external sources of performance
       data.

OPTIONS
       The available command line options are:

       -f file, --file=file
            File with input text to be archived, or ``-'' for standard input.

       -h hostname, --hostname=hostname
            Source host name for the archive.  The default value is the  local
            host name, or ``localhost'' if that cannot be obtained.

       -l label, --label=label
            Add  context  labels to the generated archive.  This option can be
            presented multiple times to produce multiple  labels  in  the  ar‐
            chive.  The label should be in the form name:value.

       -m metric, --metric=metric
            Metric   name  for  the  archive.   The  default  metric  name  is
            paste.value.

       -o outfile, --outfile=outfile
            Archive output file.  The default archive name is paste.

       -t timezone, --timezone=timezone
            Source timezone for the archive archive.  The default value is the
            local timezone.

       -?, --help
            Display usage message and exit.

PCP ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the
       file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installation,  the  file
       /etc/pcp.conf  contains  the  local  values  for  these variables.  The
       $PCP_CONF variable may be used to specify an alternative  configuration
       file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
