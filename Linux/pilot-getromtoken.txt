NAME
       pilot-getromtoken - Reads a ROM token from a Palm Handheld device.

SECTION
       pilot-link: Tools

SYNOPSIS
        pilot-getromtoken [-p|--port <port>] [--version] [-?|--help] [--usage] [-q|--quiet] [-t|--token  token] [-s|--sysinfo] [--ram] [--rom] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Tokens you may currently extract are:

       adcc: Entropy for internal A->D convertor calibration

       irda: Present only on memory card w/IrDA support

       snum: Device serial number (from Memory Card Flash ID)

        pilot-getromtoken is used to fetch the ROM from your Palm handheld for use in debugging Palm applications through the use of POSE, the Palm OS Emulator application.

       Note,  because  pilot-getrom  uses  the low-level RPC protocol to fetch the ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do not use this protocol, you currently cannot fetch an OS5 ROM image using this utility.
       This will be updated in a future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM images, using the debugger protocol.

OPTIONS
   pilot-getromtoken options
                               -t,
                               --token token

       A ROM token to read (i.e. snum)

                               -s, --sysinfo

       Print SysInfo

                               --ram

       Read RAM

                               --rom

       Read ROM

                               <filename>

       Write the ROM image to the file named by <filename>. If this is omitted, the filename will be written out as the rom version name as follows:  'pilot-$VERSION.rom'  ,where an OS  3.5  image  would  be
       written as the filename of 'pilot-3.5.0.rom'.

   Conduit Options
                               -p, --port
                               <port>

       Use  device file <port> to communicate with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-getrom will look for the $PILOTPORT environment variable. If neither are found or supplied,  pilot-getrom
       will print the usage information.

                               -q,
                               --quiet

       Suppress 'Hit HotSync button' message

                               -v, --version

       Display version of pilot-getrom and exit without connecting.

   Help Options
                               -h, --help

       Display the help synopsis for pilot-getrom and exit without connecting.

                               --usage

       Display a brief usage message and exit without connecting.

USAGE
       Connect to a target Palm handheld and fetch the ROM for use in debugging Palm applications through the use of POSE, the Palm OS Emulator or with the CoPilot application (deprecated).

BUGS
   Known Bugs
        pilot-getrom  does  not  work with OS5 devices as yet, due to changes in the architecture and design of the Palm HotSync protocol and file type changes from m68k to ARM. Other than that, pilot-getrom
       has no known bugs at this time.

   Reporting Bugs
       We have an online bug tracker. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed. Reporting bugs via email, while  easy,  is
       not very useful in terms of accountability. Please point your browser to http://bugs.pilot-link.org: http://bugs.pilot-link.org and report your bugs and issues there.
