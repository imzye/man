DESCRIPTION
   XpmWriteFileFromImage
       The  XpmWriteFileFromImage() function writes an image and its possible shapeimage out to a file in the XPM format.  If the file cannot be opened, it returns XpmOpenFailed.  If insufficient working
       storage is allocated, it returns XpmNoMemory.  If no error occurs then it returns XpmSuccess.  If the passed XpmAttributes structure pointer is not NULL, XpmWriteFileFromImage() looks for the fol‐
       lowing attributes: XpmColormap, XpmHotspot, XpmCharsPerPixel, XpmRgbFilename, and XpmExtensions.  As a backward compatibility feature, XpmWriteFileFromImage() also looks for the  XpmInfos  attrib‐
       utes.   If  the filename contains an extension such as “.xpm”, in order to get a valid C variable name, the dot character is replaced by an underscore ’_’ when writing out.  As a backward compati‐
       bility feature, if the XpmInfos attributes are defined it writes out possible stored information such as comments, color defaults and symbol.  Finally, if the XpmRgbFilenameattribute  is  defined,
       XpmWriteFileFromImage() searches for color names in this file and if found writes them out instead of the rgb values.

       In  addition  on systems which support such features if the given file name ends by ’.Z’ or ’.gz’ it is assumed to be a compressed file. Then, XpmWriteFileFromImage() writes to a piped compress or
       gzip process.  And if instead of a file name, NULL is passed to XpmWriteFileFromImage(), it writes to the standard output.

   XpmWriteFileFromPixmap
       To write out a Pixmap to an XPM file, use XpmWriteFileFromPixmap().

       If the passed XpmAttributes structure pointer is not NULL, XpmWriteFileFromPixmap() looks for the following attributes: XpmSize.  If they are not defined it  performs  an  XGetGeometry  operation.
       Then it uses XGetImage to get from the given pixmaps the related X images which are passed to XpmWriteFileFromImage().  Finally XpmWriteFileFromPixmap() destroys the created images using XDestroy‐
       Image.  The XpmWriteFileFromPixmap() function returns the same errors as XpmWriteFileFromImage().

   XpmWriteFileFromData
       XpmWriteFileFromData() writes an XPM data array to an XPM file.

       XpmWriteFileToData() returns XpmOpenFailed if it cannot open the file, XpmFileInvalid if this is not a valid XPM data, and XpmSuccess otherwise.

   XpmWriteFileFromXpmImage
       To write out an XpmImage to an XPM file, use XpmWriteFileFromXpmImage().  The XpmWriteFileFromXpmImage() function writes an image out to a file in the XPM format.  If the file cannot be opened, it
       returns  XpmOpenFailed.  If insufficient working storage is allocated, it returns XpmNoMemory.  If no error occurs then it returns XpmSuccess.  If the passed XpmInfo structure pointer is not NULL,
       XpmWriteFileFromXpmImage() looks for the following attributes: XpmComments, XpmExtensions, and XpmHotspot, and writes the related information out as well.  In addition  on  systems  which  support
       such  features if the given file name ends by ’.Z’ or ’.gz’ it is assumed to be a compressed file. Then, XpmWriteFileFromXpmImage() writes to a piped compress or gzip process.  And if instead of a
       file name, NULL is passed to XpmWriteFileFromXpmImage(), it writes to the standard output.

   XpmWriteFileFromBuffer
       XpmWriteFileFromBuffer() writes a XPM buffer to a file.  XpmWriteFileFromBuffer() returns XpmOpenFailed if it cannot open the file, and XpmSuccess otherwise.

       As a convenience, the XpmReadFileToBuffer() and XpmWriteFileFromBuffer() functions are provided to copy a file to a buffer and to write a file from a buffer.  Thus for instance one may  decide  to
       use XpmCreateBufferFromPixmap(), XpmWriteFileFromBuffer(), and XpmFree() instead of XpmWriteFileFromPixmap().  On some systems this may lead to a performance improvement, since the parsing will be
       performed in memory, but it uses more memory.
