NAME
       Tk::FireButton - Button that keeps invoking callback when pressed

SYNOPSIS
           use Tk::FireButton;

           $fire = $parent->FireButton( ... );

           # May/should change:
           $w->Whatever(... -bitmap => $Tk::FireButton::INCBITMAP, ...);
           $w->Whatever(... -bitmap => $Tk::FireButton::DECBITMAP, ...);
           $w->Whatever(... -bitmap => $Tk::FireButton::HORIZINCBITMAP, ...);
           $w->Whatever(... -bitmap => $Tk::FireButton::HORIZDECBITMAP, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       FireButton is-a Button widget (see Tk::Button) that keeps invoking the callback bound to it as long as the <FireButton> is pressed.

       Four suitable bitmaps are predefined in this package: $INCBITMAP and $DECBITMAP for vertical increment and decrement buttons, and $HORIZINCBITMAP and $HORIZDECBITMAP for horizontal increment and
       decrement buttons. See below for methods accessing these bitmaps.

SUPER-CLASS
       The FireButton widget-class is derived from the Button widget-class and inherits all the methods and options its super-class (see Tk::Button).

STANDARD OPTIONS
       FireButton supports all the standard options of a Button widget.  See Tk::options for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:             repeatDelay
       Class:            RepeatDelay
       Switch:           -repeatdelay
       Fallback:      300 (milliseconds)
           Specifies the amount of time before the callback is first invoked after the Button-1 is pressed over the widget.

       Name:             repeatInterval
       Class:            RepeatInterval
       Switch:           -repeatinterval
       Fallback:      100 (milliseconds)
           Specifies the amount of time between invocations of the callback bound to the widget with the "command" option.

CHANDED OPTION FALLBACK VALUES
       The fallback values of the following options as different from the Button widget:

               -padx               => 0,
               -pady               => 0,

METHODS
       Same as for Button widget.

       Additionally, there are four methods returning the names of the standard increment and decrement bitmaps: INCBITMAP, HORIZINCBITMAP, DECBITMAP, and HORIZDECBITMAP.

       Subclasses of FireButton may override these methods to supply different increment and decrement bitmaps.

ADVERTISED WIDGETS
       None.
