PRIMES(6)                      BSD Games Manual                      PRIMES(6)

NAME
     primes — generate primes

SYNOPSIS
     primes [start [stop]]

DESCRIPTION
     The primes utility prints primes in ascending order, one per line, start‐
     ing at or above start and continuing until, but not including stop.  The
     start value must be at least 0 and not greater than stop.  The stop value
     must not be greater than 4294967295.  The default value of stop is
     4294967295.

     When the primes utility is invoked with no arguments, start is read from
     standard input.  stop is taken to be 4294967295.  The start value may be
     preceded by a single ‘+’.  The start value is terminated by a non-digit
     character (such as a newline).  The input line must not be longer than
     255 characters.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Out of range or invalid input results in an appropriate error message be‐
     ing written to standard error.

BUGS
     primes won't get you a world record.
