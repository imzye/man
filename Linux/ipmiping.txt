NAME
       ipmiping - send IPMI Get Authentication Capabilitiy request to network hosts

SYNOPSIS
       ipmiping [OPTION...] destination

DESCRIPTION
       ipmiping  uses the IPMI Get Channel Authentication Capabilities request datagram to elicit an IPMI Get Channel Authentication Capabilitiesl response from a remote host. The utility can be used to ver‐
       ify if a remote host supports IPMI. The initial starting sequence number will be randomized.  ipmiping will return 0 to the environment if it receives atleast 1 response from the remote  host.  Other‐
       wise, it exists with a value of 1.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available

       -h     Output help menu.

       -V     Output version.

       -c count
              Stop after sending count packets.

       -i interval
              Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. The default is to wait for one second between each packet.

       -I interface address
              Set source address to specified interface address. Argument may be numeric IP address or name of device.

       -t timeout
              Time to wait for a response, in seconds. Default is five seconds.

       -v     Verbose output.

       -s num Specify an initial starting sequence number. The default is to use a random initial sequence number.

       -d     Turn on debugging.

       -r version
              Specify  IPMI version. Available options are "1.5" and "2.0". Default is to use "1.5". Note that packets will always be sent with the IPMI 1.5 protocol, but IPMI 1.5 vs IPMI 2.0 relevant fields
              will be communicated in the Get Channel Authentication Capabilities datagram depending on user choice.

KNOWN ISSUES
       It has been observed that some remote BMCs can get "confused" and delay packet responses if duplicate packets (with duplicate sequence numbers) are sent in succession very quickly. There is  no  known
       way to cleanly deal with a "confused" BMC other than the wait awhile.

       Unlike ping(8), local network devices (e.g. 127.0.0.1) cannot be "pinged".
