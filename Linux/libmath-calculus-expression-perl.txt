NAME
       Math::Calculus::Expression - Algebraic Calculus Tools Expression Class

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Calculus::Expression;

         # Create an expression object.
         my $exp = Math::Calculus::Expression->new;

         # Set a variable and expression.
         $exp->addVariable('x');
         $exp->setExpression('x^(2+1) + 6*5*x') or die $exp->getError;

         # Simplify
         $exp->simplify or die $exp->getError;;

         # Print the result.
         print $exp->getExpression; # Prints x^3 + 30*x

DESCRIPTION
       This module can take an algebraic expression, parse it into a tree structure, simplify the tree, substitute variables and named constants for other variables or constants (which may be numeric),
       numerically evaluate the tree and turn the tree back into an output of the same form as the input.

       It supports a wide range of expressions including the +, -, *, / and ^ (raise to power) operators, bracketed expressions to enable correct precedence and the functions ln, exp, sin, cos, tan, sec,
       cosec, cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, cosech, coth, asin, acos, atan, asinh, acosh and atanh.

EXPORT
       None by default.

METHODS
       new
             $exp = Math::Calculus::Expression->new;

           Creates a new instance of the expression object, which can hold an individual expression and perform basic operations on it.

       addVariable
             $exp->addVariable('x');

           Sets a certain named value in the expression as being a variable. A named value must be an alphabetic chracter.

       setExpression
             $exp->setExpression('x^2 + 5*x);

           Takes  an  expression in human-readable form and stores it internally as a tree structure, checking it is a valid expression that the module can understand in the process. Note that the module
           is strict about syntax. For example, note above that you must write 5*x and not just 5x. Whitespace is allowed in the expression, but does not have any effect on precedence.   If  you  require
           control  of  precedence, use brackets; bracketed expressions will always be evaluated first, as you would normally expect. The module follows the BODMAS precedence convention. Returns undef on
           failure and a true value on success.

       getExpression
             $expr = $exp->getExpression;

           Returns a textaul, human readable representation of the expression that is being stored.

       simplify
             $exp->simplify;

           Attempts to simplify the expression that is stored internally.

       evaluate
             $exp->evaluate(x => 0.5, a => 4);

           This method takes a hash mapping any variables and named constants (represented by letters) in the expression to numerical values,  and  attempts  to  evaluate  the  expression  and  return  a
           numerical value. It fails and returns undef if it finds letters that have no mapping or an error such as division by zero occurs during the evaluation.

       sameRepresentation
             $same = $exp->sameRepresentation($exp2);

           The  sameRepresentation method takes another expression object as its parameter and returns true if that expression has the same internal representation as the expression the method is invoked
           on. Be careful - while it can be said that if two expressions have the same representation they are equal, it would be wrong to say that if they have different  representations  they  are  not
           equal. It is clear to see that "x + 2" and "2 + x" are equal, but their internal representation may well differ.

       clone
             $expCopy = $exp->clone;

           The clone method returns a deep copy of the expression object (deep copy meaning that if the original is modified the copy will not be affected and vice versa).

       getTraceback
             $exp->getTraceback;

           When setExpression and differentiate are called, a traceback is generated to describe what these functions did. If an error occurs, this traceback can be extremely useful in helping track down
           the source of the error.

       getError
             $exp->getError;

           When  any  method  other than getTraceback is called, the error message stored is cleared, and then any errors that occur during the execution of the method are stored. If failure occurs, call
           this method to get a textual representation of the error.

       Other Methods
           Any other method call is taken to refer to a subclass of Expression. The first letter of the name of the method invoked is capitalized, then a module by that name is loaded (if it exists)  and
           the  method  is  called  on  it.  This  works  for,  for  example,  the  Differentiate module; calling the differentiate method on an Expression will load the Differentiate module and call the
           differentiate method. If a module cannot be loaded or the method cannot be called, then this module will die.
