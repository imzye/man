NAME
       malsym - compile a Malaga symbol file

SYNOPSIS
       malsym symbol-file

       malsym extended-symbol-file -use symbol-file

DESCRIPTION
       Malaga is a development environment for natural-language grammars based on the Left-Associative Grammar formalism.  Malaga grammars can be used for automatic
       morphological and/or syntactic analysis.

       The program malsym compiles a Malaga symbol file. Give it the symbol file (suffix .sym or .esym) that is to be translated as argument. If an extended-symbol-
       file (suffix .esym) is to be compiled, you must add the option -use.

       See info Malaga for details.

OPTIONS
       -h[elp]
              Print a help text about malsym's command line arguments and exit.

       -u[se] symbol-file
              Use the already compiled symbol-file as the base symbol file when compiling an extended symbol file.

       -v[ersion]
              Print malsym's version number and exit.
