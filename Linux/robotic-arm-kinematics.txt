NAME
       robotic-arm-kinematics - GUI for editing and visualizing Denavit-Hartenberg parameters

SYNOPSIS
       robotic-arm-kinematics

DESCRIPTION
       robotic-arm-kinematics is a graphical application with both practical and didactic intentions: it can be used to teach and learn the usage of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters to define the kinematic
       chain of robotic manipulators. But it can be also used to define real kinematic chains for a subsequent usage within C++ programs.
