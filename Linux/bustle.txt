NAME
       bustle - D-Bus visualiser

SYNOPSIS
       bustle logfile

DESCRIPTION
       Bustle is a tool to chart and provide timing information of D-Bus calls for profiling and debugging. It is intended to replace reading the cryptic output of dbus-monitor. Calls are displayed using
       Message Sequence Charts, a succinct way of representing entities and interactions over time.

       You may generate a dump using bustle-pcap  and pass its filename as an argument to this command to visualise dbus calls saved previously.
