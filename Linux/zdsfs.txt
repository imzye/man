NAME
       zdsfs - File system for z/OS data set access

SYNOPSIS
   mounting:
       zdsfs <devices> <mountpoint> [<options>]

   unmounting:
       fusermount -u <mountpoint>

DESCRIPTION
       Use the zdsfs command for read access to z/OS data sets stored on one or more DASDs.

       The  zdsfs  file system translates the record-based z/OS data sets to UNIX file system semantics.  After mounting the devices, you can use common Linux tools
       to access the files on the disk. Physical sequential data sets are represented as files. Partitioned data sets are represented as directories, with each mem‐
       ber being represented as a file in that directory.

RESTRICTIONS
       Only read access is supported.

       Data sets on tape devices are not supported.

       To  maintain data consistency, a DASD must not be modified while it is in use by zdsfs. This can be assured by varying the device offline in z/OS before set‐
       ting it online in Linux.

       The access to the device by Linux is not subject to RACF or any other z/OS auditing mechanism. The safety of the data on the device must  be  established  by
       the  respective  Linux mechanisms. The default behavior of zdsfs is to grant access to the files in the fuse file system only to the user who has started the
       tool. This behavior can be configured by using the options `allow_other', `default_permissions', `umask', `uid', and `gid'.

       Only physical sequential (PS) and partitioned data sets (PDS) are supported. Supported record formats are: V, F, U, B, S, A, and M.

       The file system is limited to basic operations (readdir, stat, open, read, seek). Because the actual size of the data in each  track  is  not  always  known,
       zdsfs  does  not support mmap. Seek operations read the whole data set to the given offset. The performance of seek operations to previous offsets can be im‐
       proved by buffering seek offsets, see option `-o seekbuffers'.

       A further consequence of the unknown exact data size is that zdsfs cannot provide exact file sizes. As a heuristic, the given file sizes are the maximum pos‐
       sible data sizes, based on the number and size of the extents that belong to each data set. When the actual end of the data is reached during read, the usual
       end of file (EOF) is returned.  To make sure that the EOF is passed to the user correctly, the option `-o direct_io' is set by zdsfs implicitly.

       The detection of incomplete multi volume data sets does not work for data sets for which only the first volume (device) is present.

OPTIONS
   general options:
       <devices> One or more DASD device nodes, where node specifications are
              separated by blanks. The device nodes can be specified explicitly with the command or with the -l option and a file.

       <mountpoint> The mount point for the specified DASD.

       -o <opt>,[<opt>...]  Fuse or mount command
              options. For fuse options see "Applicable FUSE options" below, for mount options see mount(8).

       -h or --help
              Print usage information, then exit.

       -v or --version
              Print version information, then exit.

   zdsfs options:
       -l <device_list>
              The specified file <device_list> contains a list of device nodes, separated by white space (space, tab or new line). All device nodes in this file are
              mounted as if given directly via the command line.

       -o rdw Keep record descriptor words in the byte stream. By default, data set files contain only the user data.

              Record boundaries might be important for applications to correctly interpret the user data. For data sets with variable records, the record descriptor
              words are required to find the record boundaries. With fixed blocks, record boundaries can be computed from the fixed record sizes.

              See `z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets' for more information about record descriptor words.

       -o ignore_incomplete
              Continue processing even if parts of a multi-volume data set are missing.  By default, zdsfs ends with an error unless all data sets are complete.

              Incomplete data sets can be tolerated, for example, if all data of interest is on another data set that is complete.  Incomplete  data  sets  are  not
              represented in the file system. Instead, for each incomplete data set, a warning message is written to the standard error stream.

       -o tracks=<n>
              Size of the track buffer in tracks. The default for <n> is 128.

              The  data  that is read from the DASD has to be stored in a buffer, because the minimum size for a read operation in raw access mode is one track, and
              the user data has to be extracted from the track images.  Reading more than one track at a time improves the overall performance, but requires  larger
              buffers.

              The  memory  needed  by  zdsfs  for  buffering a single track is 64KB for the raw track data and 56KB for the extracted user data. Each time a file is
              opened a total of (<n> * 120KB) is allocated for the track buffer.

       -o seekbuffer=<s>
              Upper limit in bytes for the seek history buffer size. The default for s is 1048576.

              Because the block and record sizes in a data set may vary, the only way to find a data byte at a particular offset (`seek') is to read  and  interpret
              the whole data set from the beginning, until the offset is reached.

              To  improve  the performance of `seek' operations in areas that have already been read, zdsfs can buffer offsets in regular intervals. These intervals
              are multiples of <n> tracks, as specified with the `tracks' option.

              For small data sets and large values of <n>, only a few seek offsets need to be buffered. In this case, the amount of memory that  is  actually  allo‐
              cated can be much smaller than the upper limit <s>.

              If  <s>  is  set to 0, no seek history buffer is allocated. In this case `seek' is still supported, but a `seek' operation might result in a read from
              the beginning of the data set.

       -o check_host_count
              Stop processing if the device is used by another operating system instance.

   Applicable FUSE options (version 2.8):
       This is a selected subset of all FUSE options. Use the zdsfs --help option to print a full list.

       -d or -o debug
              Enable debug output (implies -f)

       -f     Foreground operation

       -o allow_other
              Allow access by other users

       -o allow_root
              Allow access by root

       -o nonempty
              Allow mounts over non-empty file/dir

       -o default_permissions
              Enable permission checking by kernel

       -o max_read=<n>
              Set maximum size of read requests

       -o kernel_cache
              Cache files in kernel

       -o [no]auto_cache

       -o sync_read
              Perform reads synchronously

DATA SET CHARACTERISTICS
       Certain data set characteristics might be required for the correct interpretation of the data. The collected metadata of all data sets can be found in a file
       `metadata.txt' in the top directory of the mounted file system.

       This file contains one line per data set, with the syntax that is used by z/OS.

       dsn=<data set name>,recfm=<fmt>,lrecl=<size>,dsorg=<org>

       dsn:  The  data  set  name.  For physical sequential data sets this is the same name as the file name in the mount directory. For partitioned data sets (PDS)
       this is the same as the directory name in the mount directory. For PDS members the member name is placed in parentheses after the PDS name.

       recfm: The record format.

       lrecl: The logical record length.

       dsorg: The data set organization.  For partitioned data sets the organization is `PO', but for partitioned data set members it is `PS'.

       In addition to the `metadata.txt' file, you can use the following extended attributes to read the data set characteristics of a file or directory:

       user.recfm: The record format.

       user.lrecl: The logical record length.

       user.dsorg: The data set organization of a file.

EXAMPLES
       To mount the z/OS disk with the name dasde enter:

         # zdsfs /dev/dasde /mnt

       To mount the z/OS disk with space for 4 tracks and keeping the record descriptor words in the byte stream, enter:

         # zdsfs -o rdw -o tracks=4 /dev/dasde /mnt

       To unmount the z/OS disk mounted on /mnt enter:

         # fusermount -u /mnt

       To list all extended attributes of file FOOBAR.TEST.TXT assuming the z/OS disk was mounted on /mnt:

         # getfattr -d /mnt/FOOBAR.TEST.TXT
