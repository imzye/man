NAME
       vulture - searches for unused ("dead") code in a Python program

SYNOPSIS
       vulture [options] <path>

DESCRIPTION
       Vulture scans for unused classes, functions and variables.

       Due to Python's dynamic nature it's impossible to find all ununsed code for a static code analyzer, because it ignores scopes and scans only token names.  Additionally, some dynamic items that are
       not explicitly called in the code may be incorrectly reported.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help

       --exclude=<exclude>

             comma-separated list of filename patterns to exclude (e.g. svn,external)

       -v, --verbose
