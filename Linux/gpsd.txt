NAME
       gpsdctl - tool for sending commands to gpsd over its control socket

SYNOPSIS
       gpsdctl action device

OPTIONS
       action
           may be add or remove. If no daemon instance is running when an add is requested, this program will launch one.

       device
           argument should be the pathname of a device. The device will be opened by gpsd to read sensor data.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a tool for sending an instance of gpsd commands over its control socket to add or remove devices from the daemon’s device list. It is not intended to be called by users, but rather by the
       Linux hotplug system and similar facilities.

ENVIRONMENT
       Two environment variables are interpreted.

       GPSD_SOCKET
           sets the location of the control socket. If the effective user ID of this program is root then it usually defaults to /run/gpsd.sock, although some systems may use the deprecated
           /var/run/gpsd.sock instead. Non-root users will use /tmp/gpsd.sock.

       GPSD_OPTIONS
           may be a list of options to be passed to gpsd when this tool launches it. It defaults to an empty string.

RETURN VALUES
       0
           on success.

       1
           if the action was unknown or the write to the control socket failed,
