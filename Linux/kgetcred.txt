KGETCRED(1)               BSD General Commands Manual              KGETCRED(1)

NAME
     kgetcred — get a ticket for a particular service

SYNOPSIS
     kgetcred [--canonicalize] [--canonical] [-c -cache | --cache=cache] [-e
              enctype | --enctype=enctype] [--debug] [-H | --hostbased]
              [--name-type=name-type] [--no-transit-check] [--no-store]
              [--cached-only] [-n | --anonymous] [--version] [--help]
              principal
     kgetcred [options] --hostbased principal
     kgetcred [options] --hostbased service hostname [extra-components]

DESCRIPTION
     kgetcred obtains a ticket for the given service principal.  Usually tick‐
     ets for services are obtained automatically when needed but sometimes for
     some odd reason you want to obtain a particular ticket or of a special
     type.

     If --hostbased is given then the given service principal name will be
     canonicalized (see below).

     The third form constructs a host-based principal from the given service
     name and hostname.  The service name "host" is used if the given service
     name in the third usage is the empty string.

     For host-based names, the local host's hostname is used if the given
     hostname is the empty string or if the principal has a single component.

     Any additional components will be included, even for host-based service
     principal names, but there are no defaults nor local canonicalization
     rules for additional components.

     Local name canonicalization rules are applied unless the --canonical
     option is given.  Currently local name canonicalization rules are sup‐
     ported only for host-based principal names' hostname component.

     The principal's realm name may be canonicalized by following Kerberos
     referrals from the client principal's home realm if the --canonicalize
     option is given or if the local name canonicalization rules are config‐
     ured to use referrals.

     Supported options:

     --canonicalize
             requests that the KDC canonicalize the principal.  Currently this
             only canonicalizes the realm by chasing referrals from the user's
             start realm, but in the future this may also enable the KDC to
             canonicalize the complete principal name.

     --canonical
             turns off local canonicalization of the principal name.

     --name-type=name-type
             the name-type to use when parsing the principal name.

     --hostbased
             is short for --name-type=srv_hst.

     -c cache, --cache=cache
             the credential cache to use.

     --delegation-credential-cache=cache
             the credential cache to use for delegation.

     -e enctype, --enctype=enctype
             encryption type to use.

     --no-transit-check
             requests that the KDC doesn't do transit checking.

     --no-store
             do not store tickets in the ccache.

     --cached-only
             do not talk the TGS, search only the ccache.

     --anonymous
             obtain an anonymous service ticket.

     --forwardable

     --debug
             enables debug output to stderr.

     --version

     --help

     If the --canonical option is used, then no further canonicalization
     should be done locally by the client (for example, DNS), but if
     --canonicalize is used, then the client will ask that the KDC canonical‐
     ize the name.

     If the --canonicalize option is used with --hostbased a host-based name-
     type, and --canonical is not used, then the hostname will be canonical‐
     ized according to the name canonicalization rules in krb5.conf.

     GSS-API initiator applications with host-based services will get the same
     behavior as using the --canonicalize --hostbased options here.
