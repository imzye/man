NAME
       claws-mail-gdata-plugin - access to GData (Google™ services)

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-gdata-plugin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-gdata-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin provides access to the Google™ services using the GData library.

       Currently allows using your Google™ contacts as results for address autocompletion in the compose window.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin
       file, named gdata.so, and press the “Open” button.
