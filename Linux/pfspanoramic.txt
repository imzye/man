NAME
       pfspanoramic - Perform projective transformations of spherical images

SYNOPSIS
       pfspanoramic <source projection>+<target projection> [--width <val>] [--height <val>] [--oversample <val>] [--interpolate] [--xrotate <angle>] [--yrotate <angle>] [--zrotate <angle>]

DESCRIPTION
       Transform  spherical  maps between various projections. Currently polar (latitude-longitude), angular (light probe), mirrorball and cylindrical are supported. The syntax for specifying the transforma‐
       tion is source_projection+target_projection, where source_projection is the current mapping that source image uses and target_projection is the projection you'd like it to be transformed  to.  If  the
       projection has some optional parameters, you can specify them with syntax: <source projection>/<argument>/...+<target projection>/<argument>/...

       As  of  now  only angular supports a parameter - angle - which defines how many degrees from the viewing direction the projection should cover, e.g. angular+angular/angle=180 converts angular image to
       show only half of a hemisphere around the viewing direction.

OPTIONS
       --width <val>, -w <val>

       --height <val>, -h <val>

              Make the target image respectively <val> pixels wide and/or high. If only one is specified, the other is computed from the target projection's typical W/H ratio.  If neither is  specified,  the
              width is taken from the source image and height is computed as above.

       --oversample <val>, -o <val>

              Oversample  each target pixel <val>x<val> times, improving quality in areas that are scaled down with respect to the source image. Reasonable values are 2 to 5, while setting it higher may make
              the reprojection unbearably slow.

       --interpolate, -i

              Use bilinear interpolation when sampling the source image. Increases quality in magnified areas.

       --xrotate <angle>, -x <angle>

              Rotate the spherical image <angle> degrees around X axis.

       --yrotate <angle>, -y <angle>

              Rotate the spherical image <angle> degrees around Y axis.

       --zrotate <angle>, -z <angle>

              Rotate the spherical image <angle> degrees around Z axis.

EXAMPLES
       pfsin grace_probe.hdr | pfspanoramic angular+polar -i -o 3 -y 90 -w 500 | pfsout grace.hdr

              Transform grace angular map to polar (latitude-longitude) projection applying bilinear interpolation and 3x3 oversampling, while rotating it by 90 degrees around Y axis. The image will  be  re‐
              sized to 500x250 pixels (as the polar projection has 2:1 width-to-height ratio) and finally saved in grace.hdr.
