Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User(3pm)                             User Contributed Perl Documentation                             Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User(3pm)

NAME
       Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User - The backing user class for the Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class storage module.

VERSION
       This documentation refers to version 0.1506.

SYNOPSIS
       Internal - not used directly, please see Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class for details on how to use this module. If you need more information than is present there, read the source.

DESCRIPTION
       The Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User class implements user storage connected to an underlying DBIx::Class schema object.

SUBROUTINES / METHODS
   new
       Constructor.

   load ( $authinfo, $c )
       Retrieves a user from storage using the information provided in $authinfo.

   supported_features
       Indicates the features supported by this class.  These are currently Roles and Session.

   roles
       Returns an array of roles associated with this user, if roles are configured for this user class.

   for_session
       Returns a serialized user for storage in the session.

   from_session
       Revives a serialized user from storage in the session.

   get ( $fieldname )
       Returns the value of $fieldname for the user in question.  Roughly translates to a call to the DBIx::Class::Row's get_column( $fieldname ) routine.

   get_object
       Retrieves the DBIx::Class object that corresponds to this user

   obj (method)
       Synonym for get_object

   auto_create
       This is called when the auto_create_user option is turned on in Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication and a user matching the authinfo provided is not found.  By default, this will call the
       "auto_create()" method of the resultset associated with this object. It is up to you to implement that method.

   auto_update
       This is called when the auto_update_user option is turned on in Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication. Note that by default the DBIx::Class store uses every field in the authinfo hash to match the
       user. This means any information you provide with the intent to update must be ignored during the user search process. Otherwise the information will most likely cause the user record to not be
       found. To ignore fields in the search process, you have to add the fields you wish to update to the 'ignore_fields_in_find' authinfo element.  Alternately, you can use one of the advanced row
       retrieval methods (searchargs or resultset).

       By default, auto_update will call the "auto_update()" method of the DBIx::Class::Row object associated with the user. It is up to you to implement that method (probably in your schema file)

   AUTOLOAD
       Delegates method calls to the underlying user row.

   can
       Delegates handling of the "can" method to the underlying user row.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       None known currently, please email the author if you find any.
