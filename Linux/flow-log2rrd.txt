FLOW-LOG2RRD(1)                                                FLOW-LOG2RRD(1)

NAME
       flow-log2rrd - Process the STAT: lines from flow-capture andflow-fanout
       to RRD files.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-log2rrd [ -p rrd_path ]

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-log2rrd utility processes the STAT lines  generated  by  flow-
       capture  and  flow-fanout  and  converts them into RRD files. RRD's are
       stored as  rrd_path/capture|fanout.hostname.srcip.dstip.port.rrd.   The
       Datastores  are  flows,pkts,lost  representing flows, packets, and lost
       flows respectively. Flow-fanout generates an additional DS nobufs indi‐
       cating the number of times a write() failed with ENOBUFS.

OPTIONS
       -p rrd_path
              Path to store files.

EXAMPLES
       Convert  flow-capture  STAT  lines  in  /var/log/netflow  to  RRD's  in
       /flows/rrd/.

       cat /var/log/netflow | flow-rpt2rrd -p /flows/rrd

BUGS
       Expects STAT lines every 5 minutes. Hard coded to 7 days  of  5  minute
       averages and 365 days of 1 day averages.
