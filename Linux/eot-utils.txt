NAME
       eotinfo - display data from an EOT file in a readable way

SYNOPSIS
       eotinfo [ EOT-file ]

DESCRIPTION
       The eotinfo command displays information on standard output about the given EOT file. If no argument is given, it reads the EOT file from standard input.

       EOT (Embedded OpenType) is a binary format and this program decodes most of the information in the EOT header. It does not read the actual font data, only the EOT header.
