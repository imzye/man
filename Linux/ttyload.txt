NAME
       ttyload - Console based color-coded graphs of CPU load average

SYNOPSIS
         ttyload [options]

OPTIONS
       -h  Show brief help.

       -v  Show version information.

       -m  Monochrome mode (no ANSI escapes).

       -c cols
           Specify how many columns wide is the screen.

       -r rows
           Specify how many rows high is the screen. These two options override the default behavior of auto-determining screen size.

       -i secs
           Alter the number of seconds in the interval between refreshes.  The default is 4, and the minimum is 1, which is silently clamped.

           None.

DESCRIPTION
       Display fairly standard, but hard-coded, ANSI ASCII escape sequences for screen manipulation and colorization for different graphs: 1 minute, 5 minute, 15 minute load averages. Use C-c to quit.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.
