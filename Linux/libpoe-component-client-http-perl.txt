NAME
       POE::Filter::HTTPChunk - Non-blocking incremental HTTP chunk parser.

VERSION
       version 0.949

SYNOPSIS
         # Not a complete program.
         use POE::Filter::HTTPChunk;
         use POE::Wheel::ReadWrite;
         sub setup_io {
           $_[HEAP]->{io_wheel} = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite->new(
             Filter => POE::Filter::HTTPChunk->new(),
             # See POE::Wheel::ReadWrite for other required parameters.
           );
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This filter parses HTTP chunks from a data stream.  It's used by POE::Component::Client::HTTP to do the bulk of the low-level HTTP parsing.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
       "new" takes no parameters and returns a shiny new POE::Filter::HTTPChunk object ready to use.

METHODS
       POE::Filter::HTTPChunk supports the following methods.  Most of them adhere to the standard POE::Filter API.  The documentation for POE::Filter explains the API in more detail.

   get_one_start ARRAYREF
       Accept an arrayref containing zero or more raw data chunks.  They are added to the filter's input buffer.  The filter will attempt to parse that data when get_one() is called.

         $filter_httpchunk->get_one_start(\@stream_data);

   get_one
       Parse a single HTTP chunk from the filter's input buffer.  Data is entered into the buffer by the get_one_start() method.  Returns an arrayref containing zero or one parsed HTTP chunk.

         $ret_arrayref = $filter_httpchunk->get_one();

   get_pending
       Returns an arrayref of stream data currently pending parsing.  It's used to seamlessly transfer unparsed data between an old and a new filter when a wheel's filter is changed.

         $pending_arrayref = $filter_httpchunk->get_pending();
