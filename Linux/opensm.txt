TORUS-2QOS.CONF(5)                                                                           OpenIB Management                                                                           TORUS-2QOS.CONF(5)

NAME
       torus-2QoS.conf - Torus-2QoS configuration for OpenSM subnet manager

DESCRIPTION
       The file torus-2QoS.conf contains configuration information that is specific to the OpenSM routing engine torus-2QoS.  Blank lines and lines where the first non-whitespace character is "#" are ig‐
       nored.  A token is any contiguous group of non-whitespace characters.  Any tokens on a line following the recognized configuration tokens described below are ignored.

       [torus|mesh] x_radix[m|M|t|T] y_radix[m|M|t|T] z_radix[m|M|t|T]
              Either  torus  or  mesh  must  be  the first keyword in the configuration, and sets the topology that torus-2QoS will try to construct.  A 2D topology can be configured by specifying one of
              x_radix, y_radix, or z_radix as 1.  An individual dimension can be configured as mesh (open) or torus (looped) by suffixing its radix specification with one of m, M, t, or T.   Thus,  "mesh
              3T 4 5" and "torus 3 4M 5M" both specify the same topology.

              Note  that  although  torus-2QoS  can route mesh fabrics, its ability to route around failed components is severely compromised on such fabrics.  A failed fabric component is very likely to
              cause a disjoint ring; see UNICAST ROUTING in torus-2QoS(8).

       xp_link sw0_GUID sw1_GUID
       yp_link sw0_GUID sw1_GUID
       zp_link sw0_GUID sw1_GUID
       xm_link sw0_GUID sw1_GUID
       ym_link sw0_GUID sw1_GUID
       zm_link sw0_GUID sw1_GUID
              These keywords are used to seed the torus/mesh topology.  For example, "xp_link 0x2000 0x2001" specifies that a link from the switch with node GUID 0x2000  to  the  switch  with  node  GUID
              0x2001  would point in the positive x direction, while "xm_link 0x2000 0x2001" specifies that a link from the switch with node GUID 0x2000 to the switch with node GUID 0x2001 would point in
              the negative x direction.  All the link keywords for a given seed must specify the same "from" switch.

              In general, it is not necessary to configure both the positive and negative directions for a given coordinate; either is sufficient.  However, the  algorithm  used  for  topology  discovery
              needs extra information for torus dimensions of radix four (see TOPOLOGY DISCOVERY in torus-2QoS(8)).  For such cases both the positive and negative coordinate directions must be specified.

              Based on the topology specified via the torus/mesh keyword, torus-2QoS will detect and log when it has insufficient seed configuration.

       x_dateline position
       y_dateline position
       z_dateline position
              In  order  for  torus-2QoS  to  provide  the guarantee that path SL values do not change under any conditions for which it can still route the fabric, its idea of dateline position must not
              change relative to physical switch locations.  The dateline keywords provide the means to configure such behavior.

              The dateline for a torus dimension is always between the switch with coordinate 0 and the switch with coordinate radix-1 for that dimension.  By default, the common switch in a  torus  seed
              is  taken  as  the  origin  of the coordinate system used to describe switch location.  The position parameter for a dateline keyword moves the origin (and hence the dateline) the specified
              amount relative to the common switch in a torus seed.

       next_seed
              If any of the switches used to specify a seed were to fail torus-2QoS would be unable to complete topology discovery successfully.  The next_seed keyword specifies that the  following  link
              and dateline keywords apply to a new seed specification.

              For  maximum  resiliency,  no  seed  specification  should  share  a switch with any other seed specification.  Multiple seed specifications should use dateline configuration to ensure that
              torus-2QoS can grant path SL values that are constant, regardless of which seed was used to initiate topology discovery.

       portgroup_max_ports max_ports
              This keyword specifies the maximum number of parallel inter-switch links, and also the maximum number of host ports per switch, that torus-2QoS can accommodate.  The default  value  is  16.
              Torus-2QoS will log an error message during topology discovery if this parameter needs to be increased.  If this keyword appears multiple times, the last instance prevails.

              Note  that the switch management port (switch port 0) gets put into the same port group with the host ports, so if you have 16 host ports per switch, portgroup_max_ports would need to be at
              least 17.

       port_order p1 p2 p3 ...
              This keyword specifies the order in which CA ports on a destination switch are visited when computing routes. When the fabric contains  switches  connected  with  multiple  parallel  links,
              routes are distributed in a round-robin fashion across such links, and so changing the order that CA ports are visited changes the distribution of routes across such links.  This may be ad‐
              vantageous for some specific traffic patterns.

              The default is to visit CA ports in increasing port order on destination switches.

              Duplicate values in the list will be ignored.

       max_changes max
              This keyword specifies the maximum number of torus changes reported.  The default value is 32.

EXAMPLE

       # Look for a 2D (since x radix is one) 4x5 torus.
       torus 1 4 5

       # y is radix-4 torus dimension, need both
       # ym_link and yp_link configuration.
       yp_link 0x200000 0x200005  # sw @ y=0,z=0 -> sw @ y=1,z=0
       ym_link 0x200000 0x20000f  # sw @ y=0,z=0 -> sw @ y=3,z=0

       # z is not radix-4 torus dimension, only need one of
       # zm_link or zp_link configuration.
       zp_link 0x200000 0x200001  # sw @ y=0,z=0 -> sw @ y=0,z=1

       next_seed

       yp_link 0x20000b 0x200010  # sw @ y=2,z=1 -> sw @ y=3,z=1
       ym_link 0x20000b 0x200006  # sw @ y=2,z=1 -> sw @ y=1,z=1
       zp_link 0x20000b 0x20000c  # sw @ y=2,z=1 -> sw @ y=2,z=2

       y_dateline -2  # Move the dateline for this seed
       z_dateline -1  # back to its original position.

       # If OpenSM failover is configured, for maximum resiliency
       # one instance should run on a host attached to a switch
       # from the first seed, and another instance should run
       # on a host attached to a switch from the second seed.
       # Both instances should use this torus-2QoS.conf to ensure
       # path SL values do not change in the event of SM failover.

       # port_order defines the order on which the ports would be
       # chosen for routing.
       port_order 7 10 8 11 9 12 25 28 26 29 27 30
