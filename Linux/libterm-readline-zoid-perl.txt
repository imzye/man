NAME
       Term::ReadLine::Zoid::ISearch - a readline incremental search mode

SYNOPSIS
       This class is used as a mode under Term::ReadLine::Zoid, see there for usage details.

DESCRIPTION
       This mode is intended as a work alike for the incremental search found in the gnu readline library.

       In this mode the string you enter is regarded as a perl regex which is used to do an incremental histroy search.

       Pressing '^R' repeatingly will give alternative results.

       Special keys like movements or the "return" drop you out of this mode and set the edit line to the last search result.
