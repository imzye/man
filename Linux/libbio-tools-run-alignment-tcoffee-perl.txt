NAME
       Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::TCoffee - Object for the calculation of a multiple sequence alignment from a set of unaligned sequences or alignments using the TCoffee program

VERSION
       version 1.7.4

SYNOPSIS
         # Build a tcoffee alignment factory
         @params = ('ktuple' => 2, 'matrix' => 'BLOSUM');
         $factory = Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::TCoffee->new(@params);

         # Pass the factory a list of sequences to be aligned.
         $inputfilename = 't/cysprot.fa';
         # $aln is a SimpleAlign object.
         $aln = $factory->align($inputfilename);

         # or where @seq_array is an array of Bio::Seq objects
         $seq_array_ref = \@seq_array;
         $aln = $factory->align($seq_array_ref);

         # Or one can pass the factory a pair of (sub)alignments
         #to be aligned against each other, e.g.:

         # where $aln1 and $aln2 are Bio::SimpleAlign objects.
         $aln = $factory->profile_align($aln1,$aln2);

         # Or one can pass the factory an alignment and one or more
         # unaligned sequences to be added to the alignment. For example:

         # $seq is a Bio::Seq object.
         $aln = $factory->profile_align($aln1,$seq);

         #There are various additional options and input formats available.
         #See the DESCRIPTION section that follows for additional details.

DESCRIPTION
       Note: this DESCRIPTION only documents the (Bio)perl interface to TCoffee.

   Helping the module find your executable
       You will need to enable TCoffee to find the t_coffee program. This can be done in (at least) three ways:

        1. Make sure the t_coffee executable is in your path so that
           which t_coffee returns a t_coffee executable on your system.

        2. Define an environmental variable TCOFFEEDIR which is a dir
           which contains the 't_coffee' app:
           In bash
           export TCOFFEEDIR=/home/username/progs/T-COFFEE_distribution_Version_1.37/bin
           In csh/tcsh
           setenv TCOFFEEDIR /home/username/progs/T-COFFEE_distribution_Version_1.37/bin

        3. Include a definition of an environmental variable TCOFFEEDIR in
           every script that will use this TCoffee wrapper module.
           BEGIN { $ENV{TCOFFEDIR} = '/home/username/progs/T-COFFEE_distribution_Version_1.37/bin' }
           use Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::TCoffee;

       If you are running an application on a webserver make sure the webserver environment has the proper PATH set or use the options 2 or 3 to set the variables.

INTERNAL METHODS
   _numeric_version
       Version "numbers" are not numeric values.  In the case of T-Coffee, they have an hash component at their end.  This was not the case in older releases.  We use the first two numeric parts to do
       different things though.  See also issue #1.

   _run
        Title   :  _run
        Usage   :  Internal function, not to be called directly
        Function:  makes actual system call to tcoffee program
        Example :
        Returns : nothing; tcoffee output is written to a
                  temporary file OR specified output file
        Args    : Name of a file containing a set of unaligned fasta sequences
                  and hash of parameters to be passed to tcoffee

   _setinput
        Title   :  _setinput
        Usage   :  Internal function, not to be called directly
        Function:  Create input file for tcoffee program
        Example :
        Returns : name of file containing tcoffee data input AND
                  type of file (if known, S for sequence, L for sequence library,
                  A for sequence alignment)
        Args    : Seq or Align object reference or input file name

   _setparams
        Title   :  _setparams
        Usage   :  Internal function, not to be called directly
        Function:  Create parameter inputs for tcoffee program
        Example :
        Returns : parameter string to be passed to tcoffee
                  during align or profile_align
        Args    : name of calling object

PARAMETERS FOR ALIGNMENT COMPUTATION
       There are a number of possible parameters one can pass in TCoffee.  One should really read the online manual for the best explanation of all the features.  See
       http://igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cnotred/Documentation/t_coffee/t_coffee_doc.html

       These can be specified as parameters when instantiating a new TCoffee object, or through get/set methods of the same name (lowercase).

   IN
        Title       : IN
        Description : (optional) input filename, this is specified when
                      align so should not use this directly unless one
                      understand TCoffee program very well.

   TYPE
        Title       : TYPE
        Args        : [string] DNA, PROTEIN
        Description : (optional) set the sequence type, guessed automatically
                      so should not use this directly

   PARAMETERS
        Title       : PARAMETERS
        Description : (optional) Indicates a file containing extra parameters

   EXTEND
        Title       : EXTEND
        Args        : 0, 1, or positive value
        Default     : 1
        Description : Flag indicating that library extension should be
                      carried out when performing multiple alignments, if set
                      to 0 then extension is not made, if set to 1 extension
                      is made on all pairs in the library.  If extension is
                      set to another positive value, the extension is only
                      carried out on pairs having a weight value superior to
                      the specified limit.

   DP_NORMALISE
        Title       : DP_NORMALISE
        Args        : 0 or positive value
        Default     : 1000
        Description : When using a value different from 0, this flag sets the
                      score of the highest scoring pair to 1000.

   DP_MODE
        Title       : DP_MODE
        Args        : [string] gotoh_pair_wise, myers_miller_pair_wise,
                      fasta_pair_wise cfasta_pair_wise
        Default     : cfast_fair_wise
        Description : Indicates the type of dynamic programming used by
                      the program

           gotoh_pair_wise : implementation of the gotoh algorithm
           (quadratic in memory and time)

           myers_miller_pair_wise : implementation of the Myers and Miller
           dynamic programming algorithm ( quadratic in time and linear in
           space). This algorithm is recommended for very long sequences. It
           is about 2 time slower than gotoh. It only accepts tg_mode=1.

           fasta_pair_wise: implementation of the fasta algorithm. The
           sequence is hashed, looking for ktuples words. Dynamic programming
           is only carried out on the ndiag best scoring diagonals. This is
           much faster but less accurate than the two previous.

           cfasta_pair_wise : c stands for checked. It is the same
           algorithm. The dynamic programming is made on the ndiag best
           diagonals, and then on the 2*ndiags, and so on until the scores
           converge. Complexity will depend on the level of divergence of the
           sequences, but will usually be L*log(L), with an accuracy
           comparable to the two first mode ( this was checked on BaliBase).

   KTUPLE
        Title       : KTUPLE
        Args        : numeric value
        Default     : 1 or 2 (1 for protein, 2 for DNA )

        Description : Indicates the ktuple size for cfasta_pair_wise dp_mode
                      and fasta_pair_wise. It is set to 1 for proteins, and 2
                      for DNA. The alphabet used for protein is not the 20
                      letter code, but a mildly degenerated version, where
                      some residues are grouped under one letter, based on
                      physicochemical properties:
                      rk, de, qh, vilm, fy (the other residues are
                      not degenerated).

   NDIAGS
        Title       : NDIAGS
        Args        : numeric value
        Default     : 0
        Description : Indicates the number of diagonals used by the
                      fasta_pair_wise algorithm. When set to 0,
                      n_diag=Log (length of the smallest sequence)

   DIAG_MODE
        Title       : DIAG_MODE
        Args        : numeric value
        Default     : 0

        Description : Indicates the manner in which diagonals are scored
                     during the fasta hashing.

                     0 indicates that the score of a diagonal is equal to the
                     sum of the scores of the exact matches it contains.

                     1 indicates that this score is set equal to the score of
                     the best uninterrupted segment

                     1 can be useful when dealing with fragments of sequences.

   SIM_MATRIX
        Title       : SIM_MATRIX
        Args        : string
        Default     : vasiliky
        Description : Indicates the manner in which the amino acid is being
                      degenerated when hashing. All the substitution matrix
                      are acceptable. Categories will be defined as sub-group
                      of residues all having a positive substitution score
                      (they can overlap).

                      If you wish to keep the non degenerated amino acid
                      alphabet, use 'idmat'

   MATRIX
        Title       : MATRIX
        Args        :
        Default     :
        Description : This flag is provided for compatibility with
                      ClustalW. Setting matrix = 'blosum' is equivalent to
                      -in=Xblosum62mt , -matrix=pam is equivalent to
                      in=Xpam250mt . Apart from this, the rules are similar
                      to those applying when declaring a matrix with the
                      -in=X fl

   GAPOPEN
        Title       : GAPOPEN
        Args        : numeric
        Default     : 0
        Description : Indicates the penalty applied for opening a gap. The
                      penalty must be negative. If you provide a positive
                      value, it will automatically be turned into a negative
                      number. We recommend a value of 10 with pam matrices,
                      and a value of 0 when a library is used.

   GAPEXT
        Title       : GAPEXT
        Args        : numeric
        Default     : 0
        Description : Indicates the penalty applied for extending a gap.

   COSMETIC_PENALTY
        Title       : COSMETIC_PENALTY
        Args        : numeric
        Default     : 100
        Description : Indicates the penalty applied for opening a gap. This
                      penalty is set to a very low value. It will only have
                      an influence on the portions of the alignment that are
                      unalignable. It will not make them more correct, but
                      only more pleasing to the eye ( i.e. Avoid stretches of
                      lonely residues).

                      The cosmetic penalty is automatically turned off if a
                      substitution matrix is used rather than a library.

   TG_MODE
        Title       : TG_MODE
        Args        : 0,1,2
        Default     : 1
        Description : (Terminal Gaps)
                      0: indicates that terminal gaps must be panelized with
                         a gapopen and a gapext penalty.
                      1: indicates that terminal gaps must be penalized only
                         with a gapext penalty
                      2: indicates that terminal gaps must not be penalized.

   WEIGHT
        Title       : WEIGHT
        Args        : sim or sim_<matrix_name or matrix_file> or integer value
        Default     : sim

        Description : Weight defines the way alignments are weighted when
                      turned into a library.

                      sim indicates that the weight equals the average
                          identity within the match residues.

                      sim_matrix_name indicates the average identity with two
                          residues regarded as identical when their
                          substitution value is positive. The valid matrices
                          names are in matrices.h (pam250mt) . Matrices not
                          found in this header are considered to be
                          filenames. See the format section for matrices. For
                          instance, -weight=sim_pam250mt indicates that the
                          grouping used for similarity will be the set of
                          classes with positive substitutions. Other groups
                          include

                              sim_clustalw_col ( categories of clustalw
                              marked with :)

                              sim_clustalw_dot ( categories of clustalw
                              marked with .)

                      Value indicates that all the pairs found in the
                      alignments must be given the same weight equal to
                      value. This is useful when the alignment one wishes to
                      turn into a library must be given a pre-specified score
                      (for instance if they come from a structure
                      super-imposition program). Value is an integer:

                              -weight=1000

         Note       : Weight only affects methods that return an alignment to
                      T-Coffee, such as ClustalW. On the contrary, the
                      version of Lalign we use here returns a library where
                      weights have already been applied and are therefore
                      insensitive to the -weight flag.

   SEQ_TO_ALIGN
        Title       : SEQ_TO_ALIGN
        Args        : filename
        Default     : no file - align all the sequences

        Description : You may not wish to align all the sequences brought in
                      by the -in flag. Supplying the seq_to_align flag allows
                      for this, the file is simply a list of names in Fasta
                      format.

                      However, note that library extension will be carried out
                      on all the sequences.

PARAMETERS FOR TREE COMPUTATION AND OUTPUT
   NEWTREE
        Title       : NEWTREE

   USETREE
        Title       : USETREE
        Args        : treefile

        Description : This flag indicates that rather than computing a new
                      dendrogram, t_coffee can use a pre-computed one. The
                      tree files are in phylips format and compatible with
                      ClustalW. In most cases, using a pre-computed tree will
                      halve the computation time required by t_coffee. It is
                      also possible to use trees output by ClustalW or
                      Phylips. Format is Phylips tree format

        Default     : very_fast
        Description : This flag indicates the method used for computing the
                      dendrogram.
                      slow : the chosen dp_mode using the extended library,
                      fast : The fasta dp_mode using the extended library.
                      very_fast: The fasta dp_mode using pam250mt.
