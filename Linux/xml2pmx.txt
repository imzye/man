DESCRIPTION
       xml2pmx translates MusicXML files to input suitable for PMX processing

SYNOPSIS
       xml2pmx [-v | --version | -h | --help]

       xml2pmx input.xml output.pmx [ p | d | v | s | l ] ..

       The musixtex.lua script from version 0.23 supports xml2pmx as a pre-preprocessor for MusicXML files.

OPTIONS
       The meanings of the letter options are as follows:

            p       XML parser output; not recommended unless the terminal window process has enough storage

            d       information on "directions" (dynamical marks etc)

            v       distribution of voices over instruments and measures

            s       statistics of MusicXML tags like <note>, <measure> etc

            l       for extracting lyrics in a separate file

BUGS
       xml2pmx processes input in UTF-8 encoding only.  MusicXML files in UTF-16 encoding should be converted using, for example, recode (in Unix-like systems) or by importing into an editor like notepad and
       saving in UTF-8 encoding.
