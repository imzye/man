NAME
       Web::ID::Util - utility functions used in Web-ID

DESCRIPTION
       These are utility functions which I found useful building Web-ID.  Many of them may also be useful creating the kind of apps that Web-ID is used to authenticate for.

       Here is a very brief summary. By default, they're all exported to your namespace. (This module uses Exporter::Tiny so you get pretty good control over what gets exported.)

       "true" - constant for true
       "false" - constant for false
       "read_only" - constant for string 'ro' (nice for Moose/Mouse)
       "read_write" - constant for string 'rw' (nice for Moose/Mouse)
       get_trine_model($url) - fetches a URL and parses RDF into an RDF::Trine::Model
       u($curie) - expands a CURIE, returning an RDF::Trine::Node::Resource
       uu($curie) - as per u($curie), but returns string
       u() - called with no CURIE, returns the RDF::Trine::NamespaceMap used to map CURIEs to URIs
       "make_bigint_from_node($node, %options)" - makes a Math::BigInt object from a numeric RDF::Trine::Node::Literal. Supports most datatypes you'd care about, including hexadecimally ones.
           Supported  options are "fallback" which provides a fallback node which will be used when $node is non-literal; and "fallback_type" either 'dec' or 'hex' which is used when parsing the fallback
           node, or if $node is a plain literal. (The actual datatype of the fallback node is ignored for hysterical raisins.)

       Additionally, any function from List::MoreUtils can be exported by request, except "true" and "false" as they conflict with the constants above.

         use Web::ID::Utils qw(:default uniq);

BUGS
       I don't wanna hear about them unless they cause knock-on bugs for Web::ID itself.
