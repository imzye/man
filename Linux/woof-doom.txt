NAME
       woof - Woof! is a continuation of Lee Killough's Doom source port MBF targeted at modern systems

SYNOPSIS
       woof [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       MBF stands for "Marine's Best Friend" and is widely regarded the successor of the Boom source port by TeamTNT. It serves as the code base for popular Doom source ports such as PrBoom+/DSDA-Doom or
       The Eternity Engine. As the original engine was limited to run only under MS-DOS, it has been ported to Windows by Team Eternity under the name WinMBF in 2004. Woof! is developed based on the Win‐
       MBF code with the aim to make MBF more widely available and convenient to use on modern systems.

OBSCURE AND LESS-USED OPTIONS

IWAD SEARCH PATHS
       To  play,  an IWAD file is needed. This is a large file containing all of the levels, graphics, sound effects, music and other material that make up the game. IWAD files are named according to the
       game; the standard names are:

       doom.wad, doom1.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad, plutonia.wad
              Doom, Doom II, Final Doom

       hacx.wad, chex.wad
              Hacx and Chex Quest - more obscure games based on the Doom engine.

       freedm.wad, freedoom1.wad, freedoom2.wad
              The Freedoom open content IWAD files.

       The following directory paths are searched in order to find an IWAD:

       Current working directory
              Any IWAD files found in the current working directory will be used in preference to IWADs found in any other directories.

       DOOMWADDIR
              This environment variable can be set to contain a path to a single directory in which to look for IWAD files. This environment variable is supported by most Doom source ports.

       DOOMWADPATH
              This environment variable, if set, can contain a colon-separated list of directories in which to look for IWAD files, or alternatively full paths to specific IWAD files.

       $HOME/.local/share/games/doom
              Writeable directory in the user's home directory. The path can be overridden using the XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory Specification).

       /usr/local/share/doom, /usr/local/share/games/doom, /usr/share/doom,
              /usr/share/games/doom System-wide locations that can be accessed by all users. The path /usr/share/games/doom is a standard path that is supported by most Doom source ports. These paths can
              be overridden using the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory Specification).

       The above can be overridden on a one-time basis by using the -iwad command line parameter to provide the path to an IWAD file to use. This parameter can also be used to specify the name of a  par‐
       ticular IWAD to use from one of the above paths. For example, '-iwad doom.wad' will search the above paths for the file doom.wad to use.

FILES
       $HOME/.local/share/woof.cfg
              The main configuration file for Woof.  See default.cfg(5).

       $HOME/.local/share/woof/woofsav*.dsg
              Savegame files.

       $HOME/.local/share/woof/tranmap.dat
              Cached translucency table.

       /usr/share/woof/autoload, $HOME/.local/share/woof/autoload/
              WAD files and DEH patches in the subdirectories of these paths are added automatically when a WAD file of the corresponding name is loaded.
