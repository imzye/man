NAME
       trx-rx - real-time audio receiver over IP

SYNOPSIS
       trx-rx [-d DEV] [-m MS] [-h ADDR] [-p PORT] [-j MS] [-r RATE] [-c N] [-v N] [-v FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       trx-rx receives real-time audio over IP and plays it out to an ALSA audio device.

OPTIONS
       -d DEV The alsa device name. Default is 'default'

       -m MS  Set the buffer time. Default is 16 milliseconds

       -h ADDR
              Set the IP address to listen on. Default is ::

       -p PORT
              Set the UDP port to listen on. Default is 1350

       -j MS  Set the jitter buffer length. Default is 16 milliseconds.

       -r RATE
              Set the sample rate. Default is 48000Hz.

       -c N   Set the number of channels. Default is 2.

       -v N   Set the verbosity level. Higher N implies more verbosity. Default is 1.

       -D FILE
              Run the receiver as a daemon, writing the process ID to FILE.

NOTES
       The Debian package has renamed the upstream binary rx to trx-rx as it is less generic and less likely to collide with other packaged binaries.

EXAMPLE
       To receive audio being sent to the local interface with the IP address 239.0.0.1 use the following:

              trx-rx -h 239.0.0.1

                                                                                                                                                           TRX-RX(1)
