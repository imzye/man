NAME
       dbf2mysql, mysql2dbf - convert between xBase and MySQL databases

SYNOPSIS
       dbf2mysql [-v[v]] [-f] [-u|-l|-L] [-n] [-o field[,field]] [-e conversion-file] [-s old-name=new-name[,old-name=new-name]] [-i field[,field]] [-d database] [-t table] [-c[c]] [-p primary] [-h host]
       [-F] [-q] [-r] [-x] [-C charset] [-P password] [-U user] dbf-file

       mysql2dbf [-v[v]] [-u|-l] -d database -t table [-h host] [-q query] [-P password] [-U user] dbf-file

DESCRIPTION
       dbf2mysql takes an xBase file and sends queries to an MySQL server to insert it into an MySQL table.

       mysql2dbf dumps a MySQL table to a dbf file.

OPTIONS
       -v     Produce some status output.

       -vv    More verbose.

       -vvv   Even more verbose: produce a progress report.

       -f     Translate all field names in the xBase file to lowercase.

       -u     Translate all text in the xBase file to uppercase.

       -l     Translate all text in the xBase file to lowercase.

       -L     Use LOCAL INFILE for table loading in MySQL.

       -n     Allow NULL fields: 'NOT NULL' will be not added in table creation statement.

       -o field[,field[,...]]
              List fields to insert into MySQL database.  Primary use is to ease import of complex dbf files where we want only few fields.  NOTE: -o is processed before substitution (-s), so you have to
              use dbf field names here.

       -e conversion-file
              Specify file for CHAR fields conversion.  File format is: 1st line: number of characters to convert (number of lines).  Further lines: <char_to_convert> <char_after_conversion>.

       -s old-name=new-name[,old-name=new-name[,...]]
              Takes  a list of field name/new field name pairs.  Primary use is to avoid conflicts between field names and MySQL reserved keywords.  When the new field name is empty, the field is skipped
              in both the CREATE clause and the INSERT clauses, i.e. it will not be present in the MySQL table.  For example:

              -s ORDER=HORDER,REMARKS=,STAT1=STATUS1

       -i field[,field[,...]]
              List fields to be indexed.  MySQL field names should be used here.

       -d database
              Select the database to insert into.  Default is 'test'.

       -t table
              Select the table to insert into.  Default is 'test'.

       -c[c]  Create table if one doesn't exist already.  If the table already exists, drop it and build a new one.  The default is to insert all data into the named  table.   If  -cc  is  specified,  no
              records will be inserted.

       -p  primary
              Select the primary key.  You have to give the exact field name.

       -h host
              Select the host to insert into.  Untested.

       -F     Fixed length records.  (By default CHAR is saved as VARCHAR.)

       -q     dbf2mysql:  "Quick" mode.  Inserts data via temporary file using 'LOAD DATA INFILE' MySQL statement.  This increased insertion speed on my PC 2-2.5 times.  Also note that during whole 'LOAD
              DATA' affected table is locked.

              mysql2dbf: Specify custom query to use.

       -r     Trim trailing and leading whitespace from CHAR type fields data.

       -x     Start each table with _rec and _timestamp fields.

       -C charset
              Specify the charset to use in table.

       -P password
              Specify password on the MySQL server.

       -U user
              Specify user on the MySQL server.

BUGS
       mysql2dbf can't write MEMO files at this time.

       Possibly incorrect field lengths for REAL numbers.
