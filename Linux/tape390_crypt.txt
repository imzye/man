NAME
       tape390_crypt - encryption support for zSeries tape devices.

SYNOPSIS
       tape390_crypt [OPTION] [DEVICE]

DESCRIPTION
       tape390_crypt exploits encryption features available in zSeries tape devices.  It can be used to enable or disable tape encryption and to set KEK (Key Encrypting Key) labels.

OPTIONS
       -h or --help
              Print help information, then exit.

       -v or --version
              Print version information, then exit.

       -q or --query
              Print  current  encryption status of the specified tape device and of the loaded medium.  If encryption is on and the medium is encrypted , additional information on the encryption keys is dis‐
              played.

       -e {on|off} or --encryption={on|off}
              sets tape encryption on or off.

       -k <value>[<char>label|<char>hash] or --key=<value>[<char>label|<char>hash]
              sets tape encryption keys.
              <value> specifies the KEK (Key Encrypting Key), which can be maximal 64 characters long.
              The store type (either label or hash) specifies how the KEK in <value> is to be stored on the tape medium. Since labels are human readable strings and hence more user friendly than hashes,  the
              default store type is label.
              The -k option can only be specified, if the tape medium is at load point.
              While  processing  the  -k option, the tape medium is initialized and all data eventually contained on the tape medium is lost.  To avoid inadvertent data loss a prompt message is issued asking
              the user whether he or she really wants to proceed.
              The -k option can be specified maximal twice, because on the tape medium maximal two EEDKs (External Encrypted Data Keys) can be stored.  If specified once, two identical EEDKs are stored.
              <char> is a character separating the KEK in <value> from the store type (either label or hash). This delimiter can be specified with the -d option as explained below.

       -d <char> or --delimiter=<char>
              specifies the character which separates the KEK in  <value> from the store type (either label or hash).  The default delimiter is : (colon).  The -d option can only be specified  together  with
              the -k option.

       -f  or --force
              specifies that no prompt message is to be issued before writing the KEK information and initializing the tape medium.  The -f option can only be specified together with the -k option.

       device specifies the device node of the tape device.

EXAMPLES
       1. Scenario:
       mount non-encrypted tape and write data with the default KEKs:
       tape390_crypt -e on /dev/ntibm0
       tar cfz /dev/ntibm0 /data

       2. Scenario:
       mount non-encrypted tape and write data with specific KEKs:
       tape390_crypt -k my_first_key -k my_second_key:hash /dev/ntibm0
       tar cfz /dev/ntibm0 /data

       3. Scenario:
       mount tape and display current encryption status:
       tape390_crypt -q /dev/ntibm0
