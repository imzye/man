NAME
       parmed: - parameter file editor

DESCRIPTION
       usage: parmed [-h] [-v] [-i FILE] [-p <prmtop>] [-c <inpcrd>] [-O] [-l FILE]

              [--prompt PROMPT] [-n] [-e] [-s] [-r] [<prmtop>] [<script>]

   positional arguments:
       <prmtop>
              Topology file to analyze.

       <script>
              File with a series of ParmEd commands to execute.

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --version
              show program's version number and exit

   Input Files:
       -i FILE, --input FILE
              Script with ParmEd commands to execute. Default reads from stdin. Can be specified multiple times to process multiple input files.

       -p <prmtop>, --parm <prmtop>
              List of topology files to load into ParmEd. Can be specified multiple times to process multiple topologies.

       -c <inpcrd>, --inpcrd <inpcrd>
              List of inpcrd files to load into ParmEd. They are paired with the topology files in the same order that each set of files is specified on the command-line.

   Output Files:
       -O, --overwrite
              Allow ParmEd to overwrite existing files.

       -l FILE, --logfile FILE
              Log file with every command executed during an interactive ParmEd session. Default is parmed.log

   Interpreter Options:
              These options affect how the ParmEd interpreter behaves in certain cases.

       --prompt PROMPT
              String to use as a command prompt.

       -n, --no-splash
              Prevent printing the greeting logo.

       -e, --enable-interpreter
              Allow  arbitrary  single Python commands or blocks of Python code to be run. By default Python commands will not be run as a safeguard for your system. Make sure you trust the source of the
              ParmEd command before turning this option on.

   Error Handling:
              These options control how ParmEd handles various errors and warnings that appear occur during the course of Action execution

       -s, --strict
              Prevent scripts from running past unrecognized input and actions that end with an error. In interactive mode, actions with unrecognized inputs and failed actions prevent  any  changes  from
              being made to the topology, but does not quit the interpreter. This is the default behavior.

       -r, --relaxed
              Scripts ignore unrecognized input and simply skip over failed actions, executing the rest of the script.  Unrecognized input in the interactive interpreter emits a non-fatal warning.
