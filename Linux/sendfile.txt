NAME
       sendfile - send file(s) via Internet

SYNOPSIS
       sendfile [ -stMgduzvolSPiqQV ] [ -c=" comment" ] [ -C=program ] [ -ps=[my_ID] ] [ -pe=[to_user] ] [ -m LIMIT ] file [...]  user[@host]

       sendfile -a="archive" [ -uviqQ ] [ -c=" comment" ] [ -C=program ] [ -ps[=my_ID] ] [ -pe[=to_user] ] file_or_directory [...]  recipient

DESCRIPTION
       sendfile sends files to the specified recipient.

       On the receiving site there must be a SAFT-server (Simple Asynchronous File Transfer) installed like sendfiled which stores incoming files into the recipients spool-directory.

       SAFT knows about 4 file types:

       BINARY  Byte-stream file which will not be modified.

       SOURCE  Record oriented program source file. Only EOL will be translated.

       TEXT    Human readable text files. EOL and the character set (like German umlauts) will be translated.

       MIME    Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension file as defined by RFC 2045-2049.

       Files can be sent compressed or pgp-encrypted and/or pgp-signed.  As an extension to SAFT, sendfile is able to send multiple binary files in one archive file.

       Default mode for sendfile is sending compressed binary files. Compression will be disabled for hosts which are inside your LAN and for files which cannot be compressed.

       With the helper program sfconf you can easily configure sendfile.

ARGUMENTS
       You have to specify at least one file name and the recipient's address.  An address can be specified as:

       user
           a local user or a sendfile alias (see below), e.g.: framstag

       user@host
           an user on a remote host, e.g.: framstag@bofh.belwue.de

       saft://host/user
           like above, but in URL-syntax, e.g.: saft://bofh.belwue.de/framstag

       saft://host:port/user
           like above, but with alternate SAFT-port, e.g.: saft://bofh.belwue.de:4870/framstag

OPTIONS
       -4, -6  Explicitly  force IPv4 or IPv6 connections. By default, the program will try to resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol automatically. If resolving a host name re‐
               turns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, sendfile will try to use the adresses in the order they are returned by the resolver.

       -s      Send in source mode (not needed if sending to a unix host).

       -t      Send in text mode (not needed if sending to a unix host).

       -M      Send MIME file (must be external composed before!).

       -g      Send in guessed mode: sendfile tries to guess the correct mode (source, text or binary). This will not work in every case and not on all platforms!

       -i      Print more transaction information.

       -v      Verbose mode: show SAFT protocol messages.

       -V      Show version information and exit.

       -u      Send uncompressed.

       -z      Send compressed.

       -a      Send files or whole directories as one archive (binary mode only).  You have to specify an archive name.

       -d      Delete previous sent file. No wildcards allowed.

       -o      Overwrite already sent file(s) with same name.

       -P      Read file from stdin. You must specify a file name, too.

       -S      Spool file into outgoing queue for later processing. You must run a sendfiled which supports this mode.

       -l      List files in the outgoing spool.

       -q      Quiet mode 1: print no transfer messages.

       -Q      Quiet mode 2: print no transfer, information or warning messages.

       -c      Add a short comment to a single file.

       -C      Force usage of specified compression program (gzip or bzip2).

       -pc     Encrypt file(s) with pgp (IDEA symmetric).

       -pe     Encrypt file(s) with pgp (public key).

       -ps     Add pgp signature(s) to the file(s).

       -m      Limit the maximum thruput (in KB/s).

ARGUMENTS
       user    Recipient user name. Can be an alias, too. See below.

       file    File name to be sent. Only when using the -a="archive" option you may specify any file or directory.

EXAMPLES
       sendfile -t project.txt chief@bigvax.somewhere.net
       sendfile -a=jokes -c 'from Gary Larson' *.gif framstag

FILES
       /etc/sendfile.deny
             Users which are not allowed to receive files or messages (set by root).

       /var/spool/sendfile/$USER/config/config
             Your configuration file. Valid entries are (the | symbol means " or"):

                bell = on|off

             add a bell when a file or message arrives.

                deleting = on|off

             allow remote users to delete their files after transmission

                msglog = on|off

             log incoming messages in /var/spool/sendfile/$USER/msglog

                notification = none|both|mail [user@host]|message [user@host]

             send a notification when a file has been arrived via mail or message or none or both mechanism.

                forward = user@host

             set a forward address.

       /var/spool/sendfile/$USER/config/restrictions
             List of addresses from where you don't want messages or files. The format is:

                user@host [mfb]

             m stands for messages, f for files and b for both. Wildcards * and ? are allowed. Examples:

                gates@microsoft.com b
                *aol.com m

             You may also specify the addresses in URL-syntax.

       /var/spool/sendfile/$USER/config/aliases
             The sendfile alias file. Format:

                alias address [sendfile-options]

             Example:

                chief grmblfz@bigvax.somewhere.net
                ccc chaoscomputerclub@saft.ccc.de -pe -ps

             You may also specify the addresses in URL-syntax.
