NAME
       gant - console based ANT+ information retrieval client for Garmin GPS products

SYNOPSIS
       gant [ OPTIONS ]

DESCRIPTION
       gant is a small command-line utility to retrieve information (sports tracks, etc.) from Garmin GPS products over the wireless ANT/ANT+ protocols. Currently supported devices are the Forerunner 405.

OPTIONS
       -a authfile
              Provide authfile (default ~/.gant).

       -f name
              Assign a name to the ANT device. (default garmin)

       -d devno
              ttyUSB devno Device no. (default 0)

       -i id  ID for pairing (default random)

       -m mydev
              (default 0)

       -p     Passive

       -v     Verbose

       -D level
              Debug

       -r     Reset the device

       -n     Do not write auth file

       -z     Do not pair

   Help options
       -h     Show command line options.

EXAMPLE 1
       Put 405 in pairing mode gant -f paul -a auth405

       This gives your garmin a name of "paul" and an auth file of "auth405" The 405 will ask you if you wish to pair with "paul". Obviously you might want to use a different name :)

       Download with: gant -nza auth405 > output

       or -Dnza if you want lots of debug output

       It  doesn't  seem to be very reliable at starting the download and I haven't investigated why yet. So, if it doesn't start downloading press ctrl-c and try again. I find it helps to take the watch out
       of power save mode.

       If you've already downloaded the data, then you'll need to set "force send" to yes on the watch.

       Compare output with .TCX file produce by windows ANT Agent.

EXAMPLE 2
            HOWTO USE gant

       1. plugin your ANT+ stick 2. the system will load the kernel module "cp210x" 3. to find out what ttyUSB device is used run

              # dmesg|grep "cp210x converter"
              [...] cp210x 3-1:1.0: cp210x converter detected
              [...] usb 3-1: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB3

       In this case you have to use the optione "-d 3". If it is ttyUSB0 then you don't need the -d option because 0 is the default 4. put the watch into paring mode (menu -> configuration -> ANT+ ->
          computer -> pairing on) 5. pair the computer with the watch ("mywatch" as name for the watch and
          the file "auth405" as an authorization file which will be created)

              # gant -d 3 -f mywatch -a auth405

       6. download saved tracks from the watch

              # gant -d 3 -f mywatch -nza auth405

       You get the possible options with

              # gant -h

       To convert the downloaded TCX file (e.g. 2011-07-22-123456.tcx) you can use gpsbabel:

              # gpsbabel -t -i gtrnctr -f 2011-07-22-123456.tcx -o gpx -F 2011-07-22-123456.gpx

DEVICES
       Wireless ANT communications happens over a USB2ANT dongle. Under Linux the dongle is driven by cp210x kernel module, and presented to user-space as a USB serial port, /dev/ttyUSBxxx where  xxx  is  an
       integer. The dongle is typically carrying the USB vendor id/product id pair of 0fcf/1004 or 0fcf/1008. Recent Linux systems employ udev to handle device nodes and permissions, thus appropriate

FILES
       /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.ko
              Kernel driver module for USB2ANT dongle.

       /dev/ttyUSBxxx
              Serial device created for dongle.

       $HOME/.gant
              Default authentication file.
