NAME
       table_socketmap — format description for smtpd socketmap tables

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the file format of "socketmap" tables used by the smtpd(8) mail daemon.

       The format described here applies to tables as defined in smtpd.conf(5).

SOCKETMAP TABLE
       A "socketmap" table uses a simple protocol.  The client sends a single-line request and the server sends a single-line reply.

       The table may be used for any kind of key-based lookup and replies are expected to follow the formats described in table(5).
