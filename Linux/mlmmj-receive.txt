mlmmj-receive(1)            General Commands Manual           mlmmj-receive(1)

NAME
       mlmmj-receive - receive mails for an mlmmj managed mailinglist

SYNOPSIS
       mlmmj-receive -L /path/to/listdir [-h] [-V] [-P] [-F]

       -h: This help

       -F: Don't fork in the background (debugging only)

       -L: Full path to list directory

       -P: Don't execute mlmmj-process (debugging only)

       -V: Print version

DESCRIPTION
       The mlmmj-receive binary is the one specified in the mailserver config‐
       uration file (aliases file),  which  writes  the  mail  to  the  <list‐
       dir>/incoming  directory and invokes mlmmj-process unless the -P option
       is specified. On systems using mailservers supporting the  /etc/aliases
       file,  a  line to activate an mlmmj managed mailinglist would look like
       this:

       list: "|/usr/bin/mlmmj-receive -L /var/spool/mlmmj/list/"

       It's very important to specify the full path  to  the  binary,  or  the
       mailinglist will not function.

       When  the  -F  option  is used, it will not fork in the background. The
       reason it forks is that if delivery of a mail takes  longer  time  than
       the  mail  server will allow a command to be idle before presumed dead,
       the mail server would kill it.
