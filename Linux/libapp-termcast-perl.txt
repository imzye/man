NAME
       stream_ttyrec - play a ttyrec to a termcast channel

VERSION
       version 0.13

SYNOPSIS
         stream_ttyrec [options] [ttyrec_file]

DESCRIPTION
       This program will stream a ttyrec file to the given termcast channel. The ttyrec file may be given on the command line, or it will be read from STDIN.  See App::Termcast for options documentation.

       This program also accepts some additional options:

       "--speed <n>"
           Set a multiplier for how fast the ttyrec should be played back ("--speed 2" means twice as fast).

       "--clamp <n>"
           Set the maximum delay between any two frames in the ttyrec. If unset, there is no maximum (the ttyrec will be streamed as written).

       "--nowait"
           Disable all delays between frames (equivalent to "--clamp 0").

       "--peek"
           "Peek" at a ttyrec that is currently being written. This will seek to the end of the file and stream new ttyrec frames as they become available.
