NAME
        icewmbg - a background settings manager for the IceWM window manager

SYNOPSIS
       icewmbg [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       icewmbg can assign a colour or image to the X11 desktop background.  Many image formats are supported.  Each icewm(1) work space can have its own background.

       When the background image has changed then icewmbg can be notified to update the background.  When switching work spaces it checks the image file modification time.  If the file has changed then it
       reloads the background image from file.

       icewmbg supports semi-transparency.  Semitransparent background images and colours can be configured.  If these are not specified then the default background is used.

       It uses XINERAMA and RANDR to support backgrounds on all connected monitors.  When monitors appear/disappear or change their resolution icewmbg will adjust.  It supports an option for one large
       background over all monitors.

       It will update the "_ICEWMBG_IMAGE" property of the root window to the path of the background image whenever it changes the desktop background.

       It should be started before icewm(1), preferably by the icewm-session(1) program.

OPTIONS
   SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Where multiple values can be given for images or colours they are separated by commas.  Each such value may be enclosed in double quotes.  When FILE is a directory then all images from that directory
       are used in sorted order.  If the value starts with an exclamation mark, as in !FILE, then the images from the directory FILE are permuted randomly.  Image file names or directory names may have
       wildcards, which will be expanded according to glob(7).

       -p, --replace
           Replace an existing icewmbg. If there is a running icewmbg it is instructed to quit.  The new icewmbg will take over.

       -q, --quit
           Tell the running icewmbg to quit. This option is used by icewm-session(1) when icewm(1) exits.

       -r, --restart
           Tell the running icewmbg to restart itself.  This is useful when a background file or directory has changed or when settings in preferences files have changed.

       -u, --shuffle
           Shuffle the list of background images randomly.  This option may be given again whenever the running icewmbg should reshuffle its list of background images.

       -c, --config=FILE
           Load preferences from FILE.

       -t, --theme=THEME
           Load the theme named THEME.

       -i, --image=FILE[,FILE]*
           Load background images from each FILE.  This overrules the "DesktopBackgroundImage" preference.

       -k, --color=COLOR[,COLOR]*
           Use background colours from each COLOR.  This overrules the "DesktopBackgroundColor" preference.

       -s, --semis=FILE[,FILE]*
           Load transparency images from each FILE.  This overrules the "DesktopTransparencyImage" preference.

       -x, --trans=NAME[,NAME]
           Use transparency colours for each NAME.  This overrules the "DesktopTransparencyColor" preference.

       -e, --center={0|1}
           Disable/Enable centring background.  This overrules the "DesktopBackgroundCenter" preference.

       -a, --scaled={0|1}
           Disable/Enable scaling background.  This overrules the "DesktopBackgroundScaled" preference.

       -m, --multi={0|1}
           Disable/Enable multi-head background.  This overrules the "DesktopBackgroundMultihead" preference.

       -y, --cycle=SECONDS
           Cycle over the list of background images every SECONDS.  This overrules the "CycleBackgroundsPeriod" preference.

       -d, --display=DISPLAY
           Use DISPLAY to connect to the X server.  If this option is missing then DISPLAY is read from the environment variable "DISPLAY".

       --sync
           Use a slower synchronous mode communication with X11 server.

   GENERAL OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Print a brief usage statement to stdout and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print the program version to stdout and exit.

       -C, --copying
           Print copying permissions to stdout for the program and exit.

FILES
   PREFERENCES
       By default icewmbg will load the background settings from the icewm(1) preferences files (see icewm-preferences(5)).  The settings read are:

         DesktopBackgroundCenter    - Display desktop background centered
         DesktopBackgroundScaled    - Display desktop background scaled
         DesktopBackgroundColor     - Desktop background color(s)
         DesktopBackgroundImage     - Desktop background image(s)
         ShuffleBackgroundImages    - Shuffle the list of background images
         SupportSemitransparency    - Support for semitransparent terminals
         DesktopTransparencyColor   - Semitransparency background color(s)
         DesktopTransparencyImage   - Semitransparency background image(s)
         DesktopBackgroundMultihead - One background over all monitors
         CycleBackgroundsPeriod     - Seconds between cycling over backgrounds

       First these settings are read from the preferences file.  Then the theme file from the current theme is read, which may overrule the preferences settings.  Lastly the prefoverride file is read, which
       overrides again.  Therefore, if you want to allow the theme to set the background use preferences for your settings, otherwise use prefoverride.  See icewm-prefoverride(5).

   SCALING
       Often a background image has a different width or height than the screen.  The settings can specify to centre ("DesktopBackgroundCenter") or scale ("DesktopBackgroundScaled") an image.  Either option
       is either 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled).  What happens for their combination is given by the following table:

         center:0 scaled:0 = the background is replicated in both directions
         center:1 scaled:0 = the background is centered, but not scaled
         center:1 scaled:1 = fill one dimension and preserve the aspect ratio
         center:0 scaled:1 = fill both dimensions and preserve the aspect ratio

SIGNALS
       icewmbg supports the following signals:

       SIGHUP
           icewmbg will restart itself.

       SIGINT, SIGTERM
           icewmbg will terminate.

       SIGUSR1
           icewmbg will reshuffle the list of background images and update the backgrounds of all work spaces.
