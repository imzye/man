NAME
       solarwolf - Collect the boxes and don't become mad

SYNOPSIS
       solarwolf

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the solarwolf command.

       solarwolf  is  an  action/arcade game written entirely in Python.  It is is originally based on the SolarFox game on the Atari 2600.  The point of the game is to scramble through 60 levels of pat‐
       terns, collecting all the boxes. The part that makes it tricky is avoiding the relentless hailstorm of fire coming at you from all directions.  You can use the "-window" and/or "-nosound" flags to
       force some of the options from the command line.
