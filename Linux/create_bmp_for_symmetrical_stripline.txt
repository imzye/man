NAME
       create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline - bitmap generator for thin conductor between two infinite groundplanes (part of atlc)

SYNOPSIS
       create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline [-v] W H w bitmapfile

WARNING
       This  man  page  is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages are produced.  The
       best documentation that was current at the time the version was produced should be found on your hard drive, usually at
       /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
       although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors are corrected in the documentation and placed at http://atlc.sourceforge.net/  be‐
       fore a new release of atlc is released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

DESCRIPTION
       create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline  is  a  pre-processor for atlc, the finite difference program that is used to calculate the properties of a two-conductor electrical transmission line of arbitrary
       cross section. The program create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline is used as a fast way of generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics program), for a 1 pixel thick conductor of width w, cen‐
       trally  located  inside  a pair of groundplanes of width W and separation H. This has an exact analytical answer, when the inner is infinitely thin and the width W is infinitely wide. This theoretical
       impedance is also calculated by the create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline. It is therefore used as a test of atlc.

       The parameters 'W' and 'H' and the inner dimensions of the outer conductor.  The outer dimensions of the inner conductor are 'w' and 'c'. The inner conductor is assumed to rest on a  dielectric  (Er2)
       which  is  'd' wide and outer conductor an the inner conductor is offset 'b' from the left hand sidewall of the outer conductor. The whole region is surrounded by a dielectric of relative permittivity
       'Er1'. The dielectrics 'Er1' and then 'Er1' and 'Er2' will both be 1.0

       The bitmaps produced by create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline are 24-bit bit colour bitmaps, as are required by atlc. Currently create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline only  produces  bitmaps  with  white
       (vacuum) dielectrics.

OPTIONS
       -v
       Print the theoeretical impedance Zo. This only works if the width W is sufficiently wide, otherwise atlc and the value printed here would disagree wildly.
