NAME
       inotifywatch - gather filesystem access statistics using inotify

SYNOPSIS
       inotifywatch  [-hvzrqf] [-e <event> ] [-t <seconds> ] [-a <event> ] [-d
       <event> ] <file> [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       inotifywatch listens for filesystem  events  using  Linux's  inotify(7)
       interface,  then outputs a summary count of the events received on each
       file or directory.

OUTPUT
       inotifywatch will output a table on standard out with  one  column  for
       each type of event and one row for each watched file or directory.  The
       table will show the amount  of  times  each  event  occurred  for  each
       watched  file or directory.  Output can be sorted by a particular event
       using the -a or -d options.

       Some diagnostic information will be output on standard error.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output some helpful usage information.

       -v, --verbose
              Output some extra information on standard  error  during  execu‐
              tion.

       @<file>
              When  watching  a directory tree recursively, exclude the speci‐
              fied file from being watched.  The file must be specified with a
              relative  or  absolute  path  according to whether a relative or
              absolute path is given for watched directories.  If  a  specific
              path is explicitly both included and excluded, it will always be
              watched.

              Note: If you need to watch a directory or file whose name starts
              with @, give the absolute path.

       --fromfile <file>
              Read filenames to watch or exclude from a file, one filename per
              line.  If filenames begin with @ they are excluded as  described
              above.   If  <file>  is  `-',  filenames  are read from standard
              input.  Use this option if you need to watch too many  files  to
              pass in as command line arguments.

       -z, --zero
              Output table rows and columns even if all elements are zero.  By
              default, rows and columns are only output if they  contain  non-
              zero  elements.  Using this option when watching for every event
              on a lot of files can result in a lot of output!

       --exclude <pattern>
              Do not process any events whose filename matches  the  specified
              POSIX extended regular expression, case sensitive.

       --excludei <pattern>
              Do  not  process any events whose filename matches the specified
              POSIX extended regular expression, case insensitive.

       -r, --recursive
              Watch all subdirectories of any directories passed as arguments.
              Watches  will be set up recursively to an unlimited depth.  Sym‐
              bolic links are not traversed.  If new directories  are  created
              within watched directories they will automatically be watched.

              Warning:  If  you use this option while watching the root direc‐
              tory of a large tree, it may take quite a while until  all  ino‐
              tify watches are established, and events will not be received in
              this time.  Also, since one inotify watch  will  be  established
              per subdirectory, it is possible that the maximum amount of ino‐
              tify watches per user will be reached.  The default  maximum  is
              8192;  it  can  be  increased  by  writing  to /proc/sys/fs/ino‐
              tify/max_user_watches.

       -t <seconds>, --timeout <seconds>
              Listen only for the specified amount of seconds.  If not  speci‐
              fied,  inotifywatch  will  gather  statistics until receiving an
              interrupt signal by (for example) pressing CONTROL-C at the con‐
              sole.

       -e <event>, --event <event>
              Listen for specific event(s) only.  The events which can be lis‐
              tened for are listed in the EVENTS section.  This option can  be
              specified  more  than once.  If omitted, all events are listened
              for.

       -a <event>, --ascending <event>
              Sort output ascending by event counts for the  specified  event.
              Sortable events include `total' and all the events listed in the
              EVENTS  section  except  `move'  and  `close'  (you   must   use
              `moved_to',   `moved_from',   `close_write'  or  `close_nowrite'
              instead).  The default is to sort descending by `total'.

       -d <event>, --descending <event>
              Sort output descending by event counts for the specified  event.
              Sortable events include `total' and all the events listed in the
              EVENTS  section  except  `move'  and  `close'  (you   must   use
              `moved_to',   `moved_from',   `close_write'  or  `close_nowrite'
              instead).  The default is to sort descending by `total'.

EXIT STATUS
       0      The program executed successfully.

       1      An error occurred in execution of the program.

EVENTS
       The following events are valid for use with the -e option:

       access A watched file or a file within a  watched  directory  was  read
              from.

       modify A  watched file or a file within a watched directory was written
              to.

       attrib The metadata of a watched file or a file within a watched direc‐
              tory  was modified.  This includes timestamps, file permissions,
              extended attributes etc.

       close_write
              A watched file or a file within a watched directory was  closed,
              after being opened in writeable mode.  This does not necessarily
              imply the file was written to.

       close_nowrite
              A watched file or a file within a watched directory was  closed,
              after being opened in read-only mode.

       close  A  watched file or a file within a watched directory was closed,
              regardless of how it was opened.  Note  that  this  is  actually
              implemented   simply  by  listening  for  both  close_write  and
              close_nowrite, hence all close events received will be output as
              one of these, not CLOSE.

       open   A watched file or a file within a watched directory was opened.

       moved_to
              A  file  or  directory was moved into a watched directory.  This
              event occurs even if the file is simply moved from  and  to  the
              same directory.

       moved_from
              A  file  or  directory was moved from a watched directory.  This
              event occurs even if the file is simply moved from  and  to  the
              same directory.

       move   A  file  or  directory was moved from or to a watched directory.
              Note that this is actually implemented simply by  listening  for
              both  moved_to  and  moved_from, hence all close events received
              will be output as one or both of these, not MOVE.

       move_self
              A watched file or directory was moved.  After  this  event,  the
              file or directory is no longer being watched.

       create A file or directory was created within a watched directory.

       delete A file or directory within a watched directory was deleted.

       delete_self
              A  watched  file or directory was deleted.  After this event the
              file or directory is no longer being watched.   Note  that  this
              event can occur even if it is not explicitly being listened for.

       unmount
              The  filesystem on which a watched file or directory resides was
              unmounted.  After this event the file or directory is no  longer
              being watched.  Note that this event can occur even if it is not
              explicitly being listened to.

EXAMPLE
       Watching the `~/.beagle' directory for 60 seconds:

       % inotifywatch -v -e access -e modify -t 60 -r ~/.beagle
       Establishing watches...
       Setting up watch(es) on /home/rohan/.beagle
       OK, /home/rohan/.beagle is now being watched.
       Total of 302 watches.
       Finished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.
       Will listen for events for 60 seconds.

BUGS
       There are race conditions in  the  recursive  directory  watching  code
       which  can cause events to be missed if they occur in a directory imme‐
       diately after that directory is created.  This is probably not fixable.

       It is assumed the inotify event queue will never overflow.
