NAME
       imapproxyd - IMAP proxy daemon

SYNOPSIS
       imapproxyd [ -f <config file name> ] [ -p <pidfile name> ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the imapproxyd command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       IMAP Proxy proxies IMAP transactions between an IMAP client and an IMAP server. The general idea is that the client should never know that it is not talking to the real IMAP server, but IMAP Proxy
       caches server connections.

       IMAP  Proxy  was  written  to compensate for webmail clients that are unable  to maintain persistent connections to an IMAP server. Most webmail clients need to log in to an IMAP server for nearly
       every single transaction; This behaviour can cause tragic performance problems on the IMAP server.  IMAP Proxy tries to deal with this problem by leaving server connections open for a  short  time
       after a webmail client logs out. When the webmail client connects again, IMAP Proxy will determine if there is a cached connection available and reuse it if possible.

FILES
       By default, IMAP Proxy reads /etc/imapproxy.conf on startup.  This can be changed by using the -f option

       Unless foreground_mode has been enabled, IMAP Proxy will write its PID to to a PID-file. It defaults to /run/imapproxy.pid, but can be overridden with the -p option
