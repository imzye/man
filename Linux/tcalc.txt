NAME
       tcalc - The terminal calculator

SYNOPSIS
       tcalc [OPTIONS] [file-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The  terminal calculator is a small and helpful program to help users of the GNU/Linux terminal do calculations simply and quickly. The formula to be calculated can be fed to tcalc through the command
       line. Alternatively, tcalc can be run with no formula and then the free mode is started, in which the calculator will wait for user input, do the necessary calculations and print out the  result,  and
       the cycle will repeat until the user enters 'q' or 'quit'.

       The  calculator  works  with the decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary number systems. It automatically identifies hex numbers if entered with a preceding "0x" or "0X", octal by preceding the number
       with a zero, binaries by preceding the number with 'b' and decimals by absence of all of the above.  Alternatively, the user can indicate the type of input by setting the 'format'  argument  (See  be‐
       low).

         ceil(x)        Smallest integral value not less than X
         floor(x)       Largest integer not greater than X
         fabs(x)        Absolute value of X
         round(x)       Round X to nearest integral value, rounding halfway cases away
                        from zero
         trunc(x)       Round X to the integral value in floating-point format nearest
                        but not larger in magnitude
       These functions can be called within a formula. to have a printout of the above list, use the "-m" or "--math" flags (see below).

       The free mode:
       --------------
       If  you start tcalc with no command line formula and no input file, this will invoke the free mode. You will see a '>' prompt indicating this mode. Enter your formulas one by one, ending each one with
       an ENTER, and tcalc will process the formula and output the result. You can enter other commands like

       User-defined functions:
       -----------------------
       To define a user function, invoke tcalc with no formulas or input files (you can pass arguments like 'output' or 'decimal'), and then enter at the prompt:

       > func your-function-name(list of arguments)

       The prompt will change to '->' indicating you are in function definition mode.  To exit this mode, type 'q' or 'quit'. Function names are currently limited to ten characters length. If you don't  want
       to  pass arguments to the function, ignore the list of arguments and the braces, just type 'func your-function-name' and press enter. Of course you will substitute 'your-function-name' with the actual
       name of the function!.

       If defining functions in files, you should enclose the function body with curly braces, as:

       func myfunc
       {
         statement-1
         statement-2
         ...
       }
       other statements...

       You can also define variables inside functions. By default, variables are initiated for the number of arguments you specify in the function declaration.  If you need to declare  other  variables,  use
       the  'var'  command  from  the free mode or from inside a formula file. Note that variable names are strictly composed of lower-case latin letters "a"-"z", and must not start with a "b" (as tcalc uses
       this letter to identify binary numbers!).

       Input files:
       ------------
       The calculator also supports input through pretyped files. Use the '-i' or function definitions and formulas to be calculated. The tcalc will process the file and output the results. Files can contain
       comments.  Commented  line  is defined as a line that starts with a hash (#). Tcalc will ignore any lines in which the hash appears. A sample file is installed with the package in the If you intend to
       pass your input file to the calculator through redirection (i.e. 'tcalc < test' if your file name is 'test') you should end your file with 'end' or 'quit' so the calculator will know where  the  input
       stops, otherwise it will enter an infinite loop, repeating the last command for ever!.

OPTIONS
       Formula
              Formula to be calculated. Examples:
                5+4
                0xff*0x23
                b111-b01
                7*0xf
                (6+5)*7
                ... and so on

       -c, --convert n
              Convert n to the output format specified by '-o' below, or to decimal if no format is specified

       -d, --decimal n
              How many digits are shown to the right of the decimal point

       -f, --format n
              Input format, possible values are:
                 * binary (b)
                 * hex (x)
                 * decimal (d)
                 * octal (o)
              Input format is usually automatically identified. This feature is provided only for convenience.
