NAME
       plowshare.conf - Configuration file for Plowshare

DESCRIPTION
       Plowshare  (plowdown,  plowup, plowdel, plowlist or plowprobe) uses a configuration file called plowshare.conf for its initial setup. This configuration file
       is searched for in the following places when plowshare is started:

           ~/.config/plowshare/plowshare.conf
           /etc/plowshare.conf

       Instead of specifying long command lines with user's preferences (credentials, network settings or download retry number, ...), it is convenient to make them
       default.

       Note: Usage of configuration file can be disabled using --no-plowsharerc command-line option. There is also --plowsharerc=FILE option to specify an alternate
       configuration file.

FILE FORMAT
       plowshare.conf file uses an INI-style format. It is composed of six sections which may be present in any order. Each section may contain lines of the form:

           [General]
               token = value
               ...
           [Plowdown]
               token = value
               ...
           [Plowup]
               token = value
               ...
           [Plowdel]
               token = value
               ...
           [Plowlist]
               token = value
               ...
           [Plowprobe]
               token = value
               ...

           # this is a comment

       Notes:

       • Sections are unordered.

       • Blank lines or lines beginning with a hash character ('#') are treated as comments and ignored.

       • Whitespace before and after a token or value is ignored (although a value can contain whitespace within).

       • Double quoting value is optional. Use them to preserve leading and trailing whitespace.

       Valid tokens are always lowercase.  Names are long-option command-line arguments of plowshare. For example: temp-directory for  plowdown.   For  modules  op‐
       tions, tokens are prepended by module name and a slash character. For example: rapidgator/auth (short-option are also possible here).

       For values, no backslash interpretation is made. "\t" is a regular string with two characters, it is not a tab character.

       Options in general section prevail over Plow* section. Options given on the command line prevail over configuration file options.
