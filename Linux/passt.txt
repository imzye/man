NAME
       qrap - temporary qemu wrapper connecting UNIX domain socket to file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       qrap [FDNUM QEMU_CMD] [QEMU_ARG]...

DESCRIPTION
       qrap is a wrapper, designed specifically for usage with qemu(1) and passt(1), connecting a UNIX domain socket to a file descriptor, and running qemu(1) with given arguments.

       A running instance of passt(1) is probed checking for UNIX domain sockets, answering a dummy ARP request, with names starting from /tmp/passt_1.socket up to /tmp/passt_64.socket.

       If  first  and  second  arguments  are not a socket number and a command, that is, respectively, FDNUM and QEMU_CMD, qrap will try to locate a qemu executable in PATH and patch the command line to
       specify a network device and a netdev back-end for usage with passt(1).

       If qrap patches the command line, it will remove any potentially conflicting network device, that is, any -netdev or -net option, or any -device option with argument starting with virtio-net-pci,,
       virtio-net-ccw,, e1000,, e1000e,, or rtl8139,.

EXAMPLES
       Start qemu explicitly passing its command name and a socket number
              $ ./qrap 5 kvm test.qcow2 -m 1024 -display none -nodefaults -nographic -net socket,fd=5 -net nic,model=virtio

       Start qemu without command name and socket number, patching arguments
              $ ./qrap test.qcow2 -m 1024 -display none -nodefaults -nographic

NOTES
       This wrapper is temporary: qemu commit 13c6be96618c ("net: stream: add unix socket") introduces native AF_UNIX socket support, and it should be included in qemu starting from the 7.2  release.  It
       will be around for a little bit longer to give users enough time to switch.
