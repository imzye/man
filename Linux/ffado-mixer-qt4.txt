NAME
       ffado-mixer - a graphical front-end for the FFADO mixer DBus controls exposed by ffado-dbus-server.

SYNOPSIS
       ffado-mixer [options]

       Available options: [-b]

DESCRIPTION
       ffado-mixer  presents  a graphical application allowing a FFADO device to be controlled.  The extent of the control is determined by the level of support for the device in FFADO and in ffado-dbus-
       server.  Typical controls offered by ffado-mixer include faders for the on-board mixer, phantom power control, mode switches and so on.

OPTIONS
       -b     Do not query ffado-dbus-server for an active interface.  Instead, create an instance of a mixer for every supported interface as defined in FFADO's "configuration" file with stubs providing
              placeholder values in place of settings obtained from the interface.  This is primarily to assist with debugging.
