NAME
       mma-libdoc  - maintain mma library files.

SYNOPSIS
       mma-libdoc

DESCRIPTION
       mma-libdoc updates and maintains the HTML documentation for the MMA library. It is recommended for use by those adding 3rd party files to the lib tree.

       If  you have already downloaded and installed MMA, the HTML documentation should be installed on your system. The documentation for the library files is in /usr/local/share/mma/docs/html/lib, or a
       similar location depending on your installation and system.

       If you add or modify the library files you can simply run mma-libdoc and the library documentation will be updated.

       Note: To run this program 'root' privileges may be needed. This
            depends on your installation and operating system.

       When mma-libdoc is run it will check the installation and install or update the docs in the root tree where mma is installed.

Caveats
       Old/unused HTML files are NOT deleted. So, if you move files around or delete .mma files you can end up with a number of unused files. Just delete the whole bunch every once in awhile  if  it  be‐
       comes a problem.

       The  program  assumes that you already have the html documentation installed. So, it doesn't do a very good job of creating the complete directory tree. If you find that you get an error right off
       the top of program you will need to create the directories by hand. Assuming you have installed in /usr/local/share/mma a command like:

              mkdir -p /usr/local/share/mma/docs/html/lib

       Depending on how your system is set up you will most likely need to be be the root user for any of this to work. If you get "permission" or "access denied" errors, run as root or fix  the  permis‐
       sions.
