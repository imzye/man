NAME
       nginx-upgrade - tool to upgrade nginx without any downtime

SYNOPSIS
       nginx-upgrade

DESCRIPTION
       This downstream shell script updates nginx without any downtime. After
       upgrading nginx via the package manager, running this script will
       create a new nginx master. This master takes over all new requests. The
       old masters and workers are then gracefully shutdown without breaking
       any existing connections.

       For further information, see: <http://nginx.org/en/docs/control.html>
