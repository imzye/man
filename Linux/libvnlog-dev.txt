NAME
       vnl-gen-header - create definition for vnlog output from C

SYNOPSIS
        $ vnl-gen-header 'int w' 'uint8_t x' 'char* y' 'double z' > vnlog_fields_generated.h

DESCRIPTION
       We provide a simple C library to produce vnlog output. The fields this library outputs must be known at compile time, and are specified in a header created by this tool. Please see the vnlog
       documentation for instructions on how to use the library

ARGUMENTS
       This tool needs to be given a list of field definitions. First we look at the commandline, and if the definitions are not available there, we look on STDIN.  Each definition is a string "type
       name" (one def per argument on the commandline or per line on STDIN). If reading from STDIN, we ignore blank lines, and treat any line starting with "#" as a comment.

       Each def represents a single output field. Each such field spec in a C-style variable declaration with a type followed by a name. Note that these field specs contain whitespace, so each one must
       be quoted before being passed to the shell.

       The types can be basic scalars, possibly with set widths ("char", "double", "int", "uint32_t", "unsigned int", ...), a NULL-terminated string ("char*") or a generic chunk of binary data ("void*").

       The names must consist entirely of letters, numbers or "_", like variables in C.
