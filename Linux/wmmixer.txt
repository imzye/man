NAME
       wmmixer - A mixer application designed for WindowMaker

DESCRIPTION
       wmmixer  is  a  mixer application designed for WindowMaker, although there is nothing in the program that makes it require WindowMaker, except maybe the NeXTStep look and the fact that it properly
       docks. It can be used with other window managers without problems.

SYNOPSIS
       wmmixer [options]

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ('--'). A summary of options is included below.

       -d, --display <string>
              Attempt to open a window on the named X display. In the absence of  this option the  display  specified  by the DISPLAY environment variable is used.

       -g, --geometry <string>
              geometry to use, e.g. +100+100 to place it at 100/100

       -h, --help
              show help text and exit.

       -v, --version
              show program version and exit.

       -w, --withdrawn
              run the application in withdrawn mode. This is for use with WindowMaker or other window managers supporting docks (e.g. KDE)

       -a, --afterstep
              use smaller window (for AfterStep Wharf)

       -s, --shaped
              shaped window

       -l, --led-color <string>
              use the specified color for led, e.g. red, green, blue (default: green)

       -L, --led-highcolor <string>
              use the specified color for led-shading, e.g. red, green, blue (default: red)

       -b, --back-color <string>
              use the specified color for backgrounds, e.g. red, green, blue

       -m, --mix-device <string>
              use specified device (rather than /dev/mixer)

       -r, --scrollwheel <number>
              Set the volume increase/decrease when using the mouse wheel (default: 2)

       For backward compatibility the following obsolete options are still supported:

       -help  show help text and exit.

       -display
              attempt to open a window on the named X display

       -position
              geometry to use, e.g. +100+100 to place it at 100/100

USAGE
       All available channels on your soundcard's mixer are accessible with wmmixer. Most common channels are identified with an appropriate icon.  Controls include a stereo (mono where appropriate) vol‐
       ume control and a recording source toggle button.

       Press the "<" and ">" arrow buttons to select a channel.  The icon identifies the current channel (a volume symbol with a question mark represents an unrecognised channel).  Click and/or drag  the
       volume display to set channel volume.  There is a also a button to set recording sources.

CONFIGURATION
       Users  can  configure  wmmixer  to suit their requirements by means of a ~/.wmmixer file. A commented example can be found in /usr/share/doc/wmmixer on Debian systems, and would be a good starting
       point
