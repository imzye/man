              The 'starch-diff' utility compares the signatures of two or more specified Starch v2.2+ archives for all chromosomes, or for a specified chromosome.

              The typical output of 'starch-diff' is a message indicating that the archives' chromosome(s) are identical or dissimilar, written to the standard error stream.

              In  addition,  if  all chromosomes are identical, 'starch-diff' exits with a zero status code. Likewise, if any chromosomes are dissimilar, 'starch-diff' exits with a non-zero status code. This
              facilitates testing in a scripting environment.
