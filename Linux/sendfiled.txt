NAME
       sendfiled - Simple Asynchronous File Transfer server

SYNOPSIS
       sendfiled [ -4 | -6 ] [ -d ] [ -f ] [ -q ] [ -Q ] [ -c configfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       sendfiled  is a server process (daemon) for the Simple Asynchrnous File Transfer (SAFT) protocol. The server is normally called by inetd (8) and receives files or messages sent by SAFT-clients to the.
       Files are stored in the recipient's spool and messages are written to the recipient's terminals.

       The -4 and -6 options explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 connections. By default, the program will try to resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol automatically. If resolving a host name
       returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, sendfiled will try to use the adresses in the order they are returned by the resolver.

       If the -d option is specified, debugging information is written to /var/log/sendfiled.dbg.

       If the -f option is specified, sendfiled prints the free disk space on /var/spool/sendfile and terminates.

       If the -q option is specified, sendfiled processes once the outgoing spool and terminates.

       If the -Q option is specified, sendfiled starts an outgoing spool daemon, which runs in an endless loop in the background.

       On startup sendfiled reads its configuration file /etc/sendfile.cf, but you can specify with -c configfile an alternate configuration file.

       sendfiled is also an O-SAFT server, which means authenticated clients can fetch files. See fetchfile (4) for details.

       sfdconf is the sendfiled configuration helper program. It has its own usage help, just type sfdconf -h

FILES
       /etc/sendfile.deny
             Users which are not allowed to receive files or messages.

       /etc/sendfile.allow
             Users which are ONLY allowed to receive files or messages. If this file has at least one entry, then /etc/sendfile.deny will be ignored.

       /etc/sendfile.aliases
             Alias names for local users. Format is:
                alias realname

       /var/spool/sendfile/LOG/in
             Log file for incoming files.

       /var/spool/sendfile/LOG/out
             Log file for outgoing files.

       /etc/sendfile.cf
             The system configuration file. See sfdconf -i config for a complete description and default values.
