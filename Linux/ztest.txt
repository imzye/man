NAME
       ztest - verify the integrity of compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       ztest [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       Ztest  verifies  the integrity of the specified compressed files.  Uncompressed files are ignored. If a file is specified as '-', the integrity of compressed data read from standard input is verified.
       Data read from standard input must be all in the same compression format.

       If no files are specified, recursive searches examine the current working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.

       The formats supported are bzip2, gzip, lzip and xz.

       Note that error detection in the xz format is broken. First, some xz files lack integrity information. Second, not all xz decompressors can verify the integrity of all xz files. Third, section 2.1.1.2
       'Stream  Flags'  of  the xz format specification allows xz decompressors to produce garbage output without issuing any warning. Therefore, xz files can't always be verified as reliably as files in the
       other formats can.

       Exit status is 0 if all compressed files verify OK, 1 if environmental problems (file not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 if any compressed file is corrupt or invalid.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       -M, --format=<list>
              process only the formats in <list>

       -N, --no-rcfile
              don't read runtime configuration file

       -O, --force-format=<fmt>
              force given format (bz2, gz, lz, xz)

       -q, --quiet
