AXMAIL.CONF(5)                                                                          Linux System Managers Manual                                                                         AXMAIL.CONF(5)

NAME
       axMail - A powerful but simple SMTP plugin for URONode.

SYNOPSIS
       axmail.conf

DESCRIPTION
       axmail.conf This file configures the operations of axMail-FAX. You have to insure that you add the proper group using addgroup. The common one to use is "ax25".

COMMANDS
       The following options are supported for axmail.conf:

       IdleTimeout   This should not be longer than the same command in uronode.conf.

       HostName      This is the fully qualified hostname of your mail system. Typically this would be an amprnet domnain such as n1uro.ampr.org.

       AllowMail     This command controls who has access to use mail on your system. The default is all.

       Identification
                     This  shows how users can authenticate into the application. The default is none as the password used over RF may also be used for popping/imap if the local sysop chooses to do this.
                     Disconnect user from their mailbox."

       AutoCreate    This allows creation of the user accounts. Since you can also configure dovecot or a pop3 daemon and pop-before-smtp to allow mail on smartphones as well, this should be set  to  yes
                     which is default.

       LoginAllowed  This grants or denies permissions for other functions such as ssh on the box. This also controls access to imap/pop. Default is yes.

       AutoGroup     I suggest using ax25. You'll have to set this using addgroup ax25.

       First_uid     This  is the first user id numeric to be used when axmail creates accounts.  I suggest 2000 as this keeps mail clients 1000 UID away from actual local clients so it'll somewhat sepa‐
                     rate them this way.

       Last_uid      This sets just how many users may create and use mailboxes using axmail.

       HomeDir       This sets the base of the users home directory. I suggest using the standard home directory for all users.

       Shell         This is the shell the users are granted. I suggest if you wish not to allow ssh or telnet access into your server to use /bin/false.

       FaxGate       This is the efax gateway to send your faxes through to. The SFax command will preformat your mail to use this gateway. Remove the quotes.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/ax25/welcome.txt
            Greeting file for new users to welcome them to the mail system.
