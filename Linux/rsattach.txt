RSATTACH(8)              Linux System Managers Manual              RSATTACH(8)

NAME
       rsattach - Start a Rose interface

SYNOPSIS
       rsattach [-i inetaddr] [-v] port

DESCRIPTION
       Rsattach  takes many of the parameters for the port from the rsports(5)
       file. The port argument  is  the  name  of  a  port  as  given  in  the
       rsports(5) file.

       Rsattach  tries  to find the free Rose device in the system. The device
       name checked is rose0. If no free Rose device is available an error  is
       generated and the program terminates.

OPTIONS
       -i inetaddr     Set the internet address of the interface. This address
                       may either be a dotted decimal address or a host name.

       -v              Display the version.

SEE ALSO
       rose(4), rsparms(4), rsports(5), ifconfig(8).

BUGS
       The program can be run many times with the same arguments creating many
       instances of the same attributes on different devices. Not a good idea.
