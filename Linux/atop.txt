NAME
       atoprc - atop/atopsar related rcfile

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the rcfile of the atop and atopsar commands.  These commands can be used to monitor the system and process load on a Linux system.

       The atoprc file contains the default settings. These settings are read during startup, first from the system-wide rcfile /etc/atoprc and after that from the user-specific rcfile ~/.atoprc (so sys‐
       tem-wide settings can be overruled by an individual user).  The options in both rcfiles are identical.

OPTIONS
       The rcfile contains keyword-value pairs, one on every line (blank lines and lines starting with a #-sign are ignored).
       The following keywords can be specified:

       flags
           A  list  of  default flags for atop can be defined here. The flags which are allowed are 't', 'B', 'H', 'G', '2' till '9', 'g', 'm', 'd', 'n', 'u', 'p', 's', 'c', 'v', 'C', 'M', 'D', 'N', 'A',
           'a', 'y', 'Y', 'f', 'F', 'R', '1', 'e', 'E' and 'x'.

       twindir
           The default absolute path name of the temporary directory in which the twin file should be allocated.

       interval
           The default interval value in seconds.

       linelen
           The length of a screen line when sending output to a file or pipe (default 80).

       username
           Regular expression or one numerical UID to select the users for which (active) processes will be shown.

       procname
           The default regular expression for the process names to be shown.

       maxlinellc
           The maximum number of lines with LLC metrics that will be shown.

       cpucritperc
           The busy percentage considered critical for a processor (see section COLORS in the man-page of the atop command).  This percentage is used to determine a weighted percentage for line  coloring
           and sorting of active processes in text mode.  When this value is zero, no line coloring or automatic sorting is performed for this resource.

       dskcritperc
           The  busy  percentage considered critical for a disk (see section COLORS in the man-page of the atop command).  This percentage is used to determine a weighted percentage for line coloring and
           sorting of active processes in text mode.  When this value is zero, no line coloring or automatic sorting is performed for this resource.

       netcritperc
           The busy percentage considered critical for a network interface (see section COLORS in the man-page of the atop command).  This percentage is used to determine a weighted percentage  for  line
           coloring and sorting of active processes in text mode.  When this value is zero, no line coloring or automatic sorting is performed for this resource.

       memcritperc
           The  percentage considered critical for memory utilization (see section COLORS in the man-page of the atop command).  This percentage is used to determine a weighted percentage for line color‐
           ing and sorting of active processes in text mode.  When this value is zero, no line coloring or automatic sorting is performed for this resource.

       swpcritperc
           The occupation percentage considered critical for swap space (see section COLORS in the man-page of the atop command).  This percentage is used to determine a weighted percentage for line col‐
           oring and sorting of active processes in text mode.  When this value is zero, no line coloring or automatic sorting is performed for this resource.

       swoutcritsec
           The number of pages swapped out per second considered critical for for memory utilization (see section COLORS in the man-page of the atop command).  This threshold is used in combination  with
           'memcritperc'  to  determine  a weighted percentage for line coloring and sorting of active processes in text mode.  When this value is zero, no line coloring or automatic sorting is performed
           for this resource.

       almostcrit
           A percentage of the critical percentage to determine if the resource is almost critical (see section COLORS in the man-page of the atop command).  When this value is zero, no line coloring for
           `almost critical' is performed.

       cpubarwidth
           Number of columns used per bar in the processor bar graph.  The default value is 0 which means that the bar width will be scaled automatically (the wider the terminal, the more columns per bar
           up to a maximum of three).  With the value 1, 2 or 3 the number of bars can be statically pinned to that number of columns, with one column of white space in between the bars.

       colorinfo
           Definition of color name for information messages (default: green) in text mode.
           Allowed colors are: red green yellow blue magenta cyan black white.

       colorthread
           Definition of color name for thread-specific lines when using the 'y' option (default: yellow).
           Allowed colors are: red green yellow blue magenta cyan black white.

       coloralmost
           Definition of color name for almost critical resources (default: cyan) in text mode.
           Allowed colors are: red green yellow blue magenta cyan black white.

       colorcritical
           Definition of color name for critical resources (default: red) in text mode.
           Allowed colors are: red green yellow blue magenta cyan black white.

       atopsarflags
           A list of default flags for atopsar can be defined here. The flags that are allowed are 'S', 'x', 'C', 'M', 'H', 'a', 'A' and the flags to select one or more specific reports.

       perfevents
           Defines whether or not the CPU cycle counter should be retrieved by atop via the 'perf' counters. The values 'auto' (default), 'enable' or 'disable' can be specified. In case  of  'auto',  the
           CPU cycle counter will not be retrieved on virtual machines due to the overhead of reading this counter in a guest.

       pacctdir
           The  name of the topdirectory used by the atopacctd daemon. In this directory, the daemon creates a subdirectory pacct_shadow.d in which files will be written containing the process accounting
           records.  The default topdirectory is /run and this option only has to be specified when the atopacctd daemon is started with an alternative topdirectory as command line argument.
           This option can only be specified in the /etc/atoprc file (on system level)!

       An example of the /etc/atoprc or ~/.atoprc file:

               flags         Aaf
               interval      5
               username
               procname
               maxlinecpu    4
               maxlinedisk   10
               maxlineintf   5
               cpucritperc   80
               almostcrit    90
               atopsarflags  CMH
               ownprocline   PID:50 VGROW:40 RGROW:45 COMMAND-LINE:50
               ownpagline    PAGSCAN:3 BLANKBOX:0 PAGSWIN:3 PAGSWOUT:7

       The keywords 'ownprocline' and 'ownpagline' are explained in the subsequent section.

OWN DEFINITION OF OUTPUT LINE
       Via the rcfile it is possible to define the layout of the output lines yourself, i.e. you can define the layout of one line with process information with the keyword 'ownprocline' (to be  selected
       with the key 'o' or the flag -o) and you can redefine all lines with system information.

       The layout of an output-line can be defined as follows (notice that this should be specified as one line in the rcfile):

          keyword   <columnid>:<prio> [<columnid>:<prio> ...]

       The columnid is the symbolic name of a column that should shown at this position in the output line.
       The prio is a positive integer value that determines which columns have precedence whenever not all specified columns fit into the current screen-width.  The higher value, the higher priority.
       The  column-specifications  should be separated by a space. The order in which columns have been specified is the order in which they will be shown, with respect to their priority (columns that do
       not fit, will be dropped dynamically).

       A special columnid for system lines is 'BLANKBOX'. This indicates that an empty column is required at this position. Also this special columnid is followed by a priority (usually low).

       The following definition can be specified for process information:

       ownprocline
           The columnids are the names of the columns that are shown in the normal output of the process-related lines that are shown by atop such as 'PID', 'CMD', 'S', ....  The only  exception  is  the
           special columnid 'SORTITEM' that is used to show one of the columns CPU%/DSK%/MEM%/NET%, depending on the chosen sort-criterium.
           An example of a user-defined process line:

               ownprocline   PID:20 PPID:10 SYSCPU:15 USRCPU:15 VGROW:14 VSIZE:12 RGROW:14 RSIZE:12 ST:8 EXC:7 S:11 SORTITEM:18 CMD:20

       The following definitions are used internally by atop as the default system lines (you can redefine each of them in the rcfile as one line):

       ownsysprcline
           Redefinition of line labeled with 'PRC':
