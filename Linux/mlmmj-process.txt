NAME
       mlmmj-process - process mail for an mlmmj managed mailinglist

SYNOPSIS
       mlmmj-process -L /path/to/list -m /path/to/mail [-h] [-P] [-V]

       -h: This help

       -L: Full path to list directory

       -m: Full path to mail file

       -P: Don't execute mlmmj-send (debugging only)

       -V: Print version

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the binary which processes a mail. Examples of what such pro‐
       cessing is:

       ·   Access control

           Using the access rules  specified  in  <listdir>/control/access  to
           perform access control to the list. This is done before headers are
           stripped, so one can create allow rules based on headers  that  are
           later stripped.

       ·   Header stripping

           Headers  specified in <listdir>/control/delheaders are deleted from
           the mail.

       ·   Header addition

           Headers specified in <listdir>/control/customheaders are  added  to
           the mail.  This could be headers like List-ID: or Reply-To:

       ·   List control

           In  case there's a mail with a recipient delimiter it's not a regu‐
           lar list mail.  Processing of these  happens  in  mlmmj-receive  as
           well.  Examples  of  such are subscription requests, mails to owner
           etc.  It will base it's recipient delimiter detection on the Deliv‐
           ered-To: header if present. If not, the To: header is used.

       ·   Moderation

           If the list is moderated, it will happen in mlmmj-process.

       When  processing is done, it will invoke the needed binary according to
       whatever mail it is. If it's a  subscription  request  it  will  invoke
       mlmmj-sub, if it's a regular list mail it will invoke mlmmj-send.
