NAME
       tif2svg - generates an SVG file from hugin 'multiple TIFF' output

Synopsis
         tif2svg [options] INPUT INPUT ...

DESCRIPTION
       Takes a list of TIFF files and assembles an SVG file with each TIFF referenced on a separate layer.

       If the --trace option is given, alpha channels are traced with 'autotrace' and this vector path is inserted as clip paths.

       Typically, multiple TIFF output is generated by hugin/nona, instead of adjusting alpha channels for enblend, this tool allows the masks to adjusted in Inkscape instead.  The saved SVG file can be
       blended with 'enblend-svg'.

       Requires Image::Size and autotrace.

       <http://enblend.sourceforge.net/>

       Note that the 'multiple TIFF' files can be large and unwieldy, use the --jpeg-proxies option to generate JPEG versions for use in Inkscape.  'enblend-svg' will swap these back when blending.
