NAME
       claws-mail-spamassassin - filter messages through SpamAssassin

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-spamassassin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-spamassassin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin allows filtering incoming mails usin SpamAssassin to detect spam messages.

       The plugin also provides the ability to teach spamd to recognize spam and ham, using the external command sa-learn in local modes or spamd in TCP mode (this one requires SpamAssassin >= 3.1.x).

       A toolbar button for marking messages as spam or ham can be added to the main window or the message window (see “Configuration” menu, “Preferences” dialog, “Customize toolbars” option).

       Messages classified as spam are moved to the configured folder or the default trash if no folder was configured.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...” dialog, click on the “Load plugin...” button and select the plugin file, named spamassassin.so, and press the
       “Open” button.
