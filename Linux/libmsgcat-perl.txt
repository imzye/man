NAME
       Locale::Msgcat - Perl extension for blah blah blah

SYNOPSIS
         use Locale::Msgcat;

         $cat = new Locale::Msgcat;

         $rc  = $cat->catopen(name, oflag);
         $msg = $cat->catgets(set_number, message_number, string);
         $rc  = $cat->catclose();

DESCRIPTION
       The Locale::Msgcat module allows access to the message catalog functions which are available on some systems. A new Locale::Msgcat object must first be created for each catalog which has to be
       open at a given time.

       The catopen operation opens the catalog whose name is given as argument.  The oflag can be either 0 or NL_CAT_LOCALE (usually 1) which is the recommended value.

       The catgets message retrieves message_number for the set_number message set, and if not found returns string.

       The catclose function should be used when access to a catalog is not needed anymore.

EXAMPLES
         use Locale::Msgcat;

         $cat = new Locale::Msgcat;
         unless ($cat->catopen("whois.cat", 1)) {
             print STDERR "Can't open whois catalog.\n";
             exit(1);
         }
         printf "First message, first set : %s\n", $cat->catgets(1, 1, "not found");
         unless ($cat->catclose()) {
             print STDERR "Can't close whois catalog.\n";
             exit(1);
         }

       The above example would print the first message from the first message set found in the whois catalog, or if not found it would print "not found".
