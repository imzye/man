DESCRIPTION
       GNU strip discards all symbols from object files objfile.  The list of object files may include archives.  At least one object file must be given.

       strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

OPTIONS
       -F bfdname
       --target=bfdname
           Treat the original objfile as a file with the object code format bfdname, and rewrite it in the same format.

       --help
           Show a summary of the options to strip and exit.

       --info
           Display a list showing all architectures and object formats available.

       -I bfdname
       --input-target=bfdname
           Treat the original objfile as a file with the object code format bfdname.

       -O bfdname
       --output-target=bfdname
           Replace objfile with a file in the output format bfdname.

       -R sectionname
       --remove-section=sectionname
           Remove any section named sectionname from the output file.  This option may be given more than once.  Note that using this option inappropriately may make the output file unusable.

       -s
       --strip-all
           Remove all symbols.

       -g
       -S
       -d
       --strip-debug
           Remove debugging symbols only.

       --strip-unneeded
           Remove all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing.

       -K symbolname
       --keep-symbol=symbolname
           Keep only symbol symbolname from the source file.  This option may be given more than once.

       -N symbolname
       --strip-symbol=symbolname
           Remove symbol symbolname from the source file. This option may be given more than once, and may be combined with strip options other than -K.

       -o file
           Put the stripped output in file, rather than replacing the existing file.  When this argument is used, only one objfile argument may be specified.

       -p
       --preserve-dates
           Preserve the access and modification dates of the file.

       -w
       --wildcard
           Permit regular expressions in symbolnames used in other command line options.  The question mark (?), asterisk (*), backslash (\) and square brackets ([]) operators can be used anywhere in the
           symbol name.  If the first character of the symbol name is the exclamation point (!) then the sense of the switch is reversed for that symbol.  For example:

                     -w -K !foo -K fo*

           would cause strip to only keep symbols that start with the letters ``fo'', but to discard the symbol ``foo''.

       -x
       --discard-all
           Remove non-global symbols.

       -X
       --discard-locals
           Remove compiler-generated local symbols.  (These usually start with L or ..)

       --only-keep-debug
           Strip a file, removing any sections that would be stripped by --strip-debug and leaving the debugging sections.

           The intention is that this option will be used in conjunction with --add-gnu-debuglink to create a two part executable.  One a stripped binary which will occupy less space in RAM and in a dis‐
           tribution and the second a debugging information file which is only needed if debugging abilities are required.  The suggested procedure to create these files is as follows:

           1.<Link the executable as normal.  Assuming that is is called>
               "foo" then...

           1.<Run "objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.dbg" to>
               create a file containing the debugging info.

           1.<Run "objcopy --strip-debug foo" to create a>
               stripped executable.

           1.<Run "objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.dbg foo">
               to add a link to the debugging info into the stripped executable.

           Note - the choice of ".dbg" as an extension for the debug info file is arbitrary.  Also the "--only-keep-debug" step is optional.  You could instead do this:

           1.<Link the executable as normal.>
           1.<Copy "foo" to  "foo.full">
           1.<Run "strip --strip-debug foo">
           1.<Run "objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo">

           ie the file pointed to by the --add-gnu-debuglink can be the full executable.  It does not have to be a file created by the --only-keep-debug switch.

       -V
       --version
           Show the version number for strip.

       -v
       --verbose
           Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of archives, strip -v lists all members of the archive.
