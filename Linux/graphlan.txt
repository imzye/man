NAME
       graphlan - circular representations of taxonomic and phylogenetic trees

SYNOPSIS
       graphlan  [-h] [--format ['output_image_format']] [--warnings WARNINGS] [--positions POSITIONS] [--dpi image_dpi] [--size image_size] [--pad pad_in] [--external_legends] [-v] input_tree output_im‐
       age

DESCRIPTION
       GraPhlAn is a software tool for producing high-quality circular representations of taxonomic and phylogenetic trees. It focuses on concise, integrative, informative, and  publication-ready  repre‐
       sentations of phylogenetically- and taxonomically-driven investigation.

OPTIONS
   positional arguments:
       input_tree
              the input tree in PhyloXML format

       output_image
              the output image, the format is guessed from the extension unless --format is given. Available file formats are: png, pdf, ps, eps, svg

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --format ['output_image_format']
              set the format of the output image (default none meaning that the format is guessed from the output file extension)

       --warnings WARNINGS
              set whether warning messages should be reported or not (default 1)

       --positions POSITIONS
              set whether the absolute position of the points should be reported on the standard output. The two cohordinates are r and theta

       --dpi image_dpi
              the dpi of the output image for non vectorial formats

       --size image_size
              the size of the output image (in inches, default 7.0)

       --pad pad_in
              the distance between the most external graphical element and the border of the image

       --external_legends
              specify whether the two external legends should be put in separate file or keep them along with the image (default behavior)

       -v, --version
              Prints the current GraPhlAn version and exit
