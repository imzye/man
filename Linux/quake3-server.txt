NAME
       quake3-server - Quake III Arena dedicated server

SYNOPSIS
       quake3-server [-h|--help] [-q|--quiet] [+set option value]...

DESCRIPTION
       quake3-server is the dedicated server for Quake III Arena, a multiplayer network game.

OPTIONS
       The wrapper script used for Quake III Arena in Debian accepts these options:

       -h, --help
              Display a short help summary

       -q, --quiet
              Disable all output

       Any  console  command  can also be prefixed with + and used as a command-line option (run the server in a terminal to use the console).  The +set command is generally the most useful to use on the
       command line.

       Options that can be set with +set (note that this is not a full list!) include:
