NAME
       crlupdate - Mono Certficate Revocation List Downloader and Updater

SYNOPSIS
       crlupdate [-m] [-v] [-f]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool allows the download of new, or update of existing, Certficate
       Revocation List (CRL) associated with the certificates present  in  the
       user  (default)  or  machine  stores. The CRL present in the stores are
       used to determine the validity of  unexpired,  trusted  X.509  certifi‐
       cates.   To ensure CRL are always fresh consider automating the updates
       using the at (or similar) command(s).

OPTIONS
       -m     Update CRL associated with certificates in the machine store. By
              default the tool works on the user store.

       -v     Verbose  mode.  Display  extra information while downloading and
              updating the CRL.

       -f     Force the download of all CRL even if they are not normally  due
              to be updated (i.e. nextUpdate is still in the future).

EXAMPLES
       mono crlupdate.exe
              Download  (if missing) or update (if existing and past due date)
              all CRL associated with certificates present in user store.

       mono crlupdate.exe -f -m
              Force the download of every  CRL  associated  with  certificates
              present  in  the  machine store. Note that the user running this
              needs read/write access to the machine store or update will  not
              occur.
