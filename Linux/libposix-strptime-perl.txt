NAME
       POSIX::strptime - Perl extension to the POSIX date parsing strptime(3) function

SYNOPSIS
        ($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday, $yday, $isdst) = POSIX::strptime("string", "Format");

DESCRIPTION
       Perl interface to strptime(3)

FUNCTIONS
       strptime
            ($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday, $yday) = POSIX::strptime(string, format);

           The result for any value not extracted is not defined. Some platforms may reliably return "undef", but this is dependent on the strptime(3) function in the underlying C library.

           For example, only the following fields may be relied upon:

            my ($min, $hour) = ( POSIX::strptime( "01:23", '%H:%M' ) )[1,2];

            my ($mday, $mon, $year) = ( POSIX::strptime( "2010/07/16", '%Y/%m/%d' ) )[3,4,5];

           Furthermore, not all platforms will set the $wday and $yday elements. If these values are required, use "mktime" and "gmtime":

            use POSIX qw( mktime );
            use POSIX::strptime qw( strptime );

            my ($mday, $mon, $year) = ( POSIX::strptime( "2010/07/16", '%Y/%m/%d' ) )[3,4,5];
            my $wday = ( gmtime mktime 0, 0, 0, $mday, $mon, $year )[6];
