NAME
       lschp - list information about available channel-paths.

SYNOPSIS
       lschp [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [ CHPID ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  lschp  command  lists status and type information about available channel-paths. A CHPID argument can be specified to return the information for the re‐
       spective channel-path identifier only.  Channel-path identifiers are specified in hexadecimal notation either simply as the CHPID-number (e.g. e0) or in  the
       form

              <cssid>.<id>

       where <cssid> is the channel-subsystem identifier and <id> is the CHPID-number (e.g. 0.7e).

       Column description:

       CHPID
              Channel-path identifier.

       Vary
              Logical channel-path state:
              0 = channel-path is not used for I/O
              1 = channel-path is used for I/O

       Cfg.
              Channel-path configure state:
              0 = stand-by
              1 = configured
              2 = reserved
              3 = not recognized

       Type
              Channel-path type identifier.

       Cmg
              Channel measurement group identifier.

       Shared
              Indicates whether a channel-path is shared between LPARs:
              0 = channel-path is not shared
              1 = channel-path is shared

       PCHID
              Physical channel-ID unless the 4-digit hexadecimal value is enclosed in parenthesis.

              If the value is enclosed in parenthesis, no physical channel-ID is associated with the CHPID, and the value is an internal channel-ID.

              For example, 0501 specifies a PCHID whereas (0502) specifies an internal channel-ID.

       A column value of '-' indicates that a facility associated with the respective channel-path attribute is not available.

OPTIONS
       -h
       --help
              Print a short help text, then exit.

       -v
       --version
              Print version number, then exit.
