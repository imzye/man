NAME
       blaze-init - creates or recovers a BlazeBlogger repository

SYNOPSIS
       blaze-init [-fqV] [-b directory]

       blaze-init -h|-v

DESCRIPTION
       blaze-init either creates a fresh new BlazeBlogger repository, or recovers an existing one in case it is corrupted. Optionally, it can also revert a configuration and default templates to their
       original state, leaving all user data (that is, both blog posts and pages) intact.

OPTIONS
       -b directory, --blogdir directory
           Allows you to specify a directory in which the BlazeBlogger repository is to be blaced. The default option is a current working directory.

       -f, --force
           Reverts existing configuration, theme, and language files to their initial state. By default, these files are kept intact.

       -q, --quiet
           Disables displaying of unnecessary messages.

       -V, --verbose
           Enables displaying of all messages, including a list of created files.

       -h, --help
           Displays usage information and exits.

       -v, --version
           Displays version information and exits.

EXAMPLE USAGE
       Create a new blog in a current directory:

         ~]$ blaze-init
         Created a BlazeBlogger repository in .blaze.

       Create a new blog in ~/public_html:

         ~]$ blaze-init -b ~/public_html
         Created a BlazeBlogger repository in /home/joe/public_html/.blaze.

       Revert a configuration file and default templates to their initial state:

         ~]$ blaze-init -f
         Recovered a BlazeBlogger repository in .blaze.

       Or if you want to see what files have been reverted:

         ~]$ blaze-init -fV
         Created .blaze/config
         Created .blaze/theme/default.html
         Created .blaze/style/default.css
         Created .blaze/lang/en_US
         Recovered a BlazeBlogger repository in .blaze.
