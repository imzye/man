NAME
       mosh-client - client-side helper for mosh

SYNOPSIS
       MOSH_KEY=KEY mosh-client [-v] IP PORT
       mosh-client -c

DESCRIPTION
       mosh-client is a helper program for the mosh(1) remote terminal application.

       mosh  itself is a setup script that establishes an SSH connection, runs the server-side helper mosh-server, and collects the server's port number and session
       key.

       mosh then executes mosh-client with the server's IP address, port, and session key. mosh-client runs for the lifetime of the connection.

       The 22-byte base64 session key given by mosh-server is supplied in the MOSH_KEY environment variable. This represents a 128-bit AES key that protects the in‐
       tegrity and confidentiality of the session.

       For constructing new setup wrappers for remote execution facilities other than SSH, it may be necessary to invoke mosh-client directly.

       With the -c option, mosh-client instead prints the number of colors of the terminal given by the TERM environment variable.

       The  -v  option will print some debugging information on standard error.  More instances of this flag will result in more debugging information.  If standard
       error is not redirected from the terminal, the display will be corrupted and quickly become unusable.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       MOSH_KEY
              This variable must be set, and must contain a Base64-encoded cryptographic key from mosh-server(1).

       MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY
              See mosh(1).

       MOSH_PREDICTION_DISPLAY
              Controls local echo as described in mosh(1).

       MOSH_TITLE_NOPREFIX
              See mosh(1).
