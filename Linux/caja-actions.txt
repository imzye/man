DESCRIPTION
       caja-actions  is  an  extension for the caja file manager which allows arbitrary programa to be launched through the caja popup menu.  Each time you right-click on one or several files in caja, or
       any part of the background of the currently opened folder, caja-actions will look at its configured actions to see if a program has been setup for this selection. If so, it will add an item to the
       menu that allows you to execute the program on the selected files.  Configurations are stored in DConf for speed and integration with other MATE programs.
