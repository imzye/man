NAME
       kbd - Keyboard input driver

SYNOPSIS

         Driver "kbd"

DESCRIPTION
       kbd  is  an  Xorg input driver for keyboards.  The driver supports the standard OS-provided keyboard interface, but these are currently only available to this driver module for Linux, BSD, and So‐
       laris.  This driver is the replacement for the built-in keyboard driver formerly included in Xorg.

       The kbd driver functions as a keyboard input device.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Depending on the X server version in use, input device options may be set in either a xorg.conf file, an xorg.conf.d snippet, or in the configuration files read by the Hardware  Abstraction  Layer
       (HAL) daemon, hald(1).

       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "Device" "string"
              Specify the keyboard device.  Default: the OS's default console keyboard input source.  Property: "Device Node" (read-only).

       Option "Protocol" "string"
              Specify the keyboard protocol.  Valid protocol types include:

                   Standard, Xqueue.

              Not all protocols are supported on all platforms.  Default: "Standard".

       Option "XLeds" "ledlist"
              makes  the keyboard LEDs specified in ledlist available for client use instead of their traditional function (Scroll Lock, Caps Lock and Num Lock).  The numbers in the list are in the range
              1 to 3.  Default: empty list.

       Option "XkbRules" "rules"
              specifies which XKB rules file to use for interpreting the XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant, and XkbOptions settings.  Default: "base" for most platforms.  If you use the "base"  value  then
              you can find listing of all valid values for these four options in the /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst file.

       Option "XkbModel" "modelname"
              specifies the XKB keyboard model name.  Default: "pc105" for most platforms.

       Option "XkbLayout" "layoutname"
              specifies the XKB keyboard layout name.  This is usually the country or language type of the keyboard.  Default: "us" for most platforms.

       Option "XkbVariant" "variants"
              specifies the XKB keyboard variant components.  These can be used to enhance the keyboard layout details.  Default: not set.

       Option "XkbOptions" "options"
              specifies the XKB keyboard option components.  These can be used to enhance the keyboard behaviour.  Default: not set.

       For a list of available XKB options, see xkeyboard-config(7).

EXAMPLE
       The following xorg.conf fragment ensures that user will be able to switch between us and sk layouts by pressing the "menu" key. The scroll lock LED shows which layout is currently active.

       The XkbVariant option defines which variants of the two layouts should be used. In case of the us layout its default variant is used. In case of the sk layout its qwerty variant is used.
