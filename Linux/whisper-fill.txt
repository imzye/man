NAME
       whisper-fill - copy missing metrics from src into dst

SYNOPSYS
       whisper-fill src_path dst_path

DESCRIPTION
       Copies data from src in dst, if missing. Unlike whisper-merge, don't overwrite data that's already present in the target file, but instead, only add the missing data (e.g. where the gaps in the target
       file are). Because no values are overwritten, no data or precision gets lost. Also, unlike whisper-merge, try to take the highest-precision archive to provide the data, instead of  the  one  with  the
       largest retention.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
