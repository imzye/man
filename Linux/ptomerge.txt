NAME
       ptomerge - merges pto projects

Synopsis
         ptomerge infile1.pto infile2.pto infile3.pto [...] outfile.pto

DESCRIPTION
       Takes a list of .pto projects and joins them together into a single .pto project.  Projects at the begining of the list get priority, existing image entries are not clobbered by subsequent entries.

       Images are identified by file paths (n parameters).

       Control points are imported anyway even if points already exist in other projects, duplicates points are however not imported.

Calling syntax
         ptomerge <pto-file> <pto-file ...> <pto-file>
