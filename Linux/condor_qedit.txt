CONDOR_QEDIT(1)                                                                                 HTCondor Manual                                                                                 CONDOR_QEDIT(1)

NAME
       condor_qedit - HTCondor Manual

       modify job attributes

SYNOPSIS
       condor_qedit [-debug ] [-n schedd-name] [-pool pool-name] {cluster | cluster.proc | owner | -constraint constraint} attribute-name attribute-value ...

DESCRIPTION
       condor_qedit modifies job ClassAd attributes of queued HTCondor jobs.  The jobs are specified either by cluster number, job ID, owner, or by a ClassAd constraint expression. The attribute-value may be
       any ClassAd expression. String expressions must be surrounded by double quotes.  Multiple attribute value pairs may be listed on the same command line.

       To ensure security and correctness, condor_qedit will not allow modification of the following ClassAd attributes:

       • Owner

       • ClusterId

       • ProcId

       • MyType

       • TargetType

       • JobStatus

       Since JobStatus may not be changed with condor_qedit, use condor_hold to place a job in the hold state, and use condor_release to release a held job, instead of  attempting  to  modify  JobStatus  di‐
       rectly.

       If a job is currently running, modified attributes for that job will not affect the job until it restarts. As an example, for PeriodicRemove to affect when a currently running job will be removed from
       the queue, that job must first be evicted from a machine and returned to the queue.  The same is true for other periodic expressions, such as PeriodicHold and PeriodicRelease.

       condor_qedit validates both attribute names and attribute values, checking for correct ClassAd syntax. An error message is printed, and no attribute is set or changed if the name or value is invalid.

OPTIONS
          -debug Causes debugging information to be sent to stderr, based on the value of the configuration variable TOOL_DEBUG.

          -n schedd-name
                 Modify job attributes in the queue of the specified schedd

          -pool pool-name
                 Modify job attributes in the queue of the schedd specified in the specified pool

EXAMPLES
          % condor_qedit -name north.cs.wisc.edu -pool condor.cs.wisc.edu 249.0 answer 42
          Set attribute "answer".
          % condor_qedit -name perdita 1849.0 In '"myinput"'
          Set attribute "In".
          % condor_qedit jbasney NiceUser TRUE
          Set attribute "NiceUser".
          % condor_qedit -constraint 'JobUniverse == 1' Requirements '(Arch == "INTEL") && (OpSys == "SOLARIS26") && (Disk >= ExecutableSize) && (VirtualMemory >= ImageSize)'
          Set attribute "Requirements".

GENERAL REMARKS
       A job's ClassAd attributes may be viewed with

          condor_q -long

EXIT STATUS
       condor_qedit will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
