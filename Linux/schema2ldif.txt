NAME
       ldap-schema-manager - manage schema to be inserted into in openldap server in cn=config mode

SYNOPSIS
       ldap-schema-manager [-y] [-n] [-c] [-o options] [path] [-h|-l|-i schema1 schema2|-m schema1 schema2|-e schema1 schema2]

DESCRIPTION
       This program will list, insert, empty or modify the ldap schemas into an openldap server in cn=config mode.  If a schema is not listed as a path, it will be searched for in the provided path, or
       in /etc/ldap/schema/ if no path has been provided.  To insert schemas from working directory prepend them with "./".  Schema with no extension is assumed to be .ldif. Specify .schema if you want
       the tool to autoconvert the schema to ldif file. See the examples for more information

   Options
       -i    This option insert the given list of schemas

       -m    This option insert the given list of schemas, replacing already inserted versions of those schemas

       -e    This option empty the given list of schemas, removing attributes and objectClasses from those.  This is useful because you cannot delete a schema without restarting slapd.

       -l    This option list inserted schemas

       -n    This option will make generated ldifs file to not be deleted after execution. Might be useful to understand errors.

       -c    This option make the program continue even if an error occur

       -y    This option answer yes to all questions. The only question right now is the confirmation one when you ask to empty a schema.

       -o    This  option  allow  you  to  specify specifics options to give to ldap commands such as ldapmodify, but beware that you will not be able to see things like password prompts as the output of
             these commands is piped.

   Special options
       --tool-name
             This option allows you to set the binary name to use in usage output, only useful if you wish to create a tool based upon ldap-schema-manager.

       --default-path
             This option defines the default path, which is otherwise /etc/ldap/schema/

       --default-schemas
             This option specifies the default list of schemas to use in case no schema list is given. Only useful if you create a tool based upon this one.  The list needs to end with "--end".

EXAMPLES
        admin@ldapserver$ ldap-schema-manager -i /etc/ldap/otherschema/myschema.ldif
          Insert the schema /etc/ldap/otherschema/myschema.ldif

        admin@ldapserver$ ldap-schema-manager -i /etc/ldap/otherschema/myschema.schema
          Convert /etc/ldap/otherschema/myschema.schema to ldif and insert it

        admin@ldapserver$ ldap-schema-manager -i myschema
          Insert the schema myschema.ldif from default directory (/etc/ldap/schema/)

        admin@ldapserver$ ldap-schema-manager -i myschema.schema
          Insert the schema myschema.schema from default directory (/etc/ldap/schema/)

        admin@ldapserver$ ldap-schema-manager -m /etc/ldap/otherschema/myschema.schema
          Convert /etc/ldap/otherschema/myschema.schema to ldif and replace the existing schema by this one

        admin@ldapserver$ ldap-schema-manager -e myschema
          Empty the schema myschema

        admin@ldapserver$ ldap-schema-manager -o "-H ldap://my.ldap.com -ZZ -D 'cn=admin,cn=config' -w password -x" -l
          Connect to another ldap server and list schemas
