NAME
       dustmite - a tool for minimizing D source code.

SYNOPSIS
       dustmite [OPTION]... PATH TESTER

DESCRIPTION
       DustMite is a tool for minimizing D source code.  Reducing C++ code also works quite well via --split *.{c,cpp,h,hpp}:d.

       DustMite will parse the source code into a simple hierarchy, and attempt to shrink it by deleting fragments iteratively, as long as the result satisfies a user-specified condition.

       PATH should be a directory containing a clean copy of the file-set to reduce.
              A file path can also be specified. NAME.EXT will be treated like NAME/NAME.EXT. TESTER should be a shell command which returns 0 for a correct reduction, and anything else otherwise.

OPTIONS
       --force
              Force reduction of unusual files

       --reduce-only MASK Only reduce paths glob-matching MASK
              (may be used multiple times)

       --no-remove REGEXP Do not reduce blocks containing REGEXP
              (may be used multiple times)

       --strip-comments
              Attempt to remove comments from source code.

       --coverage DIR
              Load .lst files corresponding to source files from DIR

       --obfuscate
              Instead of reducing, obfuscate the input by replacing words with random substitutions

       --keep-length
              Preserve word length when obfuscating

       --split MASK:MODE
              Parse and reduce files specified by MASK using the given splitter. Can be repeated. MODE must be one of: files, lines, words, d

       --no-redirect
              Don't redirect stdout/stderr streams of test command.

       -j[N]  Use N look-ahead processes (8 by default)

       --help Show this message

   Less interesting options:
       --strategy STRAT
              Set strategy (careful/lookback/pingpong/indepth/inbreadth)

       --dump Dump parsed tree to DIR.dump file

       --dump-html
              Dump parsed tree to DIR.html file

       --times
              Display verbose spent time breakdown

       --cache DIR
              Use DIR as persistent disk cache (in addition to memory cache)

       --trace
              Save all attempted reductions to DIR.trace

       --no-save
              Disable saving in-progress results

       --no-optimize
              Disable tree optimization step (may be useful with --dump)
