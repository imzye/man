NAME
       cliquer - find cliques in weighted and unweighted graphs.

SYNOPSIS
       cliquer --help

       cliquer [ options ] graph-filename

DESCRIPTION
       cliquer searched for cliques in a graph.  The graph is read from the file given as command line argument, or stdin if that filename is "-".

       The file must be ASCII as described below or a binary DIMACS-format.

       By default it prints the first maximal clique it finds, but this can be changed with the options described below.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Displays a short list of options and what they do.

       -a --all
              Find all cliques.

       -s --single
              Find only one clique (default).

       -w --weight
              Tell only maximum weight (no faster than -s).

       -m N --min N
              Search for cliques with weight at least N.

              If N=0, searches for maximum weight clique (default).

       -M N --max N
              Search for cliques with weight at most N.

              If N=0, no limit is imposed (default).

              N being positive is incompatible with "--min 0" ("--min 1" is assumed).

       -x --maximal
              Require cliques to be maximal.

       -u --unweighted
              Assume weight 1 for all vertices.

       -0 --from-0
              Number vertices 0 to n-1 instead of 1 to n when writing.

       -q --quiet
              Suppresses progress output.

              Specifying -q twice suppresses all output except the actual result.

       -r F --reorder F
              Reorder with function F.  Available reordering functions are:

              none   No ordering (same order as in the file).

              reverse
                     Reverse order as in the file.

              default
                     One of the two below, depending on weightedness.

              unweighted-coloring
                     Coloring method efficient for unweighted graphs.

              weighted-coloring
                     Coloring method efficient for weighted graphs.

              degree Order by ascending degree.

              random Random order.

FILE FORMAT
       The format of the ASCII representation of a graph is the following: Each line has a single letter (enclosed in spaces) as first part.

       A line with 'p' starts the graph.  The second token is a name of at most 15 characters and ignored.  Then there is the number of nodes in this graph.  Then the number of edges (currently ignored).

       A line with 'e' adds an edge.  The two next tokens are the numbers of two nodes to connect.

       A line with 'n' weights an node.  The first argument is the number of the node to assign a weight to, the second it's weight.
