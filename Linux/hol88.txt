NAME
       hol88 - Higher Order Logic

SYNOPSIS
       hol88

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the hol88 command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has
       online documentation provided via the hol88-help and hol88-library-help packages, and in dvi format as provided in the hol88-doc package.  The documentation can also be found at the project's web‐
       site, http://www.ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/hvg/hol88, in various forms.
