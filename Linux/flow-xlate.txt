NAME
       flow-xlate - Apply translations to selected fields of a flow.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-xlate [ -hkn ]  [ -b big|little ]  [ -C comment ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -v variable binding ]  [ -V flow_version ]  [ -x xlate_fname ]  [ -X xlate_definition ]  [ -z z_level ]

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-xlate utility is used to apply translations to flows. Translations are defined in a configuration file and are composed of actions and a definition to invoke action(s). The definitions are in
       the form of terms, each term can have a filter and multiple actions.

       Words in the configuration file of the form @VAR or @{VAR:default} will be expanded at run-time by setting variable names with the -v option.

       Translation actions begin with the xlate-action keyword followed by a symbolic name. Each action has a type defined below.

       Translation definitions begin with the xlate-definition keyword followed by a symbolic name. Each definition is composed of terms which are evaluated in the order of the configuration file. A term may
       invoke a filter to conditionally invoke an action.

FILES
       Configuration files: Symbols - /etc/flow-tools/sym/*.  Filter - /etc/flow-tools/cfg/filter.cfg.  Xlate - /etc/flow-tools/cfg/xlate.cfg.

BUGS
       The scale option can overflow the 32 bit flow counters. This could be solved by detecting this condition and splitting the flow in two.

       Translation between aggregated and non aggregated formats is not supported.
