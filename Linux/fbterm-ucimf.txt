       This manual page documents briefly the fbterm_ucimf commands.

       fbterm_ucimf is a program that providing an interface for fbterm using ucimf, the Linux unicode framebuffer consle input method framework.

       This program is intended to be work with a non-setuid fbterm using fbterm -i fbterm_ucimf command, however because of some unresolved problem in fbterm package this aim has not been achieved yet.

       Currently  this  program  is the only known working solution to start ucimf in Debian. Setuid fbterm is required, use command chown root:utmp /usr/bin/fbterm to change its user/group to root/utmp,
       and chmod 6755 /usr/bin/fbterm to change make it setuid.  After doing so users without root privilege are able to load the input method with fbterm -i  fbterm_ucimf  while  starting  fbterm,  then
       press Ctrl+Space to activate the input method, and Ctrl+Shift to switch among the input methods to find your preferred one.
