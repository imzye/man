NAME
       opensnitch-ebpf-modules - GNU/Linux interactive firewall application

DESCRIPTION
       opensnitch-ebpf-modules provides the eBPF kernel modules to intercept network connections. It offers better performance and reliability.

       The modules are installed under /usr/lib/opensnitchd/ebpf/

KNOWN BUGS
       When coming back from suspend state, the eBPF modules stop working.

       The only solution for now is to restart the daemon when the computer wakes up:
