NAME
       raw2hdf — Create an .hdf hard disk image from a raw data file

SYNOPSIS
       raw2hdf [OPTION] rawfile hdffile

DESCRIPTION
       raw2hdf  converts  a binary dump of a hard disk's data into an IDE disk
       image in .hdf format for use with Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulators.

OPTIONS
       -v version
              specifies the version of .hdf image to be created. Valid  values
              are  `1.0'  for  a  version 1.0 file and `1.1' for a version 1.1
              file. Defaults to creating version 1.1 files.

       -h, --help
              give brief usage help, listing available options.

       -V, --version
              output version information.  rawfile specifies a raw  data  file
              (or  block  device  corresponding  to an actual disk) to be con‐
              verted.

       hdffile
              specifies the .hdf file to create.

NOTES
       Since raw2hdf has no knowledge of the geometry of the disk  from  which
       the original image was taken (indeed, the input file need not originate
       from a real IDE disk at all), there is no guarantee that  the  informa‐
       tion contained in the .hdf file header accurately represents the origi‐
       nal disk. However, it will attempt to construct a header that  is  con‐
       sistent  with  the  size of the image, to produce an .hdf file which is
       functionally equivalent.

BUGS
       None known.
