DESCRIPTION
       reconstruct rebuilds one or more IMAP mailboxes.  It can be used to re‐
       cover from almost any sort of data corruption.

       If reconstruct can find existing header and index files, it attempts to
       preserve  any data in them that is not derivable from the message files
       themselves. The state reconstruct attempts  to  preserve  includes  the
       flag names, flag state, and internaldate.

       reconstruct derives all other information from the message files.

       reconstruct  reads  its  configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
       file unless specified otherwise by -C.  Any  mailbox  directory  under‐
       neath  the path specified in the partition-news configuration option is
       assumed to be in news format.

       reconstruct does not adjust the quota usage recorded in any quota  root
       files.  After running reconstruct, it is advisable to run quota(8) with
       the -f switch in order to fix the quota root files.

       When upgrading versions of Cyrus software, it may be necessary  to  run
       reconstruct  with  the -V option, to rebuild indexes to a given version
       (or max for the most recent).  Note that the -V option cannot  be  com‐
       bined  with  most other reconstruct options.  If a mailbox needs recon‐
       structing you should do that first, and then upgrade it  with  -V  once
       it's good.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -p partition
              Search for the listed (non-existant) mailboxes on the  indicated
              partition.  Create  the mailboxes in the database in addition to
              reconstructing them. (not compatible with the use of wildcards)

       -x     When processing a mailbox which is not in the mailbox list (e.g.
              via  the  -p or -f options), do not import the metadata from the
              mailbox, instead create it anew (this  specifically  affects  at
              least  the  mailbox's  seen state unique identifier, user flags,
              and ACL).

       -r     Recursively reconstruct all sub-mailboxes of  the  mailboxes  or
              mailbox prefixes given as arguments.

       -f     Examine  the  filesystem underneath mailbox, adding all directo‐
              ries with a cyrus.header found there as new  mailboxes.   Useful
              for restoring mailboxes from backups.

       -s     Don't stat underlying files.  This makes reconstruct run faster,
              at the expense of not noticing some issues (like zero byte files
              or size mismatches).  "reconstruct -s" should be quite fast.

       -q     Emit less verbose information to syslog.

       -n     Don't make any changes.  Problems are reported, but not fixed.

       -G     Force re-parsing of the underlying message (checks GUID correct‐
              ness). Reconstruct with -G should fix  all  possible  individual
              message issues, including corrupted data files.

       -I     If  two  mailboxes  exist with the same UNIQUEID and reconstruct
              visits both of them, -I will cause the second mailbox to have  a
              new  UNIQUEID created for it.  If you don't specify -I, you will
              just get a syslog entry telling you of the clash.

       -R     Perform a UID upgrade operation on  GUID  mismatch  files.   Use
              this  option  if  you  think your index is corrupted rather than
              your message files, or if all backup attempts  have  failed  and
              you're happy to be served the missing files.

       -U     Use  this option if you have corrupt message files in your spool
              and have been unable to restore them  from  backup.   This  will
              make the mailbox IOERROR free and fix replication.

              WARNING:  this  deletes corrupt message files for ever - so make
              sure you've exhausted other options first!

       -o     Ignore odd files in your  mailbox  disk  directories.   Probably
              useful if you are using some tool which adds additional tracking
              files.

       -O     Delete odd files.  This is the opposite of -o.

       -M     Prefer mailboxes.db over cyrus.header  -  will  rewrite  ACL  or
              uniqueid  from the mailboxes.db into the header file rather than
              the other way around.  This feature was  introduced  in  version
              3.0.

       -V version
              Change  the  cyrus.index  minor  version  to a specific version.
              This can be useful for upgrades or  downgrades.  Use  a  magical
              version  of max to upgrade to the latest available database for‐
              mat version.

       -u     Instead of mailbox prefixes, give usernames on the command line

EXAMPLES
       reconstruct -r -f tech.support
          Recursively reconstruct all mailboxes within the tech.support  hier‐
          archy, restoring any directories containing cyrus.header files.

       reconstruct -r -f tech.support.Archive.2%
          Recursively  reconstruct  all  mailboxes within the tech.support.Ar‐
          chive hierarchy with names beginning with '2', restoring any  direc‐
          tories containing cyrus.header files.

       reconstruct -r -f -u jsmith
          Recursively reconstruct all mailboxes belonging to jsmith, restoring
          any directories containing cyrus.header files.

HISTORY
       The options -k (keep flags) and -g (clear GUID) have been deprecated in
       Cyrus version 2.4.

       The -u and -V options were added in Cyrus version 2.5.

       The -M option was added in Cyrus version 3.0.
