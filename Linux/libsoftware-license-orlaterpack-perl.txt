NAME
       Software::License::AGPL_3::or_later - AGPLv3+ license for Software::License infrastructure

VERSION
       Version v0.10.2, released on 2016-10-10 22:17 UTC.

WHAT?
       "Software-License-OrLaterPack" (or just "OrLaterPack" for brevity) is an add-on for "Software-License", a set of licenses with "or later" clause (like "GPL_3::or_later"). It allows Perl developers
       (who use "Dist-Zilla") to release their work under the terms of a License version N or (at user option) any later version.

       This is "Software::License::AGPL_3::or_later" module documentation. Read this if you are going to hack or extend the module, or use the module directly.

       If you want to use GNU license with "or later" clause read the user manual. General topics like getting source, building, installing, bug reporting and some others are covered in the README file.

SYNOPSIS
           my $lic = Software::License::AGPL_3::or_later->new( {
               holder  => 'John Doe',
               year    => '2010',
               program => 'Assa'
           } );

           $lic->_abbr;    # 'AGPL'
           $lic->abbr;     # 'AGPLv3+'
           $lic->_name;    # 'GNU Affero General Public License'
           $lic->name;     # 'The GNU Affero General Public License version 3 or later'

           $lic->notice;
               # Copyright statement and
               # standard GNU 3-paragraph license notice.
           $lic->notice( 'short' );
               # Copyright statement, license name and
               # two sentences about free software and warranties.

           # Xand other methods inherited from Software::License::AGPL_3
           # and Software::License.

DESCRIPTION
       "Software::License::AGPL_3::or_later" is a subclass of "Software::License::AGPL_3".  It overrides few parent methods and introduces few own methods.

       See documentation on Software::License for a general description of the class interface.

OBJECT ATTRIBUTES
   _abbr
       Bare abbreviated license name, "AGPL".

       Note: this attribute is not inherited from the base class.

   abbr
       Abbreviated license name: concatenated bare abbreviated license name, 'v' character, and license version (with trailing plus sign).

       Note: this attribute is not inherited from the base class.

   base
       A reference to base license object, i. e. license without "or later" clause.

       Note: this attribute is not inherited from the base class.

   _name
       Bare name of the license, which is also bare name of the base license, because it does include neither definitive article ("The"), nor license version nor "or later" clause: "GNU Affero General
       Public License".

       Note: this attribute is not inherited from the base class.

   name
       This attribute meets "Software::License" specification: returned name starts with definitive capitalized article ("The"). Returned name also includes the base license version (like other
       "Software::License" classes do) (without trailing plus sign) and "or later" clause.

   program
       A program name as specified by the "program" option in constructor, or the "Program" option in constructor, or "this program". This form of program name is intended to be used in the middle of
       sentence.

       Note: this attribute is not inherited from the base class.

   Program
       A program name as specified by the "Program" option in constructor, or the "program" option in constructor, or "This program". This form of program name is intended to be used in the beginning of
       sentence.

       Note: this attribute is not inherited from the base class.

   version
       License version (base license version with appended plus sign to denote "or later" clause).

OBJECT METHODS
   notice
       This method overrides Software::License's "notice". Differences are:

       •   If the license object was created with "program" or "Program" or both options, notice will include real program name instead of generic "this program".

       •   It returns copyright statement followed by standard GNU 3-paragraph license notice.

       •   Result is formatted with Text::Wrap::fill.

       The  method  can  be  called  with 'short' argument to get short version of notice. Short version includes: copyright statement, license name, and two sentences about free software and warranties.
       Note: This is experimental feature.
