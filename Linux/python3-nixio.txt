       explore
              Search  for  information  within  NIX file(s). Use the "file" command for general information about the file(s). The verbose flag can be used to get more detailed information about the file
              structure.  Multiple -v options increase the verbosity. (e.g.  'nixio explore file nix_file -vvv' for most detailed output). The "metadata" (mdata) and "data" commands provide  further  op‐
              tions  for  finding  and  viewing  data and metadata information. With the "dump" subcommand data can be dumped to file (up to 3D data). The "plot" command is only available if the nixworks
              package is installed (https://github.com/G-node/nixworks). NOTE: This tool is under active development. Please use the github issue tracker (https://github.com/G-node/nixpy/issues) for  bug
              reports and feature requests.

       validate
              Validate NIX files for missing or inconsistent objects and annotations.

       upgrade
              Upgrade NIX files to newest file format version.
