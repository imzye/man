NAME
     uredir — UDP port redirector

SYNOPSIS
     uredir [-hinsv] [-I ID] [-l LVL] [-t SEC] [[SRC]:PORT] [DST]:PORT

DESCRIPTION
     uredir is a small tool to redirect UDP traffic.  It can be used as a poor man's filtering tool, e.g. for small multihomed embedded systems without a built-in firewall.

     uredir forwards packets to a specified destination remembering the sender's address, any packets received from the destination are in turn forwarded to the sender.

     When uredir is launched from inetd(8) it does not immediately exit when the first reply has been forwarded.  Instead it lingers for three (3) seconds in case more requests are received, e.g. in the case
     of an SNMP walk.  This helps conserve precious system resources, useful in particular on embedded systems.

     For a TCP port redirector, try redir(1), which now has the same maintainer as uredir(1).

OPTIONS
     -h      Print a summary of the options and exit

     -i      Run in inetd mode, read data from stdin.  Implies -n, always runs in foreground

     -I ID   Identity, tag syslog messages with the ID name, default: process name

     -l LVL  Set log level: none, err, info, notice (default), debug

     -n      Run in foreground, do not detach from controlling terminal

     -s      Use syslog, even if running in foreground, default w/o -n

     -t SEC  Set timeout to SEC seconds for connections, default 3

     -v      Show program version

     [SRC]:PORT
             Source, or outer/public, IP and UDP port to bind to, the SRC can be left out to default to 0.0.0.0.  Must not be set when running in inet mode, -i

     [DST]:PORT
             Destination, or inner/private, IP and UDP port to redirect to

EXAMPLE
     This simple UDP proxy example forwards inbound DNS requests on any interface to an external DNS server on 192.168.0.1.

             uredir :53 192.168.0.1:53

     To run uredir in inetd mode, e.g. to redirect SNMP requests, and timeout after 5 sec, try the following.  Runs in foreground, as required for inetd services, and uses syslog for logging:

             snmp dgram udp wait root uredir -it 5 127.0.0.1:16161

     Syntax may vary between different inetd implementations and UNIX distributions.
