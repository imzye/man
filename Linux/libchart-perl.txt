Chart::Manual::Properties(3pm)                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                      Chart::Manual::Properties(3pm)

NAME
       Chart::Manual::Properties - complete guide to Chart's changeable properties

INTRO
       Individual properties of a chart can be changed via method "set":

           $chart_object->set( %properties);
           $chart_object->set( key => 'value', ... );

       This page documents all viable keys and values for this calls.

       The first section lists the most common data types and their acceptable values.

       Please note that all chart type reacts only to a distinct subset of properties. The section section therefore groups all properties by chart type or set of types, where they have an effect. The
       descriptions in this section are shortened to achive a tabular overview.

       A fuller description of each property provides the third section, where they are alpabetically sorted.

       The general layout of a chart image:

DATA TYPES
       Every key expects values of a certain data type. The more often occurring types are sorted, enumerated and decibed in this section.

   boolean
       Yes or no decisions you can answer with the perlish 0 or 1 as well as with 'true' or 'false', which might be shortened to 't' and 'T' or 'f' and 'F'. 'none' as an alias of 'false' is also an
       option.

   code
       Anonymous subroutine that usually takes the first argument and returns a transformed result:

           sub { $_[0] + 1 }

   color
       The usual options are:

         names:  'blue'

       All names are tabulated visually and by name under "NAMES" in Chart::Property::DataType::Color::Constant.  You can also define a color with integer values in the RGB or HSL space.  Acceptable
       ranges are for RGB: 3x 0..255 and for  HSL: 0..359, 2 x 0..100.

         RGB triplets: [0,255,255]
         RGB hashes: { Red =>   0,  Green => 255, Blue => 255 }
         RGB hashes: { R   =>   0,  G     => 255, B    => 255 }
         HSL hashes: { H   => 240,  S     => 100, L     => 50 }
         HSL hashes: { hue => 240, saturation => 100, lightness => 50 }

       Detailed explanation and even more options you find under Graphics::Toolkit::Color.

   font
       There are a handful GD built in font object, than can be referenced:

           GD::Font->Tiny
           GD::Font->Small
           GD::Font->MediumBold
           GD::Font->Large
           GD::Font->Giant

   integer
       Whole numbers (without decimals) to set position, size and alike.

   positive integer
       Integers greater or equal zero.

   string
       Short texts for title, sub_title and labels on axis, tics and legend.  Line breaks ("/n") are only acceptable inside single quotes and in the "title".

BY CHART TYPE
       Summary of all properties, grouped by chart type where there applicable.  Sections are named after the Chart type in question, except All and NoPie.  The format is: name ... type, description;
       "default value".

       "start" .............. "integer": start value of the first interval; 'undef'

ALPHABETICALLY
   angle_interval
       "Direction" only: how many radial lines should be drawn.  The default value is 30, which means that a line will be drawn every 30 degrees. Valid Values are: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 and 60.  If
       you choose 0, direction will draw no line.

   arrow
       "Direction" only: Bool that if 'true', chart will draw a arrow from the center to the point. Defaults to 'false'.

   brush_size
       "Lines" only: Integer sets the width of the lines in pixels. Default is 6.

   background
       see "colors"

   brushStyle
       Sets the shape of points for Chart::Points, Chart::LinesPoints.

       Possible values are: 'FilledCircle', 'circle', 'donut', 'OpenCircle', 'fatPlus', 'triangle', 'upsidedownTriangle', 'square', 'hollowSquare', 'OpenRectangle', 'FilledDiamond', 'OpenDiamond',
       'Star', 'OpenStar'.  Default: 'FilledCircle'. Look at Demo at "Points" in Chart::Manual::Types.

   brush_style1
       "Composite" only: brush style of points associated with left y-axis.

   brush_style2
       "Composite" only: brush style of points associated with right y-axis.

   colors
       The key "colors" is special, because there are a lot of things that need to be colored. That's why its value is a hash with keys within, which name what exactly needs to be colored. Their value
       has to be a color definition (name, RGB array ref or HSL hash ref):

           $obj->set('colors' => {'background' => [255,255,255]});

       sets the background color to white (which is the default). Valid keys are:

           'background' (background color for the image)
           'title' (color of the title)
           'text' (all the text in the chart)
           'x_label' (color of the x-axis label)
           'y_label' (color of the first y axis label)
           'y_label2' (color of the second y axis label)
           'grid_lines' (color of the grid lines)
           'x_grid_lines' (color of the x grid lines - for x axis ticks)
           'y_grid_lines' (color of the y grid lines - for to left y axis ticks)
           'y2_grid_lines' (color of the y2 grid lines - for right y axis ticks)
           'dataset0'..'dataset63' (the different datasets)
           'misc' (everything else, ie. axis, ticks, box around the legend)

       NB. For composite charts, there is a limit of 8 datasets per component.  The colors for 'dataset8' through 'dataset15' become the colors for 'dataset0' through 'dataset7' for the second component
       chart.

   composite_info
       "Composite" only: information about which data set gets visualized by which chart type. It should be a reference to an array of array references, containing information like the following:

           $obj->set ('composite_info' => [ ['Bars', [1,2]],
                            ['Lines', [3,4] ] ]);

       This example would set the two component charts to be a bar chart and a line chart.  It would use the first two data sets for the bar chart (note that the numbering starts at 1, not zero like most
       of the other numbered things in Chart), and the second two data sets for the line chart.  The default is undef.

       NB. Chart::Composite can only do two component charts.

   custom_x_ticks
       Used in "Points", "Lines", "Linespoints", "Errorbars", and "Bars" charts. This option allows you to you to specify exactly which x-ticks and x-tick labels should be drawn.  It should be assigned a
       reference to an array of desired ticks.  Just remember that I'm counting from the 0th element of the array.  (ie., if 'custom_x_ticks' is assigned [0,3,4], then the 0th, 3rd, and 4th x-ticks will
       be displayed)

   datasetx
       see "colors"

   f_x_tick
       Needs a reference to a function ("code") which uses the x-tick labels generated by the '@data[0]' as the argument. The result of this function can reformat the labels. For instance

          $obj -> set ('f_x_tick' => \&formatter );

       An example for the function formatter: x labels are seconds since an event.  The referenced function can transform this seconds to hour, minutes and seconds.

   f_y_tick
       The same situation as for 'f_x_tick' but now used for y labels.

   f_y_tick1
       "Composite" only: "code" ref to a function which has one argument and has to return a string which labels the first resp. second y axis.  Both default to undef.

   f_y_tick2
       "Composite" only: "code" ref to a function which has one argument and has to return a string which labels the first resp. second y axis.  Both default to undef.

   graph_border
       "Pie" only: Sets the number of pixels used as a border between the title/labels and the actual graph within the image.  Defaults to 10.

   grey_background
       Puts a nice soft grey background on the data plot area when set to 'true'.  Default is 'true'.

   grid_lines
       bool: draw grid lines matching up to x and y ticks.  Default is 'false'.

   imagemap
       Lets Chart know you're going to ask for information about the placement of the data for use in creating an image map from the png.  This information can be retrieved using the imagemap_dump()
       method.  NB. that the imagemap_dump() method cannot be called until after the Chart has been generated.

   include_zero
       If 'true', forces the y-axis to include zero if it is not in the dataset range. Default is 'false'.

       In general, it is better to use this, than to set the "min_val" if that is all you want to achieve.

   integer_ticks_only
       bool specifies to draw the x- and y-ticks at floating point values (as normal) or when set to 'true' only at integer values.  Default: 'false'

   interval
       "Split" only: Sets the interval of one partition of plot. Defaults 'undef'.

   interval_ticks
       "Split" only: Number of ticks for the x-axis. Defaults to 5.

   label_font
       This option changes the "font" of the axis labels.  Default is GD::Font->MediumBold.

   label_values
       "Pie" only: What kind of value labels to show alongside the pie.  Valid values are 'percent', 'value', 'both' and 'none'.  Defaults to 'percent'.

   legend
       Specifies the placement of the legend.  Valid values are 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'.  Setting this to 'none' tells chart not to draw a legend.  Default is 'right'.

   legend_example_size
       "Composite" only: Length of the example line in the legend in pixels.  Defaults to 20.

   legend_font
       This option changes the "font" of the text in the legend.  Default is GD::Font->Small.

   legend_labels
       Array reference containing texts, which are the labels assigned to each color in the legend. Amount has to correspond to the amount of data sets.

         @labels = ('foo', 'bar');
         $obj->set ('legend_labels' => \@labels);

       Default is empty, in which case 'Dataset 1', 'Dataset 2', etc. are used as the labels.

   legend_label_values
       "Pie" only: What labels to draw in the legend. Valid values are c<'percent'>, 'value', 'both' and 'none'. Defaults to 'value'.

   legend_lines
       "Pie" only: bool to decide if lines connecting pie slices and label are drawn. Default is 'false'.

   label_values
       "Pie" only: Labels to draw beside the pie slices. Valid values are 'percent', 'value', 'both' and 'none'. Defaults to 'percent'.

   line
       "Direction" only: If you turn this option to 'true', then point will be connected with lines. Defaults to 'false'.

   max_circles
       "Direction" only: Sets the maximum number of circles in the coordinate system.  Default is 100. This limit is used to avoid plotting  an unreasonable large number of ticks if non-round values are
       used for the min_val and max_val.

   max_val
       Sets the maximum y-value on the graph, overriding the normal auto-scaling.  Default is undef.

   max_val1
       "Composite" only: Maximum y-value for the first (left y-axis) components.  Default to undef.

   max_val2
       "Composite" only: Maximum y-value for the second (right y-axis) components.  Default to undef.

   max_x_ticks
       Work similar as 'max_y_ticks' and 'min_y_ticks'. Of course, only for a xy_plot.

   max_y_ticks
       Sets the maximum number of y_ticks to draw when generating a scale.  Default is 100. This limit is used to avoid plotting an unreasonable large number of ticks if non-round values are used for the
       min_val and max_val.

       The value for 'max_y_ticks' should be at least 5 times larger than 'min_y_ticks'.

   min_circles
       "Direction" only: Sets the minimum number of circles when generating a scale for direction. Default is 4, minimum is 2.

   min_val
       Sets the minimum y-value on the graph, overriding the normal auto-scaling.  Default is undef.

       Caution: should be used when setting 'max_val' and 'min_val' to floating point or non-round numbers. This is because the scale must start & end on a tick, ticks must have round-number intervals,
       and include round numbers.

       Example: Suppose your data set has a range of 35-114 units. If you specify them as the 'min_val' & 'max_val', the y_axis will be plotted with 80 ticks every 1 unit.. If no 'min_val' & 'max_val',
       the system will auto scale the range to 30-120 with 10 ticks every 10 units.

       If the 'min_val' & 'max_val' are specified to excessive precision, they may be overridden by the system, plotting a maximum 'max_y_ticks' ticks.

   min_val1
       "Composite" only: Minimum y-value for the first (left y-axis) component.  Default to undef.

   min_val2
       "Composite" only: Minimum y-value for the second (right y-axis) component.  Default to undef.

   min_x_ticks
       Work similar as 'max_y_ticks' and 'min_y_ticks'. Of course, only for a xy_plot.

   min_y_ticks
       Sets the minimum number of y_ticks to draw when generating a scale.  Default is 6, The minimum is 2.

   no_cache
       Adds Pragma: no-cache to the http header while output for CGI.  Be careful with this one, as Netscape 4.5 is unfriendly with POST using this method.

   pairs
       Direction only: bool if 'true', Chart uses the first dataset as a set of degrees and the second dataset as a set of values.  Then, the third set is a set of degrees and the fourth a set of values
       ...  If 'pairs' is set to 'false', Chart uses the first dataset as a set of angels and all following datasets as sets of values. Defaults to 'false'.

   png_border
       Sets the number of pixels used as a border between the graph and the edges of the image.  Defaults to 10.

   point
       Indicates to draw points in a direction chart. 'true' or 'false' possible. Defaults to 'true'.

   polar
       "Direction" only: If set 'true', the maximum x value is in the center of the coordinate system. Defaults to 'false'.

   precision
       Sets the number of numerals after the decimal point. Affects in most cases the y-axis. But also the x-axis if "xy_plot" was set and also the labels in a pie chart. Defaults to 3.

   pt_size
       "Points" and "LinesPoints" only: Sets the radius of the points in pixels.  Default is 18.

   ring
       "Pie" only: sets the "thickness" of the pie, the percentage of the radius, which is visible. Defaults to 1 (full pie chart).  Good values are between 0.2 and 0.4.

   scale
       "Split" only: Every y-value will be multiplied with that value, but the scale won't change. Which means that split allows one to overdraw certain  rows! Only useful if you want to give prominence
       to the maximal amplitudes of the data. Defaults to 1.

   same_error
       "ErrorBars" only: It tells chart that you want use the same error value of a data point if set to 'true'. Look at the documentation to see how the module ErrorBars works. Default: 'false'.

   same_y_axes
       "Composite" only: Forces both component charts to use the same maximum and minimum y-values if set to 'true'.  This helps to keep the composite charts from being too confusing.  Default is
       "undef".

   skip_int_ticks
       If 'true' the labels and ticks will be drawn every nth tick. Of course in horizontalBars it affects the x-axis. Default to 1, no skipping.

   skip_x_ticks
       Sets the number of x-ticks and x-tick labels to skip.  (ie.  if 'skip_x_ticks' was set to 4, Chart would draw every 4th x-tick and x-tick label).  Default is "undef".

   skip_y_ticks
       "HorizontalBars" only: Draw only every n'th tick with label on y-axis.  does for other charts. Defaults to 1 (draw all).

   sort
       In a xy-plot, the data will be sorted ascending if set to 'true'.  (Should be set if the data isn't sorted, especially in Lines, Split and LinesPoints) In a Pareto Chart the data will be sorted
       descending.  Defaults to 'false'.

   spaced_bars
       "Bars" only: Leaves space between the groups of bars at each data point when set to 'true'.  This just makes it easier to read a bar chart.  Default is 'true'.

   start
       "Split" only: Sets the start value of the first interval.  If the x coordinate of the first data point is zero, you should 'set' to zero. Default is 'undef'.

   sub_title
       Write a sub-title under the "title" in smaller letters.  Default is empty.

   text_space
       Sets the amount of space left on the sides (lext and right) of text, (title, legend, label) to make it more readable.  Defaults to 2.

   tick_label_font
       This is the font for the tick labels. It also needs a GD font object as an argument. Default is GD::Font->Small.

   tick_len
       Sets the length of the x- and y-ticks in pixels.  Default is 4.

   title
       Content of title text. If empty, no title is drawn.  It recognizes '\n' as a newline, and acts accordingly.  Remember, if you want to use normal quotation marks instead of single quotation marks
       then you have to quote "\\n". Default is empty.

   title_font
       This option changes the "font" of the title. Default is GD::Font->Large.

   transparent
       Makes the background of the whole image transparent if set to 'true'.  Useful for making web page images.  Default is 'false'.

   x_grid_lines
       Draws vertical grid lines matching up to x ticks if set to 'true'.  Default is 'false'.

   x_label
       Tells Chart what to use for the x-axis label.  If empty, no label is drawn.  Default is empty.

   x_ticks
       Specifies how to draw the x-tick labels.  Valid values are 1: 'normal', 2: 'staggered' (alternating on upper and lower row - for very long labels), and 3: 'vertical' (the labels are draw upwards
       in right angle).  Default is 'normal'.

   xy_plot
       Forces Chart to plot a x-y-graph, which means, that the x-axis is also numeric if set to 'true'. Very useful for mathematical graphs.  Works for Lines, Points, LinesPoints and ErrorBars. Split
       makes always a xy_plot. Defaults to 'false'.

   y_label
       Tells Chart what to use for labels on the standard, left y-axis.  If empty, no label is drawn.  Default is empty ('').

   y_label2
       Text of the label on the second, right y-axis (if different from left).  If empty, no label is drawn.  Default is empty ('').

   y_axes
       Tells Chart where to place the y-axis. Has no effect on Composite and Pie.  Valid values are 'left', 'right' and 'both'. Defaults to 'left'.

   y_grid_lines
       Draws horizontal grid lines matching up to y ticks if set to 'true'.  Default is 'false'.

   y_ticks1
       Composite only: number of y ticks to use on the first and second y-axis (y_ticks2).  Please note that if you just set the 'y_ticks' option, both axes will use that number of y ticks. Both default
       to undef.

   y_ticks2
       see "y_ticks1"
