NAME
       gp-saml-gui - login to a GlobalProtect VPN that uses SAML authentication

SYNOPSIS
       gp-saml-gui [-h] [--no-verify] [-C COOKIES] [-K] [-p] [-g] [-c CERT]] [--key KEY] [-v] [-q] [-x] [-P] [-S] [-E] [-u] [--clientos {Windows,Linux,Mac}] [-f EXTRA] server [--] [openconnect_extra ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a helper script to allow you to interactively login to a GlobalProtect VPN that uses SAML authentication, so that you can subsequently connect with OpenConnect.

       Some GlobalProtect VPNs which use SAML authentication are amenable to automated login, using tools such as openconnect-gp-okta, however interactive login is useful for debugging and is a necessary
       alternative for some VPNs.

OPTIONS
       Positional arguments

              server Hostname or IP address of GlobalProtect server (portal or gateway)

              openconnect_extra Extra arguments to include in output OpenConnect command-line (these should be preceded by -- so that they are not parsed as gp-saml-gui's own options).

       Optional arguments

              --h, --help Show help message and exit

              --no-verify Ignore invalid server certificate

              -C, --cookies Use and store cookies in this file

              -K, --no-cookies Don't use or store cookies at all

              -g, --gateway SAML auth to gateway

              -i, --ignore-redirects Use specified gateway hostname as server, ignoring redirects

              -p, --portal SAML auth to portal (default)

              -v, --verbose Increase verbosity of explanatory output to stderr

              -q, --quiet Reduce verbosity to a minimum

              -x, --external Launch external browser (for debugging)

              -P, --pkexec-openconnect Use PolicyKit (pkexec) to exec openconnect

              -S, --sudo-openconnect Use sudo to exec openconnect

              -E, --exec-openconnect Execute openconnect directly (advanced users)

              -f, --field Extra form field(s) to pass to include in the login query string (e.g. "-f magic-cookie-value=deadbeef01234567")

       Client certificate

              -c, --cert PEM file containing client certificate (and optionally private key)

              --key PEM file containing client private key (if not included in same file as certificate)

       Debugging and advanced options

              -u, --uri Treat server as the complete URI of the SAML entry point, rather than GlobalProtect server
