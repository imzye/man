NAME
       Pod::PseudoPod::HTML -- format PseudoPod as HTML

SYNOPSIS
         use Pod::PseudoPod::HTML;

         my $parser = Pod::PseudoPod::HTML->new();

         ...

         $parser->parse_file('path/to/file.pod');

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a formatter that takes PseudoPod and renders it as wrapped html.

       This is a subclass of Pod::PseudoPod and inherits all its methods.

METHODS
   add_body_tags
         $parser->add_body_tags(1);
         $parser->parse_file($file);

       Adds beginning and ending "<html>" and "<body>" tags to the formatted document.

   add_css_tags
         $parser->add_css_tags(1);
         $parser->parse_file($file);

       Imports a css stylesheet to the html document and adds additional css tags to url, footnote, and sidebar elements for a nicer display. If you don't plan on writing a style.css file (or using the
       one provided in "examples/"), you probably don't want this option on.
