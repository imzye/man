NAME
       ncpd - Daemon which handles the serial link to a Psion

SYNOPSIS
       ncpd [-V] [-h] [-v log-class] [-d] [-e] [-p [host:]port] [-s device] [-b baud-rate] [long-options]

DESCRIPTION
       ncpd  is  the  daemon which handles the serial link to your Psion. It listens at port 7501 for local connections and provides basic PLP/NCP services for plpfuse and plpftp and other front-ends. It
       auto-connects to the psion, even after unplugging/switching off therefore it can run all the time if you can dedicate a serial device to it.

OPTIONS
       -V, --version
              Display the version and exit

       -h, --help
              Display a short help text and exit.

       -e, --autoexit
              Exit automatically if the device is disconnected. Furthermore, use the current tty as I/O device. This option is intended for starting ncpd on demand using mgetty's auto-detect function. (A
              patch for mgetty is needed for that).

       -v, --verbose=log-class
              Increase the logging level of the program. the possible values for log-class are:

              nl     Set NCP debug level to LOG

              nd     Set NCP debug level to DEBUG

              ll     Set Link debug level to LOG

              ld     Set Link debug level to DEBUG

              pl     Set Packet debug level to LOG

              pd     Set Packet debug level to DEBUG

              ph     Set Packet debug level to HANDSHAKE

              m      Set overall debug level to verbose

              all    Turn on all the above logging on.

       -d, --dontfork
              Do not background the daemon.

       -p, --port=[host:]port
              Specify the port to listen on - by default the value for the host is 127.0.0.1 and the value for the port is looked up in /etc/services using the key psion/tcp.  If it is not found there, a
              default value of 7501 is used.

       -s, --serial=device
              Specify the serial device to use to connect to the Psion - this defaults to /dev/ttyS0

       -b, --baudrate=baud-rate
              Specify the baud rate to use for the serial connection. If the word auto is specified, ncpd cycles through baud-rates of 115200, 57600, 38400, 19200 and 9600 baud. Default setting is auto.
