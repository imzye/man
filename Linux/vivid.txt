NAME
       vivid - LS_COLORS manager with multiple themes

SYNOPSIS
        vivid [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Generator  for the LS_COLORS (environment variable) controlling the color voice of ls, tree, fd, bfs, duste and many other tools. It uses a YAML configuration format for the file type database and
       core themes.

       Unlike dircolors, the database and themes are organized in different files.  This allows users to choose and customize color themes independently from the collection of file extensions. Instead of
       using cryptic ANSI escape codes, colors can be specified in RRGBBB format and will be converted to ANSI truecolor (24-bit) codes or 8-bit codes for older terminal emulators.

USAGE:
       vivid <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
       -m, --color-mode <mode>
              Type of ANSI colors to be used [default: 24-bit] [possible values: 8-bit, 24-bit]

       -d, --database <path>
              Path to filetypes database (filetypes.yml)

       -h, --help
              Prints help information

       -V, --version
              Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
       generate
              Generate a LS_COLORS expression

       preview
              Preview a given theme

       themes Prints list of available themes

       help   Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

EXAMPLES:
       Choose a color theme (for example: molokai).  Then, add this to your shells RC file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, …): export LS_COLORS="$(vivid generate molokai)"

       Note: Terminals without true color support By default, vivid runs in true color mode (24-bit). If you don't have a terminal that supports 24-bit colors, use the --color-mode 8-bit option when run‐
       ning vivid. This will generate interpolated 8-bit colors: export LS_COLORS="$(vivid -m 8-bit generate molokai)"
