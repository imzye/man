NAME
       sphinx_pitch - Extract pitch from audio files

SYNOPSIS
       sphinx_pitch [ options ]...

DESCRIPTION
       This program reads audio files and analyzes them for pitch and voicing.

       -c     file for batch processing

       -di    directory, input file names are relative to this, if defined

       -do    directory, output files are relative to this

       -ei    extension to be applied to all input files

       -eo    extension to be applied to all output files

       -flen  Number of seconds in each analysis frame (needs to be greater than twice the longest period you wish to detect - to detect down to 80Hz you need a frame length of 2.0/80 = 0.025).

       -fshift
              Frame shift: number of seconds between each analysis frame.

       -i     audio input file

       -input_endian
              of audio data (will be determined automatically if not given)

       -mswav Defines input format as Microsoft Wav (RIFF)

       -nist  Defines input format as NIST sphere

       -nskip If a control file was specified, the number of utterances to skip at the head of the file

       -o     text output file (standard output will be used if not given)

       -raw   Defines input format as raw binary data

       -runlen
              If a control file was specified, the number of utterances to process (see -nskip too)

       -samprate
              Sampling rate of audio data (will be determined automatically if 0)

       -search_range
              Fraction of the best local estimate to use as a search range for smoothing.

       -smooth_window
              Number of frames on either side of the current frame to use for smoothing.

       -voice_thresh
              Threshold of normalized difference under which to search for the fundamental period.
