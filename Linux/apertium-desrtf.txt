NAME
     apertium-desrtf — Rich Text Format processor for Apertium

SYNOPSIS
     apertium-desrtf [-hin] [input_file [output_file]]

DESCRIPTION
     apertium-desrtf is an RTF format processor.  Data should be passed through this processor before being piped to lt-proc(1).  The program takes input in the form of an RTF document and produces output
     suitable for processing with lt-proc(1).  RTF commands and other format information are enclosed in brackets so that lt-proc(1) treats them as whitespace between words.

OPTIONS
     -h, --help

     -i      Makes the addition of trailing sentence terminator (‘.’) unconditional, often leading to duplicates.

     -n      Suppresses the addition of a trailing sentence terminator.

EXAMPLES
     You could write the following to show how the input document is analysed:
           cat input.rtf | apertium-desrtf | lt-proc ca-es.automorf.bin
