NAME
       update-boinc-applinks - create/remove symbolic links for anonymous BOINC applications

SYNOPSIS
       update-boinc-applinks [options]

DESCRIPTION
       update-boinc-applinks creates (or removes) symbolic links for anonymous BOINC applications and their associated app_info.xml files in a given BOINC data directory.

       Note: update-boinc-applinks is an extension for Debian users and is only available in Debian's boinc-client package.

OPTIONS
       For a full summary of options, run update-boinc-applinks --help.

       -h, --help
              Show help message and all options.

       --create
              Create symbolic links and project directories.

       --remove
              Remove symbolic links and empty project directories.

       --data-dir=DIR
              Manage symbolic links in the given directory DIR. If this option is not present, DIR defaults to the current working directory.

       --project=PROJECT
              Manage  symbolic  links only for the given project PROJECT.  Run update-boinc-applinks --list-projects to get a list of projects for which anonymous applications are available and therefore can
              be replaced with PROJECT. If this option is not present, update-boinc-applinks will manage symbolic links for all available projects.

       --list-projects
              Show a list of projects for which anonymous applications are available. Normally those applications are provided by packages called boinc-app-PROJECT (e.g. boinc-app-seti).
