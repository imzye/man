NAME
       <gnu-triplet>-cross-exe-wrapper - Run an executable using CPU emulation if needed

SYNOPSIS
       <gnu-triplet>-cross-exe-wrapper <executable> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       <gnu-triplet>-cross-exe-wrapper can be used to wrap a program compiled the architecture designated by its prefix in GNU triplet form.  If the CPU happens to be able to run the program directly, it
       is run without emulation.  The personality(2) of the execution environment is adjusted if necessary.  The first argument must be a full path to the target executable.  All further arguments are
       forwarded to the target executable.
