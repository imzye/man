NAME
       ImVirt - detects several virtualizations

SYNOPSIS
           use ImVirt;
           print imv_get(IMV_PROB_DEFAULT, imv_detect()),"\n";

DESCRIPTION
       The "ImVirt" package tries to detect if it is run in a virtualization container. At least the following container should be detected:

       ARAnyM
       KVM
       lguest
       LXC
       OpenVZ
       QEMU
       UML
       VirtualBox
       Virtual PC/Server
       VMware
       Xen

DETECTION HEURISTIC
       The detection is based on a heuristic - you should not trust the result at all.

       ImVirt probes for different well-known characteristics of different virtualization containers. Any characteristics found or not found are weighted by their significance.

       The result of the heuristic is a weighted tree. The leaves are the (not) detected containers.

FUNCTIONS
       The following functions should be used to retrieve the detected virtualization containers:

       imv_get($prob) Returns exactly one string describing the detected container. If the detected container has a smaller match probability than $prob the string 'Unknown' is returned.
       imv_get_all() Returns a hash any positive detected containers as keys and their corresponding match probability as value.
       imv_get_pos_results() Returns a list of all possible results which might be returned by all detection modules. The list entries might be appended by some additional data like version numbers etc.
