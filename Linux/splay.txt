NAME
       splay - MPEG-1,2 Audio layer 1,2,3 file player

SYNOPSIS
       splay [-2VMfmrsv] [-k num] [-d dev] [-l list] [-t num] filenames...

DESCRIPTION
       Splay is the sound file player such as MPEG-1,2 Audio files.  And you can play these files using list file.  With pthread, it can play sound files smoother.

OPTIONS
       Splay has several options.

       -2     play MPEG-Audio files with half-frequency.  If you use this option, you may play MPEG audio files with job which exhausts CPU very much.
       -f     display info on played and remaining frames and time.
       -m     force to mono.  Play with mono even if file is in stereo.
       -r     Repeat forever.  If you -r with -s, list files are shuffled every time.
       -s     Shuffle play. If you give list file or a number of files, Splay will rearrange them randomly. And with -r every time the order of files is changed.
       -v[v[v]]
              Verbose, Very verbose, Very very verbose.
       -M     Play MPEG file from standard input.
       -V     Show version number.
       -t  num
              num  of frames were saved during playing. When CPU is so busy and prevents splay from decoding, splay will play back using saved frames. This feature lets you do other job freely while
              listening to MPEG music.
       -k  num
              num of frames are skipped at the start of playing.
       -d  dev
              Change device file. Default device file is /dev/dsp.  If you can't use this device file or you can output raw type data to file, you can use this option.  If the first character of dev
              is / , dev would be considered as device file, If the first character of dev is - , dev would be considered as standard output, otherwise dev would be considered as normal file.
       -l  list
              Select list file.  http:// can be used. (e.g. http://localhost/abc.m3u)
       filenames
              You can put several files, and use http:// If you use -l option, these will be ignored.
