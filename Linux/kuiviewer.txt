NAME
       kuiviewer - a viewer for Qt Designer user interface files

SYNOPSIS
       kuiviewer [ generic-options ] [ ui-file... ]

       kuiviewer [ generic-options ] { -s, --takescreenshot filename } [ -w, --screenshotwidth int ] [ -h, --screenshotheight int ] ui-file

DESCRIPTION
       KUIViewer is a utility to display and test the user interface (.ui) files generated by Qt Designer.  The interfaces can be displayed in a variety of different widget styles.

       Normally  KUIViewer  launches a full GUI, allowing the user to interact with the given interface.  By passing the --takescreenshot option, you can make KUIViewer dump a screenshot of the interface
       instead and exit immediately.  Other options are available to control precisely how this screenshot is constructed.

       This application is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.

OPTIONS
       Below are the kuiviewer-specific options.  For a full summary of options, run kuiviewer --help.

       -s, --takescreenshot filename
              Take a screenshot of the given interface and exit immediately.  The filename argument specifies where the screenshot will be saved.  This screenshot will be saved in PNG format.

       -w, --screenshotwidth int
              Before taking a screenshot, resize the interface to the given width.

       -h, --screenshotheight int
              Before taking a screenshot, resize the interface to the given height.
