OPTIONS
       -s STAGE, --stage STAGE
               Starts  processing  at  a  given stage. This is used in case you had to stop processing, or a file was missing, or things generally blew up. It is especially useful if a burn fails because
               then you don't have to start totally over and re-WAV the files. If you just want to perform a single step, use --quit to abort after the stage you request with --stage. Also see --skip.

               clean   This is the default starting stage. The temp directory is cleared out.  A playlist is required, since we expect to move to the build stage next, which requires it.

               build   This stage examines the playlist from the command line, and tries to create a list of symlinks from the given playlist. So far, "mp3cd" can  understand  ".m3u"  files,  XMLPlaylist
                       files, and lists of files.

               decode  All the files are converted into WAVs. So far, "mp3cd" knows how to decode MP3, Ogg, and FLAC files. (WAVs will be left as they are during this stage.)

               correct The WAV files are corrected to have the correct bitrate and number of channels, as required for an audio CD.

               norm    The WAV files' volumes are normalized so any large differences in volume between records will be less noticeable.

               toc     Generates a Table of Contents for the audio CD.

               toc_ok  Validates the TOC, just in case something went really wrong with the WAV files.

               cdr_ok  Verifies that there is a CDR ready for burning.

               burn    Actually performs the burn of all the WAV files to the waiting CDR.

       -q, --quit
               Aborts after one stage of processing. See --stage.

       -t DIR, --tempdir DIR
               Use  a working directory other than "/tmp/mp3cd-username". This is where all the file processing occurs. You will generally need at least 650M free here (or more depending on the recording
               length of your destination CD).

       -d PATH, --device PATH
               Use a device path other than "/dev/cdrecorder".

       -r TYPE, --driver TYPE
               Use a CDRDAO driver other than what cdrdao automatically detects. Note that some drivers may not support CD-TEXT mode. In this case, try "generic-mmc-raw".

       -c ARGS, --cdrdao ARGS
               Pass the given option string of ARGS to cdrdao during each command.

       -n, --simulate
               Do not actually write to the disc but simulate the process instead.

       -E, --no-eject
               Don't eject drive after the burn.

       -L, --no-log
               Don't redirect output to "tool-output.txt". All information will instead be redirected to the terminal via standard output (STDOUT). This will  cause  a  lot  of  low-level  detail  to  be
               displayed.

       -T, --no-cd-text
               Don't attempt to write CD-TEXT tags to the audio CD. Some devices and drivers do not support this mode. See --driver for more details.

       -S STAGES, --skip STAGES
               While  processing, skips the stages listed in the comma-separated list of stages given in STAGES. This would only be used if you really know what you're doing. For example, if the audio is
               already normalized and you didn't want to burn a CD, you could skip the normalizing and burning stages by giving "--skip norm,burn". See --stage and --quit.

       -V, --version
               Report which version of mp3cd this is.

       -v, --verbose
               Shows commands as they are executed.

       -h, --usage
               Show brief usage summary.

       --help  Show detailed help summary.

       --longhelp
               Shows the full command line instructions.

DESCRIPTION
       This script implements the suggested methods outlined in the Linux MP3 CD Burning mini-HOWTO:
        <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-CD-Burning/>

       This will burn a playlist (.m3u, XMLPlaylist or command line list) of MP3s, Oggs, FLACs, and/or WAVs to an audio CD. The ".m3u" format is really  nothing  more  than  a  list  of  fully  qualified
       filenames. The script handles making the WAVs sane by resampling if needed, and normalizing the volume across all tracks.

       If  a  failure happens, earlier stages can be skipped with the '-s' flag.  The file "tool-output.txt" in the temp directory can be examined to see what went wrong during the stage. Some things are
       time-consuming (like decoding the audio into WAVs) and if the CD burn fails, it's much nicer not to have to start over from scratch. When doing this, you will not need the m3u file any more, since
       the files have already been built. See the list of stages using '-h'.

PREREQUISITES
       Requires "cdrdao", and that /dev/cdrecorder is a valid symlink to the /dev/sg device that cdrdao will use. Use .cdrdao to edit driver options. (See "man cdrdao" for details.)

       Requires "sox" to decode MP3 and check/correct WAV formats.
        http://www.spies.com/Sox/

       Requires "normalize" to process the audio.
        http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cvaill/normalize/

       Optionally requires "oggdec" to decode Ogg to WAV files.
        http://www.gnu.org/directory/audio/ogg/OggEnc.html/

       Optionally requires "flac" to decode flac to WAV files.
        http://flac.sourceforge.net/

       Optionally requires "Config::Simple" Perl module if you want to use the .mp3cdrc file.
        http://search.cpan.org/~sherzodr/Config-Simple/

FILES
       ~/.mp3cdrc
               Default options can be recorded in this file. The option names are the same as their command line long-name. Command line options will override these values. All options  are  run  through
               perl's eval. For example:
                   tempdir: /scratch/mp3cd/$ENV{'USER'}
                   device: /dev/burner
