NAME
       mpg321 — Simple and lightweight command line MP3 player

SYNOPSIS
       mpg321 [options] file(s) | URL(s) | -

DESCRIPTION
       mpg321 is a free command-line mp3 player, which uses the mad audio decoding library. mpg321 was written to be a drop-in replacement for the (by-then) non-free mpg123 player.  Some functions remain
       unimplemented, but mpg321 should function as a basic drop-in replacement for mpg123 front-ends such as gqmpeg, and those programs which use mpg123 to decode mp3 files (like gtoaster, and other CD-
       recording software).

OPTIONS
       -o devicetype
                 Set the output device type to devicetype.  devicetype can be one of:

                 oss - the Linux Open Sound System;

                 sun - the Sun audio system;

                 alsa - the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture;

                 alsa09 - the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture, version 0.9;

                 esd - the Enlightened Sound Daemon;

                 arts - the analog real-time synthesiser

                 See -a device, below.

       -a device, --audiodevice device
                 Use  device for audio-out instead of the default device, depending on the output device you've chosen (via -o devicetype).  By default this is the native sound device.  Generally this is
                 the device for devicetype (or the default system device) to use for output (i.e. /dev/sound/dsp1).

                 This option has no effect with -o arts.

                 For -o esd, specify the host on which esd is running; defaults to localhost.

                 For -o alsa, specify audio device using the hw:x,y syntax, where x and y are numbers, default is hw:0,0.  For example, if there is only one device installed, in most  cases,  the  device
                 should be named hw:0,0.  When there is only one device, the device should always have the same name and numbers.

       -g N, --gain N
                 Set gain (volume) to N (1-100).

       -k N, --skip N
                 Skip N frames into the file being played.

       -n N, --frames N
                 Decode only the first N frames of the stream. By default, the entire stream is decoded.

       -@ list, --list list
                 Use the file list for a playlist. The list should be in a format of filenames followed by a line feed. Multiple -@ or --list specifiers will be ignored; only the last -@ or --list option
                 will  be  used.  The  playlist  is  concatenated  with filenames specified on the command-line to produce one master playlist. A filename of '-' will cause standard input to be read as a
                 playlist.

       -z, --shuffle
                 Shuffle playlists and files specified on the command-line. Produces a randomly-sorted playlist which is then played through once.

       -Z, --random
                 Randomise playlists and files specified on the command-line. Files are played through, choosing at random; this means that random files will be played for as long as mpg321 is running.

       -v, --verbose
                 Be more verbose. Show current byte, bytes remaining, time, and time remaining, as well as more information about the mp3 file.

       -s, --stdout
                 Use standard output instead of an audio device for output. Output is in 16-bit PCM, little-endian.

       -w N, --wav N
                 Write to wav file N instead of using the audio device. This option will be preferred if --cdr or --au are specified too. Specifying '-' for N will cause the file to be written  to  stan‐
                 dard output.

       --cdr N   Write to cdr file N instead of using the audio device. Specifying '-' for N will cause the file to be written to standard output.

       --au N    Write to au file N instead of using the audio device. Specifying '-' for N will cause the file to be written to standard output.

       -t, --test
                 Test mode; do no output at all.

       -q, --quiet
                 Quiet mode; suppress output of mpg123 boilerplate and file and song name.

       -B        Read recursively the given directories. Allows you to define only the directory or directories and then mpg321 recursively plays all the songs.

       -F        Turn on FFT analysis on PCM data. Remote mode only

       -S        Report song to AudioScrobbler (last.fm).

       -x        Set xterm title setting

       -b        Number of decoded frames for the output buffer.

       -K        Enable Basic Keys.

       -R        "Remote control" mode. Useful for front-ends. Allows seeking and pausing of mp3 files. See README.remote (in /usr/share/doc/mpg321 on Debian and some other systems.)

       -3, --restart
                 Restart "remote shell". Used only when in "Remote control" mode.

       --stereo  Force stereo output: duplicates mono stream on second output channel. Useful for output for devices that don't understand mono, such as some CD players.

       --aggressive
                 Aggressive mode; try to get higher priority on the system. Needs root permissions.

       --skip-printing-frames=N
                 Skip N frames between printing a frame status update, in both Remote Control (-R) and verbose (-v) mode. Can help CPU utilisation on slower machines. This is an mpg321-specific option.

       -l N, --loop N
                 Loop song or playlist N times.If N is 0 means infinite times.

       --help, --longhelp
                 Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
                 Show version of program.

Basic keys (enabled with -K):
        * or /   Increase or decrease volume.

        n        Skip song.

        m        Mute/unmute.
