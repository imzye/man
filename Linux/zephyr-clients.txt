NAME
       zstat - display Zephyr statistics

SYNOPSIS
       zstat [ -h ] [ -s ] [ host ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zstat is used to display statistics reported by a HostManager, zhm(8), or a Zephyr Server zephyrd(8), or both.

       -h          is used to indicate that only HostManager statistics should be displayed.

       -s          is used to indicate that only server statistics should be displayed.

       If no hosts are specified, the current host is assumed.
                   When both HostManager and server statistics are displayed, statistics from the current server for each host are displayed.
