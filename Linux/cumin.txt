                       [-m {sync,async}] [-p PCT] [-b BATCH_SIZE] [-s BATCH_SLEEP] [-x]
                       [-o {txt,json}] [-i] [-n] [--force] [--backend BACKEND]
                       [--transport {clustershell}] [--dry-run] [--no-progress]
                       [--version] [-d] [--trace]
                       HOSTS_QUERY [COMMAND ...]

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       HOSTS_QUERY
              Hosts selection query

       COMMAND
              Command to be executed. If no commands are specified, --dry-run is set.

NAMED ARGUMENTS
       -c, --config
              configuration file. [default: /etc/cumin/config.yaml]

       --global-timeout
              Global timeout in seconds (int) for the whole execution. [default: None (unlimited)]

       -t, --timeout
              Timeout in seconds (int) for the the execution of every command in each host. [default: None (unlimited)]

       -m, --mode
              Possible choices: sync, async

              Execution  mode, required when there are multiple COMMANDS to be executed. In sync mode, execute the first command on all hosts, then proceed with the next one only if -p/--success-percent‐
              age is reached. In async mode, execute on each host independently from each other, the list of commands, aborting the execution on any given host at the first command that fails.

       -p, --success-percentage
              Possible choices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,  43,  44,
              45,  46,  47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91,
              92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100

              Percentage threshold to consider an execution unit successful. Required in sync mode, optional in async mode when -b/--batch-size is used. Accepted values are integers in the  range  0-100.
              [default: 100]

       -b, --batch-size
              The  commands will be executed with a sliding batch of this size. The batch mode depends on the -m/--mode option when multiple commands are specified. In sync mode the first command is exe‐
              cuted in batch to all hosts before proceeding with the next one. In async mode all commands are executed on the first batch of hosts, proceeding with the next hosts as soon as one host com‐
              pletes all the commands. The -p/--success-percentage is checked before starting the execution in each host. It accept an absolute integer (i.e. 10) or a  percentage  (i.e.  50%).  [default:
              None (# of hosts)]

       -s, --batch-sleep
              Sleep in seconds (float) to wait before starting the execution on the next host when -b/--batch-size is used. [default: None]

       -x, --ignore-exit-codes
              USE WITH CAUTION! Treat any executed command as successful, ignoring the exit codes. [default: False]

       -o, --output
              Possible choices: txt, json

              Specify a different output format. [default: None]

       -i, --interactive
              Drop into a Python shell with the results. [default: False]

       -n, --no-colors
              Disable colored output. [default: False]

       --force
              USE WITH CAUTION! Force the execution without confirmation of the affected hosts. [default: False]

       --backend
              Override  the  default  backend  selected in the configuration file for this execution. The backend-specific configuration must be already present in the configuration file. One of [direct,
              knownhosts, openstack, puppetdb] or any external backend listed in the configuration file [default: None]

       --transport
              Possible choices: clustershell

              Override the default transport selected in the configuration file for this execution. The transport-specific configuration must already be present in the configuration file. [default: None]

       --dry-run
              Do not execute any command, just return the list of matching hosts and exit. [default: False]

       --no-progress
              Do not show the progress bars during execution.

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -d, --debug
              Set log level to DEBUG. See also log_file in the configuration. [default: False]

       --trace
              Set log level to TRACE, a custom logging level intended for development debugging. See also log_file in the configuration. [default: False]
