NAME
       gpsdebuginfo - Generate a gpsd debug dump of your host.

SYNOPSIS
       gpsdebuginfo

DESCRIPTION
       gpsdebuginfo is a shell script to run a series of short tests to see the state of gpsd on you machine. Run it, and send the complete output, without change, when you request support help.

       The script should not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You may wish to study the output before sending it to verify that.

       gpsdebuginfo should be run as root. It may be run as a normal user, but with loss of functionality. Running under sudo may cause misleading results.

OPTIONS
       None.

ENVIRONMENT
       This script depends on the following environment variables:

       PATH
           To find gpsd, gpspipe, and other installed gpsd parts.

       PYTHONPATH
           To find the gps Python module.

RETURN VALUES
       0
           on success.
