NAME
       bf_tar - shell script to write a tar file of a bogofilter directory to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       bf_tar [-r] [-R] bogofilter_directory

DESCRIPTION
       bf_tar bundles a bogofilter working directory in tar format and copies it to standard output (your console, or where you redirect it, see EXAMPLES below).

OPTIONS
       The -r option causes bf_tar to remove inactive log files after the archive has been written successfully. The default is to leave log files.

       The -R option causes bf_tar to remove inactive log files before the archive is written. This may reduce chances that the resulting archive is recoverable should it become damaged. The archive may be
       smaller though. The default is to leave log files.

EXIT STATUS
       The script exits with status code 0 if everything went well, and nonzero if it encountered trouble.

EXAMPLES
       ·   bf_tar ~/.bogofilter > outfile.tar

           Writes a standard .tar file containing the essential files from ~/.bogofilter to outfile.tar.

       ·   bf_tar ~/.bogofilter | gzip -9 -c > outfile.tar.gz

           Writes a gzipped .tar.gz file containing the essential files from ~/.bogofilter to outfile.tar.gz.

       ·   bf_tar `pwd`/mydirectory > outfile.tar

           Prepend $(pwd)/ or `pwd`/ if you want to specify an absolute path instead of a relative path.

NOTES
       This script is meant for use with Berkeley DB based bogofilter versions.

       This script requires a SUSv2 compliant pax utility.

       This script expects a SUSv2 compliant shell. Solaris systems should have the SUNWxcu4 package installed (when bogofilter is configured) so that /usr/xpg4/bin/sh can be used.
