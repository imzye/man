NAME
       XML::Struct::Simple - Transform MicroXML data structures into simple (unordered) form

SYNOPSIS
           my $micro = [
               root => { xmlns => 'http://example.org/' },
               [ '!', [ x => {}, [42] ] ]
           ];
           my $converter = XML::Struct::Simple->new( root => 'record' );
           my $simple = $converter->transform( $micro );
           # { record => { xmlns => 'http://example.org/', x => 42 } }

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a transformation from structured XML (MicroXML) to simple key-value format (SimpleXML) as known from XML::Simple: Attributes and child elements are treated as hash keys with
       their content as value. Text elements without attributes are converted to text and empty elements without attributes are converted to empty hashes.

       XML::Struct can export the function "simpleXML" for easy use. Function "readXML" and XML::Struct::Reader apply transformation to SimpleXML with option "simple".

METHODS
   transform( $element )
       Transform XML given as array reference (MicroXML) to XML as hash reference (SimpleXML) as configured.

   transform_content( $element [, $depth ] )
       Transform child nodes and attributes of an XML element given as array reference at a given depth (0 by default). Returns a hash reference, a scalar, or the element unmodified.

CONFIGURATION
       root
           Keep  the root element instead of removing. This corresponds to option "KeepRoot" in XML::Simple. In addition a non-numeric value can be used to override the name of the root element. Disabled
           by default.

       attributes
           Include XML attributes. Enabled by default. The special value "remove" is equivalent to false. Corresponds to option "NoAttr" in XML::Simple.

       content
           Name of a field to put text content in. Set to ""content" by default.  Corresponds to option "ContentKey" in XML::Simple.

       depth
           Only transform up to a given depth. Set to a negative value by default for unlimited depth. Elements below depth are not cloned but copied by  reference.   Depth  0  will  return  the  element
           unmodified.

       Option "KeyAttr", "ForceArray", and other fetures of XML::Simple not supported. Options "NsExpand" and "NsStrip" supported in XML::LibXML::Simple are not supported yet.
