NAME
       imapcopy - IMAP backup, copy and migration tool

SYNOPSIS

       imapcopy

DESCRIPTION
       Read imapcopy -h for reference. An example configuration file can be found in the directory /usr/share/doc/imapcopy/examples.

       Sadly IMAPCopy does not have builtin SSL/TLS support, so you can not connect to most modern IMAP servers. A workaround is to run stunnel -c -f -d 1143 -r imap.boh.org:993 -P '' in parallel with
       IMAPCopy and then modify the configuration to connect to port 1143 on localhost. Here we have assumed that imap.boh.org is your IMAP server. Note, that if you need this hack for both source and
       destination, then you have to use two instances of stunnel and you have to configure them for different ports, of course (e.g. 1143 and 2143).
