HISTORY
       pipes.sh was originally created by Matthew Simpson and posted to the Arch Linux Forums in early 2010. It was also later posted to Gist released in the public domain.

       In early 2013, Yu-Jie Lin posted a modification of the script to Gist after reading about it on a blog.  It was maintained on Gist independently for a period of a few months.

       In  2014,  the  script was given its own GitHub repository as a project which encouraged contributions from other developers. As the project gained more popularity the decision was made to combine
       forces with developers of similar projects.

       Finally in 2015, the MIT License was added and the Pipeseroni collective was formed (see LINKS below) to maintain the project.
