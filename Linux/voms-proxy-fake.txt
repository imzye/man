NAME
       voms-proxy-fake - create a proxy with VOMS extensions

SYNOPSIS
       voms-proxy-fake [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The voms-proxy-fake generates a proxy containing arbitrary attributes without contacting the VOMS server.

OPTIONS
       Options may be specified indifferently with either a "-" or "--" prefix.

       -help Displays usage.

       -version Displays version.

       -debug Enables extra debug output.

       -q Quiet mode, minimal output.

       -verify Verifies certificate to make proxy for.

       -pwstdin Allows passphrase from stdin.

       -limited Creates a limited proxy.

       -hours  H Proxy is valid for H hours (default:12).

       -vomslife  H Tries to get an AC with information valid for H hours. The default is "as long as the proxy certificate". The special value 0 means as long as the server will allow.

       -bits  B Number of bits in key {0|512|1024|2048|4096}. 0 is a special value which means: same number of bits as in the issuing certificate.

       -cert  certfile Non-standard location of user certificate

       -key  keyfile Non-standard location of user key

       -certdir  certdir Location of trusted certificates dir

       -out  proxyfile Location of new proxy cert

       -voms  voms[:command] Specifies the fake VOMS server that will appear in the attribute certificate. command is ignored and is present for compatibility with voms-proxy-init.

       -include  file Includes file in the certificate (in a non critical extension)

       -conf  file Read options from file.

       -policy The file containing the policy expression.

       -policy-language pl The language in which the policy is expressed. Default is IMPERSONATION_PROXY.

       -path-length Maximum depth of proxy certfificate that can be signed from this.

       -globus  version Underlying Globus version.

       -proxyver Version of the proxy certificate to create. May be 2 or 3. Default value is decided upon underlying globus version.

       -separate  file Saves the voms credential on file file.

       -hostcert  file The cert that will be used to sign the AC.

       -hostkey  file The key thet will be used to sign the AC.

       -fqan  file The string that will be included in the AC as the granted FQAN.

       -newformat

       This forces the server to generate ACs in the new (correct) format. This is meant as a compatibility feature to ease migration while the servers upgrade to the new version.

       -newsubject  newdn

       The  created proxy will have newdn as subject rather than what is would normally have depending on the specific version of proxy created. Non-printable characters may be specified via the '\XX' encod‐
       ing, where XX are two hexadecimal characters.

       -newissuer  newdn

       The created proxy will have newdn as issuer rather than what is would normally have depending on the specific version of proxy created. Non-printable characters may be specified via the  '\XX'  encod‐
       ing, where XX are two hexadecimal characters.

       -newserial  newserial

       The  created  proxy  will  have  the  newserial as its serial number. The new serial number will have to be specified as an hex representation. Any length is possible. If this option is not specified,
       voms-proxy-fake will choose the serial number.

       -pastac  timespec

       The created AC will have its validity start in the past, as specified by timespec.

       The format of timespec is one of: seconds, hours:minutes, hours:minutes:seconds

       -pastproxy  timespec

       The created proxy will have its validity start in the past as specified by timespec

       The format of timespec is one of: seconds, hours:minutes, hours:minutes:seconds

       -nscert  bit,...,bit

       The created proxy will have the specified bits in the Netscape Certificate Extension. Acceptable values for bit are: client, server, email, objsign, sslCA, emailCA, objCA. The default value is not  to
       have this extension.

       -extkeyusage  bit,...,bit

       The  created  proxy  will  have  the  specified  bits in the Extended Key Usage Extension. Acceptable values for bit are: serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection, timeStamping, msCodeInd,
       msCodeCom, msCTLSign, msSGC, msEFS, nsSGC, deltaCRL. The default value is not to have this extensions.

       -keyusage  bit,...,bit

       The created proxy will have the specified bits in the Key Usage Extensions. Acceptable values for bit are: digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment,  keyAgreement,  keyCert‐
       Sign, cRLSign, encipherOnly, decipherOnly. The default value is to copy this extensions from the issuer certificate while removing the keyCertSign and nonRepudiation bits if present.

       -selfsigned

       The created certificate will be a self-signed certificate and have a CA=true bit in the Basic constraints Exception.

       -extension  oid[/criticality]value

       This option allows to specified additional extensions to be put in the created certificate.

       oid is the Object Identifier of the extensions. Any OID may be used even if it is not already known in advance. This must always be specified. There is no default.

       criticality specifies whether the extensions is critical or not, and it must be either true or false. If absent, it defaults to false.

       value  is  the  value  of  the  extensions. It is composed by two subfields, type and content. type is a single charater, and specifies how the content is interpreted. ':' means that content is a text
       string to be included as is. '~' means that content is an hex representation of the string. '+' means that content is the name of a file which will contain the actual data.

       -acextension  oid[/criticality]value

       This option allows to specified additional extensions to be put in the created attribute certificate.

       -ga  id = value  [(qualifier)]

       This option adds the generic attribute specified to the AC generated. Please note that spaces before and after the '=' char are swallowed in the command line.

       -voinfo  file

       The  file  file contains informations for additional ACs that should be included in the created proxy. ACs specified via the -voinfo option shall be added before ACs specified via the command line op‐
       tions.

       The format of the file is the following:

       [voname]

       parameter=value

       parameter=value

       ...
