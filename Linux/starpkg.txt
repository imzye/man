NAME
       starpkg - convert a StarPlot data set to StarPlot file format

SYNOPSIS
       starpkg [ --dataset ] data-set [ --dest destination ]
       starpkg --recurse input-dir [ --dest destination ]

DESCRIPTION
       On  the  StarPlot  web  site are available some packages of data that include both an original data file from NASA, and also a  specification file.  These packages are referred to as "data sets", from
       which starconvert(1) can produce a data file in StarPlot format.  For ease of use, this should be done via the starpkg shell script.

USAGE
       Assuming that data-set is a valid StarPlot data set (either in tar.gz format or a directory resulting from uncompressing the tar.gz file), the `starpkg --dataset' command converts it  to  a  StarPlot-
       formatted  data file.  Note that the `--dataset' flag is optional, and the name of the input data set may be specified without it.  In order to be a valid StarPlot data set, a directory or tar.gz file
       must contain at least a valid specification file whose name ends with `.spec' and a flat text data file named `catalog.dat'.

       If the `--dest' option is omitted, the default location of the output file is the first of the directories /usr/share/starplot, $PWD, $HOME in which the user has write  permissions.   If  `--dest'  is
       omitted  or  destination  is  a  directory,  the  name  of  the output file will by default be ${specfilename%.spec}.stars.  For instance, a data set containing gliese.3.spec will produce a file named
       gliese.3.stars.

       The `starpkg --recurse' form of the command executes the above action for every StarPlot data set contained in input-dir, placing the resulting StarPlot data files to the directory  destination.   (If
       the  --dest option is omitted, the default destination directory is chosen as above.)  This form of the starpkg command is most useful when a new version of StarPlot has been installed and you wish to
       regenerate all StarPlot data files from data sets using the new starconvert program.

OPTIONS
       --dataset, -s
              Specify a directory or tar.gz file to use as a StarPlot data set.

       --dest, -d
              Specify the file or directory in which to output StarPlot-format data files.

       --quiet, -q
              Print only fatal errors to the terminal.

       --recurse, -r
              Specify a directory in which to search for StarPlot data sets.

       --starconvert-option option
              Pass option through to starconvert.  If you wish to pass more than one option (or an option that takes a following argument), you should give this flag multiple times, once for each starconvert
              option or argument.

       --verbose, -v
              Print all starconvert output to the terminal.
