NAME
       xbattbar — show battery status in X Window

SYNOPSIS
       xbattbar [-a] [-t thickness] [-p interval] [-I color] [-O color] [-i color] [-o color] [-c] [-r] [-s script-name] [top | bottom | left | right]

DESCRIPTION
       xbattbar  shows  the  current (laptop) battery status in the X window environment.  Battery status is obtained through the APM kernel module.  The APM kernel module depends on your UNIX plat‐
       form, therefore, consult your documentation for its detail.

       xbattbar shows its battery status in a simple bar indicator.  -a option makes the indicator window keep always on top of your screen.  The thickness of the indicator is 3  pixels  in  default
       and  you can set the thickness as a parameter of -t option.  This indicator is appeared in the bottom of the display, as its default.  The option top, left, or right forces the status indica‐
       tor to be at the top, left, and right of the display, respectively.  Though it's a default, you can also use buttom as the option.

       In the case the AC line is on-line (plugged in), its color of the bar indicator consists of "green" and "olive drab" portions.  The "green" portion shows its battery  charging  level.   These
       colors  can  be changed by -I and -O options.  In the other case (AC line is off-line), the "blue" portion of the bar indicator shows the percentage of its remaining battery level.  The color
       conbination for the AC off-line case can be changed by -i and -o options.

       xbattbar tries to know its battery status in every 10 seconds in default.  This is achived by APM polling.

       If it is used with option -c then ACPI polling will be used.

       If it is used with option -r then sysfs polling will be used (thanks to Elena Grandi <elena.valhalla@gmail.com> for the script).

       You can use your external script for check battery status. It must print two lines to STDOUT 'battery=value' and 'ac_line=on|off

       -p option sets the polling interval in second.

       If the mouse cursor enters in the status indicator, the diagnosis window appears in the center of the display, which shows both AC line status and battery  remaining  level.   This  diagnosis
       window disappears if the mouse cursor leaves from the status indicator.
