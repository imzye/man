DSDP-COLOR(1)                    User Commands                   DSDP-COLOR(1)

NAME
       dsdp-color - Find an approximate coloring of a graph

SYNOPSIS
       dsdp-color [OPTIONS] GRAPH_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The  dsdp-color  program  reads a graph from a file, formulates the SDP
       relaxation of the k-coloring problem, solves the problem using the DSDP
       library,  and applies a randomized algorithm to generate an approximate
       solution.

       A positive semidefinite relaxation of the graph k-coloring problem  can
       be rewritten as
          Find       X>=0
          such that  X_ij <= 1 - 1/(k-1) for all edges (i,j).

OPTIONS
       -dloginfo N
              Set  the logging level (default 0).  More information is printed
              for higher numbers.

       -params FILE
              Read DSDP parameters from FILE

       -help  Print a help message

FILE FORMAT
       The input file should be in the following format:
              n m
              r1 c1 [w1]
              …
              im jm [wm]
       where n is the number of nodes, and m is the number of edges.  Each r/c
       pair  or  r/c/w triple describes one edge, where r is the row, c is the
       column, and w is the weight.  The weight defaults to 0.0.   The  weight
       is not used, except that a weight of 0.0 means to ignore the edge.
