NAME
       blobAndConquer - 3D platform shooting game

SYNOPSIS
       blobAndConquer [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       With  the  apparent defeat of Galdov and the reclaiming of the Fire, Time, Space and Reality Crystals the Blobs' battle was only just beginning. Bob had rescued many Blobs and fought many battles,
       but now he had an ever bigger task ahead of him. The Blobs' homeworld is still littered with the alien forces and Bob once again makes it his task to lead the counter attack. But even without Gal‐
       dov the aliens are still extremely well organised...

       They're Ready. Will You Be?
