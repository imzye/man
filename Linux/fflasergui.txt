NAME
       fflasergui - Watch laser scanner data remotely in real-time

SYNOPSIS
       fflasergui

DESCRIPTION
       This GUI application allows for viewing laser scanner data remotely. It
       connects to a Fawkes instance and reads the current data from the
       blackboard and updates as new data comes in. It can show high and low
       resolution laser interfaces, and visualize the data as beams, end
       points, or hull. The data can be freely zoomed, moved, and rotated by
       90 degrees.
