NAME
       Tk::waitVariableX - a waitVariable with extensions.

SYNOPSIS
        use Tk::waitVariableX;

        $splash->waitVariableX( [$millis, $destroy_splashscreen], \$v1, \$v2} );

DESCRIPTION
       This subroutine waits for a list of variables, with a timeout - the subroutine returns when one of the variables changes value or the timeout expires, whichever occurs first.

       Although the millisecond parameter is required, it may be zero, which effects no timeout. The milliscond paramter may also be an array of two elements, the first the millisecond value, and the
       second a normal Per/Tk callback. The callback is invoked just before waitVariableX returns.

       Callback format is patterned after the Perl/Tk scheme: supply either a code reference, or, supply an array reference and pass the callback code reference in the first element of the array,
       followed by callback arguments.
