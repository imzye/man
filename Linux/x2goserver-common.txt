NAME
       x2goserver.conf - X2Go Server Main Configuration File

SYNOPSIS
       x2goserver.conf

DESCRIPTION
       x2goserver.conf is the main configuration file for X2Go Server and the X2Go::Server Perl API.

SECTIONS
       The x2goserver.conf's configuration file format is an INI-based configuration format. It falls apart into sections and options with their values.

           [section1]
           sec1option1 = valueA
           sec1option2 = valueB
           ...

           [section2]
           sec2option1 = valueC
           sec2option2 = valueD
           ...

SECTION [limit users]
       In this section you can list up Posix users known to the system and specify the max. number of allowed simultaneous X2Go sessions in an X2Go Server farm.

SECTION [limit groups]
       In  this  section  you can list up Posix group names known to the system and specify the max. number of allowed simultaneous X2Go sessions in an X2Go Server farm. The session limitation applies to
       all users in the specified groups.

       If individual users are listed in section [limit users] and some of their groups are listed in section [limit groups], then the maximum value of allowed sessions will be chosen.

       If a user is a member of several of the specified groups under section [limit groups], then the number of allowed simultaneous X2Go sessions for a certain user will be derived from the group  with
       the most allowed sessions found under this section.

SECTION [log]
       The [log]'s section only option is the loglevel option. Allowed values are:

           emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug.

       The loglevel option controls the verbosity of the X2Go::Server Perl functions. The log output appears via LOCAL7 (normally: /var/log/syslog).

EXAMPLE
       The below configuration file is the default after installation of X2Go Server:

           [limit users]
           #user-foo=1

           [limit groups]
           #bar-group=1

           [log]
           # possible levels are:
           #   emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug
           loglevel=notice
