NAME
       python-pymzml-doc - mzML mass spectrometric data parsing (documentation)

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the python-pymzml-doc package. This package contains the documentation for the python3-pymzml software package. The documentation is provided in the form of
       source code (ReST files), in the form of HTML files and, finally, as a PDF-formatted file. The files are located in /usr/share/doc/python3-pymzml.

EXAMPLES
       A  number  of  useful  examples are shipped within the python3-pymzml package and can be found at /usr/share/doc/python3-pymzml/example_scripts. A number of the examples make use of functions
       contained in get_example_file.py via an import of that file's contents. It is suggested to copy this directory to a temporary place and to run python from inside that new directory so  as  to
       gain access to the features contained in that get_example_file.py file through an import (which would not work otherwise).
