ARGUMENTS
       Here are the most important options, more are listed in the full documentation:

       --help    Print the full documentation, not just this short overview.

       --input   Specify the input file name. Example:

                     graph-easy --input=input.txt

                 The format will be auto-detected, override it with --from.

       --output  Specify the output file name. Example:

                     graph-easy --output=output.txt input.txt

       --as      Specify the output format. Example:

                     graph-easy --as=ascii input.txt

                 Valid formats are:

                     ascii       ASCII art rendering
                     boxart      Unicode Boxart rendering
                     html        HTML
                     svg         Scalable Vector Graphics
                     graphviz    the DOT language
                     dot         alias for "graphviz"
                     txt         Graph::Easy text
                     vcg         VCG (Visualizing Compiler Graphs - a subset of GDL) text
                     gdl         GDL (Graph Description Language) text
                     graphml     GraphML

                 In addition, the following formats are understood and piped through the program specified with the --renderer option (default: dot):

                     bmp         Windows bitmap
                     gif         GIF
                     hpgl        HP-GL/2 vector graphic
                     jpg         JPEG
                     pcl         PCL printer language
                     pdf         PDF
                     png         PNG
                     ps          Postscript
                     ps2         Postscript with PDF notations (see graphviz documentation)
                     tga         Targa bitmap
                     tif         TIFF bitmap

                 The default format will be determined by the output filename extension, and is "ascii", if the output filename was not set.

                 You can also use ONE argument of the form "--as_ascii" or "--ascii".

       --from    Specify the input format. Valid formats are:

                     graphviz    the DOT language
                     txt         Graph::Easy text
                     vcg         VCG text
                     gdl         GDL (Graph Description Language) text

                 If not specified, the input format is auto-detected.

                 You can also use ONE argument of the form "--from_dot", etc.

       --renderer
                 The external program (default: "dot") used to render the output formats like "png", "jpg" etc. Some choices are "neato", "twopi", "fdp" or "circo".

       --parse   Input will only be parsed, without any output generation.  Useful in combination with "--debug=1" or "--stats". Example:

                     graph-easy input.txt --parse --debug=1

       --stats   Write various statistics about the input graph to STDERR. Best used in combination with "--parse":

                     graph-easy input.txt --parse --stats

       --timeout Set the timeout in seconds for the Graph::Easy layouter that generates ASCII, HTML, SVG or boxart output. If the layout does not finish in this time, it will be aborted. Example:

                     graph-easy input.txt --timeout=500

                 Conversion to DOT, VCG/GDL, GraphML or plain text ignores the timeout.

                 The default is 240 seconds (4 minutes).

       --verbose Write info regarding the conversion process to STDERR.

DESCRIPTION
       "graph-easy" reads a description of a graph (a connected network of nodes and edges, not a pie chart :-) and then converts this to the desired output format.

       By default, the input will be read from STDIN, and the output will go to STDOUT. The input is expected to be encoded in UTF-8, the output will also be UTF-8.

       It understands the following formats as input:

           Graph::Easy  http://bloodgate.com/perl/graph/manual/
           DOT          http://www.graphviz.org/
           VCG          http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~sander/html/gsvcg1.html
           GDL          http://www.aisee.com/

       The formats are automatically detected, regardless of the input file name, but you can also explicitly declare your input to be in one specific format.

       The output can be a dump of the graph in one of the following formats:

           Graph::Easy  http://bloodgate.com/perl/graph/manual/
           DOT          http://www.graphviz.org/
           VCG          http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~sander/html/gsvcg1.html
           GDL          http://www.aisee.com/
           GraphML      http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/

       In addition, "Graph::Easy" can also create layouts of graphs in one of the following output formats:

           HTML   SVG   ASCII   BOXART

       Note that for SVG output, you need to install the module Graph::Easy::As_svg first.

       As  a  shortcut,  you  can  also  specify  the  output format as 'png', this will cause "graph-easy" to pipe the input in graphviz format to the "dot" program to create a PNG file in one step. The
       following two examples are equivalent:

           graph-easy graph.txt --dot | dot -Tpng -o graph.png
           graph-easy graph.txt --png

OTHER ARGUMENTS
       "graph-easy" supports a few more arguments in addition to the ones from above:

       --version Write version info and exit.

       --debug=N Set the debug level (1..3). Warning, this will generate huge amounts of hard to understand output on STDERR. Example:

                         graph-easy input.txt --output=test.html --debug=1

       --png, --dot, --vcg, --gdl, --txt, --ascii, --boxart, --html, --svg
                 Given exactly one of these options, produces the desired output format.

EXAMPLES
   ASCII output
               echo "[ Bonn ] -- car --> [ Berlin ], [ Ulm ]" | graph-easy

               +--------+  car   +-----+
               |  Bonn  | -----> | Ulm |
               +--------+        +-----+
                 |
                 | car
                 v
               +--------+
               | Berlin |
               +--------+

   Graphviz example output
               echo "[ Bonn ] -- car --> [ Berlin ], [ Ulm ]" | graph-easy --dot
               digraph GRAPH_0 {

                 edge [ arrowhead=open ];
                 graph [ rankdir=LR ];
                 node [
                   fontsize=11,
                   fillcolor=white,
                   style=filled,
                   shape=box ];

                 Bonn -> Ulm [ label=car ]
                 Bonn -> Berlin [ label=car ]

               }

   VCG example output
               echo "[ Bonn ] -- car --> [ Berlin ], [ Ulm ]" | graph-easy --vcg
               graph: {
                 title: "Untitled graph"

                 node: { title: "Berlin" }
                 node: { title: "Bonn" }
                 node: { title: "Ulm" }

                 edge:  { label: "car" sourcename: "Bonn" targetname: "Ulm" }
                 edge:  { label: "car" sourcename: "Bonn" targetname: "Berlin" }

               }

   GDL example output
       GDL (Graph Description Language) is a superset of VCG, and thus the output will look almost the same as VCG:

               echo "[ Bonn ] -- car --> [ Berlin ], [ Ulm ]" | graph-easy --gdl
               graph: {
                 title: "Untitled graph"

                 node: { title: "Berlin" }
                 node: { title: "Bonn" }
                 node: { title: "Ulm" }

                 edge:  { label: "car" source: "Bonn" target: "Ulm" }
                 edge:  { label: "car" source: "Bonn" target: "Berlin" }

               }

   GraphML example output
       GraphML is XML:

               echo "[ Bonn ] -- car --> [ Berlin ], [ Ulm ]" | graph-easy --graphml
               <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
               <graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns"
                   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                   xsi:schemaLocation="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns
                    http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd">

                 <!-- Created by Graph::Easy v0.58 at Mon Aug 20 00:01:25 2007 -->

                 <key id="d0" for="edge" attr.name="label" attr.type="string"/>

                 <graph id="G" edgedefault="directed">
                   <node id="Berlin">
               </node>
                   <node id="Bonn">
               </node>
                   <node id="Ulm">
               </node>
                   <edge source="Bonn" target="Berlin">
                     <data key="d0">car</data>
               </edge>
                   <edge source="Bonn" target="Ulm">
                     <data key="d0">car</data>
               </edge>
                 </graph>
               <graphml>

CAVEATS
       Please note that it is impossible to convert 100% from one format to another format since every graph language out there has features that are unique to only this language.

       In addition, the conversion process always converts the input first into an Graph::Easy graph, and then to the desired output format.

       This means that only features and attributes that are actually valid in Graph::Easy are supported yet. Work in making Graph::Easy an universal format supporting as much as  possible  is  still  in
       progress.

       Attributes  that  are  not  yet supported natively by Graph::Easy are converted to custom attributes with a prefixed "x-format-", f.i. "x-dot-". Upon output to the same format, these are converted
       back, but conversion to a different format will lose these attributes.

       For a list of what problems still remain, please see the TODO file in the "Graph::Easy" distribution on CPAN:

       <http://search.cpan.org/~tels/Graph-Easy/>

       If you notice anything wrong, or miss attributes, please file a bug report on

       <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Graph-Easy>

       so we can fix it and include the missing things into Graph::Easy!
