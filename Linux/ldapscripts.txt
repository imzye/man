NAME
       ldapscripts - Scripts to manage POSIX accounts in your LDAP directory.

DESCRIPTION
       The ldapscripts are a set of shell (sh) scripts designed to manage POSIX accounts in an OpenLDAP directory. They can be used as standalone tools or within Samba 3.x's smb.conf file.

REQUIREMENTS
       The main requirements are the OpenLDAP client tools (ldapadd, ldapsearch, ldapdelete, ...). Other commands are called in the scripts but should come with your OS (sed, grep, cut, ...).

CONFIGURATION
       The  main  configuration  of the ldapscripts is usually the file /etc/ldapscripts/ldapscripts.conf (or /usr/local/etc/ldapscripts/ldapscripts.conf, depending on your system). Modify it to fit your
       needs before using the scripts. You can override that default path by defining the LDAPSCRIPTS_CONF environment variable.

       Each script also uses a "runtime" file, usually /usr/lib/ldapscripts/runtime (or /usr/local/lib/ldapscripts/runtime). You don't need to modify this file.

TEMPLATES
       Each script that adds information to the directory uses a template. Templates are directly embedded at the end of the scripts but it is also possible to use external template files (see GTEMPLATE,
       UTEMPLATE and MTEMPLATE variables in the configuration file). Each template consists of a preformatted LDIF file using special keywords that will be replaced on-the-fly. Sample files are  provided
       for  your  convenience  :  ldapaddgroup.template.sample, ldapadduser.template.sample and ldapaddmachine.template.sample. It is strongly advised to use those files instead of modifying the embedded
       (default) templates in the scripts.

       Sample templates include every keyword you can use. One special additional keyword is the <ask> keyword that will trigger user input to get the attribute value interactively.

USING AS STANDALONE TOOLS
       Each script can be used as a standard command-line tool. Check their man pages to get help.

USING WITH SAMBA 3.x
       Each Samba 3.x smb.conf "xxx script" option has a matching script. Modify you smb.conf file this way to call them :

       # [...]
       add machine script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapaddmachine '%u' sambamachines
       add user script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapadduser '%u' sambausers
       add group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapaddgroup '%g'
       add user to group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapaddusertogroup '%u' '%g'
       delete user script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapdeleteuser '%u'
       delete group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapdeletegroup '%g'
       delete user from group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapdeleteuserfromgroup '%u' '%g'
       set primary group script = /usr/local/sbin/ldapsetprimarygroup '%u' '%g'
       rename user script = /usr/local/sbin/ldaprenameuser '%uold' '%unew'
       # [...]

BUGS
       Sometimes, that kind of message may appear in the log file : Additional information: value does not conform to assertion syntax .  Setting slapd's debug level to  32  shows  additional  details  :
       get_ava: illegal value for attributeType uidNumber .  This is *not* a bug : the ldapscripts tend to use the power of LDAP filters to easily find users (or groups) using either a uidNumber (numeri‐
       cal  value)  or  a  uid  (string  value).  The following filter (used by ldapfinger(1)) will generate the above message if $_USER is a login : "(|(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(|(uid=$_USER)(uidNum‐
       ber=$_USER))) (&(objectClass=posixGroup)(|(cn=$_USER)(gidNumber=$_USER))))" because filter part "(uidNumber=$_USER)" requires an integer but gets a string. You can mostly ignore those warnings.
