NAME
       tigr-glimmer — Fine start/stop positions of genes in genome sequence

SYNOPSIS
       tigr-extract [genome-file options]

DESCRIPTION
       Program  extract  takes a FASTA format sequence file and a file with a list of start/stop positions in that file  (e.g., as produced by the  long-orfs  program) and extracts and outputs the speci‐
       fied sequences.

       The first command-line argument is the name of the sequence file, which must be in FASTA format.

       The second command-line argument is the name of the coordinate file.  It must contain a list of pairs of positions in the first file, one per line.  The format of each entry is:

       <IDstring>>  <start position>  <stop position>

       This file should contain no other information, so if you're using the output of  glimmer  or  long-orfs , you'll have to cut off header lines.

       The output of the program goes to the standard output and has one line for each line in the coordinate file.  Each line contains the  IDstring , followed by white space, followed by the  substring
       of  the sequence file specified by the coordinate pair.  Specifically, the substring starts at the first position of the pair and ends at the second position (inclusive).  If the first position is
       bigger than the second, then the DNA reverse complement of each position is generated.  Start/stop pairs that "wrap around" the end of the genome are allowed.

OPTIONS
       -skip     makes the output omit the first 3 characters of each sequence, i.e., it skips over the start codon.  This was the behaviour of the previous version of the program.

       -l        makes the output omit an sequences shorter than  n  characters.  n  includes the 3 skipped characters if the  -skip  switch is one.
