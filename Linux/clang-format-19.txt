NAME
       clang-format-diff.py - manual page for clang-format-diff.py 19

DESCRIPTION
       usage: clang-format-diff.py [-h] [-i] [-p NUM] [-regex PATTERN]

       [-iregex PATTERN] [-sort-includes] [-v]
              [-style STYLE] [-fallback-style FALLBACK_STYLE] [-binary BINARY]

       This script reads input from a unified diff and reformats all the changed lines. This is useful to reformat all the lines touched by a specific patch.  Example usage for git/svn users:

              git diff -U0 --no-color --relative HEAD^ | clang-format-diff.py -p1 -i svn diff --diff-cmd=diff -x-U0 | clang-format-diff.py -i

       It  should  be noted that the filename contained in the diff is used unmodified to determine the source file to update. Users calling this script directly should be careful to ensure that the path
       in the diff is correct relative to the current working directory.

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -i     apply edits to files instead of displaying a diff

       -p NUM strip the smallest prefix containing P slashes

       -regex PATTERN
              custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat (case sensitive, overrides -iregex)

       -iregex PATTERN
              custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat (case insensitive, overridden by -regex)

       -sort-includes
              let clang-format sort include blocks

       -v, --verbose
              be more verbose, ineffective without -i

       -style STYLE
              formatting style to apply (LLVM, GNU, Google, Chromium, Microsoft, Mozilla, WebKit)

       -fallback-style FALLBACK_STYLE
              The name of the predefined style used as afallback in case clang-format is invoked with-style=file, but can not find the .clang-formatfile to use.

       -binary BINARY
              location of binary to use for clang-format
