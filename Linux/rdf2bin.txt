NAME
       rdf2bin, rdf2com - convert an RDOFF object file to flat binary

SYNOPSIS
       rdf2bin [-o relocation-origin] [-p segment-alignment] [-f format] input-file output-file
       rdf2com [-p segment-alignment] input-file output-file
       rdf2ith [-o relocation-origin] [-p segment-alignment] input-file output-file
       rdf2srec [-o relocation-origin] [-p segment-alignment] input-file output-file

OPTIONS
       -o relocation-origin
              Relocate at origin relocation-origin.  If invoked as rdf2com, the default relocation origin will be 0x100. Else, the default origin is 0.

       -p segment-alignment
              Pad segments until their size is a multiple of segment-alignment.  By default, 16 is used.

       -f format
              Specify  the output format.  The currently supported formats are binary (bin), DOS COM (binary with origin 0x100) (com) Intel hex (ith or ihx), and Motorola S-Records (srec).  If not specified,
              the format is set by the command name.
