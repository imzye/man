NAME
       uniconv - convert text to native formats through Unicode

SYNOPSIS
       uniconv -out output-file [ -decode input-encoding ] [ -encode output-encoding ] [ input-file ] [ -todos ] [ -fromdos ] [ -tomac ] [ -frommac ]

DESCRIPTION
       uniconv  program decodes scripts with a certain encoding encodes them with some other encoding.  The scipt is a 16,8 or 7 bit-byte stream.  The converted text  will be sent to the standard output,
       even in case of 16-bit encoding methods,unless the output file is specified by the -out option.

       The -decode and -encode options are optional, the default converter is utf-8.  The program reads the Unicode map helper files (*.my) from the default directory /usr/share/data.  Simple 1-to-1  en‐
       coding  methods  can  be  added  on  the  fly  by  adding a a my-file, or setting your yudit.datapath property in ~/.yudit/yudit.properties or /usr/share/yudit/config/yudit.properties.  By default
       /usr/share/yudit/data and ~/.yudit/data are searched.

       My-files can be created by a program called The files can be converted between dos/unix/mac line-ending variants with -fromdos, -frommac, -todos, -tomac options. the default (not  scpecified  one)
       is Unix.  makeumap.

ENCODING
       If you received this program through the Yudit distribution, then as of today you can convert between the encoding methods below.

       utf-8  Yudit  recommends  this  format  for international information exchange.  ASCII text  will  get through  intact, while other Unicode characters will get their 8th bit set and the length  of
              the  code  will depend on how far away they are in the Unicode space.  This is the only transformation format that can encode both 16-bit (ucs-2) and 31-bit (ucs-4) Unicode.

       utf-8-s
              Hackers utf-8 format - it does not give an error message when a surrogate pair is decoded and it can encode a surrogate pair 'as is'.  This is not a  recommended  encoding  format  although
              this format is used to encode/decode clipboard data, in order to preserve input.

       utf-16 Although  16  is bigger than 8 this is still a compromise required by OSes like Windows that can not handle ucs-4 - this encoding produces 16-bit Unicode streams.  In addition to BMP it can
              convert 16 planes using the Unicode Surrogate Area.  This encoding can not convert anything above U+10FFFF (Plane 16).  The input byte order is recognized by the first  two  characters  BEM
              (byte-order-mark) U+FEFF. This format is used in Windows NT for documents like notepad .txt files.

       utf-16-be
              Big endian utf-16 converter.

       utf-16-le
              Littlen endian utf-16 converter.

       utf-7  This  is  the  recommended  format for international information exchange, when 7-bit can only be used. It can only handle 16-bit (utf-16) Unicode, for ucs-4 (above U+10FFFF) you should use
              utf-8 encoding.

       gb-18030
              This is a Chinese character encoding format based upon GB 18030.  It encodes the whole U+0000..U+10FFFF range, while being compatible with gb-2312.

       gb-2312-x11
              This is a Chinese character encoding format based upon GB 2312.  It is a 7-bit encoding format.

       gb-2312
              This is a Chinese character encoding format based upon GB 2312.  It is an 8-bit encoding format.

       big-5  This is a Chinese character encoding format based upon BIG5 encoding.  It is an 8-bit encoding format.

       hz     This is a Chinese character encoding format based upon "Hanzi" encoding.  It is a 7-bit encoding format.

       viscii This is a Vietnamese character encoding format.

       ucs-2-be
              This converts 16-bit Unicode (ucs-2) streams. The format takes care of big-endian variant.  Yudit does not recommend this format.

       ucs-2-le
              This converts 16-bit Unicode (ucs-2) streams. The format takes care of little-endian variant.  Yudit does not recommend this format.

       ucs-2  This converts 16-bit Unicode (ucs-2) streams.  The input byte order is recognized by the first two characters BEM (byte-order-mark) U+FEFF.  Yudit does not recommend this format.

       java   This  converts  \uxxxx  character escapes. When encoding, all characters above U+0080 will be escaped with a string like '\u0080'. When decoding the same format is decoded but, in addition,
              utf-8 format is also recognized, so it can also be used to recover data accidentally saved with the wrong encoding. The U+10000..U+10FFFF area is converted to surrogates and vice versa.

       java-s This converts \uxxxx character escapes. When encoding, all characters above U+0080 will be escaped with a string like '\u0080'. When decoding the same format is decoded  but,  in  addition,
              utf-8  format  is also recognized, so it can also be used to recover data accidentally saved with the wrong encoding. Surrogates are not treated specially during conversion - this is why it
              is not a recommended conversion.

FILES
       ~/.yudit/yudit.properties or /usr/share/yudit/config/yudit.properties
              can have yudit.datapath property. This is where the map files are kept.  By default /usr/share/yudit/data is searched.
