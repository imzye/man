DESCRIPTION
       installsieve  is  a  utility  that  allows  users to manage their sieve
       scripts kept on the server.

       NOTE:
          This program is deprecated. Please use sieveshell

OPTIONS
       -v name
              View script with the given name. The script  if  retrieved  suc‐
              cessfully is output to standard output.

       -l     List  all  of the scripts currently on the server. If one of the
              scripts is active an arrow is printed indicating that it is  the
              active script.

       -p port
              Port  to  connect  to. If left off this defaults to sieve as de‐
              fined in /etc/services.

       -i file
              Install a file onto the server. If a script with the  same  name
              already  exists  on  the server it is overwritten. Upon success‐
              fully putting the script on the server the script is set active.

       -a name
              Set name as the active script. The list of available  names  can
              be obtained from the -l option.

       -d name
              Delete the sieve script on the server with name.

       -m mechanism
              Force  installsieve  to use mechanism for authentication. If not
              specified the strongest authentication  mechanism  supported  by
              the  server  is  chosen.  Specify login to use the LOGIN command
              instead of AUTHENTICATE.

       -g name
              Get the sieve script with name  and  save  it  to  disk  with  a
              ".script"  extension. If a file with that name already exists it
              is overwritten.

       -u userid
              Userid/Authname to use for authentication; by default, the  cur‐
              rent user.
