           47 5    * * 7 /usr/bin/ftpwatch

       The user should then create a .ftpwatchrc file. If one is found the specifed files and directories in that file will be dired, and the result is stored as separate files in a .ftpwatch directory i
       the home directory.  diff(1) is invoked to find any changes since last run. If any are found, the output of diff is mailed to the user.

       -d<opt> passes the options in <opt> to diff when invoked to generate the change-repport sent to the user.

       Where  <Host>  is  the  hostname of the ftp server and <File> is the file or directory to watch. If you instead want to watch an entire directory structure recoursly you can add an R to the config
       line of the dir whoes subdirs you are intresed in, like this:

           <Host>:R:<File>
