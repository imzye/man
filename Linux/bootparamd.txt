NAME
       bootparams — boot parameter database

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/bootparams

DESCRIPTION
       The  bootparams  file specifies the boot parameters that diskless clients may request when booting over the network.  Each client supported by this server must have an entry in the bootparams file
       containing the pathnames for its root and (optionally) swap areas.

       Each line in the file (other than comment lines that begin with a #) specifies the client name followed by the pathnames that the client may request by their logical names.  The components of  the
       line are delimited with blank or tab, and may be continued onto multiple lines with a backslash.

       For example:

             dummy   root=host:/export/dummy/root \
                     swap=host:/export/dummy/swap \
                     dump=host:/export/dummy/swap

       When  the  client named "dummy" requests the pathname for its logical "root" it will be given the pathname “host:/export/dummy/root” as the response to its RPC request.  The "host:" component must
       be supplied.
