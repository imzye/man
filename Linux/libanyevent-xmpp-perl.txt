NAME
       AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MUC::Message - A room message

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       This message represents a message from a MUC room. It is derived from AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Message. (You can use the methods from that class to access it for example).

       Also the methods like eg. "make_reply" return a AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MUC::Message.

METHODS
       new (%args)
           This constructor takes the same arguments that the constructor for AnyEvent::XMPP::IM::Message takes.

       room
           Returns the chatroom in which' context this message was sent.

       send ([$room])
           This method send this message. If $room is defined it will set the connection of this message object before it is send.

       make_reply ([$msg])
           This method returns a new instance of AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MUC::Message.  The destination address, connection and type of the returned message object will be set.

           If  $msg  is defined and an instance of AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MUC::Message the destination address, connection and type of $msg will be changed and this method will not return a new instance of
           AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext::MUC::Message.

           If $self is a message of type 'groupchat' the "to" attribute will be set to the bare JID of the room for the reply.

           This method returns the nickname of the source of this message.

       is_private
           This method returns true when the message was not directed to the room, but privately to you.
