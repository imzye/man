NAME
       rpmfile - list file modes and types in RPM packages

SYNOPSIS
       rpmfile [-h] [-a] [-p] [FILE...] [DIR...]

DESCRIPTION
       rpmfile produces three-column output: file name, file mode (octal), and file type, as determined by file(1).  When processing a directory, an additional column is prepended to the output, which is
       typically RPM file basename.

OPTIONS
       -a  Process all Sisyphus packages.

       -p  When processing a directory, list package names, not file names; furthermore, enable special treatment of packages with the same name; that is, process only the one with the latest version.

       -h  Display this help and exit.
