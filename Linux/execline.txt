NAME
       execlineb - command launcher for execline scripts

SYNOPSIS
       execlineb [ -p | -P | -S nmin | -s nmin ] [ -q | -w | -W ] [ -c commandline ] script args

OPTIONS
       -c commandline
              execute commandline, do not look for a file.

   Options for environment management
       -p     will bypass the push phase: the current frame of positional parameters will be overwritten.  The script will not be reentrant

       -P     will bypass positional parameter handling completely: the environment will not be pushed, and positional parameters will be ignored.  execlineb -P -c 'script' is equivalent to, but more ef‐
              ficient than, execlineb -c 'emptyenv -P script'.  You should use the -P option only in standalone scripts that take no arguments, such as s6's or runit's run scripts.

       -S nmin
              will substitute the positional parameters - up to at least nmin - but will not push nor set environment variables.  execlineb -S3 -c 'script' is equivalent to, but more efficient than, exe‐
              clineb -c 'elgetpositionals -P3 emptyenv -P script'.

       -s nmin
              behaves just like the -S option, except that it defines $@ as the rest of the command line after nmin arguments have been removed.

   Options for block syntax checking
       External execline commands that read blocks, like foreground, use the EXECLINE_STRICT environment variable.

       Normally the EXECLINE_STRICT environment variable is inherited from the caller.  You can force it unset, set to 1, or set to 2 by giving respectively the -q, -w or -W option to execlineb.

       -q     same as EXECLINE_STRICT is unset.

              They won't complain at all.

       -w     same as EXECLINE_STRICT is set to 1.

              They will print a warning message on stderr if they find their blocks not to be properly quoted.

       -W     same as EXECLINE_STRICT is set to 2.

              They will also die.

NOTES
       On Debian GNU/Linux system, all binaries from execline package are installed in /usr/lib/execline/bin/.

       For convenience, a script is provided as /usr/bin/execlineb, which adds /usr/lib/execline/bin/ to PATH when invoked.
