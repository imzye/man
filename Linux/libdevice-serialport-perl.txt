DESCRIPTION
       Some systems, serial ports, and modem behave in strange ways.  To test the capabilities of Perl's Device::SerialPort, this tool queries the system settings for the given DEVICE, and attempts to
       set up the port and send the initialization string "ATE1" to the modem, reporting the results seen.
