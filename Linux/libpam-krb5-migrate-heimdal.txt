NAME
       pam_krb5_migrate - Kerberos 5 Migration PAM module

SYNOPSIS
       auth            optional pam_krb5_migrate.so

DESCRIPTION
       pam_krb5_migrate  is a stackable authentication module that takes a username and password from an earlier module in the stack, and attempts to transparently add them to a Kerberos realm using
       the Kerberos 5 kadmin service.

       The module can be used to ease the administrative burdens of migrating a large installed userbase from pre-existing authentication methods to a Kerberos-based setup.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be passed to the authentication module:

       debug          syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

       keytab=<file>  use alternate keytab for authentication (default is /etc/security/pam_krb5.keytab).

       min_uid=<uid>  don't add principals for uids lower than <uid>.  (default is 100)

       principal=<name>
                      use the key for <name> instead of the default pam_migrate/<hostname> key

       realm=<REALM>  update the database for a realm other than the default realm.
