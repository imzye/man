NAME
       flexloader - GPL utility to configure SRAM based ALTERA devices via the ALTERA ByteBlaster

SYNOPSIS
       flexloader [options] [parport_dev] [rbf_filename]

DESCRIPTION
       flexloader is a small utility to configure SRAM based ALTERA devices.  It downloads a code to the device SRAM using the ALTERA ByteBlaster or compatible JTAG programmer. It dialogs with it through the
       parallel interface, using parport. Note that you should have access rights to the parallel port.

       It should support APEX20K, FLEX10K, FLEX6000 and ACEX1K families, though I only tested it on a FLEX10K10 device.

       It currently only support files in raw binary format (.rbf), but others format such as HEX or TTF may be implemented later.
