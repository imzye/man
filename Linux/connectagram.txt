DESCRIPTION
       Connectagram  is a word unscrambling game. The board consists of several scrambled words that are joined together. You can choose the length of the words, the amount of words, and the pattern that
       the words are arranged in. The game provides a hint option for times when you are stuck, and features an online word lookup that fetches the definitions of each word from Wiktionary. Your  current
       progress is automatically saved.
