NAME
       MooseX::UndefTolerant::Attribute - Make your attribute(s) tolerant to undef initialization

VERSION
       version 0.21

SYNOPSIS
         package My:Class;
         use Moose;

         use MooseX::UndefTolerant::Attribute;

         has 'bar' => (
             traits => [ qw(MooseX::UndefTolerant::Attribute)],
             is => 'ro',
             isa => 'Num',
             predicate => 'has_bar'
         );

         # Meanwhile, under the city...

         # Doesn't explode
         my $class = My::Class->new(bar => undef);
         $class->has_bar # False!

DESCRIPTION
       Applying this trait to your attribute makes its initialization tolerant of of undef.  If you specify the value of undef to any of the attributes they will not be initialized (or will be set to the
       default, if applicable).  Effectively behaving as if you had not provided a value at all.
