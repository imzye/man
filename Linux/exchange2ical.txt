NAME
       exchange2ical - Convert Exchange calendar to ical file

SYNOPSIS
       exchange2ical [-?V] [-?|--help] [--usage] [-f|--database=STRING] [-p|--profile=STRING]
            [-P|--password=STRING] [-i|--icalsync=STRING] [-o|--filename=STRING] [-R|--range=STRING]
               [-d|--debuglevel=STRING] [--dump-data] [-V|--version]

DESCRIPTION
       exchange2ical provides a way to extract appointments from an Exchange calendar into the ical format. The ical is provided on stdout by default if the filename is not specified.

OPTIONS
       --database

       -f     Set the path to the profile database to use

       --profile

       -p     Set  the  profile  to  use.  If  no  profile  is  specified,  exchange2ical  tries  to  retrieve  the  default profile in the database. If no default profile has been set, exchange2ical returns
              MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND .

       --password

       -P     Specify the password for the profile to use. This can be omitted if the password is stored in the profile.

       --icalsync

       -i     Specify an icalendar file to be used to sync back to exchange.

       --filename

       -o     Specify the filename for the icalendar output.  The specified file will be overwritten with the new icalendar. If this is omitted, stdout will be used by default.

       --range

       -r     Specify the range of exchange appointments to be converted into an icalendar.  If there are no events, whos start date is within the specified range, an icalendar with no vevents  will  be  re‐
              turned.  Format: MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY

       --dump-data
              Dump the hex data. This is only required for debugging or educational purposes.

       --debuglevel

       -d     Set the debug level.

EXAMPLES
       Extract appointments from the Exchange calendar:
       exchange2ical > appointments.ical
       Extract appointments from the Exchange calendar to a specified path
       exchange2ical --filename=/path/to/file.ics
       Extract only appointments which begin from June 25 2008 to July 26 2009
       exchange2ical --range=06/25/2008-07/26/2009

REMARKS
       If you are using the default profile database path and have set a default profile (using mapiprofile --profile=profile_name -S ) you do not need to specify these parameters on the command line.
