NAME
       pioneers-metaserver - metaserver for Pioneers

SYNOPSIS
       pioneers-metaserver [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Pioneers  is an implementation of the popular, award-winning "Settlers of Catan" board game.  It uses a client/server model for networked play. This program provides a piece of network infrastruc‐
       ture that helps match pioneers clients to pioneers servers. Casual players of pioneers probably do not need to run this program.

OPTIONS
       -?, --help
              Print a short help text and exit.

       -d, --daemon
              Run in daemon mode.

       -P, --pidfile pidfile
              Write the pid to pidfile (implies -d)

       -r, --redirect location
              Redirect to another metaserver running at location.

       -s, --servername hostname
              Use hostname as hostname when creating servers.

       -p, --port-range from-to
              Use ports in the range from-to (inclusive) to start servers.  When this range is not specified, the metaserver will not be able to create new games.

       --debug
              Enable debug messages.

       --syslog-debug
              Duplicate the messages of the syslog to the console.

       --version
              Show version information.

ENVIRONMENT
       The default settings of the metaserver can be influenced with the following three environment variables:

       PIONEERS_METASERVER
              The hostname the metaserver will use when creating new games. This should be a hostname that can be resolved by all clients that will connect.

       PIONEERS_SERVER_CONSOLE
              The path (including the filename) to pioneers-server-console.  If it contains only a filename and no path or if it is not set, the PATH variable in the environment is  used  to  locate  the
              program.

       PIONEERS_DIR
              The path to the game definition files.  If it is not set, the default installation path will be used.

FILES
       /usr/share/games/pioneers/*.game
              Game definitions

SIGNALS
       SIGINT
              Shutdown the metaserver gracefully (can also be used to check for memory leaks)
