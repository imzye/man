NAME
       bean-price - fetch from the internet commodity prices for Beancount processing

DESCRIPTION
       usage: bean-price [-h] [--version] [-e] [-v] [-d DATE] [-i] [-u UNDECLARED]

              [-c] [-a] [-s] [-n] [--cache CACHE_FILENAME] [--no-cache] [--clear-cache] sources [sources ...]

       Fetch prices from the internet and output them as Beancount price directives.

   positional arguments:
       sources
              A list of filenames (or source "module/symbol", if -e is specified) from which to create a list of jobs.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --version, -V
              show program's version number and exit

       -e, --expressions, --expression
              Interpret the arguments as "module/symbol" source strings.

       -v, --verbose
              Print out progress log. Specify twice for debugging info.

       -d DATE, --date DATE
              Specify the date for which to fetch the prices.

       -i, --inactive
              Select all commodities from input files, not just the ones active on the date

       -u UNDECLARED, --undeclared UNDECLARED
              Include commodities viewed in the file even without a corresponding Commodity directive, from this default source. The currency name itself is used as the lookup symbol in this default source.

       -c, --clobber
              Do not skip prices which are already present in input files; fetch them anyway.

       -a, --all
              A shorthand for --inactive, --undeclared, --clobber.

       -s, --swap-inverted
              For  inverted  sources,  swap  currencies instead of inverting the rate. For example, if fetching the rate for CAD from 'USD:google/^CURRENCY:USDCAD' results in 1.25, by default we would output
              "price CAD 0.8000 USD". Using this option we would instead output " price USD 1.2500 CAD".

       -n, --dry-run
              Don't actually fetch the prices, just print the list of the ones to be fetched.

   cache:
       --cache CACHE_FILENAME
              Enable the cache and with the given cache name.

       --no-cache
              Disable the price cache.

       --clear-cache
              Clear the cache prior to startup
