NAME
       jsc - command-line JavaScript interpreter.

SYNOPSIS
       jsc [options] [files] [-- arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jsc command.

       jsc  is  a  command-line utility that allows you to run JavaScript programs outside of the context of a web browser. It is primarily used as part of the test
       harness for validating the JavaScript portions of WebKit, but can also be used as a scripting tool.

       jsc can be run in an interactive mode to test out JavaScript expressions, or it can be passed one or more files to run similar to invoking a Perl  or  Python
       script.

OPTIONS
       -e     Evaluate argument as script code.

       -f     Specifies a source file (deprecated).

       -h, --help
              Shows summary of command-line options.

       -i     Enables interactive mode (default if no files are specified).

       -p file
              Outputs profiling data to a file.

       -s     Installs signal handlers that exit on a crash.

       -x     Output exit code before terminating.

       --options
              Dumps all JSC VM options and exits.

       --dumpOptions
              Dumps all JSC VM options before continuing.

       --<jsc VM option>=<value>
              Sets the specified JSC VM option.
