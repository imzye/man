NAME
       pgn2web - program to convert PGN chess files to webpages

SYNOPSIS
       pgn2web [options] pgn-file  html-file
       p2wgui -- graphical frontend to pgn2web

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the pgn2web and p2wgui commands.

       pgn2web is a program to generate webpages from "portable game notation"
        PGN files, that allow the replaying of chess games within a web
        browser. It has a commandline client and a gtk graphical user interface
        for convenience. The html output is highly customisable, it is using
        javascript and is standards compliant to be working with all major
        browsers.

OPTIONS
       These programs do follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with short options starting with one dash (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -c yes|no
              include a link to the pgn2web homepage.

       -p <piece-set>
              use the <piece-set> pieceset. Available sets are: adventurer  alfonso-x  cases  condal  harlequin  kingdom  leipzig  line  lucena  magnetic  mark  marroquin  maya  mediaeval  merida  motif

       -s frameset|linked|individual
              use the specified layout.

       Passing no parameters at all will simply launch the GUI version.
