NAME
       airport2-portinspector - Port maps inspector for the Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station ("Snow")

SYNOPSIS
       airport2-portinspector

DESCRIPTION
       airport2-portinspector allows you to inspect the port maps used by the hosts associated with your base station.

OPTIONS
       airport2-portinspector accepts no command-line options. airport2-portinspector is a wrapper script around the PortInspector.jar jar file located in /usr/share/java/airport-utils.

       You  can  set  the JAVACMD environment variable to use a specific JVM instead of the one chosen by the wrapper script. Set the DEBUG environment variable to 1 to get the debug output from the
       wrapper script.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DEBUG  Set this variable to 1 to get the debug output from the wrapper script.

       JAVACMD
              The full path to the Java Virtual Machine to use. By default, the wrapper uses JAVACMD; if it is not set, it looks for JAVA_BINDIR/java, then for JAVA_HOME/bin/java before looking  for
              a java executable in the PATH. In the latter case, the JVM used can be configured using the Debian alternatives system (see update-alternatives(8)).

       JAVA_HOME
              The full path where your JDK/JRE is installed.

       JAVA_BINDIR
              The full path to the directory where the java executable is located.

       JAVA_ARGS
              Extra command-line arguments to be passed to the Java Virtual Machine.
