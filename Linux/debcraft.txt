NAME
       Debcraft - Easy, fast and secure way to build Debian packages

DESCRIPTION
       usage: debcraft <build|improve|test|release|shell|prune> [options] [<path|pkg|srcpkg|dsc|git-url>]

       Debcraft is a tool to easily build .deb packages. The 'build' argument accepts as a subargument any of:

              * path to directory with program sources including a debian/ subdirectory with * the Debian packaging instructions

              * path to a .dsc file and source tarballs that can be built into a .deb

              * Debian package name, or source package name, that apt can download

              * git http(s) or ssh URL that can be downloaded and built

       The  command 'release' is intended to be used to upload a package that is ready to be released. The command 'test' will run the Debian-specific regression test suite if the package has autopkgtest
       support, and drop to a shell for investigation if tests failed to pass. The command 'shell' can be used to play around in the container and 'prune' will clean up temporary files by Debcraft.

       In addition to parameters below, anything passed in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS will also be honored. Successful builds include running './debian/rules clean' to clean up artifacts, while failed builds will
       leave them around for inspection.

       Note that Debcraft builds never runs as root, and thus packages with DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT are not supported.

   optional arguments:
       --build-dirs-path
              Path for writing build files and artifacts (default: parent directory)

       --distribution
              Linux distribution to build in (default: debian:sid)

       --container-command
              container command to use (default: podman)

       --host-architecture
              host architecture to use when performing a cross build

       --skip-sources
              build only binaries and skip creating a source tarball to make the build slightly faster ('debcraft build' only)

       --with-binaries
              create a release with both source and binaries, for example with intent to upload to NEW ('debcraft release' only)

       --pull ensure container base is updated

       --copy perform the build on a copy of the package directory

       --clean
              ensure sources are clean before and after build (only needed on packages with incomplete 'debian/clean' or 'debian/.gitignore' definitions)

       --debug
              emit debug information

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       --version
              display version and exit
