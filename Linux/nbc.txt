NAME
       nbc - Compiler for LEGO Mindstorms NXT

SYNOPSIS
       nbc [options] file [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nbc command.

       nbc is a program that compiles Not eXactly C (NXC) files or NeXT Byte Code (NBC) files into programs that can run on the standard LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT firmware or the enhanced NBC/NXC firmware. The
       nbc  compiler  can  either save the compiler output to a file or upload it to a LEGO Mindstorms NXT for execution.  The compiler can also compile NXT Picture files (.ric) using the text-based RIC‐
       Script language.  Since nbc can compile different programming languages it uses the file extension to determine the type of code it is compiling.  NXC programs should use the .nxc file  extension,
       NBC programs should use the .nbc file extension, and RICScript programs should use the .rs file extension.
