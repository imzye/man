NAME
       true::VERSION - shim to allow modules to depend on true.pm

DESCRIPTION
       This module exists to work around bugs in the dependency system which prevent modules from depending on true.

       Instead of depending on true, depend on true::VERSION with the same version number.

       This module was introduced with version 0.16 of true.
