NAME
       evolver-nox-d - The Surface Evolver program with no X support and double precision floating point format

SYNOPSIS
       evolver-nox-d [-a][-d][-e][-i][-m][-q][-w][-x][-y][-h][-V] [-f FILE] [-pN] [DATAFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Surface  Evolver  is an interactive program for the modelling of liquid surfaces shaped by various forces and constraints.  Basically the Surface Evolver minimizes the energy of triangulated sur‐
       faces according to designated energies and constraints.

       This man page mainly documents command line options and environment variables.

OPTIONS
       -a     Autoconvert to named quantities when needed (default is on); use `-a-' to deactivate autoconversion.

       -d     Begin with parser debugging on (equivalent to `debug' runtime command); beware of copious output.

       -e     Echo stdin to stdout; meant for testing piped input.

       -f FILE
              After loading DATAFILE, read commands from file, then command line prompt.

       -i     Preserve DATAFILE numbers for element id's, rather than renumbering.

       -m     Begin with memory debugging on (equivalent to `memdebug' runtime command); beware of copious output.

       -pN    Run with N concurrent processes.

       -q     Convert to named quantities at start (equivalent to `convert_to_quantities' runtime command).

       -w     Exit immediately after any warning or error message; meant for batch runs.

       -x     Exit immediately after any error message; meant for batch runs.

       -y     Break to user prompt after any warning message.

       -h     Display this help, then exit.

       -V     Display the version and the banner, then exit.

AVAILABILITY
       The latest version of the Surface Evolver, up-to-date documentation, and more are available on-line from:

           http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver

BANNER
       Surface Evolver Version 2.70a (Debian 2.70+ds-4build2), August 27, 2013, 64-bit.  Compiled for double, 15 digits precision.  Built with Geomview support.

ENVIRONMENT
       EVOLVERPATH
              Colon-separated  list  of  paths  automatically  searched  for  datafiles,  included  files,  or  on-line  help  documentation.   By   default,   the   paths   /usr/share/doc/evolver/html   and
              /usr/share/doc/evolver/examples are appended (in that order); this default behaviour can be cancelled by appending at least three consecutive colons (":::") at its end.

FILES
       ~/.evolver_history
              Per user command history file.

       /usr/share/doc/evolver/manual.pdf
