NAME
       String::Binary::Interpolation - make it easier to interpolate binary bytes into a string

SYNOPSIS
       Where you would previously have had to write something like this ...

           my $binary = "ABC@{[chr(0b01000100)]}E"

       or ...

           my $binary = 'ABC'.chr(0b01000100).'E';

       to interpolate some random byte into a string you can now do this ...

           use String::Binary::Interpolation;

           my $binary = "ABC${b01000100}E";

       which I think you'll agree is much easier to read.

BUT WHY!?!?!?
       Bit-fields, dear reader. If you are writing data to a binary file, and that file contains bytes (or even longer words) which are bit-fields, it is easier to have the bits of the bit-field right
       there in your string instead of having to glue the string together from various parts, and it's far easier to read than the frankly evil hack of embedding an array-ref.

OK, SO WHAT DOES IT DO?
       When you "use" the module all it does is create a bunch of varliables in your namespace. They are named from $b00000000 to $b11111111 and their values are the corresponding characters. NB that
       when writing files containing characters with the high-bit set you need to be careful that you read and write bytes and not some unicode jibber-jabber.
