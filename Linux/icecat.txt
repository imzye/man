NAME
       icecat - IceCat - GNU version of IceCat browser

SYNOPSIS
       icecat [ options ... ] [URL]

DESCRIPTION
       Gnuzilla IceCat is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance and portability.

       GNUzilla  is the GNU version of the GNU suite, and GNU IceCat is the GNU version of the IceCat browser. Its main advantage is an ethical one: it is entirely free software. While the IceCat source code
       from the GNU project is free software, they distribute and recommend non-free software as plug-ins and addons.

       In addition, GNU IceCat includes some privacy protection features, included in a separate addon:

       Some sites refer to zero-size images on other hosts to keep track of cookies. When IceCat detects this mechanism it blocks cookies from the site hosting the zero-length image file. (It is possible  to
       re-enable  such  a  site by removing it from the blocked hosts list.)  Other sites rewrite the host name in links redirecting the user to another site, mainly to "spy" on clicks. When this behavior is
       detected, IceCat shows a message alerting the user.

       Origin of the name

       The name IceCat was coined to show our relationship to the GNU IceCat browser. Ice isn't Fire and a Cat isn't a Fox, so it is clearly a different package (we don't want GNU blamed  for  our  mistakes,
       nor cause confusion with their trademarks), but is equally clearly intimately related (of course nearly all of the work comes from the GNU foundation effort, so we want to give credit).
