DESCRIPTION
       Creating New Users The smbldap-useradd command creates a new user account using the values specified on the command line and the default values from the system and from the configuration files (in the
       /etc/smbldap-tools directory).

       Without any option, the account created will be a Unix (Posix) account. The following options may be used to add information:

       -a
          The user will have a Samba account (and Unix).

       -A
          Can change password? 0 if no, 1 if yes.

       -b
          The user is an AIX account.

       -B
          Must change password? 0 if no, 1 if yes.

       -c "comment"
          The new user's comment field (gecos). This option is for gecos only! To set as user's full name use the -N and -S options.

       -C sambaHomePath
          SMB home share, like '\\\\PDC-SRV\\homes'.

       -d home_dir
          The new user will be created using home_dir for the user's login directory. The default is to append the login name to userHomePrefix (defined in the configuration file) and use that as the login
       directory name.

       -D sambaHomeDrive
          Letter associated with home share, like 'H:'.

       -E sambaLogonScript
          Relative to the [netlogon] share (DOS script to execute on login, like 'foo.bat'.

       -F sambaProfilePath
          Profile directory, like '\\\\PDC-SRV\\profiles\\foo'.

       -g initial_group
          The group name or number of the user's initial login group. The group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group. The default group number is defined in the
       configuration file (defaultUserGid="513").

       -G group,[...]
          A list of supplementary groups that the user is also a member of. Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same restrictions
       as the group given with the -g option. The default is for the user to belong only to the initial group.

       -H sambaAcctFlags
          Spaces and trailing bracket are ignored (samba account control bits like '[NDHTUMWSLKI]').

       -i
          Creates an interdomain trust account (machine Workstation). A password will be asked for the trust account.

       -k skeletonDir
          When creating the user's home directory, copy files and directories from skeletonDir rather than /etc/skel. The -k option is only valid in conjunction with the -m option. The default is not to
       create the directory and not to copy any files.

       -m
          The user's home directory will be created if it does not exist. The files contained in skeletonDir will be copied to the home directory if the -k option is used, otherwise the files contained in
       /etc/skel will be used instead.  Any directories contained in skeletonDir or /etc/skel will be created in the user's home directory as well.

       -M mail
          E-mail addresses (multiple addresses are separated by commas).

       --non-unique
          Allow the creation of a user account with a duplicate (non-unique) UID.

       -n
          Do not print banner message.

       -N givenname
          Family name. Defaults to username.

       -o node
          The user's account will be created in the specified organizational unit. It is relative to the user suffix dn ($usersdn) defined in the configuration file.  Ex: 'ou=admin,ou=all'

       -O localMailAddress
          localMailAddresses (multiple addresses are separated by commas).

       -P
          Ends by invoking smbldap-passwd.

       -p
          Read password from STDIN without verification.

       -s shell
          The name of the user's login shell. The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to select the default login shell.

       -S surname
          Defaults to username.

       -t time
          Wait <time> seconds before exiting script when adding computer's account. This is useful when Master/PDC and Slaves/BDCs are connected through the Internet (replication is not real time).

       -T mailToAddress
          Forward address (multiple addresses are separated by commas).

       -u uid
          The numerical value of the user's ID. This value must be unique, unless the --non-unique option is used. The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the smallest ID value greater than
       1000 and greater than every other user.

       -w/-W
          Creates an account for a Samba machine (Workstation), so that it can join a sambaDomainName. Normally -w is used for adding machines through Samba but -W can be used for manual addition of samba
       attributes.

       -X encoding
          Specify input encoding for givenname and surname (default UTF-8).

       -Z name=value
          Specify custom LDAP attributes, using comma-separated name=value pairs.
