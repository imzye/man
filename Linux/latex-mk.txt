SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the latex-mk commands. This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has
       documentation in the GNU Info format; see below.

       latex-mk is a wrapper script used by the LaTeX-Mk makefile system for LaTeX documents. Its purpose is to run LaTeX the appropriate number of times to resolve all references and page changes
       associated with resolving references.
