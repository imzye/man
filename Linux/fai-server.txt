NAME
       nfsroot.conf - nfsroot configuration for FAI

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/fai/nfsroot.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The nfsroot is a file system on the install server. It is used during installation by the install clients.

       nfsroot.conf defines the essential options for the install server, which are mostly used inside the nfsroot. Use bash(1) syntax for defining variables.

VARIABLES
       FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP
              Two  or  three  parameters for debootstrap(8), space separated. Debootstrap is called as the first part of fai-make-nfsroot unless -B is used. This variable defines SUITE and MIRROR for de‐
              bootstrap. The third parameter is the name of the bootstrap script variant to use. Example:

              FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP="bullseye http://deb.debian.org/debian"

       NFSROOT_ETC_HOSTS
              This multiline variable is added to /etc/hosts inside the nfsroot.  You can use this when DNS is not available on the clients. Example:

              NFSROOT_ETC_HOSTS="192.168.33.250 faiserver"

       FAI_ROOTPW
              The encrypted root password on all install clients during the installation process. Used when log in via ssh.  This is not the password for the new installed system. Example:

              FAI_ROOTPW='$1$kBnWcO.E$djxB128U7dMkrltJHPf6d1'  # pw is fai

              Use mkpasswd, htpasswd or md5pass for generating the password hash.

              echo "yoursecrectpassword" | mkpasswd -m md5 -s

       NFSROOT
              Directory on the install server where the nfsroot is created.

       TFTPROOT
              Directory on the install server for the tftp data, used by PXE network boot.

       FAI_CONFIGDIR
              Location of the configuration space on the install server. Used by fai-cd(8), fai-mirror(1) and fai-setup(8).

       SERVERINTERFACE
              Used to specify the interface when detecting the subnet for the exportfs line. Only needed when the install server has multiple interfaces.

       SSH_IDENTITY
              Location of a ssh public key file. This user can log into the install clients in as root without a password. Only useful with FAI_FLAGS="sshd". Example:

              SSH_IDENTITY=/home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

       NFSROOT_HOOKS
              Directory of hooks to be sourced at the end of fai-make-nfsroot, i.e. they have to be shell scripts.

       NFSROOT_SERVER
              IP address of the NFS server for the rootfs if not on the DHCP server.  This is only used by fai-chboot to work around dracut's DHCP handling which prefers  the  DHCP  server's  IP  address
              above all other DHCP options.

       FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP_OPTS
              Options that will be passed to debootstrap(8). Used for excluding packages and for specifying a different architecture.

NOTES
       Normally, the nfsroot is mounted by the install kernel via NFS.  It's also used on the FAI CD. FAI clients can also receive the nfsroot via http. There you have to create a compressed squashfs im‐
       age of the nfsroot with fai-cd(8).
