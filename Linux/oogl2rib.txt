DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the oogl2rib command.

       oogl2rib Convert OOGL file to RenderMan rib format.  Default: read from
       stdin, write to stdout. Accepts "-" as infile/outfile.

OPTIONS
       The  default action is to create a complete rib file containing default
       camera, lights, etc.

       -n name
              Set name for rendered TIFF file (default "geom.tiff") or  frame‐
              buffer window (default "geom.rib").

       -B r,g,b
              Set  background  color,  each component ranges from 0 to 1.  De‐
              fault is no background.

       -w width
              Set width of rendered frame, in pixels.

       -h height
              Set height of rendered frame, in pixels.

       -f     The .rib file renders to on-screen framebuffer instead  of  TIFF
              file.

       -g     Output geometry only, no world, no world block.

       -b     Encapsulate  geometry-only  into a world block. This is the con‐
              figuration to define a RIB file 'clip object' via the Quick Ren‐
              derMan specification.  Ignores -nBwhf.
