NAME
       mvdsv - QuakeWorld-compatible dedicated server

SYNOPSIS
       mvdsv  -basedir  DIRECTORY  -game  DIRECTORY  [-t  chroot  dir] [-u user] [-g group] [-d] [-cheats] [-enablelocalcommand] [-democache SIZE_IN_KB] [-progtype PROGTYPENUMBER] [-minmemory] [-heapsize

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mvdsv command.

       mvdsv (multi-view demo server) is a QuakeWorld-compatible dedicated server.

       On Debian, it currently requires a package "quake-registered" that can be generated from copy of Quake I via game-data-packager(6).

OPTIONS
       mvdsv does not follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes. Most notably, it does not have a --help command.

       [unix specific parameters]

       -t DIRECTORY
              chroot to DIRECTORY

       -u USER
              setuid to USER

       -g GROUP
              setguid to GROUP

       -d     daemonize to background (not recommended when run from systemd unit)

       [common parameters]

       -basedir BASEDIR
              The "base directory" is the path to the filesystem directory holding the quake game directories (id1/pak0.pak, id1/pak1.pak). The base directory is only used during  filesystem  initializa‐
              tion. Defaults to current directory when not set.  Example: mvdsv -basedir /usr/share/games/quake

       -game GAMEDIR
              The  "game directory" is the first tree on the search path and directory that all generated files (savegames, screenshots, demos, config files) will be saved to.  This directory is relative
              to the base directory.

       +gamedir GAMEDIR
              Identical to "-game". However, when both are set, "-game" takes precedence.

       -ip IPV4_ADDRESS
              Bind to the network interface with this IPv4 address, instead of all interfaces.  Currently only IPv4 addresses are supported. IPv6 addresses will silently fail.

       -port UDP_PORT
              Listen on UDP port number PORT for QuakeWorld clients to connect. Defaults to 27500.

       -cheats
              Enable cheats on this server. Equivalent to setting "sv_cheats 1" in the config.  This makes a set of cheat commands available on the QuakeWorld client:
              `god` will make the player invulnerable.
              `noclip` allows the player to clip through walls.
              `fly` allows the player to fly, but not clip through walls.
              `give <alphanum> [amount]` will give the player items.
              2 = shotgun
              3 = super shotgun
              4 = nailgun
              5 = super nailgun
              6 = grenade launcher
              7 = rocket launcher
              8 = lightning gun
              s = shotgun ammo
              n = nailgun ammo
              r = rocket ammo
              h = health
              c = cells ammo

       -enablelocalcommand
              Allow executing arbitrary shell code from within the server with "localcommand CMD". VERY DANGEROUS. Only enable this if you know what you are doing.

       -democache SIZE_IN_KB
              Set the demo cache size in KB. Will default to 16 MiB if set below that value.

       -progtype PROGTYPENUMBER
              Define the type of the qwprogs. This setting is usually not needed, as it is autodetected.
                  0 = pr1 (qwprogs.dat etc)
                  1 = native (.so/.dll)
                  2 = q3vm (.qvm)
                  3 = q3vm (.qvm) with JIT

       -minmemory
              Set memory to 0x550000 bytes (deprecated, use -mem).

       -heapsize SIZE_IN_KB
              Allocate fixed amount of memory in KiB (deprecated, use -mem).

       -mem SIZE_IN_MB
              Allocate fixed amount of memory in Mi. Overrides -heapsize and -minmemory.  Defaults to 32 MiB.

       +exec MYSERVER.CFG
              execute all server commands configured in the file MYSERVER.CFG.
