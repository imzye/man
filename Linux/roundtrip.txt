NAME
     roundtrip — a comparison program for testing roundtrip conversion

SYNOPSIS
     roundtrip filename filename

DESCRIPTION
     The roundtrip program is essentially a "chemical diff." That is, it will
     return with an error if two files do not have the same number of atoms,
     the same number of molecules, and where appropriate, the same element and
     coordinates for each atom.

OPTIONS
     If given two filenames, roundtrip will guess the file format from the
     extension.

EXAMPLES
     Compare two files created via a roundtrip test
           roundtrip 3d.sdf 3d.xyz
