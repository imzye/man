NAME
       talkd — remote user communication server

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/in.talkd [-dpq]

DESCRIPTION
       Talkd is the server that notifies a user that someone else wants to initiate a conversation.  It acts a repository of invitations, responding to requests by clients wishing to rendezvous to hold a
       conversation.  In normal operation, a client, the caller, initiates a rendezvous by sending a CTL_MSG to the server of type LOOK_UP (see ⟨protocols/talkd.h⟩).  This causes the server to search its
       invitation tables to check if an invitation currently exists for the caller (to speak to the callee specified in the message).  If the lookup fails, the caller then sends an ANNOUNCE message caus‐
       ing the server to broadcast an announcement on the callee's login ports requesting contact.  When the callee responds, the local server uses the recorded invitation to respond with the appropriate
       rendezvous address and the caller and callee client programs establish a stream connection through which the conversation takes place.

OPTIONS

       [-p] Packet logging mode; writes copies of malformed packets to /var/log/talkd.packets.  This is useful for debugging interoperability problems.
