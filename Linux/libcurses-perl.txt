NAME
       Curses - terminal screen handling and optimization

           initscr;
           ...
           endwin;

DESCRIPTION
       "Curses" is the interface between Perl and your system's curses(3) library.  For descriptions on the usage of a given function, variable, or constant, consult your system's documentation, as such
       information invariably varies (:-) between different curses(3) libraries and operating systems.  This document describes the interface itself, and assumes that you already know how your system's
       curses(3) library works.

   Unified Functions
       Many curses(3) functions have variants starting with the prefixes w-, mv-, and/or wmv-.  These variants differ only in the explicit addition of a window, or by the addition of two coordinates that
       are used to move the cursor first.  For example, addch() has three other variants: waddch(), mvaddch(), and mvwaddch().  The variants aren't very interesting; in fact, we could roll all of the
       variants into original function by allowing a variable number of arguments and analyzing the argument list for which variant the user wanted to call.

       Unfortunately, curses(3) predates varargs(3), so in C we were stuck with all the variants.  However, "Curses" is a Perl interface, so we are free to "unify" these variants into one function.  The
       section "Available Functions" below lists all curses(3) functions "Curses" makes available as Perl equivalents, along with a column listing if it is unified.  If so, it takes a varying number of
       arguments as follows:

           "function( [win], [y, x], args );"

           win is an optional window argument, defaulting to "stdscr" if not specified.

           y, x is an optional coordinate pair used to move the cursor, defaulting to no move if not specified.

           args are the required arguments of the function.  These are the arguments you would specify if you were just calling the base function and not any of the variants.

       This makes the variants obsolete, since their functionality has been merged into a single function, so "Curses" does not define them by default.  You can still get them if you want, by setting the
       variable $Curses::OldCurses to a non-zero value before using the "Curses" package.  See "Perl 4.X "cursperl" Compatibility" for an example of this.

   Wide-Character-Aware Functions
       The following are the preferred functions for working with strings, though they don't follow the normal unified function naming convention (based on the names in the Curses library) described
       above.  Despite the naming, each corresponds to a Curses library function.  For example, a "getchar" call performs a Curses library function in the "getch" family.

       In addition to these functions, The "Curses" module contains corresponding functions with the conventional naming (e.g. "getch"); the duplication is for historical reasons.  The preferred
       functions were new in Curses 1.29 (April 2014).  They use the wide character functions in the Curses library if available (falling back to using the traditional non-wide-character versions).  They
       also have a more Perl-like interface, taking care of some gory details under the hood about which a Perl programmer shouldn't have to worry.

       The reason for two sets of string-handling functions is historical.  The original Curses Perl module predates Curses libraries that understand multiple byte character encodings.  Moreover, the
       module was designed to have a Perl interface that closely resembles the C interface syntactically and directly passes the internal byte representation of Perl strings to C code.  This was probably
       fine before Perl got Unicode function, but today, Perl stores strings internally in either Latin-1 or Unicode UTF-8 and the original module was not sensitive to which encoding was used.

       While most of the problems could be worked around in Perl code using the traditional interface, it's hard to get right and you need a wide-character-aware curses library (e.g. ncursesw) anyway to
       make it work properly.  Because existing consumers of the Curses module may be relying on the traditional behavior, Curses module designers couldn't simply modify the existing functions to
       understand wide characters and convert from and to Perl strings.

       None of these functions exist if Perl is older than 5.6.

       "getchar"

       This calls wget_wch().  It returns a character -- more precisely, a one-character (not necessarily one-byte!) string holding the character -- for a normal key and a two-element list "(undef,
       key-number)" for a function key.  It returns "undef" on error.

       If you don't expect function keys (i.e. with "keypad(0))", you can simply do

               my $ch = getchar;
               die "getchar failed" unless defined $ch;

       If you do expect function keys (i.e. with keypad(1)), you can still assign the result to a scalar variable as above.  Because of of the way the comma operator works, that variable will receive
       either "undef" or the string or the number, and you can decode it yourself.

               my $ch = getchar;
               die "getchar failed" unless defined $ch;
               if (<$ch looks like a number >= 0x100>) {
                       <handle function key>
               } else {
                       <handle normal key>
               }

       or do

               my ($ch, $key) = getchar;
               if (defined $key) {
                       <handle function key $key>
               } else if (defined $ch) {
                       <handle normal key $ch>
               } else {
                       die "getchar failed";
               }

       If wget_wch() is not available (i.e. The Curses library does not understand wide characters), this calls wgetch(), but returns the values described above nonetheless.  This can be a problem
       because with a multibyte character encoding like UTF-8, you will receive two one-character strings for a two-byte-character (e.g. "ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½" and "â½" for "â½").  If you append these
       characters to a Perl string, that string may internally contain a valid UTF-8 encoding of a character, but Perl will not interpret it that way. Perl may even try to convert what it believes to be
       two characters to UTF-8, giving you four bytes.

       "getstring"

       This calls "wgetn_wstr" and returns a string or "undef".  It cannot return a function key value; the Curses library will itself interpret KEY_LEFT and KEY_BACKSPACE.

       If wgett_wstr() is unavailable, this calls wgetstr().

       In both cases, the function allocates a buffer of fixed size to hold the result of the Curses library call.

               my $s = getstring();
               die "getstring failed" unless defined $s;

       "addstring"/"insstring"

       This adds/inserts the Perl string passed as an argument to the Curses window using waddnwstr()/wins_nwstr() or, if unavailable, waddnstr()/winsnstr().  It returns a true value on success, false on
       failure.

               addstring("Hâ½llâ¡, Wâ¡rld") || die "addstring failed";

       "instring"

       This returns a Perl string (or "undef" on failure) holding the characters from the current cursor position up to the end of the line.  It uses winnwstr() if available, and otherwise innstr().

               my $s = instring();
               die "instring failed" unless defined $s;

       "ungetchar"

       This pushes one character (passed as a one-character Perl string) back to the input queue. It uses unget_wch() or ungetch().  It returns a true value on success, false on failure.  It cannot push
       back a function key; the Curses library provides no way to push back function keys, only characters.

               ungetchar("X") or die "ungetchar failed";

       The "Curses" module provides no interface to the complex-character routines (wadd_wch(), wadd_wchnstr(), wecho_wchar(), win_wch(), win_wchnstr(), wins_wch()) because there is no sensible way of
       converting from Perl to a C "cchar_t" or back.

   Objects
       Objects work.  Example:

           $win = new Curses;
           $win->addstr(10, 10, 'foo');
           $win->refresh;
           ...

       Any function that has been marked as unified (see "Available Functions" below and "Unified Functions" above) can be called as a method for a Curses object.

       Do not use initscr() if using objects, as the first call to get a "new Curses" will do it for you.

   Security Concerns
       It has always been the case with the curses functions, but please note that the following functions:

           getstr()   (and optional wgetstr(), mvgetstr(), and mvwgetstr())
           inchstr()  (and optional winchstr(), mvinchstr(), and mvwinchstr())
           instr()    (and optional winstr(), mvinstr(), and mvwinstr())

       are subject to buffer overflow attack.  This is because you pass in the buffer to be filled in, which has to be of finite length, but there is no way to stop a bad guy from typing.

       In order to avoid this problem, use the alternate functions:

          getnstr()
          inchnstr()
          innstr()

       which take an extra "size of buffer" argument or the wide-character-aware getstring() and instring() versions.

COMPATIBILITY
   Perl 4.X "cursperl" Compatibility
       "Curses" was written to take advantage of features of Perl 5 and later.  The author thought it was better to provide an improved curses programming environment than to be 100% compatible.
       However, many old "curseperl" applications will probably still work by starting the script with:

           BEGIN { $Curses::OldCurses = 1; }
           use Curses;

       Any old application that still does not work should print an understandable error message explaining the problem.

       Some functions and variables are not available through "Curses", even with the "BEGIN" line.  They are listed under "Curses items not available through Perl Curses".

       The variables $stdscr and $curscr are also available as functions "stdscr" and "curscr".  This is because of a Perl bug.  See the LIMITATIONS section for details.

   Incompatibilities with previous versions of "Curses"
       In previous versions of this software, some Perl functions took a different set of parameters than their C counterparts.  This is not true in the current version.  You should now use getstr($str)
       and "getyx($y, $x)" instead of "$str = getstr()" and "($y, $x) = getyx()".

DIAGNOSTICS
       •   Curses function '%s' called with too %s arguments at ...

           You have called a "Curses" function with a wrong number of arguments.

       •   argument %d to Curses function '%s' is not a Curses %s at ...

       •   argument is not a Curses %s at ...

           The argument you gave to the function wasn't of a valid type for the place you used it.

           This probably means that you didn't give the right arguments to a unified function.  See the DESCRIPTION section on "Unified Functions" for more information.

       •   Curses function '%s' is not defined in your Curses library at ...

           Your code has a call to a Perl "Curses" function that your system's Curses library doesn't provide.

       •   Curses variable '%s' is not defined in your Curses library at ...

           Your code has a Perl "Curses" variable that your system's Curses library doesn't provide.

       •   Curses constant '%s' is not defined in your Curses library at ...

           Your code references the specified "Curses" constant, and your system's Curses library doesn't provide it.

       •   Curses::Vars::FETCH called with bad index at ...

       •   Curses::Vars::STORE called with bad index at ...

           You've been playing with the "tie" interface to the "Curses" variables.  Don't do that.  :-)

       •   Anything else

           Check out the perldiag man page to see if the error is in there.

LIMITATIONS
       If  you  use the variables $stdscr and $curscr instead of their functional counterparts ("stdscr" and "curscr"), you might run into a bug in Perl where the "magic" isn't called early enough.  This
       is manifested by the "Curses" package telling you $stdscr isn't a window.  One workaround is to put a line like "$stdscr = $stdscr" near the front of your program.
