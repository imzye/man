NAME
       pfqueue.conf - pfqueue configuration file

FULL PATH
       /etc/pfqueue.conf or ~/.pfqueue

DESCRIPTION
       pfqueue  can  be  configured  storing  its  option in configuration files.  At startup, if /etc/pfqueue.conf is present it is read and options are set accordingly; then, if a .pfqueue file is
       present in user's home directory, it is read and options are set accordingly, overriding those stored in /etc/pfqueue.conf.
       Note that the resulting settings are overridden by command line options.
