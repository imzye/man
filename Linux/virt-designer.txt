NAME
       virt-designer - Generate domain XML

SYNOPSIS
       virt-designer [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       virt-designer is a command line tool for generating XML documents for libvirt domains. However, it cooperates with libosinfo database to guess the correct combination of attributes (e.g. disk driver,
       NIC model).

       virt-designer does not feed libvirt with generated XML though. For now, it's a proof of concept.

OPTIONS
       The basic structure of arguments passed to virt-designer is:

         virt-designer [-c URI] [OPTION] [OPTION] ...

       However, arguments have no pre-defined order so users can type them in any order they like.

   General Options
       -c URI, --connect=URI
         The libvirt connection URI which is used for querying capabilities of the host.

       --list-os
         List IDs of operating systems known to libosinfo

       --list-platform
         List IDs of platforms known to libosinfo

       -o OS, --os=OS
         Specify operating system that will be run on the domain. OS is an ID which can be obtained via --list-os.

       -p PLATFORM, --platform=PLATFORM
         Specify platform (hypervisor) under which the domain will run. PLATFORM is and ID which can be obtained via --list-platform.

       -a ARCH, --architecture=ARCH
         Set domain's architecture

       -C PATH[,FORMAT] --cdrom=PATH[,FORMAT]
         Add PATH as a CDROM to the domain. To specify its format (e.g. raw, qcow2, phy) use FORMAT.

       -d PATH[,FORMAT] --disk=PATH[,FORMAT]
         Add PATH as a disk to the domain. To specify its format (e.g. raw, qcow2, phy) use FORMAT.

       -i NETWORK[,ARG=VAL]
         Add an interface of type network with NETWORK source. Moreover, some other configuration knobs can be set (possible ARGs): mac, link={up|down}

       -g GRAPHICS
         Add a graphics device of type GRAPHICS. Valid values are spice or vnc.

       -s
         Add smartcard reader to the VM conifguration

       -u
         Add USB controllers and setup USB redirection in the VM configuration.

       -r RESOURCE, --resources=RESOURCES
         Set minimal or recommended resources on the domain XML. By default, the recommended is used.

       Usually, both --os and --platform are required as they are needed to make the right decision on driver, model, ...  when adding a new device.  However, when adding a disk which is an installation
       medium (e.g. a CD-ROM or DVD), virt-designer tries to guess the OS. Something similar is done with platform. Usually, the platform is guessed from the connection URI.

EXAMPLES
       Domain with Fedora 17 from locally stored ISO and one NIC with mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 and link set down:

         # virt-designer -C Fedora-17-x86_64-Live-KDE.iso \
                         -i default,mac=00:11:22:33:44:55,link=down

       To add multiple devices just use appropriate argument multiple times:

         # virt-designer -d /tmp/home.img,qcow2 \
                         -d /var/lib/libvirt/images/f17.img,qcow2 \
                         -i default,mac=00:11:22:33:44:55,link=down \
                         -i blue_network \
                         -r minimal
