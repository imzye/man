NAME
       propwatch - a tool to monitor X11 properties

SYNOPSIS
       propwatch [ options ] property-name ...

DESCRIPTION
       propwatch is a tool to monitor window properties of root and application windows.  Nice for debugging property-based IPC of X11 programs.

OPTIONS
       propwatch uses the Athena Widgets and accepts the usual toolkit options like -display and -geometry.

       Additional options are:

       -watch display
              Display to monitor the windows on.  By default the display specified in the DISPLAY environment variable or via -display is used, but it is possible to watch another display instead.

       -verbose
              be verbose.

       -proplog
              Log property changes to stdout.

       -kbdlog
              Log keystrokes to stdout.

       All remaining command line arguments are assumed to be property names which should be monitored.  If no property names are specified, a build in default (WM_COMMAND) will be used.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY
              specifies the display to use for the propwatch window.
