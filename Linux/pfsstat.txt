NAME
       pfsstat - Show frame / image statistics

SYNOPSIS
       pfsstat

DESCRIPTION
       This command will show a short text statistic on each image in the pfs stream. In the statistics you can find:

       File - name of the input file

       Width, Height - image dimensions

       Minimum - minimum luminance of an image(*), given in linear
              units (relative luminance in cd/m^2) and logarithmic units

       Maximum - maximum luminance of an image(*)

       Average - average luminance of an image(*)

       Mean - mean luminance of an image(*)

       (*)  Before  min,  max,  average, median and dynamic range is computed, the following processing is performed on an image: 1) negative and zero values are replaced with the smallest positive value (to
       compute logarithms); 2) the image is low-pass filtered. The low-pass filtering removes few very dark or very bright pixels that can significantly influence estimation of the dynamic  range.  The  per‐
       centile,  instead  of a low-pass filter, is sometimes used for the same purpose. However, a low-pass filter is preferred to the percentile in pfstools since, taking into account the processing that is
       happening in the human visual system, low-frequency band filter is more plausible.

       Note: This command requires GNU Octave.

EXAMPLES
