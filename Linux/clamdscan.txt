Clamd client(1)                                                                                Clam AntiVirus                                                                               Clamd client(1)

NAME
       clamdscan - scan files and directories for viruses using Clam AntiVirus Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       clamdscan [options] [file/directory]

DESCRIPTION
       clamdscan is a clamd client which may be used as a clamscan replacement. It accepts all the options implemented in clamscan but most of them will be ignored because its scanning abilities only de‐
       pend on clamd.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help information and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       --quiet
              Be quiet - only output error messages.

       --stdout
              Write all messages (except for libclamav output) to the standard output (stdout).

       -c, --config-file=FILE
              Read clamd settings from FILE.

       -l FILE, --log=FILE
              Save the scan report to FILE.

       -f FILE, --file-list=FILE
              Scan files listed line by line in FILE.

       -p A[:I], --ping A[:I]
              Ping clamd up to [A] times at optional interval [I] until it responds.

       -w, --wait
              Wait up to 30 seconds for clamd to start. Optionally use alongside ping to set attempts [A] and interval [I] to check clamd.

       -m, --multiscan
              In  the  multiscan  mode clamd will attempt to scan the directory contents in parallel using available threads. This option is especially useful on multiprocessor and multi-core systems. If
              you pass more than one file or directory in the command line, they are put in a queue and sent to clamd individually. This means, that single files are always scanned by  a  single  thread.
              Similarly, clamdscan will wait for clamd to finish a directory scan (performed in multiscan mode) before sending request to scan another directory. This option can be combined with --fdpass
              (see below).

       -z, --allmatch
              After a match, continue scanning within the file for additional matches.

       --remove
              Remove infected files. Be careful.

       --move=DIRECTORY
              Move infected files into DIRECTORY.

       --copy=DIRECTORY
              Copy infected files into DIRECTORY.

       --no-summary
              Do not display summary at the end of scanning.

       --reload
              Request clamd to reload virus database.

       --allmatch
              Continue scanning within file after finding a match.

       -i, --infected
              Only print infected files

       --fdpass
              Open the file and pass the opened file descriptor to clamd. This is useful if clamd is running as a different user or if clamd sees a different file system tree. This is faster than stream‐
              ing the file to clamd.  Only available if connected to clamd via local(unix) socket.

       --stream
              Forces  file streaming to clamd. This is generally not needed as clamdscan detects automatically if streaming is required. This option only exists for debugging and testing purposes, in all
              other cases --fdpass is preferred.

EXAMPLES
       (0) To scan a one file:

              clamdscan file

       (1) To scan a current working directory:

              clamdscan

       (2) To scan all files in /home:

              clamdscan /home

       (3) To scan a file when clamd is running as a different user:

              clamdscan --fdpass ~/downloads

       (4) To scan from standard input:

              clamdscan - < file_to_scan

              cat file_to_scan | clamdscan -

RETURN CODES
       0 : No virus found.

       1 : Virus(es) found.

       2 : An error occurred.
