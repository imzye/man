NAME
       libmcrypt-config - script to get information about the installed version of      LIBMCRYPT.

SYNOPSIS
       libmcrypt-config [  --prefix[=DIR]  ] [  --exec-prefix[=DIR]  ] [  --libs  ] [  --cflags  ] [  --version  ]

DESCRIPTION
       libmcrypt-config is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use LIBMCRYPT library.

OPTIONS
       --prefix=PREFIX
              If  specified,  use  PREFIX  instead of the installation prefix that LIBMCRYPT was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the
              exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that LIBMCRYPT was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option must  be  specified
              before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a LIBMCRYPT program.

       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a LIBMCRYPT program.

       --version
              Print the currently installed version of LIBMCRYPT on the standard output.
