NAME
       cjet - converts HP PCL to Canon CaPSL format

SYNOPSIS
       cjet [options]<input.pcl>output

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cjet command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       cjet  converts  the common HP PCL page description language to Canon's CaPSL, which was used in the mid-1990s by some Canon laser printers.  It is normally used as part of a printer filter script,
       like the Foomatic system.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -f     Use full paint mode instead of partial paint mode.  This requires the printer to have at least 1.5 MB of memory to work correctly.

       -p     Ignore paper size commands.  Useful for printing files formatted for paper size X on printers with paper size Y.

       -q     Quiet mode. Suppresses all warning messages.

       -x X   Shift output on paper by X dots horizontally. Positive values of X shift to the right; negative values to the left.  Dots are 1/300 inch (0.085 mm).

       -y Y   Shift output on paper by Y dots vertically. Positive values of Y shift downwards; negative values shift upwards.
