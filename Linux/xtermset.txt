NAME
       terms - database of blessed terminals for xtermset.

DESCRIPTION
       The terms database is a file whichs tells xtermset which terminals are controllable.

       terms is usually located in /usr/share/xtermset and it is an ASCII file.  A blessed terminal is described in one line.

       There are several modifiers which affect the way how xtermset interprets the TERM variable.

       ^<term-name> tells xtermset that $TERM should begin with <term-name>

       <term-name>$ tells xtermset that $TERM should begin with <term-name>

       <term-name> tells xtermset that $TERM must contain <term-name>

       You can combine the ^ and the $ options to create an exact match for $TERM
