       Why use SurgeScript?

       Unlike other programming languages, SurgeScript has been designed with the specific needs of games in mind. Its features include:

           * The state-machine pattern: objects are state machines.
           * The composition approach: you may design complex objects and behaviors
           by means of composition.
           * The hierarchy system: objects have a parent and may have children,
           in a tree-like structure.
           * The game loop: it's defined implicitly.

       Other benefits include:

           * Small footprint, easy to integrate.
           * C-like syntax, including plenty of features.
           * Automatic garbage collection.
           * Easy to extend via Plugins.
           * It's free and open source software.

       These  features come from the experience of the developer dealing with game engines, applications related to computer graphics and so on. Some of the best practices have been incorporated into the
       language itself, making things really easy for developers and modders.
