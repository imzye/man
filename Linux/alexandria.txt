NAME
       alexandria - a book collection manager

SYNOPSIS
       alexandria [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Alexandria  is  a  GNOME  desktop application for managing book collec‐
       tions. It has a simple user interface which makes it easy to enter  the
       details of your library, generally using Internet sources to find cata‐
       logue information for your books. It also enables you  to  create  fil‐
       tered  views  of  your book collection based on details such as author,
       publisher etc.

       When launched without any options the Alexandria main window opens  and
       presents a view of your libraries, or if run for the first time creates
       a new library ready for you to add books either manually  or  with  the
       help of providers of book information on the Internet.

OPTIONS
       --debug
           Print verbose debug information describing the operation of the
           program. Useful for determining behaviour when a problem is
           encountered. This also sets the logger level to DEBUG.

       --version
           Show program version information and exit.

       --help
           Show summary of options and exit. This also shows a great many
           predefined options common to all GTK programs which are not
           defined in this manual page.

FILES
       $HOME/.alexandria
           The per-user configuration of Alexandria
           is stored in this directory. Each the books in each library are
           stored in a sub-directory with the library's name e.g. `My
           Library'. Book files are stored in YAML format (a text-based data
           format). They are named after the book's ISBN
           e.g. 9780755322800.yaml The cover images are also named after with
           book's ISBN, with the file extension .cover, although they are
           usually JPEG format files. If a book has no ISBN, it's ID will be
           a number generated from the book title.

       $HOME/.alexandria/.smart_libraries
           Smart Libraries are a filtered view of your book collection, and
           are saved as YAML format files in this directory.
