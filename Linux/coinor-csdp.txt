NAME
       csdp - semidefinite program solver

SYNOPSIS
       csdp <problemfile> <finalsolution> <initialsolution>
       csdp-complement <inputgraph> <outputgraph>
       csdp-graphtoprob <graph> <problemfile>
       csdp-randgraph <rand_graph> <file> <n> <p> [<seed>]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the csdp, csdp-complement, csdp-graphtoprob, csdp-randgraph and csdp-theta commands.

       csdp -- interface to solve general semi-definite programs
       csdp-complement -- compute the complement of a graph and output it in csdp problem format
       csdp-graphtoprob -- convert graph into csdp problem format file
       csdp-randgraph -- generate a random graph
       csdp-theta -- solves the Lovasz thetha problem

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see /usr/share/doc/coinor-csdp-doc/csdpuser.pdf.

       csdp
              inputproblem in the SDPA sparse format

       problemfile
              is the name of a file containing the SDP problem in SDPA sparse format

       finalsolution
              is the optional name of a file in which to save the final solution

       initialsolution
              is the optional name of a file from which to take the initial solution.

       CSDP searches for a file named param.csdp in the current directory. If no such file exists, then default values for all of CSDP’s parameters are used. If there is a parameter file, then CSDP reads
       the parameter values from this file.  The default parameter values is given below (can be pasted into a file):

       axtol=1.0e-8
       atytol=1.0e-8
       objtol=1.0e-8
       pinftol=1.0e8
       dinftol=1.0e8
       maxiter=100
       minstepfrac=0.90
       maxstepfrac=0.97
       minstepp=1.0e-8
       minstepd=1.0e-8
       usexzgap=1
       tweakgap=0
       affine=0
       printlevel=1
       perturbobj=1
       fastmode=0

       param.csdp file parameter description

       axtol  atytol objtol tolerances for primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and relative duality gap

       pinftol
              dinftol tolerances used in determining primal and dual infeasibility

       maxiter
              plimit the total number of iterations that CSDP may use

       minstepfrac
              maxstepfrac determine how close to the edge of the feasible region CSDP will step. If the primal or dual step is shorter than minstepp or minstepd, then CSDP declares a line search failure.
              usexzgap If parameter 0, then CSDP will use the objective function duality gap instead of the tr(XZ) gap

       tweakgap
              if set to 1, and usexzgap is set to 0, then CSDP will attempt to "fix" negative duality gaps.

       affine If parameter affine is set to 1, then CSDP will take only primal–dual affine steps and not make use of the barrier term. This can be useful for some problems that do not have feasible solu‐
              tions  that  are  strictly in the interior of the cone of semidefinite ma- trices.  printlevel determines how much debugging information is output. Use printlevel=0 for no output and print‐
              level=1 for normal output.  Higher values of printlevel will generate more debugging output.

       perturbobj
              determines whether the objective function will be perturbed to help deal with problems that have unbounded optimal solution sets. If per- turbobj is 0, then the objective will not  be  per‐
              turbed. If perturbobj=1, then the objective function will be perturbed by a default amount. Larger values of perturbobj (e.g. 100.0) increase the size of the perturbation. This can be help‐
              ful in solving some difficult problems.

       fastmode
              determines  whether  or  not CSDP will skip certain time consuming operations that slightly improve the accuracy of the solutions. If fastmode is set to 1, then CSDP may be somewhat faster,
              but also somewhat less accurate.
