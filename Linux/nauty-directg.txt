NAME
       nauty-directg - generate small digraphs with given underlying graph

SYNOPSIS
       directg [-q] [-u|-T|-G] [-V] [-o] [-f#] [-e#|-e#:#] [-s#/#] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Read undirected graphs and orient their edges in all possible ways.

              Edges  can  be  oriented in either or both directions (3 possibilities).  Isomorphic directed graphs derived from the same input are suppressed.  If the input graphs are non-isomorphic then the
              output graphs are also.

       -e# | -e#:#
              specify a value or range of the total number of arcs

       -o     orient each edge in only one direction, never both

       -f#    Use only the subgroup that fixes the first # vertices setwise

       -T     use a simple text output format (nv ne edges) instead of digraph6

       -G     like -T but includes group size as third item (if less than 10^10)

              The group size does not include exchange of isolated vertices.

       -V     only output graphs with nontrivial groups (including exchange of

       isolated vertices).
              The -f option is respected.

       -u     no output, just count them

       -s#/#  Make only a fraction of the orientations: The first integer is

              the part number (first is 0) and the second is the number of parts. Splitting is done per input graph independently.

       -q     suppress auxiliary information
