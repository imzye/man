NAME
       toybox - Toybox - BSD-licensed Linux command line utilities

DESCRIPTION
       Toybox 0.8.9 multicall binary (see https://landley.net/toybox)

       usage: toybox [--long | --help | --version | [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS...]]

       With no arguments, "toybox" shows available COMMAND names. Add --long to include suggested install path for each command, see https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#install for details.

       First argument is name of a COMMAND to run, followed by any ARGUMENTS to that command. Most toybox commands also understand:

       --help          Show command help (only) --version       Show toybox version (only)

       The filename "-" means stdin/stdout, and "--" stops argument parsing.

       Numerical arguments accept a single letter suffix for kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, and exabytes, plus an additional "d" to indicate decimal 1000's instead of 1024.

       Durations can be decimal fractions and accept minute ("m"), hour ("h"), or day ("d") suffixes (so 0.1m = 6s).
