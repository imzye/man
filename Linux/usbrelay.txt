NAME
       usbrelay - control or query USB HID relays

SYNOPSIS
       usbrelay [OPTION...]  [ACTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       usbrelay allows for querying and setting the state of USB HID electrical relays.  If no ACTION is passed, the state of all relays is printed to stdout.  RELID_N=[0|1] sets the N-th relay on module
       RELID to off or on.

       Multiple actions can be performed with one command

       eg:

       usbrelay REL0A_1=0 REL0A_2=1 REL0B_2=0...

       The Relay module ID can be changed on DCTTECH relays: RELID_0=NEWID sets the relay RELID to NEWID
