NAME
       buildd-vlog - view current build log

SYNOPSIS
       buildd-vlog

VERSION
       This man page documents the packaged version of buildd-vlog.  This version is maintained by the buildd-tools project developers on Alioth (https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd-tools/).

       There  is  also  a version maintained by Ryan Murray which is adapted to build daemon needs, with similar functionality.  This version should be equally capable of working in a buildd setup, but has a
       number of enhancements aimed at making it suitable for use by end-users.

DESCRIPTION
       buildd-vlog monitors the build currently in progress and outputs the log file during the build in a manner similar to tail(1).

FILES
       /etc/buildd/buildd.conf
              Configuration, maintained by the system administrator.  This may be used to override the defaults.

       ~/.builddrc
              User-specific configuration.
