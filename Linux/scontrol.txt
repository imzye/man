NAME
       scontrol - view or modify Slurm configuration and state.

SYNOPSIS
       scontrol [OPTIONS...] [COMMAND...]

DESCRIPTION
       scontrol  is used to view or modify Slurm configuration including: job, job step, node, partition, reservation, and overall system configuration. Most of the commands can only be executed by user root
       or an Administrator. If an attempt to view or modify configuration information is made by an unauthorized user, an error message will be printed and the requested action will not occur.  If no command
       is entered on the execute line, scontrol will operate in an interactive mode and prompt for input. It will continue prompting for input and executing commands until explicitly terminated. If a command
       is entered on the execute line, scontrol will execute that command and terminate. All commands and options are case-insensitive, although  node  names,  partition  names,  and  reservation  names  are
       case-sensitive  (node  names "LX" and "lx" are distinct). All commands and options can be abbreviated to the extent that the specification is unique. A modified Slurm configuration can be written to a
       file using the scontrol write config command. The resulting file will be named using the convention "slurm.conf.<datetime>" and located in the same directory as the original "slurm.conf" file. The di‐
       rectory containing the original slurm.conf must be writable for this to occur.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              When the show command is used, then display all partitions, their jobs and jobs steps. This causes information to be displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that
              are unavailable to user's group.

       -d, --details
              Causes the show command to provide additional details where available.

       --federation
              Report jobs from federation if a member of one.

       -F, --future
              Report nodes in FUTURE state.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message describing the usage of scontrol.

       --hide Do not display information about hidden partitions, their jobs and job steps.  By default, neither partitions that are configured as hidden nor those partitions unavailable to user's group will
              be displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).

       --local
              Show only information local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in the federated if a member of one. Overrides --federation.

       -M, --clusters=<string>
              The cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.  Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.  This option implicitly sets the --local option.

       -o, --oneliner
              Print information one line per record.

       -Q, --quiet
              Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.

       --sibling
              Show all sibling jobs on a federated cluster. Implies --federation.

       -u, --uid=<uid>
              Attempt to update a job as user <uid> instead of the invoking user id.

       -v, --verbose
              Print detailed event logging. Multiple -v's will further increase the verbosity of logging. By default only errors will be displayed.

       -V , --version
              Print version information and exit.

   COMMANDS
       abort  Instruct the Slurm controller to terminate immediately and generate a core file.  See "man slurmctld" for information about where the core file will be written.

       cancel_reboot <NodeList>
              Cancel pending reboots on nodes. The node will be undrain'ed and the reason cleared if the node was drained by an ASAP reboot.

       cluster CLUSTER_NAME
              The cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.

       create SPECIFICATION
              Create a new partition or reservation.  See the full list of parameters below.  Include the tag "res" to create a reservation without specifying a reservation name.

       completing
              Display all jobs in a COMPLETING state along with associated nodes in either a COMPLETING or DOWN state.

       delete SPECIFICATION
              Delete  the entry with the specified SPECIFICATION.  The two SPECIFICATION choices are PartitionName=<name> and Reservation=<name>. Reservations and partitions should have no associated jobs at
              the time of their deletion (modify the jobs first).  If the specified partition is in use, the request is denied.

       errnumstr ERRNO
              Given a Slurm error number, return a descriptive string.

       fsdampeningfactor FACTOR
              Set the FairShareDampeningFactor in slurmctld.

       help   Display a description of scontrol options and commands.

       hold job_list
              Prevent a pending job from being started (sets its priority to 0).  Use the release command to permit the job to be scheduled.  The job_list argument is a comma separated list  of  job  IDs  OR
              "jobname=" with the job's name, which will attempt to hold all jobs having that name.  Note that when a job is held by a system administrator using the hold command, only a system administrator
              may release the job for execution (also see the uhold command). When the job is held by its owner, it may also be released by the job's owner.  Additionally, attempting to hold  a  running  job
              will have not suspend or cancel it. But, it will set the job priority to 0 and update the job reason field, which would hold the job if it was requeued at a later time.

       notify job_id message
              Send a message to standard error of the salloc or srun command or batch job associated with the specified job_id.

       pidinfo proc_id
              Print  the  Slurm  job id and scheduled termination time corresponding to the supplied process id, proc_id, on the current node.  This will work only with processes on node on which scontrol is
              run, and only for those processes spawned by Slurm and their descendants.

       listpids [job_id[.step_id]] [NodeName]
              Print a listing of the process IDs in a job step (if JOBID.STEPID is provided), or all of the job steps in a job (if job_id is provided), or all of the job steps in all of the jobs on the local
              node (if job_id is not provided or job_id is "*").  This will work only with processes on the node on which scontrol is run, and only for those processes spawned by Slurm and their descendants.
              Note that some Slurm configurations (ProctrackType value of pgid) are unable to identify all processes associated with a job or job step.

              Note that the NodeName option is only really useful when you have multiple slurmd daemons running on the same host machine.  Multiple slurmd daemons on one host are, in general,  only  used  by
              Slurm developers.

       ping   Ping the primary and secondary slurmctld daemon and report if they are responding.

       reboot [ASAP] [nextstate=<RESUME|DOWN>] [reason=<reason>] <ALL|NodeList>
              Reboot  the  nodes in the system when they become idle using the RebootProgram as configured in Slurm's slurm.conf file.  Each node will have the "REBOOT" flag added to its node state.  After a
              node reboots and the slurmd daemon starts up again, the HealthCheckProgram will run once. Then, the slurmd daemon will register itself with the slurmctld daemon and the "REBOOT"  flag  will  be
              cleared.   The node's "DRAIN" state flag will be cleared if the reboot was "ASAP", nextstate=resume or down.  The "ASAP" option adds the "DRAIN" flag to each node's state, preventing additional
              jobs from running on the node so it can be rebooted and returned to service "As Soon As Possible" (i.e. ASAP).  "ASAP" will also set the node reason to "Reboot  ASAP"  if  the  "reason"  option
              isn't  specified.   If the "nextstate" option is specified as "DOWN", then the node will remain in a down state after rebooting. If "nextstate" is specified as "RESUME", then the nodes will re‐
              sume as normal and the node's reason and "DRAIN" state will be cleared.  Resuming nodes will be considered as available in backfill future scheduling and won't be replaced by idle  nodes  in  a
              reservation.   The  "reason"  option sets each node's reason to a user-defined message.  A default reason of "reboot requested" is set if no other reason is set on the node.  The reason will be
              appended with "reboot issued" when the reboot is issued and "reboot complete" when the node registers and has a "nextstate" of "DOWN".  You must specify either a list of nodes or that ALL nodes
              are  to  be  rebooted.  NOTE: By default, this command does not prevent additional jobs from being scheduled on any nodes before reboot.  To do this, you can either use the "ASAP" option or ex‐
              plicitly drain the nodes beforehand.  You can alternately create an advanced reservation to prevent additional jobs from being initiated on nodes to be rebooted.  Pending reboots  can  be  can‐
              celled by using "scontrol cancel_reboot <node>" or setting the node state to "CANCEL_REBOOT".  A node will be marked "DOWN" if it doesn't reboot within ResumeTimeout.

       reconfigure
              Instruct  all  Slurm  daemons  to  re-read  the configuration file.  This command does not restart the daemons.  This mechanism would be used to modify configuration parameters (Epilog, Prolog,
              SlurmctldLogFile, SlurmdLogFile, etc.).  The Slurm controller (slurmctld) forwards the request to all other daemons (slurmd daemon on each compute node). Running jobs continue execution.   Most
              configuration  parameters  can  be changed by just running this command, however, Slurm daemons should be shutdown and restarted if any of these parameters are to be changed: AuthType, Control‐
              Mach, PluginDir, StateSaveLocation, SlurmctldHost, SlurmctldPort, or SlurmdPort. The slurmctld daemon and all slurmd daemons must be restarted if nodes are added to or removed from the cluster.

       release job_list
              Release a previously held job to begin execution.  The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs OR "jobname=" with the job's name, which will attempt to hold all jobs having  that
              name.  Also see hold.

       requeue [option] job_list
              Requeue a running, suspended or finished Slurm batch job into pending state.  The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.  The command accepts the following option:

              Incomplete
                     Operate only on jobs (or tasks of a job array) which have not completed.  Specifically only jobs in the following states will be requeued: CONFIGURING, RUNNING, STOPPED or SUSPENDED.

       requeuehold [option] job_list
              Requeue  a running, suspended or finished Slurm batch job into pending state, moreover the job is put in held state (priority zero).  The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.
              A held job can be released using scontrol to reset its priority (e.g.  "scontrol release <job_id>"). The command accepts the following options:

              Incomplete
                     Operate only on jobs (or tasks of a job array) which have not completed.  Specifically only jobs in the following states will be requeued: CONFIGURING, RUNNING, STOPPED or SUSPENDED.

              State=SpecialExit
                     The "SpecialExit" keyword specifies that the job has to be put in a special state JOB_SPECIAL_EXIT.  The "scontrol show job" command will display the JobState as SPECIAL_EXIT, while  the
                     "squeue" command as SE.

       resume job_list
              Resume a previously suspended job.  The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.  Also see suspend.

              NOTE:  A  suspended  job releases its CPUs for allocation to other jobs.  Resuming a previously suspended job may result in multiple jobs being allocated the same CPUs, which could trigger gang
              scheduling with some configurations or severe degradation in performance with other configurations.  Use of the scancel command to send SIGSTOP and SIGCONT signals would stop a job without  re‐
              leasing  its  CPUs for allocation to other jobs and would be a preferable mechanism in many cases.  If performing system maintenance you may want to use suspend/resume in the following way. Be‐
              fore suspending set all nodes to draining or set all partitions to down so that no new jobs can be scheduled. Then suspend jobs. Once maintenance is done resume jobs then  resume  nodes  and/or
              set all partitions back to up.  Use with caution.

       schedloglevel LEVEL
              Enable  or disable scheduler logging.  LEVEL may be "0", "1", "disable" or "enable". "0" has the same effect as "disable". "1" has the same effect as "enable".  This value is temporary and will
              be overwritten when the slurmctld daemon reads the slurm.conf configuration file (e.g. when the daemon is restarted or scontrol reconfigure is executed) if the SlurmSchedLogLevel  parameter  is
              present.

       setdebug LEVEL
              Change the debug level of the slurmctld daemon.  LEVEL may be an integer value between zero and nine (using the same values as SlurmctldDebug in the slurm.conf file) or the name of the most de‐
              tailed message type to be printed: "quiet", "fatal", "error", "info", "verbose", "debug", "debug2", "debug3", "debug4", or "debug5".  This value is temporary and will  be  overwritten  whenever
              the slurmctld daemon reads the slurm.conf configuration file (e.g. when the daemon is restarted or scontrol reconfigure is executed).

       setdebugflags [+|-]FLAG
              Add  or  remove DebugFlags of the slurmctld daemon.  See "man slurm.conf" for a list of supported DebugFlags.  NOTE: Changing the value of some DebugFlags will have no effect without restarting
              the slurmctld daemon, which would set DebugFlags based upon the contents of the slurm.conf configuration file.

       show ENTITY ID
              or

       show ENTITY=ID
              Display the state of the specified entity with the specified identification.  ENTITY may be aliases, assoc_mgr, bbstat, burstbuffer, config, daemons, dwstat, federation,  frontend,  job,  node,
              partition,  reservation, slurmd, step, topology, hostlist, hostlistsorted or hostnames ID can be used to identify a specific element of the identified entity: job ID, node name, partition name,
              reservation name, or job step ID for job, node, partition, or step respectively.  For an ENTITY of bbstat or dwstat (they are equivalent) optional arguments are the options of the local  status
              command.   The status commands will be executed by the slurmctld daemon and its response returned to the user.  For an ENTITY of topology, the ID may be a node or switch name.  If one node name
              is specified, all switches connected to that node (and their parent switches) will be shown.  If more than one node name is specified, only switches that connect to  all  named  nodes  will  be
              shown.   aliases will return all NodeName values associated to a given NodeHostname (useful to get the list of virtual nodes associated with a real node in a configuration where multiple slurmd
              daemons  execute  on  a  single  compute  node).   assoc_mgr  displays  the  current  contents  of  the  slurmctld's  internal  cache  for  users,  associations  and/or  qos.  The  ID  may   be
              users=<user1>,[...,<userN>],  accounts=<acct1>,[...,<acctN>],  qos=<qos1>,[...,<qosN>] and/or flags=<users,assoc,qos>, used to filter the desired section to be displayed. If no flags are speci‐
              fied, all sections are displayed.  burstbuffer displays the current status of the BurstBuffer plugin.  config displays parameter names from the configuration files in mixed case  (e.g.  Slurmd‐
              Port=7003)  while  derived  parameters names are in upper case only (e.g. SLURM_VERSION).  hostnames takes an optional hostlist expression as input and writes a list of individual host names to
              standard output (one per line). If no hostlist expression is supplied, the contents of the SLURM_JOB_NODELIST environment variable is used. For example "tux[1-3]" is mapped to "tux1","tux2" and
              "tux3"  (one  hostname per line).  hostlist takes a list of host names and prints the hostlist expression for them (the inverse of hostnames).  hostlist can also take the absolute pathname of a
              file (beginning with the character '/') containing a list of hostnames.  Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]"). All other  ID  values  must
              identify  a  single  element. The job step ID is of the form "job_id.step_id", (e.g. "1234.1").  slurmd reports the current status of the slurmd daemon executing on the same node from which the
              scontrol command is executed (the local host). It can be useful to diagnose problems.  By default hostlist does not sort the node list or make it unique (e.g. tux2,tux1,tux2 = tux[2,1-2]).   If
              you  wanted  a  sorted list use hostlistsorted (e.g. tux2,tux1,tux2 = tux[1-2,2]).  By default, all elements of the entity type specified are printed.  For an ENTITY of job, if the job does not
              specify socket-per-node, cores-per-socket or threads-per-core then it will display '*' in ReqS:C:T=*:*:* field. For an ENTITY of federation, the federation name that the controller is  part  of
              and the sibling clusters part of the federation will be listed.

       shutdown OPTION
              Instruct Slurm daemons to save current state and terminate.  By default, the Slurm controller (slurmctld) forwards the request all other daemons (slurmd daemon on each compute node).  An OPTION
              of slurmctld or controller results in only the slurmctld daemon being shutdown and the slurmd daemons remaining active.

       suspend job_list
              Suspend a running job.  The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.  Use the resume command to resume its execution.  User processes must stop on receipt of SIGSTOP  signal  and
              resume upon receipt of SIGCONT for this operation to be effective.  Not all architectures and configurations support job suspension.  If a suspended job is requeued, it will be placed in a held
              state.  The time a job is suspended will not count against a job's time limit.  Only an operator, administrator, SlurmUser, or root can suspend jobs.

       takeover [INDEX]
              Instruct one of Slurm's backup controllers (slurmctld) to take over system control. By default the first backup controller (INDEX=1) requests control from the primary and waits for its termina‐
              tion.  After  that,  it switches from backup mode to controller mode. If primary controller can not be contacted, it directly switches to controller mode. This can be used to speed up the Slurm
              controller fail-over mechanism when the primary node is down.  This can be used to minimize disruption if the computer executing the primary Slurm controller is scheduled down.  (Note:  Slurm's
              primary controller will take the control back at startup.)

       top job_list
              Move  the specified job IDs to the top of the queue of jobs belonging to the identical user ID, partition name, account, and QOS.  The job_list argument is a comma separated ordered list of job
              IDs.  Any job not matching all of those fields will not be effected.  Only jobs submitted to a single partition will be effected.  This operation changes the order of jobs by adjusting job nice
              values.   The  net  effect on that user's throughput will be negligible to slightly negative.  This operation is disabled by default for non-privileged (non-operator, admin, SlurmUser, or root)
              users. This operation may be enabled for non-privileged users by the system administrator by including the option "enable_user_top" in the SchedulerParameters configuration parameter.

       token [lifespan=<lifespan>] [username=<username>]
              Return an auth token which can be used to support JWT authentication if AuthAltTypes=auth/jwt has been enabled on the system.  Supports two optional arguments. lifespan= may be used to  specify
              the token's lifespan in seconds. username (only available to SlurmUser/root) may be used to request a token for a different username.

       uhold job_list
              Prevent  a  pending  job  from being started (sets its priority to 0).  The job_list argument is a space separated list of job IDs or job names.  Use the release command to permit the job to be
              scheduled.  This command is designed for a system administrator to hold a job so that the job owner may release it rather than requiring the intervention of a system administrator (also see the
              hold command).

       update SPECIFICATION
              Update  job,  step,  node, partition, or reservation configuration per the supplied specification. SPECIFICATION is in the same format as the Slurm configuration file and the output of the show
              command described above. It may be desirable to execute the show command (described above) on the specific entity you want to update, then use cut-and-paste tools to enter updated configuration
              values  to  the  update. Note that while most configuration values can be changed using this command, not all can be changed using this mechanism. In particular, the hardware configuration of a
              node or the physical addition or removal of nodes from the cluster may only be accomplished through editing the Slurm configuration file and executing the reconfigure command (described above).

       version
              Display the version number of scontrol being executed.

       wait_job job_id
              Wait until a job and all of its nodes are ready for use or the job has entered some termination state. This option is particularly useful in the Slurm Prolog or in the batch  script  itself  if
              nodes are powered down and restarted automatically as needed.

              NOTE: Don't use scontrol wait_job in PrologSlurmctld or Prolog with PrologFlags=Alloc as this will result in a deadlock.

       write batch_script job_id optional_filename
              Write the batch script for a given job_id to a file or to stdout. The file will default to slurm-<job_id>.sh if the optional filename argument is not given. The script will be written to stdout
              if - is given instead of a filename.  The batch script can only be retrieved by an admin or operator, or by the owner of the job.

       write config optional_filename
              Write the current configuration to a file with the naming convention of "slurm.conf.<datetime>" in the same directory as the original slurm.conf file.  If a filename is given that file location
              with a .<datetime> suffix is created.

   INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
       NOTE: All commands listed below can be used in the interactive mode, but NOT on the initial command line.

       all    Show all partitions, their jobs and jobs steps. This causes information to be displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that are unavailable to user's group.

       details
              Causes the show command to provide additional details where available.  Job information will include CPUs and NUMA memory allocated on each node.  Note that on computers with hyperthreading en‐
              abled and Slurm configured to allocate cores, each listed CPU represents one physical core.  Each hyperthread on that core can be allocated a separate task, so a job's CPU count and task  count
              may differ.  See the --cpu-bind and --mem-bind option descriptions in srun man pages for more information.  The details option is currently only supported for the show job command.

       exit   Terminate scontrol interactive session.

       hide   Do not display partition, job or jobs step information for partitions that are configured as hidden or partitions that are unavailable to the user's group.  This is the default behavior.

       oneliner
              Print information one line per record.

       quiet  Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.

       quit   Terminate the execution of scontrol.

       verbose
              Print detailed event logging.  This includes time-stamps on data structures, record counts, etc.

       !!     Repeat the last command executed.

   JOBS - SPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND
       Note  that  update requests done by either root, SlurmUser or Administrators are not subject to certain restrictions. For instance, if an Administrator changes the QOS on a pending job, certain limits
       such as the TimeLimit will not be changed automatically as changes made by the Administrators are allowed to violate these restrictions.

       Account=<account>
              Account name to be changed for this job's resource use.  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "Account=".

       AdminComment=<spec>
              Arbitrary descriptive string. Can only be set by a Slurm administrator.

       ArrayTaskThrottle=<count>
              Specify the maximum number of tasks in a job array that can execute at the same time.  Set the count to zero in order to eliminate any limit.  The task throttle count for a  job  array  is  re‐
              ported as part of its ArrayTaskId field, preceded with a percent sign.  For example "ArrayTaskId=1-10%2" indicates the maximum number of running tasks is limited to 2.

       BurstBuffer=<spec>
              Burst buffer specification to be changed for this job's resource use.  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "BurstBuffer=".  Format is burst buffer plugin specific.

       Clusters=<spec>
              Specifies the clusters that the federated job can run on.

       ClusterFeatures=<spec>
              Specifies features that a federated cluster must have to have a sibling job submitted to it. Slurm will attempt to submit a sibling job to a cluster if it has at least one of the specified fea‐
              tures.

       Comment=<spec>
              Arbitrary descriptive string.

       Contiguous=<yes|no>
              Set the job's requirement for contiguous (consecutive) nodes to be allocated.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".  Only the Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.

       CoreSpec=<count>
              Number of cores to reserve per node for system use.  The job will be charged for these cores, but be unable to use them.  Will be reported as "*" if not constrained.

       CPUsPerTask=<count>
              Change the CPUsPerTask job's value.

       Deadline=<time_spec>
              It accepts times of the form HH:MM:SS to specify a deadline to a job at a specific time of day (seconds are optional).  You may also specify midnight, noon, fika (3 PM) or teatime  (4  PM)  and
              you  can  have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for a deadline in the morning or the evening.  You can specify a deadline for the job with a date of the form MMDDYY or MM/DD/YY or MM.DD.YY,
              or a date and time as YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]].  You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be seconds (default), minutes, hours, days, or weeks  and  you  can
              tell  Slurm  to  put  a deadline for tomorrow with the keyword tomorrow.  The specified deadline must be later than the current time.  Only pending jobs can have the deadline updated.  Only the
              Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.

       DelayBoot=<time_spec>
              Change the time to decide whether to reboot nodes in order to satisfy job's feature specification if the job has been eligible to run for less than this time period. See salloc/sbatch man pages
              option --delay-boot.

       Dependency=<dependency_list>
              Defer  job's  initiation  until  specified  job  dependency  specification is satisfied.  Cancel dependency with an empty dependency_list (e.g. "Dependency=").  <dependency_list> is of the form
              <type:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]>.  Many jobs can share the same dependency and these jobs may even belong to different  users.

              after:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have begun execution or been canceled.

              afterany:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated.

              afternotok:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated in some failed state (non-zero exit code, node failure, timed out, etc).

              afterok:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully executed (ran to completion with an exit code of zero).

              singleton
                     This job can begin execution after any previously launched jobs sharing the same job name and user have terminated.  In other words, only one job by that name and owned by that user  can
                     be running or suspended at any point in time.

       EligibleTime=<time_spec>
              See StartTime.

       EndTime
              The time the job is expected to terminate based on the job's time limit.  When the job ends sooner, this field will be updated with the actual end time.

       ExcNodeList=<nodes>
              Set the job's list of excluded node. Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]").  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "ExcNodeList=".

       Features=<features>
              Set  the  job's  required  node  features.   The  list  of  features  may  include  multiple  feature  names  separated by ampersand (AND) and/or vertical bar (OR) operators.  For example: Fea‐
              tures="opteron&video" or Features="fast|faster".  In the first example, only nodes having both the feature "opteron" AND the feature "video" will be used.  There is no mechanism to specify that
              you  want  one  node  with  feature "opteron" and another node with feature "video" in case no node has both features.  If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated
              nodes, then use the OR operator and enclose the options within square brackets.  For example: "Features=[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]" might be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated on a
              single  rack  of the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.  A request can also specify the number of nodes needed with some feature by appending an asterisk and count after the fea‐
              ture name.  For example "Features=graphics*4" indicates that at least four allocated nodes must have the feature "graphics."  Parenthesis are also supported for features to be  ANDed  together.
              For  example  "Features=[(knl&a2a&flat)*4&haswell*2]"  indicates  the  resource allocation should include 4 nodes with ALL of the features "knl", "a2a", and "flat" plus 2 nodes with the feature
              "haswell".  Constraints with node counts may only be combined with AND operators.  Value may be cleared with blank data value, for example "Features=".

       Gres=<list>
              Specifies a comma delimited list of generic consumable resources.  The format of each entry on the list is "name[:count[*cpu]]".  The name is that of the consumable resource.  The count is  the
              number  of those resources with a default value of 1.  The specified resources will be allocated to the job on each node allocated unless "*cpu" is appended, in which case the resources will be
              allocated on a per cpu basis.  The available generic consumable resources is configurable by the system administrator.  A list of available generic consumable resources will be printed and  the
              command will exit if the option argument is "help".  Examples of use include "Gres=gpus:2*cpu,disk=40G" and "Gres=help".

       JobId=<job_list>
              Identify the job(s) to be updated.  The job_list may be a comma separated list of job IDs.  Either JobId or JobName is required.

       Licenses=<name>
              Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) as described in salloc/sbatch/srun man pages.

       MailType=<types>
              Set  the  mail  event  types. Valid type values are NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, REQUEUE, ALL (equivalent to BEGIN, END, FAIL, REQUEUE, and STAGE_OUT), STAGE_OUT (burst buffer stage out and teardown
              completed), TIME_LIMIT, TIME_LIMIT_90 (reached 90 percent of time limit), TIME_LIMIT_80 (reached 80 percent of time limit), TIME_LIMIT_50 (reached 50 percent  of  time  limit)  and  ARRAY_TASKS
              (send emails for each array task). Multiple type values may be specified in a comma separated list. Unless the ARRAY_TASKS option is specified, mail notifications on job BEGIN, END and FAIL ap‐
              ply to a job array as a whole rather than generating individual email messages for each task in the job array.

       MailUser=<name>
              Set the user to receive email notification of state changes. A blank string will set the mail user to the default which is the submitting user.

       MinCPUsNode=<count>
              Set the job's minimum number of CPUs per node to the specified value.

       MinMemoryCPU=<megabytes>
              Set the job's minimum real memory required per allocated CPU to the specified value. Either MinMemoryCPU or MinMemoryNode may be set, but not both.

       MinMemoryNode=<megabytes>
              Set the job's minimum real memory required per node to the specified value.  Either MinMemoryCPU or MinMemoryNode may be set, but not both.

       MinTmpDiskNode=<megabytes>
              Set the job's minimum temporary disk space required per node to the specified value.  Only the Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.

       TimeMin=<timespec>
              Change TimeMin value which specifies the minimum time limit minutes of the job.

       JobName=<name>
              Identify the name of jobs to be modified or set the job's name to the specified value.  When used to identify jobs to be modified, all jobs belonging to all users are modified unless the UserID
              option is used to identify a specific user.  Either JobId or JobName is required.

       Name[=<name>]
              See JobName.

       Nice[=<adjustment>]
              Update  the  job with an adjusted scheduling priority within Slurm. With no adjustment value the scheduling priority is decreased by 100. A negative nice value increases the priority, otherwise
              decreases it. The adjustment range is +/- 2147483645. Only privileged users can specify a negative adjustment.

       NodeList=<nodes>
              Change the nodes allocated to a running job to shrink its size.  The specified list of nodes must be a subset of the nodes currently allocated to the job. Multiple node names may  be  specified
              using  simple  node  range expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]"). After a job's allocation is reduced, subsequent srun commands must explicitly specify node and task counts which are valid for the new
              allocation.

       NumCPUs=<min_count>[-<max_count>]
              Set the job's minimum and optionally maximum count of CPUs to be allocated.

       NumNodes=<min_count>[-<max_count>]
              Set the job's minimum and optionally maximum count of nodes to be allocated.  If the job is already running, use this to specify a node count less than currently allocated and resources  previ‐
              ously  allocated  to the job will be relinquished. After a job's allocation is reduced, subsequent srun commands must explicitly specify node and task counts which are valid for the new alloca‐
              tion. Also see the NodeList parameter above. This is the same as ReqNodes.

       NumTasks=<count>
              Set the job's count of required tasks to the specified value. This is the same as ReqProcs.

       OverSubscribe=<yes|no>
              Set the job's ability to share compute resources (i.e. individual CPUs) with other jobs. Possible values are "YES" and "NO".  This option can only be changed for pending jobs.

       Partition=<name>
              Set the job's partition to the specified value.

       Priority=<number>
              Set the job's priority to the specified value.  Note that a job priority of zero prevents the job from ever being scheduled.  By setting a job's priority to zero it is held.  Set  the  priority
              to a non-zero value to permit it to run.  Explicitly setting a job's priority clears any previously set nice value and removes the priority/multifactor plugin's ability to manage a job's prior‐
              ity.  In order to restore the priority/multifactor plugin's ability to manage a job's priority, hold and then release the job.  Only the Slurm administrator or root can increase job's priority.

       QOS=<name>
              Set the job's QOS (Quality Of Service) to the specified value.  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "QOS=".

       Reboot=<yes|no>
              Set the job's flag that specifies whether to force the allocated nodes to reboot before starting the job. This is only supported with some  system  configurations  and  therefore  it  could  be
              silently ignored.

       ReqCores=<count>
              Change the job's requested Cores count.

       ReqNodeList=<nodes>
              Set the job's list of required node. Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]").  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "ReqNodeList=".

       ReqNodes=<min_count>[-<max_count>]
              See NumNodes.

       ReqProcs=<count>
              See NumTasks.

       ReqSockets=<count>
              Change the job's requested socket count.

       ReqThreads=<count>
              Change the job's requested threads count.

       Requeue=<0|1>
              Stipulates whether a job should be requeued after a node failure: 0 for no, 1 for yes.

       ReservationName=<name>
              Set the job's reservation to the specified value.  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "ReservationName=".

       ResetAccrueTime
              Reset  the job's accrue time value to 0 meaning it will lose any time previously accrued for priority.  Helpful if you have a large queue of jobs already in the queue and want to start limiting
              how many jobs can accrue time without waiting for the queue to flush out.

       SiteFactor=<account>
              Specify the job's admin priority factor in the range of +/-2147483645.  Only privileged users can modify the value.

       StdOut=<filepath>
              Set the batch job's stdout file path.

       Shared=<yes|no>
              See OverSubscribe option above.

       StartTime=<time_spec>
              Set the job's earliest initiation time.  It accepts times of the form HH:MM:SS to run a job at a specific time of day (seconds are optional).  (If that time is already past, the next day is as‐
              sumed.)   You  may  also specify midnight, noon, fika (3 PM) or teatime (4 PM) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening.  You can also say
              what day the job will be run, by specifying a date of the form MMDDYY or MM/DD/YY or MM.DD.YY, or a date and time as  YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]].   You  can  also  give  times  like  now  +  count
              time-units, where the time-units can be seconds (default), minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell Slurm to run the job today with the keyword today and to run the job tomorrow with the
              keyword tomorrow.

              Notes on date/time specifications:
               - although the 'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is allowed by the code, note that the poll time of the Slurm scheduler is not precise enough to guarantee dispatch of the  job
              on  the exact second.  The job will be eligible to start on the next poll following the specified time. The exact poll interval depends on the Slurm scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds with the default
              sched/builtin).
               - if no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
               - if a date is specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current year is assumed, unless the combination of MM/DD and HH:MM:SS has already passed for that year, in which  case  the  next
              year is used.

       Switches=<count>[@<max-time-to-wait>]
              When  a tree topology is used, this defines the maximum count of switches desired for the job allocation. If Slurm finds an allocation containing more switches than the count specified, the job
              remain pending until it either finds an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit expires. By default there is no switch count limit and no time limit delay. Set the count to  zero
              in  order to clean any previously set count (disabling the limit).  The job's maximum time delay may be limited by the system administrator using the SchedulerParameters configuration parameter
              with the max_switch_wait parameter option.  Also see wait-for-switch.

       wait-for-switch=<seconds>
              Change max time to wait for a switch <seconds> secs.

       TasksPerNode=<count>
              Change the job's requested TasksPerNode.

       ThreadSpec=<count>
              Number of threads to reserve per node for system use.  The job will be charged for these threads, but be unable to use them.  Will be reported as "*" if not constrained.

       TimeLimit=<time>
              The job's time limit.  Output format is [days-]hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".  Input format (for update command)  set  is  minutes,  minutes:seconds,  hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,
              days-hours:minutes  or days-hours:minutes:seconds.  Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to the next minute.  If changing the time limit of a job, either specify a new
              time limit value or precede the time and equal sign with a "+" or "-" to increment or decrement the current time limit (e.g. "TimeLimit+=30"). In order to increment  or  decrement  the  current
              time  limit,  the  JobId  specification must precede the TimeLimit specification.  Note that incrementing or decrementing the time limit for a job array is only allowed before the job array has
              been split into more than one job record.  Only the Slurm administrator or root can increase job's TimeLimit.

       UserID=<UID or name>
              Used with the JobName option to identify jobs to be modified.  Either a user name or numeric ID (UID), may be specified.

       WCKey=<key>
              Set the job's workload characterization key to the specified value.

       WorkDir=<directory_name>
              Set the job's working directory to the specified value. Note that this may only be set for jobs in the PENDING state, and that jobs may fail to launch if they rely  on  relative  paths  to  the
              originally submitted WorkDir.

   JOBS - SPECIFICATIONS FOR SHOW COMMAND
       The  "show" command, when used with the "job" or "job <jobid>" entity displays detailed information about a job or jobs.  Much of this information may be modified using the "update job" command as de‐
       scribed above.  However, the following fields displayed by the show job command are read-only and cannot be modified:

       AllocNode:Sid
              Local node and system id making the resource allocation.

       BatchFlag
              Jobs submitted using the sbatch command have BatchFlag set to 1.  Jobs submitted using other commands have BatchFlag set to 0.

       ExitCode=<exit>:<sig>
              Exit status reported for the job by the wait() function.  The first number is the exit code, typically as set by the exit() function.  The second number of the signal that caused the process to
              terminate if it was terminated by a signal.

       GroupId
              The group under which the job was submitted.

       JobState
              The current state of the job.

       NodeListIndices
              The NodeIndices expose the internal indices into the node table associated with the node(s) allocated to the job.

       NtasksPerN:B:S:C=
              <tasks_per_node>:<tasks_per_baseboard>:<tasks_per_socket>:<tasks_per_core> Specifies the number of tasks to be started per hardware component (node, baseboard, socket and core).  Unconstrained
              values may be shown as "0" or "*".

       PreemptEligibleTime
              Time the job becomes eligible for preemption. Modified by PreemptExemptTime, either from the global option in slurm.conf or the job QOS. This is hidden if the job has not started or if Preempt‐
              Mode=OFF.

       PreemptTime
              Time at which job was signaled that it was selected for preemption.  (Meaningful only for PreemptMode=CANCEL and the partition or QOS with which the job is associated has a GraceTime value des‐
              ignated.) This is hidden if the job has not started or if PreemptMode=OFF.

       PreSusTime
              Time the job ran prior to last suspend.

       Reason The reason job is not running: e.g., waiting "Resources".

       ReqB:S:C:T=
              <baseboard_count>:<socket_per_baseboard_count>:<core_per_socket_count>:<thread_per_core_count> Specifies the count of various hardware components requested by the job.  Unconstrained values may
              be shown as "0" or "*".

       SecsPreSuspend=<seconds>
              If the job is suspended, this is the run time accumulated by the job (in seconds) prior to being suspended.

       Socks/Node=<count>
              Count of desired sockets per node

       SubmitTime
              The time  and  date stamp (in localtime) the job was submitted.  The format of the output is identical to that of the EndTime field.

              NOTE:  If  a job is requeued, the submit time is reset.  To obtain the original submit time it is necessary to use the "sacct -j <job_id[.<step_id>]" command also designating the -D or --dupli‐
              cate option to display all duplicate entries for a job.

       SuspendTime
              Time the job was last suspended or resumed.

              NOTE on information displayed for various job states: When you submit a request for the "show job" function the scontrol process makes an RPC request call to slurmctld with  a  REQUEST_JOB_INFO
              message type.  If the state of the job is PENDING, then it returns some detail information such as: min_nodes, min_procs, cpus_per_task, etc. If the state is other than PENDING the code assumes
              that it is in a further state such as RUNNING, COMPLETE, etc. In these cases the code explicitly returns zero for these values. These values are meaningless once the job resources have been al‐
              located and the job has started.

   STEPS - SPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND
       StepId=<job_id>[.<step_id>]
              Identify the step to be updated.  If the job_id is given, but no step_id is specified then all steps of the identified job will be modified.  This specification is required.

       CompFile=<completion file>
              Update  a  step with information about a step's completion.  Can be useful if step statistics aren't directly available through a jobacct_gather plugin.  The file is a space-delimited file with
              format for Version 1 is as follows

              1 34461 0 2 0 3 1361906011 1361906015 1 1 3368 13357 /bin/sleep

              K maxrss
              L uid
              M command name

       TimeLimit=<time>
              The job's time limit.  Output format is [days-]hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".  Input format (for update command)  set  is  minutes,  minutes:seconds,  hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,
              days-hours:minutes or days-hours:minutes:seconds.  Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to the next minute.  If changing the time limit of a step, either specify a new
              time limit value or precede the time with a "+" or "-" to increment or decrement the current time limit (e.g. "TimeLimit=+30"). In order to increment or decrement the current  time  limit,  the
              StepId specification must precede the TimeLimit specification.

   NODES - SPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND
       NodeName=<name>
              Identify the node(s) to be updated. Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]"). This specification is required.

       ActiveFeatures=<features>
              Identify  the feature(s) currently active on the specified node.  Any previously active feature specification will be overwritten with the new value.  Also see AvailableFeatures.  Typically Ac‐
              tiveFeatures will be identical to AvailableFeatures; however ActiveFeatures may be configured as a subset of the AvailableFeatures. For example, a node may be booted in multiple configurations.
              In that case, all possible configurations may be identified as AvailableFeatures, while ActiveFeatures would identify the current node configuration.

       AvailableFeatures=<features>
              Identify the feature(s) available on the specified node.  Any previously defined available feature specification will be overwritten with the new value.  AvailableFeatures assigned via scontrol
              will only persist across the restart of the slurmctld daemon with the -R option and state files preserved or slurmctld's receipt of a SIGHUP.  Update slurm.conf with any  changes  meant  to  be
              persistent across normal restarts of slurmctld or the execution of scontrol reconfig.

              Note: Available features being removed via scontrol must not be active (i.e. remove them from ActiveFeatures first).

       Comment=<comment>
              Arbitrary descriptive string.  Use quotes to enclose a comment having more than one word

       CpuBind=<node>
              Specify  the  task  binding  mode  to be used by default for this node.  Supported options include: "none", "board", "socket", "ldom" (NUMA), "core", "thread" and "off" (remove previous binding
              mode).

       Gres=<gres>
              Identify generic resources to be associated with the specified node.  Any previously defined generic resources will be overwritten with the new value.  Specifications for multiple  generic  re‐
              sources should be comma separated.  Each resource specification consists of a name followed by an optional colon with a numeric value (default value is one) (e.g. "Gres=bandwidth:10000").  Mod‐
              ification of GRES count associated with specific files (e.g. GPUs) is not allowed other than to set their count on a node to zero.  In order to change the GRES count to  another  value,  modify
              your  slurm.conf  and gres.conf files and restart daemons.  If GRES as associated with specific sockets, that information will be reported For example if all 4 GPUs on a node are all associated
              with socket zero, then "Gres=gpu:4(S:0)". If associated with sockets 0 and 1 then "Gres=gpu:4(S:0-1)".  The information of which specific GPUs are associated with specific GPUs is not reported,
              but  only  available by parsing the gres.conf file.  Generic resources assigned via scontrol will only persist across the restart of the slurmctld daemon with the -R option and state files pre‐
              served or slurmctld's receipt of a SIGHUP.  Update slurm.conf with any changes meant to be persistent across normal restarts of slurmctld or the execution of scontrol reconfig.

       NodeAddr=<node address>
              Name that a node should be referred to in establishing a communications path.  This name will be used as an argument to the getaddrinfo() function for identification. If a node range expression
              is used to designate multiple nodes, they must exactly match the entries in the NodeName (e.g. "NodeName=lx[0-7] NodeAddr=elx[0-7]"). NodeAddr may also contain IP addresses.

       NodeHostname=<node hostname>
              Typically  this would be the string that "/bin/hostname -s" returns.  It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by "/bin/hostname -f" (e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain
              name associated with the host through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver settings. Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it may prevent  use  of
              hostlist  expressions  (the numeric portion in brackets must be at the end of the string). A node range expression can be used to specify a set of nodes. If an expression is used, the number of
              nodes identified by NodeHostname must be identical to the number of nodes identified by NodeName.

       Reason=<reason>
              Identify the reason the node is in a "DOWN", "DRAINED", "DRAINING", "FAILING" or "FAIL" state.  Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.

       State=<state>
              Identify the state to be assigned to the node. Possible node states are "NoResp", "ALLOC", "ALLOCATED", "COMPLETING", "DOWN", "DRAIN", "FAIL",  "FAILING",  "FUTURE"  "IDLE",  "MAINT",  "MIXED",
              "PERFCTRS/NPC",  "RESERVED",  "POWER_DOWN",  "POWER_UP",  "RESUME"  or  "UNDRAIN". Not all of those states can be set using the scontrol command only the following can: "CANCEL_REBOOT", "DOWN",
              "DRAIN", "FAIL", "FUTURE", "RESUME", "NoResp", "POWER_DOWN", "POWER_UP" and "UNDRAIN".  If a node is in a "MIXED" state it usually means the node is in multiple states.  For  instance  if  only
              part  of the node is "ALLOCATED" and the rest of the node is "IDLE" the state will be "MIXED".  If you want to remove a node from service, you typically want to set its state to "DRAIN".  "CAN‐
              CEL_REBOOT" cancels a pending reboot on the node (same as "scontrol cancel_reboot <node>").  "FAILING" is similar to "DRAIN" except that some applications will seek to  relinquish  those  nodes
              before the job completes.  "PERFCTRS/NPC" indicates that Network Performance Counters associated with this node are in use, rendering this node as not usable for any other jobs.  "RESERVED" in‐
              dicates the node is in an advanced reservation and not generally available.  "RESUME" is not an actual node state, but will change a node state from "DRAINED", "DRAINING", "DOWN" or "REBOOT" to
              either  "IDLE"  or  "ALLOCATED"  state  as  appropriate.  "RESUME" will also clear the "POWERING_DOWN" state of a node and make it eligible to be allocted.  "UNDRAIN" clears the node from being
              drained (like "RESUME"), but will not change the node's base state (e.g. "DOWN").  Setting a node "DOWN" will cause all running and suspended jobs on that node to be  terminated.   "POWER_DOWN"
              and  "POWER_UP"  will use the configured SuspendProg and ResumeProg programs to explicitly place a node in or out of a power saving mode. If a node is already in the process of being powered up
              or down, the command will only change the state of the node but won't have any effect until the configured ResumeTimeout or SuspendTimeout is reached.  Use of this command can be useful in sit‐
              uations  where  a  ResumeProg  like capmc in Cray machines is stalled and one wants to restore the node to "IDLE" manually, in this case rebooting the node and setting the state to "POWER_DOWN"
              will cancel the previous "POWER_UP" state and the node will become "IDLE".  The "NoResp" state will only set the "NoResp" flag for a node without changing its underlying state.   While  all  of
              the  above  states  are  valid, some of them are not valid new node states given their prior state.  If the node state code printed is followed by "~", this indicates the node is presently in a
              power saving mode (typically running at reduced frequency).  If the node state code is followed by "#", this indicates the node is presently being powered up or configured.  If the  node  state
              code  is  followed  by "$", this indicates the node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintenance".  If the node state code is followed by "@", this indicates the node is cur‐
              rently scheduled to be rebooted.  Generally only "DRAIN", "FAIL" and "RESUME" should be used.  NOTE: The scontrol command should not be used to change node state on Cray systems. Use Cray tools
              such as xtprocadmin instead.

       Weight=<weight>
              Identify  weight to be associated with specified nodes. This allows dynamic changes to weight associated with nodes, which will be used for the subsequent node allocation decisions.  Weight as‐
              signed via scontrol will only persist across the restart of the slurmctld daemon with the -R option and state files preserved or slurmctld's receipt of a SIGHUP.   Update  slurm.conf  with  any
              changes meant to be persistent across normal restarts of slurmctld or the execution of scontrol reconfig.

   NODES - SPECIFICATIONS FOR SHOW COMMAND
       The meaning of the energy information is as follows:

       CurrentWatts
              The instantaneous power consumption of the node at the time of the last node energy accounting sample, in watts.

       LowestJoules
              The energy consumed by the node between the last time it was powered on and the last time it was registered by slurmd, in joules.

       ConsumedJoules
              The energy consumed by the node between the last time it was registered by the slurmd daemon and the last node energy accounting sample, in joules.

       If the reported value is "n/s" (not supported), the node does not support the configured AcctGatherEnergyType plugin. If the reported value is zero, energy accounting for nodes is disabled.

       The meaning of the external sensors information is as follows:

       ExtSensorsJoules
              The energy consumed by the node between the last time it was powered on and the last external sensors plugin node sample, in joules.

       ExtSensorsWatts
              The instantaneous power consumption of the node at the time of the last external sensors plugin node sample, in watts.

       ExtSensorsTemp
              The temperature of the node at the time of the last external sensors plugin node sample, in celsius.

       If the reported value is "n/s" (not supported), the node does not support the configured ExtSensorsType plugin.

       The meaning of the resource specialization information is as follows:

       CPUSpecList
              The list of Slurm abstract CPU IDs on this node reserved for exclusive use by the Slurm compute node daemons (slurmd, slurmstepd).

       MemSpecLimit
              The combined memory limit, in megabytes, on this node for the Slurm compute node daemons (slurmd, slurmstepd).

       The meaning of the memory information is as follows:

       RealMemory
              The total memory, in MB, on the node.

       AllocMem
              The total memory, in MB, currently allocated by jobs on the node.

       FreeMem
              The total memory, in MB, currently free on the node as reported by the OS.

   FRONTEND - SPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND
       FrontendName=<name>
              Identify the front end node to be updated. This specification is required.

       Reason=<reason>
              Identify the reason the node is in a "DOWN" or "DRAIN" state.  Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.

       State=<state>
              Identify  the  state  to  be assigned to the front end node. Possible values are "DOWN", "DRAIN" or "RESUME".  If you want to remove a front end node from service, you typically want to set its
              state to "DRAIN".  "RESUME" is not an actual node state, but will return a "DRAINED", "DRAINING", or "DOWN" front end node to service, either "IDLE" or "ALLOCATED" state as  appropriate.   Set‐
              ting a front end node "DOWN" will cause all running and suspended jobs on that node to be terminated.

   PARTITIONS - SPECIFICATIONS FOR CREATE, UPDATE, AND DELETE COMMANDS
       AllowGroups=<name>
              Identify the user groups which may use this partition.  Multiple groups may be specified in a comma separated list.  To permit all groups to use the partition specify "AllowGroups=ALL".

       AllocNodes=<name>
              Comma  separated  list  of  nodes  from which users can execute jobs in the partition.  Node names may be specified using the node range expression syntax described above.  The default value is
              "ALL".

       Alternate=<partition name>
              Alternate partition to be used if the state of this partition is "DRAIN" or "INACTIVE."  The value "NONE" will clear a previously set alternate partition.

       CpuBind=<node>
              Specify the task binding mode to be used by default for this partition.  Supported options include: "none", "board", "socket", "ldom" (NUMA), "core", "thread" and "off" (remove previous binding
              mode).

       Default=<yes|no>
              Specify  if  this partition is to be used by jobs which do not explicitly identify a partition to use.  Possible output values are "YES" and "NO".  In order to change the default partition of a
              running system, use the scontrol update command and set Default=yes for the partition that you want to become the new default.

       DefaultTime=<time>
              Run time limit used for jobs that don't specify a value. If not set then MaxTime will be used.  Format is the same as for MaxTime.

       DefMemPerCPU=<MB>
              Set the default memory to be allocated per CPU for jobs in this partition.  The memory size is specified in megabytes.

       DefMemPerNode=<MB>
              Set the default memory to be allocated per node for jobs in this partition.  The memory size is specified in megabytes.

       DisableRootJobs=<yes|no>
              Specify if jobs can be executed as user root.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".

       GraceTime=<seconds>
              Specifies, in units of seconds, the preemption grace time to be extended to a job which has been selected for preemption.  The default value is zero, no preemption grace time is allowed on this
              partition or qos.  (Meaningful only for PreemptMode=CANCEL)

       Hidden=<yes|no>
              Specify if the partition and its jobs should be hidden from view.  Hidden partitions will by default not be reported by Slurm APIs or commands.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".

       JobDefaults=<specs>
              Specify job default values using a comma delimited list of "key=value" pairs.  Supported keys include

              DefCpuPerGPU  Default number of CPUs per allocated GPU.

              DefMemPerGPU  Default memory limit (in megabytes) per allocated GPU.

       MaxMemPerCPU=<MB>
              Set the maximum memory to be allocated per CPU for jobs in this partition.  The memory size is specified in megabytes.

       MaxMemPerCNode=<MB>
              Set the maximum memory to be allocated per node for jobs in this partition.  The memory size is specified in megabytes.

       MaxNodes=<count>
              Set the maximum number of nodes which will be allocated to any single job in the partition. Specify a number, "INFINITE" or "UNLIMITED".  Changing the MaxNodes of a partition has no effect upon
              jobs that have already begun execution.

       MaxTime=<time>
              The maximum run time for jobs.  Output format is [days-]hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".  Input format (for update command) is minutes, minutes:seconds, hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,
              days-hours:minutes  or  days-hours:minutes:seconds.   Time  resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to the next minute.  Changing the MaxTime of a partition has no effect upon
              jobs that have already begun execution.

       MinNodes=<count>
              Set the minimum number of nodes which will be allocated to any single job in the partition.  Changing the MinNodes of a partition has no effect upon jobs that have already begun execution.  In‐
              creasing  this  value  may  prevent  pending jobs from starting, even if they were submitted without -N/--nodes specification.  If you do get in that situation, updating the MinNodes value of a
              pending job using the scontrol command will allow that job to be scheduled.

       Nodes=<name>
              Identify the node(s) to be associated with this partition. Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]").  Note that jobs may  only  be  associated
              with  one  partition  at any time.  Specify a blank data value to remove all nodes from a partition: "Nodes=".  Changing the Nodes in a partition has no effect upon jobs that have already begun
              execution.

       OverTimeLimit=<count>
              Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before being canceled.  The configured job time limit is treated as a soft limit.  Adding OverTimeLimit to the soft limit  provides  a
              hard limit, at which point the job is canceled.  This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon each job's soft time limit.  A partition-specific OverTimeLimit will over‐
              ride any global OverTimeLimit value.  If not specified, the global OverTimeLimit value will take precedence.  May not exceed 65533 minutes.  An input value of "UNLIMITED" will clear any  previ‐
              ously configured partition-specific OverTimeLimit value.

       OverSubscribe=<yes|no|exclusive|force>[:<job_count>]
              Specify if compute resources (i.e. individual CPUs) in this partition can be shared by multiple jobs.  Possible values are "YES", "NO", "EXCLUSIVE" and "FORCE".  An optional job count specifies
              how many jobs can be allocated to use each resource.

       PartitionName=<name>
              Identify the partition to be updated. This specification is required.

       PreemptMode=<mode>
              Reset the mechanism used to preempt jobs in this partition if PreemptType is configured to preempt/partition_prio. The default preemption mechanism is specified by the cluster-wide  PreemptMode
              configuration parameter.  Possible values are "OFF", "CANCEL", "REQUEUE" and "SUSPEND".

       Priority=<count>
              Jobs  submitted to a higher priority partition will be dispatched before pending jobs in lower priority partitions and if possible they will preempt running jobs from lower priority partitions.
              Note that a partition's priority takes precedence over a job's priority.  The value may not exceed 65533.

       PriorityJobFactor=<count>
              Partition factor used by priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority.  The value may not exceed 65533.  Also see PriorityTier.

       PriorityTier=<count>
              Jobs submitted to a partition with a higher priority tier value will be dispatched before pending jobs in partition with lower priority tier value and,  if  possible,  they  will  preempt  run‐
              ning jobs from partitions with lower priority tier values.  Note that a partition's priority tier takes precedence over a job's priority.  The value may not exceed 65533.  Also see PriorityJob‐
              Factor.

       QOS=<QOSname|blank to remove>
              Set the partition QOS with a QOS name or to remove the Partition QOS leave the option blank.

       RootOnly=<yes|no>
              Specify if only allocation requests initiated by user root will be satisfied.  This can be used to restrict control of the partition to some meta-scheduler.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".

       ReqResv=<yes|no>
              Specify if only allocation requests designating a reservation will be satisfied.  This is used to restrict partition usage to be allowed only within a reservation.  Possible  values  are  "YES"
              and "NO".

       Shared=<yes|no|exclusive|force>[:<job_count>]
              Renamed to OverSubscribe, see option descriptions above.

       State=<up|down|drain|inactive>
              Specify if jobs can be allocated nodes or queued in this partition.  Possible values are "UP", "DOWN", "DRAIN" and "INACTIVE".

              UP        Designates that new jobs may queued on the partition, and that jobs may be allocated nodes and run from the partition.

              DOWN      Designates  that new jobs may be queued on the partition, but queued jobs may not be allocated nodes and run from the partition. Jobs already running on the partition continue to run.
                        The jobs must be explicitly canceled to force their termination.

              DRAIN     Designates that no new jobs may be queued on the partition (job submission requests will be denied with an error message), but jobs already queued on the partition  may  be  allocated
                        nodes and run.  See also the "Alternate" partition specification.

              INACTIVE  Designates that no new jobs may be queued on the partition, and jobs already queued may not be allocated nodes and run.  See also the "Alternate" partition specification.

       TRESBillingWeights=<TRES Billing Weights>
              TRESBillingWeights  is used to define the billing weights of each TRES type that will be used in calculating the usage of a job. The calculated usage is used when calculating fairshare and when
              enforcing the TRES billing limit on jobs.  Updates affect new jobs and not existing jobs.  See the slurm.conf man page for more information.

   RESERVATIONS - SPECIFICATIONS FOR CREATE, UPDATE, AND DELETE COMMANDS
       Reservation=<name>
              Identify the name of the reservation to be created, updated, or deleted.  This parameter is required for update and is the only parameter for delete.  For create, if you do not want to  give  a
              reservation name, use "scontrol create res ..." and a name will be created automatically.

       Accounts=<account list>
              List  of  accounts  permitted  to  use the reserved nodes, for example "Accounts=physcode1,physcode2".  A user in any of the accounts may use the reserved nodes.  A new reservation must specify
              Users or Groups and/or Accounts.  If both Users/Groups and Accounts are specified, a job must match both in order to use the reservation.  Accounts can also be denied access to reservations  by
              preceding  all  of the account names with '-'. Alternately precede the equal sign with '-'.  For example, "Accounts=-physcode1,-physcode2" or "Accounts-=physcode1,physcode2" will permit any ac‐
              count except physcode1 and physcode2 to use the reservation.  You can add or remove individual accounts from an existing reservation by using the update command and adding a '+' or '-' sign be‐
              fore the '=' sign.  If accounts are denied access to a reservation (account name preceded by a '-'), then all other accounts are implicitly allowed to use the reservation and it is not possible
              to also explicitly specify allowed accounts.

       BurstBuffer=<buffer_spec>[,<buffer_spec>,...]
              Specification of burst buffer resources which are to be reserved.  "buffer_spec" consists of four elements: [plugin:][type:]#[units] "plugin" is the burst buffer plugin name,  currently  either
              "datawarp" or "generic".  If no plugin is specified, the reservation applies to all configured burst buffer plugins.  "type" specifies a Cray generic burst buffer resource, for example "nodes".
              if "type" is not specified, the number is a measure of storage space.  The "units" may be "N" (nodes), "K|KiB", "M|MiB", "G|GiB", "T|TiB", "P|PiB" (for powers of 1024)  and  "KB",  "MB",  "GB",
              "TB",  "PB"  (for  powers  of  1000).   The default units are bytes for reservations of storage space.  For example "BurstBuffer=datawarp:2TB" (reserve 2TB of storage plus 3 nodes from the Cray
              plugin) or "BurstBuffer=100GB" (reserve 100 GB of storage from all configured burst buffer plugins).  Jobs using this reservation are not restricted to these burst buffer resources, but may use
              these  reserved resources plus any which are generally available.  NOTE: Usually Slurm interprets KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, TB units as powers of 1024, but for Burst Buffers size specifications Slurm
              supports both IEC/SI formats.  This is because the CRAY API for managing DataWarps supports both formats.

       CoreCnt=<num>
              This option is only supported when SelectType=select/cons_res or select/cons_tres. Identify number of cores to be reserved.  If NodeCnt is used without the FIRST_CORES flag, this is  the  total
              number  of  cores  to  reserve where cores per node is CoreCnt/NodeCnt.  If a nodelist is used, or if NodeCnt is used with the FIRST_CORES flag, this should be an array of core numbers by node:
              Nodes=node[1-5] CoreCnt=2,2,3,3,4 or flags=FIRST_CORES NodeCnt=5 CoreCnt=1,2,1,3,2.

       Licenses=<license>
              Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) which are to be reserved.  License names can be followed by a colon and count (the default  count  is  one).
              Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g. "Licenses=foo:4,bar").  A new reservation must specify one or more resource to be included: NodeCnt, Nodes and/or Licenses.  If a reserva‐
              tion includes Licenses, but no NodeCnt or Nodes, then the option Flags=LICENSE_ONLY must also be specified.  Jobs using this reservation are not restricted to these licenses, but may use  these
              reserved licenses plus any which are generally available.

       MaxStartDelay[=<timespec>]
              Change  MaxStartDelay  value  which  specifies  the maximum time an eligible job not requesting this reservation can delay a job requesting it. Default is none.  Valid formats are minutes, min‐
              utes:seconds, hours:minutes:seconds, days-hours, days-hours:minutes, days-hours:minutes:seconds.  Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to the next minute. Output  for‐
              mat is always [days-]hours:minutes:seconds.

       NodeCnt=<num>[,num,...]
              Identify number of nodes to be reserved. The number can include a suffix of "k" or "K", in which case the number specified is multiplied by 1024.  A new reservation must specify one or more re‐
              source to be included: NodeCnt, Nodes and/or Licenses.

       Nodes=<name>
              Identify the node(s) to be reserved. Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "Nodes=lx[10-20]").  Specify a blank data value to remove all  nodes  from  a
              reservation: "Nodes=".  A new reservation must specify one or more resource to be included: NodeCnt, Nodes and/or Licenses. A specification of "ALL" will reserve all nodes. Set Flags=PART_NODES
              and PartitionName= in order for changes in the nodes associated with a partition to also be reflected in the nodes associated with a reservation.

       StartTime=<time_spec>
              The start time for the reservation.  A new reservation must specify a start time.  It accepts times of the form HH:MM:SS for a specific time of day (seconds are optional).  (If that time is al‐
              ready past, the next day is assumed.)  You may also specify midnight, noon, fika (3 PM) or teatime (4 PM) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the
              evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying a date of the form MMDDYY or MM/DD/YY or MM.DD.YY, or a date and time as YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]].  You can also give times
              like  now + count time-units, where the time-units can be seconds (default), minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell Slurm to run the job today with the keyword today and to run the job
              tomorrow with the keyword tomorrow. You cannot update the StartTime of a reservation in ACTIVE state.

       EndTime=<time_spec>
              The end time for the reservation.  A new reservation must specify an end time or a duration.  Valid formats are the same as for StartTime.

       Duration=<time>
              The length of a reservation.  A new reservation must specify an end time or a duration.  Valid formats  are  minutes,  minutes:seconds,  hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,  days-hours:minutes,
              days-hours:minutes:seconds, or UNLIMITED.  Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to the next minute. Output format is always [days-]hours:minutes:seconds.

       PartitionName=<name>
              Partition  used  to  reserve  nodes from. This will attempt to allocate all nodes in the specified partition unless you request fewer resources than are available with CoreCnt, NodeCnt or TRES.
              Jobs will be allowed to use this reservation even if running in a different partition. There only needs to be overlapping nodes from that different partition and the nodes used in the  reserva‐
              tion.

       Flags=<flags>
              Flags  associated  with  the reservation.  You can add or remove individual flags from an existing reservation by adding a '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign.  For example: Flags-=DAILY (NOTE:
              this shortcut is not supported for all flags).  Currently supported flags include:

              ANY_NODES     This is a reservation for burst buffers and/or licenses only and not compute nodes.  If this flag is set, a job using this reservation may use the associated burst buffers  and/or
                            licenses plus any compute nodes.  If this flag is not set, a job using this reservation may use only the nodes and licenses associated with the reservation.

              DAILY         Repeat the reservation at the same time every day.

              FLEX          Permit  jobs  requesting  the  reservation to begin prior to the reservation's start time, end after the reservation's end time, and use any resources inside and/or outside of the
                            reservation regardless of any constraints possibly set in the reservation. A typical use case is to prevent jobs not explicitly requesting the reservation  from  using  those  re‐
                            served  resources rather than forcing jobs requesting the reservation to use those resources in the time frame reserved. Another use case could be to always have a particular num‐
                            ber of nodes with a specific feature reserved for a specific account so users in this account may use this nodes plus possibly other nodes without this feature.

              FIRST_CORES   Use the lowest numbered cores on a node only. Flag removal with '-=' is not supported.

              IGNORE_JOBS   Ignore currently running jobs when creating the reservation.  This can be especially useful when reserving all nodes in the system for maintenance.

              LICENSE_ONLY  See ANY_NODES.

              MAINT         Maintenance mode, receives special accounting treatment.  This reservation is permitted to use resources that are already in another reservation.

              MAGNETIC      This flag allows jobs to be considered for this reservation even if they didn't request it.

              NO_HOLD_JOBS_AFTER
                            By default, when a reservation ends the reservation request will be removed from any pending jobs submitted to the reservation and will be put into a held state.  Use this flag to
                            let jobs run outside of the reservation after the reservation is gone. Flag removal with '-=' is not supported.

              OVERLAP       This reservation can be allocated resources that are already in another reservation. Flag removal with '-=' is not supported.

              PART_NODES    This flag can be used to reserve all nodes within the specified partition.  PartitionName and Nodes=ALL must be specified with this flag.

              PURGE_COMP[=<timespec>]
                            Purge  the  reservation  if it is ever idle for timespec (no jobs associated with it).  If timespec isn't given then 5 minutes is the default.  Valid timespec formats are minutes,
                            minutes:seconds, hours:minutes:seconds, days-hours, days-hours:minutes, days-hours:minutes:seconds.  Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded  up  to  the  next
                            minute. Output format is always [days-]hours:minutes:seconds.

              REPLACE       Nodes  which  are  DOWN, DRAINED, or allocated to jobs are automatically replenished using idle resources.  This option can be used to maintain a constant number of idle resources
                            available for pending jobs (subject to availability of idle resources).  This should be used with the NodeCnt reservation option; do not identify specific nodes to be included  in
                            the reservation. Flag removal with '-=' is not supported.

                            NOTE: Removing a node from the cluster while in a reservation with the REPLACE flag will not cause it to be replaced.

              REPLACE_DOWN  Nodes  which  are DOWN or DRAINED are automatically replenished using idle resources.  This option can be used to maintain a constant sized pool of resources available for pending
                            jobs (subject to availability of idle resources).  This should be used with the NodeCnt reservation option; do not identify specific nodes to be included in the reservation.  Flag
                            removal with '-=' is not supported.

                            NOTE: Removing a node from the cluster while in a reservation with the REPLACE_DOWN flag will not cause it to be replaced.

              SPEC_NODES    Reservation is for specific nodes (output only).

              STATIC_ALLOC  Make  it so after the nodes are selected for a reservation they don't change.  Without this option when nodes are selected for a reservation and one goes down the reservation will
                            select a new node to fill the spot.

              TIME_FLOAT    The reservation start time is relative to the current time and moves forward through time (e.g. a StartTime=now+10minutes will always be 10 minutes in the future). Repeating (e.g.
                            DAILY) floating reservations are not supported. Flag cannot be added to or removed from an existing reservation.

              WEEKDAY       Repeat the reservation at the same time on every weekday (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday).

              WEEKEND       Repeat the reservation at the same time on every weekend day (Saturday and Sunday).

              WEEKLY        Repeat the reservation at the same time every week.

       Features=<features>
              Set the reservation's required node features. Multiple values may be "&" separated if all features are required (AND operation) or separated by "|" if any of the specified features are required
              (OR operation).  Parenthesis are also supported for features to be ANDed together with counts of nodes having the specified features.  For example "Features=[(knl&a2a&flat)*4&haswell*2]"  indi‐
              cates the advanced reservation should include 4 nodes with ALL of the features "knl", "a2a", and "flat" plus 2 nodes with the feature "haswell".

              Value may be cleared with blank data value, "Features=".

       Groups=<group list>
              List  of groups permitted to use the reserved nodes, for example "Group=bio,chem".  A new reservation must specify Users or Groups and/or Accounts.  If both Users/Groups and Accounts are speci‐
              fied, a job must match both in order to use the reservation.  Unlike users groups do not allow denied access to reservations.  You can add or remove individual groups from an existing  reserva‐
              tion  by  using the update command and adding a '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign.  NOTE: Groups and Users are mutually exclusive in reservations, if you want to switch between the 2 you must
              update the reservation with a group='' or user='' and fill in the opposite with the appropriate setting.

       Skip   Used on a reoccurring reservation, skip to the next reservation iteration.  NOTE: Only available for update.

       Users=<user list>
              List of users permitted to use the reserved nodes, for example "User=jones1,smith2".  A new reservation must specify Users or Groups and/or Accounts.  If  both  Users/Groups  and  Accounts  are
              specified,  a  job  must  match both in order to use the reservation.  Users can also be denied access to reservations by preceding all of the user names with '-'. Alternately precede the equal
              sign with '-'.  For example, "User=-jones1,-smith2" or "User-=jones1,smith2" will permit any user except jones1 and smith2 to use the reservation.  You can add or remove individual  users  from
              an  existing reservation by using the update command and adding a '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign.  If users are denied access to a reservation (user name preceded by a '-'), then all other
              users are implicitly allowed to use the reservation and it is not possible to also explicitly specify allowed users.  NOTE: Groups and Users are mutually exclusive in reservations, if you  want
              to switch between the 2 you must update the reservation with a group='' or user='' and fill in the opposite with the appropriate setting.

       TRES=<tres_spec>
              Comma-separated  list  of  TRES  required  for the reservation. Current supported TRES types with reservations are: CPU, Node, License and BB. CPU and Node follow the same format as CoreCnt and
              NodeCnt parameters respectively.  License names can be followed by an equal '=' and a count:

              License/<name1>=<count1>[,License/<name2>=<count2>,...]

              BurstBuffer can be specified in a similar way as BurstBuffer parameter. The only difference is that colon symbol ':' should be replaced by an equal '=' in order to follow the TRES format.

              Some examples of TRES valid specifications:

              TRES=cpu=5,bb/cray=4,license/iop1=1,license/iop2=3

              TRES=node=5k,license/iop1=2

              As specified in CoreCnt, if a nodelist is specified, cpu can be an array of core numbers by node: nodes=compute[1-3] TRES=cpu=2,2,1,bb/cray=4,license/iop1=2

              Please note that CPU, Node, License and BB can override CoreCnt, NodeCnt, Licenses and BurstBuffer parameters respectively.  Also CPU represents CoreCnt, in a reservation and will  be  adjusted
              if you have threads per core on your nodes.

              Note  that  a reservation that contains nodes or cores is associated with one partition, and can't span resources over multiple partitions.  The only exception from this is when the reservation
              is created with explicitly requested nodes.

PERFORMANCE
       Executing scontrol sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from scontrol or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmctld daemon come in at once, it
       can result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run scontrol or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to scontrol to the min‐
       imum necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Some scontrol options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below. (Note: Command  line  options  will  always  override
       these settings.)

       SCONTROL_ALL        -a, --all

       SCONTROL_FEDERATION --federation

       SCONTROL_FUTURE     -F, --future

       SCONTROL_LOCAL      --local

       SCONTROL_SIBLING    --sibling

       SLURM_BITSTR_LEN    Specifies  the  string  length to be used for holding a job array's task ID expression.  The default value is 64 bytes.  A value of 0 will print the full expression with any length
                           required.  Larger values may adversely impact the application performance.

       SLURM_CLUSTERS      Same as --clusters

       SLURM_CONF          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       SLURM_CONF_OUT      When running 'write config', the location of the Slurm configuration file to be written.

       SLURM_TIME_FORMAT   Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of standard, the default value, generates output in the form "year-month-dateThour:minute:second".  A value of  relative  re‐
                           turns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.  For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by "Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name
                           of the day for the coming week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").  For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.  "6 Jun 2012").
                           All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

                           A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of "%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

       SLURM_TOPO_LEN      Specify the maximum size of the line when printing Topology. If not set, the default value is unlimited.

AUTHORIZATION
       When  using SlurmDBD, users who have an AdminLevel defined (Operator or Admin) and users who are account coordinators are given the authority to view and modify jobs, reservations, nodes, etc., as de‐
       fined in the following table - regardless of whether a PrivateData restriction has been defined in the slurm.conf file.
