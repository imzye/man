NAME
       pam_tmpdir - PAM module for creating a secure directory for users' temporary files

SYNOPSIS
       pam_tmpdir.so

DESCRIPTION
       This module can be plugged into the session stack of a given service to provide secure, per-user directories for temporary files.

OPTIONS
       The directory in which the users' temporary directories are created can be set using an entry in /etc/security/tmpdir.conf:

       tmpdir=/path/to/tmpdir

       The default is /tmp/user.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Although this is intended to be used with the session module type, it also provides account, auth, and password module types.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
              The temporary directory was successfully created.

       PAM_ABORT
              An error occurred when attempting to create the temporary directory.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
              An internal error occurred.

EXAMPLES
       To allow users to login even if pam_tmpdir fails to create a safe tmpdir:

              session    optional     pam_tmpdir.so

       To deny login if an error occurs while setting up the safe tmpdir:

              session    required     pam_tmpdir.so

       NOTE: This could allow for a DoS attack if a malicious user creates /tmp/user before pam_tmpdir does.
