LPQ(1)                                                                                    BSD General Commands Manual                                                                                    LPQ(1)

NAME
     lpq — spool queue examination program

SYNOPSIS
     lpq [-al] [-Pprinter] [job# ...] [user ...]

DESCRIPTION
     lpq examines the spooling area used by lpd(8) for printing files on the line printer, and reports the status of the specified jobs or all jobs associated with a user.  lpq invoked without any arguments
     reports on any jobs currently in the queue.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Report on the local queues for all printers, rather than just the specified printer.

     -l      Information about each of the files comprising the job entry is printed.  Normally, only as much information as will fit on one line is displayed.

     -Pprinter
             Specify a particular printer, otherwise the default line printer is used (or the value of the PRINTER variable in the environment).  All other arguments supplied are interpreted as user names or
             job numbers to filter out only those jobs of interest.

     For each job submitted (i.e., invocation of lpr(1)) lpq reports the user's name, current rank in the queue, the names of files comprising the job, the job identifier (a number which may be supplied to
     lprm(1) for removing a specific job), and the total size in bytes.  Job ordering is dependent on the algorithm used to scan the spooling directory and is supposed to be FIFO (First In First Out).  File
     names comprising a job may be unavailable (when lpr(1) is used as a sink in a pipeline) in which case the file is indicated as “(standard input)”.

     If lpq warns that there is no daemon present (i.e., due to some malfunction), the lpc(8) command can be used to restart the printer daemon.

ENVIRONMENT
     If the following environment variable exists, it is used by lpq:

     PRINTER  Specifies an alternate default printer.

FILES
     /etc/printcap             To determine printer characteristics.
     /var/spool/*              The spooling directory, as determined from printcap.
     /var/spool/output/*/cf*   Control files specifying jobs.
     /var/spool/output/*/lock  The lock file to obtain the currently active job.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Unable to open various files.  The lock file being malformed.  Garbage files when there is no daemon active, but files in the spooling directory.

SEE ALSO
     lpr(1), lprm(1), lpc(8), lpd(8)

HISTORY
     lpq appeared in 3BSD.

BUGS
     Due to the dynamic nature of the information in the spooling directory, lpq may report unreliably.  Output formatting is sensitive to the line length of the terminal; this can result in widely spaced
     columns.
