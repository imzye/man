FILES
       .weblate
              Per project configuration file

       ~/.config/weblate
              User configuration file

       /etc/xdg/weblate
              Global configuration file

       The program follows XDG specification, so you can adjust placement of config files by environment variables XDG_CONFIG_HOME or XDG_CONFIG_DIRS.

       Following settings can be configured in the [weblate] section (you can customize this by --config-section):

       key    API KEY to access Weblate.

       url    API server URL, defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/.

       translation
              Path of default translation, component or project.

       The configuration file is INI file, for example:

          [weblate]
          url = https://hosted.weblate.org/api/
          key = APIKEY
          translation = weblate/master

       Additionally API keys can be stored in the [keys] section:

          [keys]
          https://hosted.weblate.org/api/ = APIKEY

       This allows you to store keys in your personal settings, while having .weblate configuration in the VCS repository so that wlc knows to which server it should talk.

EXAMPLES
       Print current program version:

          $ wlc version
          version: 0.1

       List all projects:

          $ wlc list-projects
          name: Hello
          slug: hello
          source_language: en
          url: http://example.com/api/projects/hello/
          web: http://weblate.org/
          web_url: http://example.com/projects/hello/

       You can also let wlc know current project and it will then operate on it:

          $ cat .weblate
          [weblate]
          url = https://hosted.weblate.org/api/
          translation = weblate/master

          $ wlc show
          branch: master
          file_format: po
          filemask: weblate/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
          git_export: git://git.weblate.org/weblate.git
          license: GPL-3.0+
          license_url: https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0+
          name: master
          new_base: weblate/locale/django.pot
          project: weblate
          repo: git://github.com/nijel/weblate.git
          slug: master
          template:
          url: https://hosted.weblate.org/api/components/weblate/master/
          vcs: git
          web_url: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/weblate/master/

       With such setup it is easy to commit pending changes in current project:

          $ wlc commit
