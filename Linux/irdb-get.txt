NAME
       irdb-get - list, search and download lirc configuration files.

SYNOPSIS
       irdb-get update

       irdb-get find  <string>

       irdb-get info  <id>

       irdb-get download <id>

       irdb-get list [pattern]

       irdb-get find-driver  <string>

       irdb-get yaml-config

       irdb-get  <-h|--help|-v|--version>

DESCRIPTION
       irdb-get can list, search and download lirc remote configuration files.  It works by downloading an index file, making all operations besides the actual download local.

       Entries in the index are identified by an id. Such an id is on the form dir/remote e. g., x10/ati_remote_wonder_III

COMMANDS
       update
           Download the index from the remote repository.

       find <string>
           List all entries in the index file matching <string>. Matching is done using regular shell match syntax (i. e., not regex).

       find-driver <string>
           List all entries in the index with a given driver. The matching is exact, no wildcards.

       info <id>
           Print some more info about a given entry.

       download <id>
           Download the configuration file for a given entry. The filename is printed on stdout.

       list <pattern>
           List entries matching <pattern>. <pattern> is on the form dir/remote e. g., x10/ati* or */ati_remote_wonder* .

           The first word in the list is something like -RL- where the letters represent:

           R   Raw configuration.

           T   Remote has timing information i. e., it can be used with generic capture devices.

           L   Remote has a lircmd config file.

           P   Remote has a photo.

       yaml-config
           Prints a YAML file on stdout which maps drivers to remote files with corresponding driver attribute. The format is unstable and primarely used by lirc-setup(1).

OPTIONS
       -h , --help
           Print help message.

       -v , --version
           Print version info.

ENVIRONMENT
       LIRC_REMOTES_URL
           The  base URL used when downloading config files, defaults to https://sourceforge.net/p/lirc-remotes/code/ci/master/tree.

       LIRC_REMOTES_LIST
           URL to a file listing all remotes, as created by lirc-lsremotes(1).  Defaults to  http://lirc-remotes.sourceforge.net/remotes.list.

       XDG_CACHE_HOME
           If defined, relocates the cached, downloaded remotes listing file to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/remotes.list, see FILES.

FILES
       ~/.cache/remotes.list
           The index file downloaded on demand or by the update command.
