NAME
       nodm - X display manager for automatic logins

SYNOPSIS
       nodm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       nodm is a minimal display manager that simply logs in as a given user and starts an X session, without asking for username or password.

       On a normal computer, using nodm is a big security issue because it would give anyone access to the computer.

       However,  there are cases where automatic login is needed: for example in an embedded system such as a mobile phone, or in a kiosk setup, or in a control panel for industrial machinery.  For those
       cases, nodm is simple to setup, lightweight, and it should do exactly the right thing.
