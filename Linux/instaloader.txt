       Instaloader goes through all media matching the specified targets and downloads the pictures and videos and their captions. You can specify

       1.9 :option:`--comments` - also download comments of each post.

       1.10 :option:`--geotags` - download geotags of each post and save them as Google Maps link (requires :option:`--login`).

       2.FILENAME SPECIFICATION

       For each target, Instaloader creates a directory named after the target, i.e. profile, #hashtag, %location id, :feed, etc. and therein saves the posts in files named after the post's timestamp.

       option:`--dirname-pattern`  - allow one to configure the directory name of each target. The default is --dirname-pattern={target}. In the dirname pattern, the token{target} is replaced by the tar‐
       get name, and {profile} is replaced by the owner of the post which is downloaded.

       option:`--filename-pattern` configures the path of the post and story's files relative to the target directory that is specified with option: The  default  is  `--filename-pattern`={date_utc}_utc.
       The tokens {target} and {profile} are replaced like in the dirname pattern.

       option:`--title-pattern`  is  similar  to  option:`--filename-pattern`,  but  for  profile  pics,  hashtag  profile  pics,  and  highlight  covers. The default is {date_utc}_UTC_{typename} if :op‐
       tion:`--dirname-pattern` contains {target} or {profile}, or {target}_{date_utc}_UTC_{typename} if it does not. Some tokens are not supported for this option, see below for details.

       The following tokens are defined for usage with :option:`--filename-pattern` and :option:`--title-pattern`:

       2.1 {target} Target name (as given in Instaloader command line)

       2.2 {profile} (same as {owner_username}) Owner of the Post / StoryItem / ProfilePic. For hashtag profile pics and highlight covers, equivalent to {target}.

       2.3 {owner_id} Unique integer ID of owner profile. For hashtag profile pics, equivalent to {target}.

       2.4 {shortcode} Shortcode (identifier string). Not available for :option:`--title-pattern`

       2.5 {mediaid} Integer representation of shortcode. Not available for :option:`--title-pattern`.

       2.6 {filename} Instagram's internal filename.

       2.7 {date_utc} (same as {date}) Creation time in UTC timezone. strftime ()-style formatting options are supported as format specifier. The default date format specifier  used  by  Instaloader  is:
       {date_utc:%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S}

       2.8 {typename} Type of media being saved, such as GraphImage, GraphStoryVideo, profile_pic, etc.

       3.FILTER POSTS

       The options :option:`--post-filter` and :option:`--storyitem-filter` allow one to specify criteria that posts or story items have to meet to be downloaded. If not given, all posts are downloaded.

       The filter string must be a Python boolean expression where the attribute from :class:`Post` or :class:`StoryItem` respectively are defined.

       the following attributes can be used with both option:`--post-filter` and option:`--storyitem-filter`:

       3.1 attr:`~Post.owner_username` (str), attr:`~Post.owner_id` (int) Owner profile username/user ID.

       3.2  :attr:`~Post.date_utc`  (datetime),  :attr:`~Post.date_local` (datetime) Creation timestamp. Since :class:`~datetime.datetime` objects can be created inside filter strings, this easily allows
       filtering by creation date.

       3.3 :attr:`~Post.is_video` (bool) Whether Post/StoryItem is a video.  For example, you may skip videos: instaloader --post-filter="not is_video" target

       This is not the same as :option:`--no-videos` and :option:`--no-video-thumbnails`, since sidecar posts (posts that contain multiple pictures/videos in one post) have this attribute set to False.

       As :option:`--post-filter`, the following attributes can be used additionally:

       3.4 :attr:`~Post.viewer_has_liked` (bool) Whether user (with :option:`--login`) has liked given post. To download the pictures from your feed that you have liked:

       3.5 :attr:`~Post.likes` (int), :attr:`~Post.comments` (int) Likes count / comments count. You might only want to download posts that were either liked by yourself or by many others.

       3.6 :attr:`~Post.caption_hashtags` (list of str) /:attr:`~Post.caption_mentions` (list of str) #hashtags or @mentions (lowercased) in the Post's caption.  For example, to download posts of kittens
       that are cute: instaloader --post-filter="'cute' in caption_hashtags" "#kitten"

       3.7 :attr:`~Post.tagged_users` (list of str) Lowercased usernames that are tagged in the Post. For :option:`--storyitem-filter`, the following additional attributes are defined:

       3.8 :attr:`~StoryItem.expiring_utc` (datetime) /:attr:`~StoryItem.expiring_local` (datetime).Timestamp when StoryItem will get unavailable.

       4.METADATA TEXT FILES

       Unless :option:`--no-captions` is given, Instaloader creates a .txt file along with each post where the Post's caption is saved.

       You can customize what metadata to save for each Post or StoryItem with :option: `--post-metadata-txt` and :option:`--storyitem-metadata-txt`. The default is --post-metadata-txt={caption}  and  no
       storyitem metadata txt. These strings are formatted similar as the path patterns described in :ref:`filename-specification and the result is saved in text files, unless it is empty.

       Specifying  these options multiple times results in output having multiple lines, in the order they were given to Instaloader. The field names are evaluated to :class: `Post` or :class:`StoryItem`
       attributes, and as such, the same fields are supported as in :ref:`filename-specification` and :ref:`filter-posts`.

       For example, to save the current number of likes for each post, rather than the post's caption:

       4.1 instaloader --post-metadata-txt="{likes} likes." <target>

       Note that with this feature, it is possible to easily and fastly extract additional metadata of already-downloaded posts, by reimporting their JSON files. Say, you now also want to export the num‐
       ber of comments the Posts had when they were downloaded:

       4.2 instaloader --post-metadata-txt="{likes} likes, {comments} comments." <target>/*.json.xz

EXAMPLES
       For example, encode the poster's profile name in the filenames with:

       instaloader --login=your_username

       instaloader --dirname-pattern={profile}

       instaloader --login=your_username --quiet target [...]

       instaloader --filename-pattern={date_utc}_UTC_{profile} "#hashtag"

       instaloader --post-filter="date_utc <= datetime(2018, 5, 31)" target

       instaloader --post-filter="not is_video" target

       instaloader --login=your_username --post-filter=viewer_has_liked :feed

       As another example, you may instruct Instaloader to store posts in a PROFILE/YEAR/SHORTCODE.jpg directory structure:

       instaloader --login=your_username --post-filter="likes>100 or viewer_has_liked" profile

       instaloader --filename-pattern={date_utc:%Y}/{shortcode} <target> ...

       instaloader --post-filter="'cute' in caption_hashtags" "#kitten"

       instaloader --post-metadata-txt="{likes} likes." <target>

       instaloader --post-metadata-txt="{likes} likes, {comments} comments." <target>/*.json.xz
