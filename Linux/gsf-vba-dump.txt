NAME
       gsf-vba-dump - extract Visual Basic for Applications macros

SYNOPSIS
       gsf-vba-dump [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the gsf-vba-dump command.

       Various  Microsoft  binary data formats, including Excel (.xls), Word (.doc) and PowerPoint (.ppt) can embed macro code streams. These macro streams are in P-code (intermediate language) compiled from
       Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

       The gsf-vba-dump utility extracts these macro streams.

BUGS
       Macro extraction from Powerpoint (.ppt) files has not been implemented yet.
