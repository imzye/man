NAME
       rbd-replay-many - replay a rados block device (RBD) workload on several clients

SYNOPSIS
       rbd-replay-many [ options ] --original-image name host1 [ host2 [ ... ] ] -- rbd_replay_args

DESCRIPTION
       rbd-replay-many  is a utility for replaying a rados block device (RBD) workload on several clients.  Although all clients use the same workload, they replay against separate images.  This matches nor‐
       mal use of librbd, where each original client is a VM with its own image.

       Configuration and replay files are not automatically copied to clients.  Replay images must already exist.

OPTIONS
       --original-image name
              Specifies the name (and snap) of the originally traced image.  Necessary for correct name mapping.

       --image-prefix prefix
              Prefix of image names to replay against.  Specifying --image-prefix=foo results in clients replaying against foo-0, foo-1, etc.  Defaults to the original image name.

       --exec program
              Path to the rbd-replay executable.

       --delay seconds
              Delay between starting each client.  Defaults to 0.

EXAMPLES
       Typical usage:

          rbd-replay-many host-0 host-1 --original-image=image -- -c ceph.conf replay.bin

       This results in the following commands being executed:

          ssh host-0 'rbd-replay' --map-image 'image=image-0' -c ceph.conf replay.bin
          ssh host-1 'rbd-replay' --map-image 'image=image-1' -c ceph.conf replay.bin
