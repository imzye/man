NAME
       ceph-run - restart daemon on core dump

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-run command ...

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-run is a simple wrapper that will restart a daemon if it exits with a signal indicating it crashed and possibly core dumped (that is, signals 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 11).

       The command should run the daemon in the foreground. For Ceph daemons, that means the -f option.

OPTIONS
       None

AVAILABILITY
