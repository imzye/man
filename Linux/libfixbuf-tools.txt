DESCRIPTION
       ipfixDump is a tool to read an IPFIX file and print its contents as human-readable ASCII to assist the user in analyzing the file.  ipfixDump prints all message headers, templates, data records,
       options templates, and options records to the output, plus a one line summary of the file's content.

       ipfixDump supports IPFIX structured data in the form of basicLists, subTemplateLists, and subTemplateMultiLists.

       By default, ipfixDump reads the IPFIX file from the standard input and writes the text to the standard output.  To specify the input or output file's location, use the --in or --out option,
       respectively.

       ipfixDump requires the input file to contain the IPFIX templates that describe the data records within the file, and the template must appear before the records that use it.  Any records that do
       not have a corresponding template are ignored.

       The default information model used by ipfixDump includes only the standard information elements defined by IANA <https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xhtml> and provided by libfixbuf.
       There are three ways to augment the set of elements:

       1.  The   --rfc5610   option   instructs   ipfixDump   to   watch   the   input   for   options   records   that   define   private   enterprise   information   elements  (as  defined  by  RFC5610
           <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5610.html>) and to add those elements to the information model.

       2.  The --element-file=FILE_NAME option tells ipfixDump to parse the contents of FILE_NAME and add those information elements to the information model.  The argument is an XML file whose schema is
           that used by IANA's XML Information Element Registry <https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xml>, with the following additions:

           cert:enterpriseId
               A number representing the Private Enterprise Number of the element

           cert:reversible
               A boolean value ("true", "yes", or 1 for true; "false", "no", or 0 for false) that specifies whether the element may have a separate identity in a reverse flow.

           The --element-file option may be used multiple times to load multiple files, and the loaded elements replace existing elements with the same identifier.

       3.  The --yaf option loads the CERT private enterprise information elements into the information model.  These elements are used by the NetSA  tools  yaf(1),  pipeline(8),  super_mediator(1),  and
           rwsilk2ipfix(1).   This option is implemented as a wrapper over the --element-file option where the file name is cert_ipfix.xml and ipfixDump checks several directories to attempt to find this
           file, stopping once it finds the first file.  The list of directories, in search order, is

           •   the directory ../share/libfixbuf relative to the directory containing the application

           •   the libfixbuf subdirectory of the "datadir" directory specified when ipfixDump was configured (defaults to $prefix/share)

           •   the share/libfixbuf subdirectory installation folder for the GLib-2 library

           •   the libfixbuf subdirectory of the directories specified by the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, or /usr/local/share and /usr/share/libfixbuf when that variable is empty

           ipfixDump exits with an error if it is unable to find the cert_ipfix.xml file.  See <https://tools.netsa.cert.org/cert-ipfix-registry/> for additional information about this file.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available for ipfixDump:

       --in FILE_NAME
           Sets the input file name to FILE_NAME.  When the option is not specified, ipfixDump reads from the standard input or exits with an error when the standard input is a terminal.  ipfixDump reads
           from the standard input if FILE_NAME is '"-"'.

       --out FILE_NAME
           Sets the output file name to FILE_NAME.  If FILE_NAME exists, it is overwritten.  The string '"-"' may be used to write to standard output (the default).

       --rfc5610
           Tells ipfixDump to scan the IPFIX input file for options records that define private enterprise information elements and to add those elements to the information model.

       --element-file FILE_NAME
           Loads the XML file FILE_NAME and incorporates information element information found in it.  The format of the file is described above.  The option may be used multiple times to  load  multiple
           files, and later elements replace existing elements when they have the same identifier.

       --yaf
           Searches  for  a  file  named  cert_ipfix.xml  in  several  locations and loads that file as if it was an argument to --element-file.  ipfixDump exits with an error if it is unable to find the
           cert_ipfix.xml file.

       --templates
           Suppresses the printing of records, causing the output to contain only message headers, templates, and a summary line.

       --data
           Suppresses the printing of templates, causing the output to contain only message headers, records, and a summary line.

       --stats
           Suppresses the printing of all message headers, templates, and records.  The output consists of the number of messages, templates, and records present in  the  input,  and  a  two-column  list
           showing template IDs found in the input and a count of the number of records that used that template.

       --hexdump
           For  data record elements whose type is octetArray, prints each octet as a 2-digit hexadecimal value with a no separator between the values.  The length of the element precedes the hexadecimal
           output.  ipfixDump uses this display for octetArray elements that are variable length or whose length is greater than eight.  Without this option, only the length of  the  octetArray  elements
           are printed.  Note that fixed-width octetArray elements whose length is less than or equal to eight are always printed as a decimal number regardless of this option.

       --hexdump=LEN
           When  the  optional parameter LEN is provided to --hexdump, only the first LEN octets of the value are printed.  If LEN is zero, only the length of octetArray values is printed.  A LEN that is
           negative or larger than 65535 is treated as the maximum, 65535.

       --version
           Prints version and copyright information to standard error and exits.

       --help
           Prints a brief usage message to the standard output and exits.

Examples
       In the following examples, the dollar sign ("$") represents the shell prompt.  The text after the dollar sign represents the command line.

        $ ipfixDump --in - --out -

        $ ipfixDump --in /data/ipfix.ipfix --out /data/text.txt --yaf
