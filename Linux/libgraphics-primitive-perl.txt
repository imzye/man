NAME
       Graphics::Primitive::Oriented - Role for components that care about orientation.

SYNOPSIS
       Some components (or things that use components) require a bit more information than origin and width/height.  The orientation role allows a component to specify whether is vertically or
       horizontally oriented.

           package My::Component;

           extends 'Graphics::Primitive::Component';

           with 'Graphics::Primitive::Oriented';

           1;

METHODS
       is_vertical
           Returns true if the component is vertically oriented.

       is_horizontal
           Returns true if the component is not vertically oriented.

       orientation
           The way a component is oriented. Values allowed are 'horizontal' or 'vertical'.
