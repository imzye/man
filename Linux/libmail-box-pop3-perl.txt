NAME
       Mail::Transport::POP3 - receive messages via POP3

INHERITANCE
        Mail::Transport::POP3
          is a Mail::Transport::Receive
          is a Mail::Transport
          is a Mail::Reporter

SYNOPSIS
        my $receiver = Mail::Transport::POP3->new(...);
        my $message = $receiver->receive($id);

DESCRIPTION
       Receive messages via the POP3 protocol from one remote server, as specified in rfc1939.  This object hides much of the complications in the protocol and recovers broken connections automatically.
       Although it is part of the MailBox distribution, this object can be used separately.

       You probably should not use this module, but Mail::Box::POP3.  This module is the interface to POP3, whereas Mail::Box::POP3 hides the protocol weirdness and works as any other mail folder.

       Mail::Transport::POP3->new(%options)
           Create  a  new  pop3  server  connection.  One object can only handle one connection: for a single user to one single server.  If the server could not be reached, or when the login fails, this
           instantiating "new" will return "undef".

            -Option      --Defined in     --Default
             authenticate                   'AUTO'
             executable    Mail::Transport  undef
             hostname      Mail::Transport  'localhost'
             interval      Mail::Transport  30
             log           Mail::Reporter   'WARNINGS'
             password      Mail::Transport  undef
             port          Mail::Transport  110
             proxy         Mail::Transport  undef
             retry         Mail::Transport  <false>
             ssl_options                    <undef>
             timeout       Mail::Transport  120
             trace         Mail::Reporter   'WARNINGS'

           authenticate => 'LOGIN'|'APOP'|'AUTO'|'OAUTH2'|'OAUTH2_SEP'
             Authenthication method.  The standard defines two methods, named LOGIN and APOP.  The first sends the username and password in plain text to the server to get permission, the latter encrypts
             this data using MD5.  When AUTO is used, first APOP is tried, and then LOGIN.

             [3.006] OAUTH* requires the authorization token to be passed as Password.  Microsoft Office365 needs "OAUTH2_SEP", where other oauth2 implementations use "OAUTH2".

           interval => SECONDS

           port => INTEGER
           proxy => PATH
           retry => NUMBER|undef
           ssl_options => HASH
             Unless overruled, "verify_hostname" will be set to false and "SSL_verify_mode" to "SSL_VERIFY_NONE}"

             You can also set the SSL parameters via IO::Socket::SSL subroutine set_defaults.  Connections will get restarted when they are lost: you have  to  keep  the  defaults  in  place  during  POP
             actions.

   Attributes
       $obj->SSLOptions()
       $obj->useSSL()
           Returns "true" when SSL must be used.

   Receiving mail
       Extends "Receiving mail" in Mail::Transport::Receive.

       $obj->receive( [$unique_message_id] )
           Inherited, see "Receiving mail" in Mail::Transport::Receive

   Exchanging information
       $obj->deleteFetched()
           Mark all messages that have been fetched with message() for deletion.  See fetched().

       $obj->deleted(BOOLEAN, @ids)
           Either  mark  the  specified  message(s)  to  be deleted on the remote server or unmark them for deletion (if the first parameter is false).  Deletion of messages will take place only when the
           connection is specifically disconnected or the last reference to the object goes out of scope.

       $obj->disconnect()
           Break contact with the server, if that (still) exists.  Returns true if successful.  Please note that even if the disconnect was not successful, all knowledge of messages etc. will be  removed
           from the object: the object basically has reverted to the state in which it was before anything was done with the mail box.

       $obj->fetched()
           Returns a reference to a list of ID's that have been fetched using message().  This can be used to update a database of messages that were fetched (but maybe not yet deleted) from the mailbox.

           Please note that if the POP3 server did not support the UIDL command, this method will always return undef because it is not possibly to reliably identify messages between sessions (other than
           looking at the contents of the messages themselves).

           See also deleteFetched().

       $obj->folderSize()
           Returns the total number of octets used by the mailbox on the remote server.

       $obj->header( $id, [$bodylines] )
           Returns a reference to an array which contains the header of the message with the specified $id.  "undef" is returned if something has gone wrong.

           The optional integer $bodylines specifies the number of lines from the body which should be added, by default none.

           example:

            my $ref_lines = $pop3->header($uidl);
            print @$ref_lines;

       $obj->id2n($id)
           Translates  the  unique  $id  of  a message into a sequence number which represents the message as long a this connection to the POP3 server exists.  When the message has been deleted for some
           reason, "undef" is returned.

       $obj->ids()
           Returns a list (in list context) or a reference to a list (in scalar context) of all IDs which are known by the server on this moment.

       $obj->message($id)
           Returns a reference to an array which contains the lines of the message with the specified $id.  Returns "undef" if something has gone wrong.

           example:

            my $ref_lines = $pop3->message($uidl);
            print @$ref_lines;

       $obj->messageSize($id)
           Returns the size of the message which is indicated by the $id, in octets.  If the message has been deleted on the remote server, this will return "undef".

       $obj->messages()
           Returns (in scalar context only) the number of messages that are known to exist in the mailbox.

   Protocol internals
       The follow methods handle protocol internals, and should not be used by a normal user of this class.

       $obj->login()
           Establish a new connection to the POP3 server, using username and password.

       $obj->send($socket, $data)
           Send $data to the indicated socket and return the first line read from that socket.  Logs an error if either writing to or reading from socket failed.

           This method does not attempt to reconnect or anything: if reading or writing the socket fails, something is very definitely wrong.

       $obj->sendList($socket, $command)
           Sends the indicated $command to the specified socket, and retrieves the response.  It returns a reference to an array with all the lines that were reveived  after  the  first  "+OK"  line  and
           before the end-of-message delimiter (a single dot on a line).  Returns "undef" whenever something has gone wrong.

       $obj->socket()
           Returns  a  connection  to  the POP3 server.  If there was no connection yet, it will be created transparently.  If the connection with the POP3 server was lost, it will be reconnected and the
           assures that internal state information (STAT and UIDL) is up-to-date in the object.

           If the contact to the server was still present, or could be established, an IO::Socket::INET object is returned.  Else, "undef" is returned and no  further  actions  should  be  tried  on  the
           object.

       $obj->status($socket)
           Update the current status of folder on the remote POP3 server.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Error: Cannot connect to $host:$port for POP3: $!
           Unsuccessful in connecting to the remote POP3 server.

       Error: Cannot get the messages of pop3 via messages()
           It is not possible to retrieve all messages on a remote POP3 folder at once: each shall be taken separately.  The POP3 folder will hide this for you.

       Error: Cannot re-connect reliably to server which doesn't support UIDL.
           The connection to the remote POP3 was lost, and cannot be re-established because the server's protocol implementation lacks the necessary information.

       Error: Cannot read POP3 from socket: $!
           It is not possible to read the success status of the previously given POP3 command.  Connection lost?

       Error: Cannot write POP3 to socket: $@
           It is not possible to send a protocol command to the POP3 server.  Connection lost?

       Error: Could not authenticate using '$some' method.
           The authenication method to get access to the POP3 server did not result in a connection.  Maybe you need a different authentication protocol, or your username with password are invalid.

       Error: Could not authenticate using any login method.
           No authentication method was explicitly prescribed, so both AUTH and APOP were tried.  However, both failed.  There are other authentication methods, which are not defined by the main POP3 RFC
           rfc1939.  These protocols are not implemented yet.  Please contribute your implementation.

       Error: POP3 Could not do a STAT
           For some weird reason, the server does not respond to the STAT call.

       Error: POP3 requires a username and password.
           No username and/or no password specified for this POP3 folder, although these are obligatory parts in the protocol.

       Error: Package $package does not implement $method.
           Fatal  error:  the  specific  package  (or  one of its superclasses) does not implement this method where it should. This message means that some other related classes do implement this method
           however the class at hand does not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author of the package.

       Error: Server at $host:$port does not seem to be talking POP3.
           The remote server did not respond to an initial exchange of messages as is expected by the POP3 protocol.  The server has probably a different service on the specified port.
