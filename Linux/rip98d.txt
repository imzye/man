RIP98D(8)                Linux System Managers Manual                RIP98D(8)

NAME
       rip98d - Send and receive RIP98 routing messages

SYNOPSIS
       rip98d [-d] [-l] [-r] [-t interval] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       The  RIP98 routing protocol was devised by John Wiseman G8BPQ as an al‐
       ternative to both traditional RIP and RSPF for use in  an  RF  environ‐
       ment.   Its  main advantage is that each routing element only takes six
       bytes and is therefore much more efficient in terms of  bandwidth  than
       other routing protocols.

       In  operation  rip98d  that each neighbour that also uses RIP98 must be
       listed. RIP98 is not a broadcast protocol and each neighbour  is  indi‐
       vidually  contacted.  Any  incoming  RIP98  message  is  also validated
       against   this   list.   The   list   of   neighbours   is   held    in
       /etc/ax25/rip98d.conf,  and  each line is either the name or the dotted
       decimal IP address of the neighbour.

       The time interval between RIP98 transmissions is set to one hour by de‐
       fault but other intervals can be set with the -t option. The routes ad‐
       vertised and received can be restricted by the -r option which only al‐
       lows  processing  of ampr.org addresses. At present rip98d is under de‐
       velopment and any feedback on its operation would be welcome.

OPTIONS
       -d              Set debugging on. Information is  only  output  if  the
                       logging option is also enabled.

       -l              Enable logging to the system log, the default is off.

       -r              Restricts  the  transmitting and receiving of routes to
                       ampr.org (44.x.x.x) addresses only.

       -t interval     The time interval between routing broadcasts,  in  min‐
                       utes. The default is 60 minutes.

       -v              Display the version.
