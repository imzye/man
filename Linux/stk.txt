NAME
       stk-demo - Sound Synthesis Toolkit demo application

SYNOPSIS
       stk-demo Instrument [options]
       STKDemo

DESCRIPTION
       The stk-demo program demonstrates several of the algorithms that are built into the Sound Synthesis Toolkit (STK). The stk-demo is a command line program, but it has a GUI frontend called STKDemo.
       Use STKDemo if you  want to try out the different synthesis algorithms implemented in STK.

       The stk-demo program can be used to build your own synthesizer/sequencer combination. The program is listening to SKINI commands on stdin.

       Instrument can be one of the following:

       Clarinet,  BlowHole, Saxofony, Flute, Brass, BlowBotl, Bowed, Plucked, StifKarp, Sitar, Mandolin, Rhodey, Wurley, TubeBell, HevyMetl, PercFlut, BeeThree, FMVoices, VoicForm, Moog, Simple, Drummer,
       BandedWG, Shakers, ModalBar, Mesh2D, Resonate, Whistle

       Simultaneous multiple output types are supported.  Likewise, simultaneous control input types are supported.  SKINI formatted scorefiles can be piped or redirected  to  stk-demo,  though  realtime
       control flags should be omitted when doing so. If the optional <file names> are not specified, default names will be indicated.  Each flag must include its own '-' sign.

OPTIONS
       -s RATE to specify a sample rate

       -n NUMBER
              specifies the number of voices to allocate

       -ow <file name>
              for .wav audio output file

       -os <file name>
              for .snd audio output file

       -om <file name>
              for .mat audio output file

       -oa <file name>
              for .aif audio output file

       -or    for realtime audio output

       -ip    for realtime control input by pipe

       -is <port>
              for realtime control input by socket

       -im    for realtime control input by MIDI,
