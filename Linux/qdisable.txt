NAME
       qdisable - disable input to a pbs destination

SYNOPSIS
       qdisable destination ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  qdisable  command directs that a destination should no longer accept batch jobs.  If the command is accepted, the destination will no longer accept Queue Job requests which specified the disabled
       queue.  Jobs which already reside in the queue will continue to be processed.  This allows a queue to be "drained."

       In order to execute qdisable, the user must have PBS Operation or Manager privilege.

OPERANDS
       The qdisable command accepts one or more destination operands.  The operands are one of three forms:
            queue
            @server
            queue@server
       If queue is specified, the request is to disable that queue at the default server.  If the @server form is given, the request is to disable all the queues at that server.  If a full destination  iden‐
       tifier, queue@server, is given, the request is to disable the named queue at the named server.

STANDARD ERROR
       The qdisable command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qdisable command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qdisable command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
