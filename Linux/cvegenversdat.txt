NAME
       cvegenversdat - Generate version matching rules for passed on files

SYNOPSIS
       <filelist> | cvegenversdat <packagename> <packageversion> <conffile>
       [breakon]

DESCRIPTION
       The cvegenversdat script is a  distribution-agnostic  script  that  at‐
       tempts  to  generate  version  matching  rules  for the files fed to it
       through standard input. It is commonly called from a  distribution-spe‐
       cific script (like cverules_gentoo).

USAGE
   COMMAND USAGE
       The command requires the following arguments to be set:

       • packagename is the name of the package (like "gzip")

       • packageversion is the (upstream) version of the tool, not of the dis‐
         tribution (so "1.4" rather than "1.4-r1" or "1.4-yourdistro-1")

       • conffile is the cvechecker configuration file  (like  "/etc/cvecheck‐
         er.conf")

       • breakon  (literally)  tells  the script to stop the moment a match is
         already found within the existing cvechecker database.   Without  the
         "breakon"  string,  the  script will scan all passed files, even if a
         few of them are already known to cvechecker.

       The script should not be called by end users but is rather a script  to
       be called by the distribution-specific scripts like cverules_gentoo.
