NAME
       jscal-store - stores joystick calibration

SYNOPSIS
       jscal-store <device-name>

DESCRIPTION
       jscal-store stores the calibration and mapping information for the given joystick device. This information can later be restored using the jscal-restore command.

       An  appropriate rule can be set up with udev so that any stored calibration settings are restored when the relevant device is connected. Some distributions (at least Debian, Ubuntu and Slackware) pro‐
       vide joystick packages which install such rules automatically.

FILES
       /var/lib/joystick/joystick.state
              File used to store the calibration settings.

SEE ALSO
       jscal(1), jscal-restore(1).
