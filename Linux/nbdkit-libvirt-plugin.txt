NAME
       nbdkit-libvirt-plugin - nbdkit libvirt plugin using virDomainBlockPeek

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit libvirt [connect=URI] domain=DOMAIN disk=DISK

EXAMPLE
        nbdkit libvirt domain=MyGuest disk=sda
        guestfish --ro --format=raw -a nbd://localhost

DESCRIPTION
       "nbdkit-libvirt-plugin" is an nbdkit(1) plugin that lets you access libvirt guest disks.  Only read-only access is possible.  It is implemented using the libvirt "virDomainBlockPeek" API.  It can also
       be used over remote libvirt connections.

PARAMETERS
       connect=URI
           This optional parameter specifies the libvirt connection URI.

       domain=DOMAIN
           This required parameter specifies the libvirt domain name (guest name).

       disk=DISK
           This required parameter specifies the guest's disk that we want to read.

           You can either give the path to the backing device (/path/to/disk) or the target name (eg. "sda").

           In either case use "virsh dumpxml DOMAIN" to list possible disks.  Look for "<source dev=...>" or "<source file=...>" or "<target dev=...>" in the XML.

FILES
       $plugindir/nbdkit-libvirt-plugin.so
           The plugin.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $plugindir.

VERSION
       "nbdkit-libvirt-plugin" first appeared in nbdkit 1.0.
