NAME
       packagesearch — Program to search for debian packages

SYNOPSIS
       packagesearch [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the packagesearch program.

       There is not much to say about it. Start it by typing packagesearch and use the help function offered by the program if necessary.

       packagesearch is aimed to help you searching the packages you need. It should make the task of searching a pleasant experience. Originally I designed it for the purpose of finding a single package
       where you have a clear imagination of what you want. But you can also use it to simply browse your packages to explore. Perhaps there is something in the database that you simply must have :-).

OPTIONS
       -v  --version
                 Prints the version information.

       -h  --help
                 Prints a usage message.

SEE ALSO
       debtags(1).
