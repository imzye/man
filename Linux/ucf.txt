NAME
       ucf.conf - site-wide configuration file for ucf

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/ucf.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/ucf.conf is a POSIX Shell snippet sourced by ucf(1) and ucfr(1).  It can contain any shell directive (just ensure you know what you are doing).

       All the variables have reasonable default values, but they be overridden on a site-wide or per-run basis.

       a) Some variables can be set in the config file /etc/ucf.conf.  These values override the defaults.

       b) Some variables can also be set by setting a corresponding environment variable.  These values take precedence over the config file.

Configuration File options
       At the moment, the user modifiable variables supported are:

       DEBUG             Debugging information: The default value is 0 (no debugging information is printed).  To enable debugging output, set the value to 1.

       VERBOSE           Verbosity: The default value is 0 (quiet).  To change the default behavior, set the value to 1.

       conf_force_conffold
                         Force the installed file to be retained.  The default is to have this variable unset, which makes the script ask in case of doubt.  This can also be overridden by the environment
                         variable UCF_FORCE_CONFFOLD

       conf_force_conffnew
                         Force the installed file to be overwritten.  The default is to have this variable unset, which makes the script ask in case of doubt.  This can also be overridden by the environ‐
                         ment variable UCF_FORCE_CONFFNEW

       conf_source_dir   This  is  the directory where the historical md5sums for a file are looked for.  Specifically, the historical md5sums are looked for in either the file ${filename}.md5sum, or the
                         subdirectory ${filename}.md5sum.d/

       conf_old_mdsum_file
                         Force the historical md5sums to be read from this file, rather than defaulting to living in the source directory.  Setting this option overrides settings in the environment vari‐
                         able UCF_OLD_MDSUM_FILE

Files
       System-wide defaults are placed in /etc/ucf.conf,

BUGS
       There are no bugs.  Any resemblance thereof is delirium.  Really.
