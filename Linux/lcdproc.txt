NAME
       lcdproc-config - format of LCDproc's configuration files

SYNTAX
       The syntax for LCDproc's configuration files is INI-file style.

       They are 8-bit text files divided into sections, each containing zero or more key-value pairs.  Sections are introduced by section labels which start with '[' and end with ']', and key-value pairs
       consist of a key name, a '=' sign and a value each.

       Key  names  are  sequences  of  non-space characters, not starting with '[' and not containing '=' or '\n', while values are shell like strings.  I.e. they are either simple sequences of non-space
       characters, or double quoted-strings with C-style syntax (except the missing support for '\NNN' and '\xNN' escape sequences) or or a mix of both of these forms.

       Section labels and key names are case-insensitive and may occur more than once.  Keys of duplicate sections will be merged into one section, while the values of duplicate keys in a section will be
       appended to form an array of values for this key.  (In the program, all values of a key can be retrieved individually)

       Spaces around section labels, keys, and values are ignored.  Lines starting with ';' or '#' are considered comments and ignored too.

       While all of the above is quite common to almost all INI-file implementations, there are a few special features that make LCDproc's config files special:

       *      Section labels may contain any character except ']', '\n' or '\0'.  However, all characters are interpreted literally (i.e. neither quoting, nor escaping done).

       *      Key names may contain any non-space character except '\n' or '\0'.  However, all characters are interpreted literally (i.e. neither quoting, nor escaping done).

       *      Comments are allowed after section labels and key value pairs

       *      Values may be a mix of quoted and unquoted strings similar as strings are interpreted in the shell.  E.g. the value 'string" with "blanks"\t!"' will be parsed as 'string with  blanks<TAB>!'
              where <TAB> stands for the TAB character.

       In case of a a parsing error the rest of the line is ignored and parsing continues with the next line.

EXAMPLE
       Here is fully working example of an LCDd.conf (formatted somewhat strange to show the features):
       # the server section
       [server]
       Bind=127.0.0.1
       Port=13666
       User="nobody"
       #Foreground=no
       #ReportLevel=3
       #ReportToSyslog=yes
       Driver="my Curses Driver"
       DriverPath=/usr/lib/lcdproc/
       WaitTime= "5"
       ServerScreen=no

       # assign keys to special functions #
       ToggleRotateKey = Enter
       PrevScreenKey = Left
       NextScreenKey = Right
       # ScrollUpKey = Up
        #ScrollDownKey=Down

       #  menu section: define keys to use in the server menu #
             [menu]
       MenuKey = Escape    # ESC switches to server menu
       EnterKey =Enter
       UpKey= Up
       DownKey="Down"
        LeftKey= "Left"
        RightKey = "Right"

       # configuration of the curses driver #
       [my curses Driver]  # yes I use the curse driver
       File= "curses.so"
       Size="20"x"4"       # LCD screen dimensions
       TopLeftX=7          # screen position: X coordinate
       TopLeftY=7          # screen position: Y coordinate
       Foreground=blue          # foreground color
       Background=cyan          # background color when backight is off
       Backlight=red       # background color when backight is on

FILES
       These are the default config files for the various parts of the LCDproc suite:

       /etc/LCDd.conf
              configuration of the LCDd server daemon

       /etc/lcdproc.conf
              configuration of the lcdproc system monitoring client

       /etc/lcdexec.conf
              configuration of the lcdexec the program starter client

       /etc/lcdvc.conf
              configuration of the lcdvc virtual console client
