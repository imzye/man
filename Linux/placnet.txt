NAME
       placnet - Plasmid Constellation Network project

DESCRIPTION
       Placnet is a new tool for plasmid analysis in NGS projects. Placnet is optimized to work with Illumina sequences but it also works with 454, Iontorrent or any of the actual sequence technologies.

       The  input  of placnet is a set of contigs and one or more SAM files with the mapping of the reads against the contigs. Placnet obtains a set of files, easily opened on Cytoscape software or other
       network tools.

OPTIONS
       Write inputFile Template

       placnet -generate

       Network process

       placnet -f inputFile.txt -p prefix -l min

       -f=s   Input file for PLACNET analysis.

       -p=s   Prefix name for output files (default 'placnet').

       -l=s   Minimun contig length to scaffold process (default '200').
