NAME
       libdmtx - Data Matrix Encoding & Decoding Library 0.7.5

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dmtx.h>

       cc file.c -ldmtx

DESCRIPTION
       libdmtx is a software library that enables programs to read and write Data Matrix barcodes of the modern ECC200 variety. The library runs natively on several platforms, and can be accessed by mul‐
       tiple  languages using the libdmtx language wrappers. The utility programs dmtxread and dmtxwrite provide a command line interface for libdmtx, and serve as a good reference for developers writing
       their own libdmtx-enabled programs.

       Data Matrix barcodes store data as a pattern of ON and OFF modules (often black on white) in a grid pattern that resembles a checkerboard. Like other 2D symbologies, Data Matrix  barcodes  have  a
       large  data capacity compared to their traditional 1D cousins, and employ sophisticated error correction techniques. Data Matrix barcodes can be square or rectangle in shape, and offer several en‐
       codation schemes for optimized storage of text and/or binary data. The Data Matrix symbology was invented and released into the public domain by RVSI Acuity CiMatrix.

ENCODING - Generating Data Matrix Barcodes
       C/C++ programs can generate a barcode with just a few basic calls to libdmtx:

       1. Call dmtxEncodeCreate()

       Creates a new DmtxEncode structure and initializes the encoding process. This function must be called before using the other encoding functions.

       2. Call dmtxEncodeSetProp() [optional]

       Allows you to control specific aspects of the encoding behavior. If this function is not called, libdmtx will use the defaults set by dmtxEncodeCreate() above. The complementary function,  dmtxEn‐
       codeGetProp(), allows you to detect the current settings.

       3. Call either dmtxEncodeDataMatrix() or dmtxEncodeDataMosaic()

       Call  one of these functions to generate an image of the desired barcode type. Your program is responsible for dispatching the resulting output to its destination, whether that means displaying it
       on a screen, writing an image file, copying it elsewhere, etc...

       4. Call dmtxEncodeDestroy()

       Releases memory allocated during the encoding process.

DECODING - Reading Data Matrix Barcodes
       Barcode reading takes more steps than barcode generation, mainly because libdmtx must find a barcode region before it can decode the message. However, this too is a relatively simple process  that
       uses 4 main structures:

       DmtxImage holds image properties and a pointer to pixel data held by the calling program.

       DmtxDecode  holds  values for controlling decode behavior and tracking scan progress. When scanning a new image, calling programs should always create a new DmtxDecode structure instead of reusing
       an old one.

       DmtxRegion defines a 4-sided region in pixel coordinates. Regions may be found in almost any orientation, and their corners won't necessarily form right angles.  libdmtx  uses  this  structure  to
       store the location of potential barcodes, which are then returned to the calling program one-at-a-time.

       DmtxMessage holds the decoded message after being extracted from the barcode region. A successfully decoded region will produce exactly one message.

       Use the following functions to find and decode Data Matrix barcodes:

       1. Call dmtxImageCreate()

       Creates and initializes a new DmtxImage structure using pixel data provided by the calling application. Parameters include a pointer to the existing pixel array, image width, height, and the pixel
       packing format.

       2. Call dmtxImageSetProp() [optional]

       Sets image properties to control the pixel mapping logic. These settings allow libdmtx to understand many native in-memory image layouts, thus preventing the extra work of transforming and copying
       data to a one-size-fits-all format. A dmtxDecodeGetProp() function is also available for detecting the current image properties.

       3. Call dmtxDecodeCreate()

       Creates and initializes a new DmtxDecode struct, which designates the image to be scanned and initializes the scan grid pattern. This function must be called before any other scanning functions.

       4. Call dmtxDecodeSetProp() [optional]

       Sets internal properties to control decoding behavior. This feature allows you to optimize performance and accuracy for specific image conditions. A dmtxDecodeGetProp() function is also available.

       5. Call dmtxRegionFindNext()

       Searches  every  pixel  location  in a grid pattern looking for potential barcode regions. A DmtxRegion is returned whenever a potential barcode region is found, or if the final pixel location has
       been scanned. Subsequent calls to this function will resume the search where the previous call left off.

       6. Call either dmtxDecodeMatrixRegion() or dmtxDecodeMosaicRegion()

       Extracts raw data from the barcode region and decodes the underlying message.

       7. Call dmtxMessageDestroy()

       Releases memory held by a DmtxMessage struct. The complementary function, dmtxMessageCreate(), is automatically called by dmtxDecodeMatrixRegion() and therefore is not normally used by the calling
       program.

       8. Call dmtxRegionDestroy()

       Releases memory held by a DmtxRegion struct. The complementary function, dmtxRegionCreate(), is automatically called by dmtxRegionFindNext() (actually dmtxRegionScanPixel()) and therefore  is  not
       normally used by the calling program.

       9. Call dmtxDecodeDestroy()

       Releases memory held by a DmtxDecode struct. This is the complementary function to dmtxDecodeCreate().

       10. Call dmtxImageDestroy()

       Releases memory held by a DmtxImage struct, excluding the pixel array passed to dmtxImageCreate(). The calling program is responsible for releasing the pixel array memory, if required.

EXAMPLE PROGRAM
       This  example  program  (available as simple_test.c in the source package) demonstrates libdmtx functionality in both directions: encoding and decoding. It creates a Data Matrix barcode in memory,
       reads it back, and prints the decoded message. The final output message should match the original input string.

         #include <stdlib.h>
         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <string.h>
         #include <assert.h>
         #include <dmtx.h>

         int
         main(int argc, char *argv[])
         {
            size_t          width, height, bytesPerPixel;
            unsigned char   str[] = "30Q324343430794<OQQ";
            unsigned char  *pxl;
            DmtxEncode     *enc;
            DmtxImage      *img;
            DmtxDecode     *dec;
            DmtxRegion     *reg;
            DmtxMessage    *msg;

            fprintf(stdout, "input:  \"%s\"\n", str);

            /* 1) ENCODE a new Data Matrix barcode image (in memory only) */

            enc = dmtxEncodeCreate();
            assert(enc != NULL);
            dmtxEncodeDataMatrix(enc, strlen(str), str);

            /* 2) COPY the new image data before releasing encoding memory */

            width = dmtxImageGetProp(enc->image, DmtxPropWidth);
            height = dmtxImageGetProp(enc->image, DmtxPropHeight);
            bytesPerPixel = dmtxImageGetProp(enc->image, DmtxPropBytesPerPixel);

            pxl = (unsigned char *)malloc(width * height * bytesPerPixel);
            assert(pxl != NULL);
            memcpy(pxl, enc->image->pxl, width * height * bytesPerPixel);

            dmtxEncodeDestroy(&enc);

            /* 3) DECODE the Data Matrix barcode from the copied image */

            img = dmtxImageCreate(pxl, width, height, DmtxPack24bppRGB);
            assert(img != NULL);

            dec = dmtxDecodeCreate(img, 1);
            assert(dec != NULL);

            reg = dmtxRegionFindNext(dec, NULL);
            if(reg != NULL) {
               msg = dmtxDecodeMatrixRegion(dec, reg, DmtxUndefined);
               if(msg != NULL) {
                  fputs("output: \"", stdout);
                  fwrite(msg->output, sizeof(unsigned char), msg->outputIdx, stdout);
                  fputs("\"\n", stdout);
                  dmtxMessageDestroy(&msg);
               }
               dmtxRegionDestroy(&reg);
            }

            dmtxDecodeDestroy(&dec);
            dmtxImageDestroy(&img);
            free(pxl);

            exit(0);
         }
