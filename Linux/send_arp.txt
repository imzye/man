NAME
       send_arp - Send out one ARP packet with source/target IP and Ethernet hardware addresses suuplied by the user.

SYNOPSIS
       send_arp sndr_ip_addr sndr_hw_addr targ_ip_addr targ_hw_addr [src_int [src_hw_addr [dest_hw_addr]]]

DESCRIPTION
       send_arp  This  program sends out one ARP packet with source/target IP and Ethernet hardware addresses suuplied by the user.  It compiles and works on Linux and will probably work on any Unix that has
       SOCK_PACKET.

       The idea behind this program is a proof of a concept, nothing more.  It comes as is, no warranty.  However, you're allowed to use it under one condition: you must use your  brain  simultaneously.   If
       this condition is not met, you shall forget about this program and go RTFM immediately.
