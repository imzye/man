NAME
       blosxom - A lightweight yet feature-packed weblog

SYNOPSIS
       blosxom is a simple web log (blog) CGI script written in perl.

DESCRIPTION
       Blosxom (pronounced "blossom") is a lightweight yet feature-packed weblog application designed from the ground up with simplicity, usability, and interoperability in mind.

       Fundamental  is  its reliance upon the file system, folders and files as its content database. Blosxom's weblog entries are plain text files like any other. Write from the comfort of your favorite
       text editor and hit the Save button. Create, edit, rename, and delete entries on the command-line, via FTP, WebDAV, or anything else you might use to manipulate your files. There's  no  import  or
       export; entries are nothing more complex than title on the first line, body being everything thereafter.

       Despite its tiny footprint, Blosxom doesn't skimp on features, sporting the majority of features one would find in any other Weblog application.

       Blosxom  is  simple,  straightforward, minimalist Perl affording even the dabbler an opportunity for experimentation and customization. And last, but not least, Blosxom is open source and free for
       the taking and altering.

USAGE
       Write a weblog entry, and place it into the main data directory. Place the the title is on the first line; the body is everything afterwards.  For example, create a file named first.txt and put in
       it something like this.

         First Blosxom Post!
