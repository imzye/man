NAME
       shpcreate - create an empty ESRI shapefile

SYNOPSIS
       shpcreate shp_file [point|arc|polygon|multipoint]

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  empty  shapefile  supporting shapes of the given type. Shapefiles actually consist of two files with the same basename and extensions .shp and .shx (or .SHP and .SHX) containing the shape
       data and shape index respectively. The files to create are determined by first stripping any filename extension from shp_file and attempting to create  the  files  shp_file.shp  or  shp_file.SHP,  and
       shp_file.shx or shp_file.SHX for the respective data and index files. The supported values for the shapetype argument are: point, arc, polygon, and multipoint.

OPTIONS
       shp_file
              the name of the shapefile to be created. Doesn´t need the extension

       point|arc|polygon|multipoint
              the type of shapefile that you wish to create. Must specify a valid option.

EXAMPLE
       shpcreate testpolygon polygon

       this will create a polygon shapefile named testpolygon (in fact testpolygon.shp and testpolygon.shx will be created).

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Missing shp_file or shapetype argument.

       2      Unknown shapetype.

       3      Unable to create the shapefile.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stdout:

       Shape Type `shapetype´ not recognised.

       Unable to create:shp_file
