NAME
       hmmlogo - given an HMM, produce data required to build an HMM logo

SYNOPSIS
       hmmlogo [options] <hmmfile>

DESCRIPTION
       hmmlogo  computes  letter height and indel parameters that can be used to produce a profile HMM logo. This tool is essentially a command-line interface for much of the data underlying the Skylign logo
       server (skylign.org).

       By default, hmmlogo prints out a table of per-position letter heights (dependent on the requested height method), then prints a table of per-position gap probabilities.

       In a typical logo, the total height of a stack of letters for one position depends on the information content of the position, and that stack height is subdivided according to the emission  probabili‐
       ties of the letters of the alphabet.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

       --height_relent_all
              Total height = relative entropy (aka information content); all letters are given a positive height.  (default)

       --height_relent_abovebg
              Total height = relative entropy (aka information content); only letters with above-background probability are given positive height.

       --height_score
              Total  height  =  sums of scores of positive-scoring letters; letter height depends on the score of that letter at that position. Only letters with above-background probability (positive score)
              are given positive height. (Note that only letter height is meaningful - stack height has no inherent meaning).

       --no_indel
              Don't print out the indel probability table.
