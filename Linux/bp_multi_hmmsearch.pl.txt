NAME
       multi_hmmsearch - perform a hmmsearch into multiple FASTA files using
                         an INDEX file

SYNOPSIS
       multi_hmmsearch -p hmm_file [-i] -f index_file

DESCRIPTION
       Not technically a Bio::Tools::Run script as this doesn't use any Bioperl or Bioperl-run components but it's useful.

   Mandatory Options:
         -p  HMM profile to use for the search.
         -f  INDEX file that contains a list of FASTA files for the multiple
             search.

   Special Options:
         -i  Create a new index file with the resulting hmms files. This is
             useful if you want to pass this list as input arguments into
             another programs.
