NAME
       horizon-imp - horizon EDA interactive manipulator

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the horizon-imp command.

       horizon-imp is the 'interactive manipulator' and can be run in one of 5 modes, each operating on a different type of item: symbol, schematic, padstack, package or board.

OPTIONS
       Details of options are included below.

       -y <symbol file>
              Run in Symbol mode:

       -c <schematic file> <block file>
              Run in Schematic mode

       -a <padstack file>
              Run in Padstack mode

       -b <board file <block file> <via directory>

USAGE
       There is normally little reason to run this command directly.  Normally horizon-prj-mgr and horizon-pool-mgr are used. But it remains useful for debugging.

ENVIRONMENT
       This command requires the environment variable HORIZON_POOL to point to the pool's directory (the one with the pool.json and pool.db in it)
