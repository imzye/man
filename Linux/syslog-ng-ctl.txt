NAME
       syslog-ng-ctl - Display message statistics and enable verbose, debug and trace modes in

SYNOPSIS
       syslog-ng-ctl [command] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE: The syslog-ng-ctl application is distributed with the system logging application, and is usually part of the syslog-ng package. The latest version of the syslog-ng application is available at
       the official syslog-ng website[1].

       This manual page is only an abstract, for the complete documentation of syslog-ng, see The Administrator Guide[2].

       The syslog-ng-ctl application is a utility that can be used to:

       ·   enable/disable various syslog-ng messages for troubleshooting

       ·   display statistics about the processed messages

       ·   reload the configuration of .

ENABLING TROUBLESHOOTING MESSAGES
       command [options]

       Use the syslog-ng-ctl <command> --set=on command to display verbose, trace, or debug messages. If you are trying to solve configuration problems, the verbose (and occasionally trace) messages are
       usually sufficient. Debug messages are needed mostly for finding software errors. After solving the problem, do not forget to turn these messages off using the syslog-ng-ctl <command> --set=off. Note
       that enabling debug messages does not enable verbose and trace messages.

       Use syslog-ng-ctl <command> without any parameters to display whether the particular type of messages are enabled or not.

       If you need to use a non-standard control socket to access syslog-ng, use the syslog-ng-ctl <command> --set=on --control=<socket> command to specify the socket to use.

       verbose
           Print verbose messages. If syslog-ng was started with the --stderr or -e option, the messages will be sent to stderr. If not specified, syslog-ng will log such messages to its internal source.

       trace
           Print trace messages of how messages are processed. If syslog-ng was started with the --stderr or -e option, the messages will be sent to stderr. If not specified, syslog-ng will log such messages
           to its internal source.

       debug
           Print debug messages. If syslog-ng was started with the --stderr or -e option, the messages will be sent to stderr. If not specified, syslog-ng will log such messages to its internal source.

       Example:

           syslog-ng-ctl verbose --set=on

THE STATS COMMAND
       stats [options]

       Use the stats command to display statistics about the processed messages. The stats command has the following options:

       --control=<socket> or -c
           Specify the socket to use to access syslog-ng. Only needed when using a non-standard socket.

       --reset or -r
           Reset all statistics to zero, except for the stored counters. (The stored counters show the number of messages stored in the message queue of the destination driver, waiting to be sent to the
           destination.)

       Example:

           syslog-ng-ctl stats

       An example output:

RELOADING THE CONFIGURATION

       Use the syslog-ng-ctl reload command to reload the configuration file of without having to restart the application. The syslog-ng-ctl reload works like a SIGHUP.
