GJOTS2DOCBOOK(1)            General Commands Manual           GJOTS2DOCBOOK(1)

NAME
       gjots2docbook - Convert a gjotsfile to DOCBOOK (on stdout)

SYNOPSIS
       gjots2docbook -a|-b [ -e ] [ -P ] [ -p ] [ gjotsfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       gjots2docbook converts a gjotsfile into DOCBOOK XML.

       gjots2docbook uses awk(1) to perform the conversion.

       gjots2docbook  does  not  create  them so the first element in the file
       should contain any <bookinfo> or <artheader> element. Similarly,  <bib‐
       liographic>  elements  are not created. In fact the output is very sim‐
       plistic with item titles in the gjotsfile being converted to chapter or
       section  headings  in  DOCBOOK.  There  is no reason why your gjotsfile
       should not contain valid DOCBOOK XML - and that is why the  -e  and  -p
       options are provided.

       If  the file does not start with <?xml ...> then appropriate lines will
       be added as follows:

              <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
              <!DOCTYPE doc_type PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN">

       If properly installed, the docbook utilities can then be used to create
       HTML, man, ps, pdf etc files eg:

              gjots2docbook -b ~/.gjotsfile >gjotsfile.xml
              docbook2pdf gjotsfile.xml

       It  may  be necessary to fine-tune the docbook formatting to access all
       features.

OPTIONS
       -a     makes a DOCBOOK article

       -b     makes a DOCBOOK book

       -e     don't encode special characters eg < -> &lt;

       -p     don't change blank lines to </para><para> markers

       -P     first section is a preface rather than a chapter (book only)
