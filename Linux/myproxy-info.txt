myproxy-info(1)                     MyProxy                    myproxy-info(1)

NAME
       myproxy-info - display information about MyProxy credentials

SYNOPSIS
       myproxy-info [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  myproxy-info  command  displays information about a user's creden‐
       tials previously stored on a myproxy-server(8)  using  myproxy-init(1).
       The user must have a valid proxy credential as generated by grid-proxy-
       init or retrieved by myproxy-logon(1) when running this command.

       The myproxy-info command  provides  information  only  for  credentials
       stored  in  the  myproxy-server(8) credential repository using myproxy-
       init(1).  In the case where the myproxy-server(8) is acting as  a  Cer‐
       tificate  Authority,  issuing  end  entity credentials via the myproxy-
       logon(1) command, the myproxy-info command will return "no  credentials
       found".

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays command usage text and exits.

       -u, --usage
              Displays command usage text and exits.

       -v, --verbose
              Enables verbose debugging output to the terminal.

       -V, --version
              Displays version information and exits.

       -s hostname[:port], --pshost hostname[:port]
              Specifies  the  hostname(s)  of the myproxy-server(s).  Multiple
              hostnames, each hostname optionally followed by a ':'  and  port
              number, may be specified in a comma-separated list.  This option
              is required if the MYPROXY_SERVER environment  variable  is  not
              defined.  If specified, this option overrides the MYPROXY_SERVER
              environment variable. If a port number is specified with a host‐
              name,   it   will   override  the  -p  option  as  well  as  the
              MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT environment variable for that host.

       -p port, --psport port
              Specifies  the  TCP  port  number  of   the   myproxy-server(8).
              Default: 7512

       -l username, --username username
              Specifies the MyProxy account to query.  By default, the command
              uses the value of the LOGNAME environment  variable.   Use  this
              option  to  specify  a different account username on the MyProxy
              server.  The MyProxy username need not correspond to a real Unix
              username.

       -d, --dn_as_username
              Use  the  certificate  subject  (DN)  as  the  default username,
              instead of the LOGNAME environment variable.

       -k name, --credname name
              Specifies name of the credential to query.   If  not  specified,
              the command displays all credentials associated with the MyProxy
              username.

EXIT STATUS
       0 on success, >0 on error

ENVIRONMENT
       GLOBUS_GSSAPI_NAME_COMPATIBILITY
              This client will, by default, perform a  reverse-DNS  lookup  to
              determine the FQHN (Fully Qualified Host Name) to use in verify‐
              ing the identity of the server by checking the FQHN against  the
              CN   in   server's   certificate.    Setting  this  variable  to
              STRICT_RFC2818 will cause the reverse-DNS lookup to NOT be  per‐
              formed  and  the  user-specified  name to be used instead.  This
              variable setting will be ignored if MYPROXY_SERVER_DN (described
              later) is set.

       MYPROXY_SERVER
              Specifies  the  hostname(s)  where the myproxy-server(8) is run‐
              ning. Multiple hostnames can be specified in a  comma  separated
              list  with  each  hostname optionally followed by a ':' and port
              number.  This environment variable can be used in place  of  the
              -s option.

       MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT
              Specifies the port where the myproxy-server(8) is running.  This
              environment variable can be used in place of the -p option.

       MYPROXY_SERVER_DN
              Specifies the distinguished name (DN) of the  myproxy-server(8).
              All  MyProxy client programs authenticate the server's identity.
              By default, MyProxy servers run with host  credentials,  so  the
              MyProxy  client  programs  expect  the  server to have a distin‐
              guished name with "/CN=host/<fqhn>" or  "/CN=myproxy/<fqhn>"  or
              "/CN=<fqhn>"  (where  <fqhn>  is the fully-qualified hostname of
              the server).  If the server is running with some other  DN,  you
              can set this environment variable to tell the MyProxy clients to
              accept the alternative DN. Also see  GLOBUS_GSSAPI_NAME_COMPATI‐
              BILITY above.

       MYPROXY_TCP_PORT_RANGE
              Specifies  a  range  of valid port numbers in the form "min,max"
              for the client side of the network connection to the server.  By
              default,  the  client will bind to any available port.  Use this
              environment variable to restrict  the  ports  used  to  a  range
              allowed  by  your  firewall.   If unset, MyProxy will follow the
              setting of the GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE environment variable.

       X509_USER_CERT
              Specifies a non-standard location for the certificate to be used
              for authentication to the myproxy-server(8).

       X509_USER_KEY
              Specifies a non-standard location for the private key to be used
              for authentication to the myproxy-server(8).

       X509_USER_PROXY
              Specifies a non-standard location for the proxy credential to be
              used for authentication to the myproxy-server(8).

       X509_CERT_DIR
              Specifies a non-standard location for the CA certificates direc‐
              tory.
