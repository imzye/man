NAME
       Linux::FD::Timer - Timer filehandles for Linux

VERSION
       version 0.017

SYNOPSIS
        use Linux::FD::Timer;

        my $fh = Linux::FD::Timer->new('monotonic', @flags);
        $fh->set_timeout(10, 10);
        while (1) {
            #do something..
            $fh->wait; #until the 10 seconds have passed.
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This module creates and operates on a timer that delivers timer expiration notifications via a file descriptor. It provides an alternative to the use of Time::HiRes' setitimer or POSIX::RT::Timer,
       with the advantage that the file descriptor may easily be monitored by mechanisms such as select, poll, and epoll.

METHODS
   new($clockid)
       This creates a new timer object, and returns a file handle that refers to that timer. The clockid argument specifies the clock that is used to mark the progress of the timer, and must be either
       'realtime' or 'monotonic'. "realtime" is a settable system-wide clock. "monotonic" is a non-settable clock that is not affected by discontinuous changes in the system clock (e.g., manual changes
       to system time). The current value of each of these clocks can be retrieved using POSIX::RT::Clock. @flags is an optional list of flags, currently limited to 'non-blocking' (requires Linux
       2.6.27).

   get_timeout()
       Get the timeout value. In list context, it also returns the interval value. Note that this value is always relative to the current time.

   set_timeout(value, $interval = 0, $abs_time = 0)
       Set the timer and interval values. If $abstime is true, they are absolute values, otherwise they are relative to the current time. Returns the old value like "get_time" does.

   receive
       If the timer has already expired one or more times since its settings were last modified using settime(), or since the last successful wait, then receive returns an unsigned 64-bit integer
       containing the number of expirations that have occurred. If not it either returns undef or it blocks (if the handle is blocking).

   clocks
       This returns a list of all known clocks usable in a timerfd. Do note that some clocks may require superuser privileges.
