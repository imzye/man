NAME
       seqmagick - Manipulate sequence files

SYNOPSIS
       usage: seqmagick [-h] [-V] [-v] [-q]

              help, convert, info, mogrify, primer-trim, quality-filter, extract-ids, backtrans-align ...

DESCIPTION
       Seqmagick is a little utility to expose the file format conversion in BioPython in a convenient way.

OPTIONS
   positional arguments:
              help, convert, info, mogrify, primer-trim, quality-filter, extract-ids, backtrans-align

       help   Detailed help for actions using help <action>

       convert
              Convert between sequence formats

       info   Info action

       mogrify
              Modify sequence file(s) in place.

       primer-trim
              Find a primer sequence in a gapped alignment, trim to amplicon

       quality-filter
              Filter reads based on quality scores

       extract-ids
              Extract the sequence IDs from a file

       backtrans-align
              Given  a protein alignment and unaligned nucleotides, align the nucleotides using the protein alignment.  Protein and nucleotide sequence files must contain the same number of sequences, in
              the same order, with the same IDs.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -V, --version
              Print the version number and exit

       -v, --verbose
              Be more verbose. Specify -vv or -vvv for even more

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress output
