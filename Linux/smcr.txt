SMCR - COMMAND SYNTAX
   OBJECT
       device One or more SMC-R devices.

       info   Generic SMC information.

              Linkgroup(s) or link(s) used by SMC-R.

       stats  SMC-R statistics.

       The  names  of  all  objects  can  be  abbreviated down to a unique stem. For example device can be abbreviated to dev or just d.  Man pages in SEE ALSO section contain more information for individual
       objects.

   COMMAND
       Specifies the action to perform on the object.  The set of possible actions depends on the object type.  As a general rule, it is possible to  show or link-show objects, but some objects do not  allow
       all of these operations. The help command is available for all objects. It prints out a list of available commands and argument syntax conventions.

       If no command is given, a default command is assumed.

RETURN CODES
       Successful  smcr command returns 0 and displays the requested linkgroup, link or device information.  If an error occurs, smcr writes a message to stderr and completes with a return code other than 0.
       Possible error messages to stderr in case of non-zero return code:

       SMC module not loaded
              Either kernel is not supporting the smcr tool or the smc kernel module is not loaded.
