NAME
       MooseX::Role::Timer - Measure times with your object.

SYNOPSIS
        package Demo;
        use Moose; # or Any::Moose
        with 'MooseX::Role::Timer';

        sub BUILD {
          shift->start_timer("build");
        }

        sub do_something {
          my $self = shift;
          $self->start_timer("something");
          # do something...
          $self->stop_timer("something");
        }

        package main;
        my $demo = Demo->new;
        $demo->do_something;
        $demo->do_something;
        printf "%3.6fs\n", $demo->elapsed_timer("build");     # time spent since BUILD
        printf "%3.6fs\n", $demo->elapsed_timer("something"); # time spent in sub do_something

       This Role provides your object with timers, making it easier to keep track of how long whatever actions take.

       start_timer($name)
           Start timer $name.

       stop_timer($name)
           Stop timer $name. Could be started again to cumulatively measure time.

       reset_timer($name)
           Stops timer $name and clears cumulated times for $name.

       elapsed_timer('name')
           Return the elapsed time in seconds (cumulated) for timer $name.

       timer_names
           Return all timer names.
