NAME
       ReRanger - Rewrite ranged or numerical statistics into other ranges.

SYNOPSIS
       dsc-datatool --transform ";ReRanger;<dataset>;<options...>"

DESCRIPTION
       This transformer can re-range values in datasets to new rangers.

       It supports both values that are a single numerical value or one that is already a range itself (num-num).

OPTIONS
       dataset
              See dsc-datatool(1) on how to specify which dataset(s) to run the transformer on.

       key=[low|mid|high]
              Specify what value to use when re-ranging an already ranged value (low-high).

              Default to mid, which is high minus low then divided by 2.

       func=<func>
              The function to use when aggregating multiple values into a new ranger, default to sum.

              Currently only one function exists, sum, which adds the sum of all values into the new range.

       allow_invalid_keys
              If given the "invalid" keys/values that is not numerical or a range will be passed through unmodified.

       range=</num>
              The new range given as /number (required).

              For example range=/64 will re-range all values into buckets of 64, 0-63, 64-127 and so on.
