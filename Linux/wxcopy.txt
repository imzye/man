NAME
       wxcopy - copy stdin or file into X11 cutbuffer

SYNOPSIS
       wxcopy [options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       wxcopy  copies  stdin  or  filename  into the cutbuffer. If no cutbuffer is specified, the data will be copied into cutbuffer 0 and the other cutbuffers will be rotated, if present.  If a cutbuffer is
       specified, the data is copied into that cutbuffer, and no rotation of buffers is performed.

OPTIONS
       --clear-selection
              Clears the PRIMARY selection owner. In practice it means that when you try to paste the data with the middle mouse button (for example) it will paste the data from cut buffer 0, instead of  any
              eventually existing mouse selection.

       --cutbuffer number
              Specifies the number of the cutbuffer to copy data to.

       -display display-name
              The data will be copied in the cutbuffers of the specified display/screen.

       --help print a help message with the list of options.

       --no-limit
              Makes the normal 64kb limit check not to be performed, making the buffer attempt to grow to whatever size is required.

       --version
              print the version of Window Maker from which the program comes.
