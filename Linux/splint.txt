NAME
       splint - A tool for statically checking C programs

SYNOPSIS
       splint [options]

DESCRIPTION
       splint  is a tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and common programming mistakes. With minimal effort, splint can be used as a better lint. If additional effort is
       invested adding annotations to programs, splint can perform stronger checks than can be done by any standard lint.  For full documentation, install the splint-doc-html Debian  package.   This  man
       page only covers a few of the available options.

OPTIONS
       -help Shows help

       Initialization

       These  flags  control  directories  and files used by splint. They may be used from the command line or in an options file, but may not be used as control comments in the source code. Except where
       noted. they have the same meaning preceded by - or +.

       -tmpdir directory
             Set directory for writing temp files. Default is /tmp/.

       -I directory
             Add directory to path searched for C include files. Note there is no space after the I, to be consistent with C preprocessor flags.

       -S directory
             Add directory to path search for .lcl specification files.

       -f file
             Load options file <file>. If this flag is used from the command line, the default ~/.splintrc file is not loaded. This flag may be used in an options file to load in another options file.

       -nof  Prevents the default options files (./.splintrc and ~/.splintrc) from being loaded. (Setting -nof overrides +nof, causing the options files to be loaded normally.)

       -systemdirs directories
             Set directories for system files (default is "/usr/include"). Separate directories with colons (e.g., "/usr/include:/usr/local/lib"). Flag settings propagate to files in a system  directory.
             If -systemdirerrors is set, no errors are reported for files in system directories.

       Pre-processor

       These flags are used to define or undefine pre-processor constants.  The -I<directory> flag is also passed to the C pre-processor.

       -D initializer
             Passed to the C pre-processor.

       -U initializer
             Passed to the C pre-processor

       Libraries These flags control the creation and use of libraries.

       -dump file
             Save state in <file> for loading. The default extension .lcd is added if <file> has no extension.

       -load file
             Load state from <file> (created by -dump). The default extension .lcd is added if <file> has no extension. Only one library file may be loaded.

             By  default,  the  standard library is loaded if the -load flag is not used to load a user library. If no user library is loaded, one of the following flags may be used to select a different
             standard library. Precede the flag by + to load the described library (or prevent a library from being loaded using nolib). See Apppendix F for information on the provided libraries.

       -nolib
             Do not load any library. This prevents the standard library from being loaded.

       -ansi-lib
             Use the ANSI standard library (selected by default).

       -strict-lib
             Use strict version of the ANSI standard library.

       -posix-lib
             Use the POSIX standard library.

       -posix-strict-lib
             Use the strict version of the POSIX standard library.

       -1-lib
             Use UNIX version of standard library.

       -1-strict-lib
             Use the strict version of the UNIX standard library.

       Output

       These flags control what additional information is printed by splint. Setting +<flag> causes the described information to be printed; setting -<flag> prevents it. By default, all these  flags  are
       off.

       -usestderr
             Send  error messages to standard error (instead of standard out).  This flag has been replaced by more precise flags for controlling the warning, status message and fatal error streams inde‐
             pendently.  See the output of splint +usestderr

       -showsummary
             Show a summary of all errors reported and suppressed. Counts of suppressed errors are not necessarily correct since turning a flag off may prevent some checking from being done to save  com‐
             putation, and errors that are not reported may propagate differently from when they are reported.

       -showscan
             Show file names as they are processed.

       -showalluses
             Show list of uses of all external identifiers sorted by number of uses.

       -stats
             Display number of lines processed and checking time.

       -timedist
             Display distribution of where checking time is spent.

       -quiet
             Suppress  herald  and  error  count.  (If  quiet is not set, splint prints out a herald with version information before checking begins, and a line summarizing the total number of errors re‐
             ported.)

       -whichlib
             Print out the standard library filename and creation information.

       -limit number
             At most <number> similar errors are reported consecutively. Further errors are suppressed, and a message showing the number of suppressed messages is printed.

       Expected Errors

       Normally, splint will expect to report no errors. The exit status will be success (0) if no errors are reported, and failure if any errors are reported. Flags can be used to set the expected  num‐
       ber  of  reported errors.  Because of the provided error suppression mechanisms, these options should probably not be used for final checking real programs but may be useful in developing programs
       using make.

       -expect <number>
             Exactly <number> code errors are expected. splint will exit with failure exit status unless <number> code errors are detected.

       -Message Format
             These flags control how messages are printed. They may be set at the command line, in options files, or locally in syntactic comments. The linelen and limit flags may be preceded by +  or  -
             with the same meaning; for the other flags, + turns on the describe printing and - turns it off. The box to the left of each flag gives its default value.

       -showcolumn
             Show column number where error is found. Default: +

       -showfunc
             Show name of function (or macro) definition containing error. The function name is printed once before the first message detected in that function. Default: +

       -showallconjs
             Show all possible alternate types (see Section 8.2.2). Default: -

       -paren-file-format
             Use file(line) format in messages.

       -hints
             Provide hints describing an error and how a message may be suppressed for the first error reported in each error class. Default: +

       -forcehints
             Provide hints for all errors reported, even if the hint has already been displayed for the same error class. Default: -

       -linelen number
             Set length of maximum message line to <number> characters. splint will split messages longer than <number> characters long into multiple lines. Default: 80

       Mode Selector Flags

       Mode  selects  flags  set the mode checking flags to predefined values. They provide a quick coarse-grain way of controlling what classes of errors are reported. Specific checking flags may be set
       after a mode flag to override the mode settings. Mode flags may be used locally, however the mode settings will override specific command line flag settings. A warning is produced if a  mode  flag
       is used after a mode checking flag has been set.

       These  are  brief descriptions to give a general idea of what each mode does. To see the complete flag settings in each mode, use splint -help modes. A mode flag has the same effect when used with
       either + or -.

       -weak Weak checking, intended for typical unannotated C code. No modifies checking, macro checking, rep exposure, or clean interface checking is done. Return values of type int may be ignored. The
             types bool, int, char and user-defined enum types are all equivalent. Old style declarations are unreported.

       -standard
             The default mode. All checking done by weak, plus modifies checking, global alias checking, use all parameters, using released storage, ignored return values or any type, macro checking, un‐
             reachable code, infinite loops, and fall-through cases. The types bool, int and char are distinct.  Old style declarations are reported.

       -checks
             Moderately strict checking. All checking done by standard, plus must modification checking, rep exposure, return alias, memory management and complete interfaces.

       -strict
             Absurdly strict checking. All checking done by checks, plus modifications and global variables used in unspecified functions, strict standard library, and strict typing  of  C  operators.  A
             special reward will be presented to the first person to produce a real program that produces no errors with strict checking.
