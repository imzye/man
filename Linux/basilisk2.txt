NAME
       BasiliskII - a 68k Macintosh emulator

SYNOPSIS
       BasiliskII [--display display-name] [--break offset] [--rominfo]

DESCRIPTION
       Basilisk II

       is  an  Open Source 68k Macintosh emulator. That is, it enables you to run 68k MacOS software on you computer, even if you are using a different operating system. However, you still need a copy of
       MacOS and a Macintosh ROM image to use Basilisk II.

       Basilisk II :

       - Emulates either a Mac Classic (which runs MacOS 0.x thru 7.5) or a Mac II series machine (which runs MacOS 7.x, 8.0 and 8.1), depending on the ROM being used

       - Color video display

       - CD quality sound output

       - Floppy disk driver (only 1.44MB disks supported)

       - Driver for HFS partitions and hardfiles

       - CD-ROM driver with basic audio functions

       - Easy file exchange with the host OS via a "Host Directory Tree" icon on the Mac desktop

       - Ethernet driver

       - Serial drivers

       - SCSI Manager (old-style) emulation

       - Emulates extended ADB keyboard and 3-button mouse

       - Uses UAE 68k emulation or (under AmigaOS and NetBSD/m68k) real 68k processor
