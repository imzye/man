NAME
       lscss - list channel subsystem devices.

SYNOPSIS
       lscss <options> [RANGE]

DESCRIPTION
       The lscss command is used to list all or a subset of devices that are managed by the common I/O subsystem.

[RANGE]
       Limit output to a range of subchannels by specifying multiple identifiers as a comma-separated list or a range or a combination of both, e.g.

            0.0.1234-0.0.1235,4711

       Note that ranges may also be separated by spaces.

OPTIONS
       -s|--short
               Shorten IDs by removing leading "0.0.". Note: only IDs beginning with "0.0."  will be displayed in this case.

       -t|--devtype <devtype>[/<model>][,...]
               For IO subchannels, limit output to devices of the given device type (e.g. 3390).

       -d|--devrange
               Indicate that RANGE refers to device identifiers.

       --avail Show availability attribute of IO devices.

       --vpm   Show  verified path mask.  VPM is an internal path mask used by Linux. A channel path can be used by Linux device drivers to do IO if the correspond‐
               ing bit is set in the VPM. Events that can lead to a channel path not being available include:

               •   The corresponding bit is not set in at least one of the PIM, PAM, or POM masks.

               •   The channel path is varied offline.

               •   Linux received no interrupt to IO using this channel path.

       -v|--version
               Print the version of the s390-tools package and the command.

       -h|--help
               Print help text.

       -u|--uppercase
               Print values using uppercase.

       --io    Show IO subchannels. (default)

       --chsc  Show CHSC subchannels.

       --eadm  Show EADM subchannels.

       --vfio  Show additional information for I/O subchannels used for VFIO.  An MDEV is a mediated device that is required to be created by the VFIO  channel  I/O
               device driver for the VFIO driver framework as the pass-through target device when doing channel I/O pass-through.

       -a|--all
               Show subchannels of all types.

EXAMPLES
       lscss
              List all devices that are managed by the common I/O subsystem.

       lscss -t 3390
              Same as above but shows only 3390 devices.

NOTES
       In rare situations a device might temporarily not be accessible to the subchannel. Then "none" is displayed as the device identifier and the other device at‐
       tributes are empty.

       For subchannels bound to an alternate driver (most notably vfio_ccw) the device identifier may also be displayed as "none". In this case use the  --vfio  op‐
       tion to show VFIO specific subchannel information.
