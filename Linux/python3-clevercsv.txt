NAME
       clevercsv-explore - Explore the CSV file in an interactive Python shell

SYNOPSIS
       clevercsv explore [-e ENCODING | --encoding=ENCODING]
                         [-n NUM_CHARS | --num-chars=NUM_CHARS] [-p | --pandas] <path>

DESCRIPTION
       The explore command allows you to quickly explore a CSV file in an interactive Python shell. This command detects the dialect of the CSV file and drops you into a Python interactive shell (REPL),
       with the CSV file already loaded. Simply run:

           clevercsv explore FILE

       to start working with the file loaded as a list of lists. Alternatively, you can run:

           clevercsv explore -p FILE

       to read the file as a Pandas dataframe.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           show this help message and exit

       -e, --encoding
           The file encoding of the given CSV file is automatically detected using chardet. While chardet is incredibly accurate, it is not perfect. In the rare cases that it makes a mistake in detecting
           the file encoding, you can override the encoding by providing it through this flag. Moreover, when you have a number of CSV files with a known file encoding, you can use this option to speed
           up the code generation process.

       -n, --num-chars
           On large CSV files, dialect detection can sometimes be a bit slow due to the large number of possible dialects to consider. To alleviate this, you can limit the number of characters to use for
           detection.

           One aspect to keep in mind is that CleverCSV may need to read a specific number of characters to be able to correctly infer the dialect. For example, in the ``imdb.csv`` file in the GitHub
           repository, the correct dialect can only be found after at least 66 lines of the file are read. Therefore, if there is availability to run CleverCSV on the entire file, that is generally
           recommended.

       -p, --pandas
           By default, this command imports the CSV file as a list of lists. By enabling this option the script will be written such that the file will be read as a Pandas DataFrame instead.

       <path>
           Path to the CSV file
