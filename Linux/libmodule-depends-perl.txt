Module::Depends::Intrusive(3pm)                                                     User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                     Module::Depends::Intrusive(3pm)

NAME
       Module::Depends::Intrusive - intrusive discovery of distribution dependencies.

SYNOPSIS
        # Just like Module::Depends, only use the Intrusive class instead

DESCRIPTION
       This module devines dependencies by running the distributions Makefile.PL/Build.PL in a faked up environment and intercepting the calls to Module::Build->new and
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker::WriteMakefile.

       You may now freak out about security.

       While you're doing that please remember that what we're doing is much the same that CPAN.pm does in order to discover prerequisites.
