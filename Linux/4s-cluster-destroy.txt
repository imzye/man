NAME
     4s-cluster-destroy — Delete the KB from a cluster.

SYNOPSIS
     4s-cluster-destroy kb-name

FILES
     This command depends on the config file /etc/4s-cluster, see 4s-cluster(5).

EXAMPLES
     $ 4s-cluster-destroy demo

     Delete the "demo" knowledgebase. This will completely erase the data in the KB, so use with care.  4s-cluster-start(1).

CAVEATS
     If the kb is currently running then it will not be stopped, so the detached backed processes will persist past the destroy operation.  4s-cluster-info(1) can be used to check what KBs are currently run‐
