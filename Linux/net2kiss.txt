NAME
       net2kiss - convert a network AX.25 driver to a KISS stream on a pseudo-
       tty

SYNOPSIS
       net2kiss [-sfzva] [-i ifname] ptyname

DESCRIPTION
       net2kiss takes AX.25 packets from an AX.25 kernel network interface and
       converts them into a KISS data stream via a pseudo-tty.

PARAMETERS
       ptyname
              specifies  the  path  to  the pseudo-tty. If you use the special
              name "/dev/ptmx", then a Unix98-PTY pair is used; the  pty  name
              is written to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -i ifname
              specifies  the  name  of the kernel AX.25 network interface. The
              default is bc0.

       -s     tells net2kiss to search by itself for  a  free  pseudoterminal,
              open  the  master  side  and create a symlink named by -p to the
              slave side.

       -f     can be used in conjunction with -s to force the creation of  the
              symlink even if the target file does already exist. *DANGEROUS*

       -v     Verbose output. Displays error messages during operation and de‐
              coded packets to stdout.

       -z     put the network interface into promiscious mode.

       -a     receive every packet instead of only AX.25 from the kernel AX.25
              network interface.

BUGS
       None known.
