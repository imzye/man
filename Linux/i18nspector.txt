NAME
       i18nspector - checking tool for gettext POT, PO and MO files

SYNOPSIS
       i18nspector [options] file [file …]

DESCRIPTION
       i18nspector  is  a  tool  for checking translation templates (POT), message catalogues (PO) and compiled message catalogues (MO) files for common problems.  These files are used by the GNU gettext
       translation functions and tools in many different development environments.

OPTIONS
       -l lang, --language lang
              Assume this language. lang should be a 2- or 3-letter ISO 639 language code, possibly followed by underscore and a 2-letter ISO 3166 territory code.

       --unpack-deb
              Allow unpacking Debian (binary or source) packages.

       -j n, --jobs n
              Use n processes in parallel.  n can be a positive integer, or auto to determine the number automatically.  The default is to use only a single process.

       -h, --help
              Show help message and exit.

       --version
              Show version information and exit.

OUTPUT FORMAT
       The following format is used for all the reported problems:

         code: file: tag [extra]

       where:

       • code is a letter indicating type of the message: E (error), W (warning), I (informative message), or P (pedantic message);

       • tag is a name of the problem that was discovered;

       • extra can contain additional information about the problem.

TAGS
   ancient-date
       The date refers to the time before the first GNU gettext release.  As such, it's extremely unlikely to be correct.

   c-format-string-missing-arguments
       A C format string for msgid consumes fewer arguments than msgid_plural; or msgstr consumes fewer arguments than msgid; or msgstr[N]  consumes  fewer  arguments  than  corresponding  msgid  or  ms‐
       gid_plural.

       Note that in some languages, the commonly used Plural-Forms expression evaluates to the same value for n=1 and n=21, n=31, and so on.  Take this Serbian translation for example:

          Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2;
          ...
          msgid "one byte"
          msgid_plural "%d bytes"
          msgstr[0] "%d bajt"
          msgstr[1] "%d bajta"
          msgstr[2] "%d bajtova"

       Here %d should not be replaced with the spelled-out form jedan.  Either %d should be kept, or the Plural-Forms expression should be amended, so that there is a special case for n=1:

          Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=n==1 ? 3 : n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2
          ...
          msgid "one byte"
          msgid_plural "%d bytes"
          msgstr[0] "%d bajt"
          msgstr[1] "%d bajta"
          msgstr[2] "%d bajtova"
          msgstr[3] "jedan bajt"

   c-format-string-non-portable-conversion
       A C format string uses a conversion specified or length modifier, for which a more portable replacement exists:

       • For integer conversions (%d, %i, %o, %u, %x, and %X), use the ll length modifier instead of L or q.

       • For floating-point conversions (%a, %A, %e, %E, %f, %F, %g, and %G), don't use the l length modifier.

       • Use the z length modifier instead of Z.

       • Use %lc instead of %C.

       • Use %ls instead of %S.

       • If a precision is given, the 0 flag has no effect on integer conversions (%d, %i, %o, %u, %x, and %X).

   perl-brace-format-string-missing-argument
       A Perl format string for msgid doesn't use a named argument that is used in msgid_plural; or msgstr doesn't use a named argument that is used in msgid; or msgstr[N] doesn't use  a  named  argument
       that is used in corresponding msgid or msgid_plural.

       Note that in some languages, the commonly used Plural-Forms expression evaluates to the same value for n=1 and n=21, n=31, and so on.  Take this Serbian translation for example:

          Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2;

          msgid "one byte"
          msgid_plural "{n} bytes"
          msgstr[0] "{n} bajt"
          msgstr[1] "{n} bajta"
          msgstr[2] "{n} bajtova"

       Here {n} should not be replaced with the spelled-out form jedan.  Either {n} should be kept, or the Plural-Forms expression should be amended, so that there is a special case for n=1:

          Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=n==1 ? 3 : n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2
