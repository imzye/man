NAME
       wimjoin- Join a split WIM into a standalone WIM

SYNOPSIS
       wimjoin [OPTION...] OUT_WIMFILE SPLIT_WIM_PART...

DESCRIPTION
       wimjoin,  or  equivalently wimlib-imagex join, joins the SPLIT_WIM_PARTs into a standalone (one-part) WIM OUT_WIMFILE.  All parts of the split WIM must be specified; you probably want to do so using a
       shell wildcard.

OPTIONS
       --check
             When reading each SPLIT_WIM_PART, verify its integrity if it contains extra integrity information.  In addition, include extra integrity information in OUT_WIMFILE, even if the split  WIM  parts
             did not contain this information.

       --include-integrity
             Include extra integrity information in OUT_WIMFILE, i.e. like --check but don't also verify the split WIM parts beforehand.

EXAMPLES
       Join a split WIM, with the parts named `windows*.swm' where the * is anything (usually the number of the part, except for the first part which may have no number), and write the joined WIM to the file
       `windows.wim'.

              wimjoin windows.wim windows*.swm

NOTES
       Both non-pipable and pipable split WIMs may be joined.

       wimjoin is roughly equivalent to:

              wimexport SWM_PART_1 --ref="SWM_GLOB" all OUT_WIMFILE
