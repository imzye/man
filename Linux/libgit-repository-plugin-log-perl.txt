NAME
       Git::Repository::Log::Iterator - Split a git log stream into records

SYNOPSIS
           use Git::Repository::Log::Iterator;

           # use a default Git::Repository context
           my $iter = Git::Repository::Log::Iterator->new('HEAD~10..');

           # or provide an existing instance
           my $iter = Git::Repository::Log::Iterator->new( $r, 'HEAD~10..' );

           # get the next log record
           while ( my $log = $iter->next ) {
               ...;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       "Git::Repository::Log::Iterator" initiates a git log command from a list of paramaters and parses its output to produce Git::Repository::Log objects represening each log item.

METHODS
   new
           my $iter = Git::Repository::Log::Iterator->new( @args );

       Create a new git log stream from the parameter list in @args and return a iterator on it.

       "new()" will happily accept any parameters, but note that "Git::Repository::Log::Iterator" expects the output to look like that of "--pretty=raw", and so will force the the "--pretty" option (in
       case "format.pretty" is defined in the Git configuration).  It will also forcibly remove colored output (using "--color=never").

       Extra output (like patches) will be stored in the "extra" parameter of the Git::Repository::Log object. Decorations will be lost.

       When unsupported options are recognized in the parameter list, "new()" will "croak()" with a message advising to use "run( 'log' => ... )" to parse the output yourself.

       The object is really a blessed hash reference, with only two keys:

       cmd The Git::Repository::Command object running the actual git log command. It might not be defined in some cases (see below "new_from_fh" and "new_from_file").

       fh  The filehandle from which the output of git log is actually read.  This is the only attribute needed to run the "next" method.

   new_from_fh
       This constructor makes it possible to provide the filehandle directly.

       The "cmd" key is not defined when using this constructor.

   new_from_file
       This constructor makes it possible to provide a filename that will be "open()"ed to produce a filehandle to read the log stream from.

       The "cmd" key is not defined when using this constructor.

   next
           my $log = $iter->next;

       Return the next log item as a Git::Repository::Log object, or nothing if the stream has ended.
