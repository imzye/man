METHODS
   new
       Creates a new instance of Text::MeCab::Dict.

       The path to the source of mecab-ipadic is required:

         my $dict = Text::MeCab::Dict->new(
           dict_source => "/path/to/mecab-ipadic-source"
         );

       If you are in an environment where mecab-config is NOT available, you must also specify libexecdir, which is where mecab-dict-index is installed:

         my $dict = Text::MeCab::Dict->new(
           dict_source => "/path/to/mecab-ipadic-source",
           libexecdir  => "/path/to/mecab/libexec/",
         );

   add
       Adds a new entry to be appended to the dictionary. Please see SYNOPSIS for arguments.

   write
       Writes out the entries that were added via add() to the specified file location. If the file name does not look like an absolute path, the name will be treated relatively from dict_source

   rebuild
       Rebuilds the index. This usually requires that you are have root privileges
