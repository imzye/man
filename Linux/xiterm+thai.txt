NAME
       txiterm - X terminal emulator for Thai (TIS-620) environments

SYNOPSIS
       txiterm [xiterm+thai-options]

DESCRIPTION
       txiterm is a wrapper around the xiterm+thai(1) program that invokes the latter program with proper Thai environment and font setup.

       All arguments to txiterm are passed as-is to xiterm+thai with additional preset -fn option, so that you do not need to set it again.

       See the xiterm+thai manual page for more information on xiterm+thai-options.

       Note: txiterm needs nectec18 - Thai TIS-620 X font from the xfonts-thai-nectec package to allow the program to render Thai TIS-620 text properly in the terminal.
