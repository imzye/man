DESCRIPTION
       wxpyimgview is a simple wxWidgets image viewer for 32-bpp BMP images, as can be created with the PNG and cairo drivers. The display is continually refreshed.

NOTES
       The  display  driver  must  be configure to map the file, with GRASS_RENDER_FILE_MAPPED=TRUE. This ensures that the file will remain a constant size, rather than being truncated whenever it is up‐
       dated.

SEE ALSO
        PNG driver, cairo driver
