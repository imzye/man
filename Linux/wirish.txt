NAME
       irish - a list of Irish words

DESCRIPTION
       /usr/share/dict/irish is an ASCII file which contains an alphabetic list of words, one per line.

FILES
       /etc/dictionaries-common/words  is a symbolic link to a /usr/share/dict/<language> file.  /usr/share/dict/words is a symbolic link to /etc/dictionaries-common/words, and is the name by which other
       software should refer to the system word list.  See select-default-wordlist(8) for more information.

       The directory /usr/share/dict can contain word lists for many languages, with name of the language in English, e.g., /usr/share/dict/french and /usr/share/dict/danish contain respectively lists of
       French and Danish words if they exist.  Such lists should be coded using the ISO 8859-1 character set encoding.

SEE ALSO
       ispell(1), select-default-wordlist(8), and the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

HISTORY
       The words lists are not specific, and may be generated from any number of sources.

       The system word list used to be /usr/dict/words.  For compatibility, software should check that location if /usr/share/dict/words does not exist.
