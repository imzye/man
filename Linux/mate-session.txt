NAME
       mate-session - Start the MATE Desktop Environment.

SYNOPSIS
       mate-session [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The mate-session program starts up the MATE desktop environment. This command is typically executed by your Login/Display Manager (like GDM, LXDM, XDM, SLiM, or from your X startup scripts like .xini‐
       trc). It will load either your saved session, or it will provide a default session for the user as defined by the system administrator (or the default MATE installation on your system).

       The default session is defined in the dconf keys under /org/mate/desktop/session/
       When saving a session, mate-session saves the currently running applications in the ~/.config/mate-session/saved-session directory of the users /home.

       mate-session is an X11 session manager. It can manage MATE applications as well as any other X11 SM compliant ones.

OPTIONS
   The following options are supported:
       -a, --autostart=DIR
              Start all applications defined in "DIR", instead of starting the applications defined in /org/mate/desktop/session/default-session
              Multiple --autostart options can be passed.

       -f, --failsafe
              Run in fail-safe mode. User-specified applications will not be started.

       --debug
              Enable debugging code.

       --display=DISPLAY
              X display to use.

       --version
              Output version information and exit.

       -?, -h, --help
              Print standard command line options.

       --help-all
              Print all command line options.

ENVIRONMENT
   mate-session sets several environment variables for the use of its child processes:
       SESSION_MANAGER

              This variable is used by session-manager aware clients to contact mate-session.

       DISPLAY

              This variable is set to the X display being used by mate-session. Note that if the --display option is used this might be different from the setting of the environment variable  when  mate-ses‐
              sion is invoked.

FILES
       ~/.config/autostart
       /usr/share/autostart
       /usr/share/mate/autostart

              The applications defined in the above directories will be started on login. mate-session-properties(1) can be used to easily configure them.

       ~/.config/mate-session/saved-session

              This directory contains the list of applications of the saved session.
