NAME
       consoleImageViewer  - highly scale-able, high quality, image viewer for
       ANSI terminals

SYNOPSIS
       consoleImageViewer  [-h][--help][-best][-fg][-bg][-nochar][-names][-ra‐
       tio][-rect][-negChar][-negColor][-wX][-hX]  image-name(s)

       Number of hyphens nor case meter for switches.

DESCRIPTION
       Not  exactly photo-viewer, but when in terminal, and need quick preview
       of (small) image(s) then it is best of its kind

       It is strongly recommended to 'export COLUMNS LINES' to adapt correctly
       to your terminal

OPTIONS
       -h/--help
              print help and exits

       -best  overwrite everything and set best settngs

       -bestnchar
              same but sets nochar to true

       -fg    use linux ansi escape color for character

       -bg    use linux ansi escape color for background

       -nochar
              disable shadowing by characters

       -names prints out image name before drawing it

       -ratio forece to keep image ratio

       -rect  will  force  rendering assuming that console char is not square,
              but rectangle of 2w~=h

       -negChar
              invert chars

       -negColor
              invert colors

       -wX    force width to width X ignoring exported COLUMNS

       -hX    force height to height X ignoring exported LINES

EXAMPLES
       No switch is considered as -best
              consoleImageViewer <image_name(s)>

       same as
              consoleImageViewer -best <image_name(s)>

       Pretty good black and white (or any terminal default view)
              consoleImageViewer -ratio -rect  -negChar  <image_name(s)>

       Overriding default or COLUMNS/ROWS by seize of 128 (-noChar is  ignored
       because -best is used)
              consoleImageViewer -best -noChar  -w128 -h128 <image_name(s)>

EXIT STATUS
       consoleImageViewer returns zero unless itcrashes
