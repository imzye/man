NAME
       Struct::Compare - Recursive diff for perl structures.

SYNOPSIS
           use Struct::Compare;
           my $is_different = compare($ref1, $ref2);

DESCRIPTION
       Compares two values of any type and structure and returns true if they are the same. It does a deep comparison of the structures, so a hash of a hash of a whatever will be compared correctly.

       This is especially useful for writing unit tests for your modules!

PUBLIC FUNCTIONS
       •   $bool = compare($var1, $var2)

           Recursively  compares  $var1  to $var2, returning false if either structure is different than the other at any point. If both are undefined, it returns true as well, because that is considered
           equal.

BUGS/NEEDED ENHANCEMENTS
       •   blessed references

           compare currently does not deal with blessed references. I need to look into how to deal with this.
