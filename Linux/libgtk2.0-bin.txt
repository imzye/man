NAME
       gtk-options - Standard Command Line Options for GTK Programs

SYNOPSIS
       program [standard options] [specific options] arguments

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the command line options, which are common to all GTK based applications.

OPTIONS
   GTK OPTIONS
       --gtk-module=MODULE
              Load an additional Gtk module.

       --gtk-debug=FLAGS
              A colon separated list of GTK debugging flags to set.  Valid flags are objects, misc, signals, dnd, and plugsocket.  The special value all enables all flags.

       --gtk-no-debug=FLAGS
              GTK debugging flags to unset.  Use this options to override the GTK_DEBUG environment variable.

       --g-fatal-warnings
              Make all warnings fatal.

   GDK OPTIONS
       --display=DISPLAY
              Set the X display to use.  Use this option to override the DISPLAY environment variable.

       --screen=SCREEN
              X screen to use.  Use this options to override the screen part of the DISPLAY environment variable (see the DISPLAY NAMES section of the X(7x) manual page).

       --sync Make X calls synchronous.  This slows down the program considerably, but may be useful for debugging purposes.

       --no-xshm
              Do not use the X server´s XSHM shared memory extension.  This slows down the program.

       --name=NAME
              Program name as used by the window manager.

       --class=CLASS
              Program class as used by the window manager.

       --gxid_host=HOST

       --gxid_port=PORT

       --xim-preedit

       --xim-status
              Control the X input method.

       --gdk-debug=FLAGS
              A  colon-separated  list  of GDK debugging flags to set.  This only works if your GDK library was compile with debugging support.  Valid flags are events, misc, dnd, color-context, and xim.
              The special value all enables all valid flags.

       --gdk-no-debug=FLAGS
              A colon-separated list of GDK debugging flags to unset.  Use this options to override the GDK_DEBUG environment variable.

SEE ALSO
       X(7x), the GTK documentation, and the GDK documentation.

       For most GTK programs there will be additional command line options, which are specific to the program.  These will be explained in the application´s documentation.
