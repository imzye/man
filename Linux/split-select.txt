OPTIONS
       –help  Displays more information about this program.

       –target config
              Performs the Split APK selection on the given configuration.

       –generate
              Generates the logic for selecting the Split APK, in JSON format.

       –base path/to/apk
              Specifies the base APK, from which all Split APKs must be based off.

       –split path/to/apk
              Includes a Split APK in the selection process.

       Where config is an extended AAPT resource qualifier of the form “resource-qualifiers:extended-qualifiers”, where “resource-qualifiers” is an AAPT resource qualifier (ex: en-rUS-sw600dp-xhdpi), and
       `extended-qualifiers' is an ordered list of one qualifier (or none) from each category:

       Generates  the  logic  for selecting a Split APK given some target Android device configuration.  Using the flag –generate will emit a JSON encoded tree of rules that must be satisfied in order to
       install the given Split APK.  Using the flag –target along with the device configuration will emit the set of Split APKs to install, following the same logic that would have been emitted via JSON.
