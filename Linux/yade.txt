NAME
       Using - manual page for Using python version: 3.13.6 (main, Aug  7 2025, 10:53:54) [GCC 14.2.0]

DESCRIPTION
       Using python version: 3.13.6 (main, Aug  7 2025, 10:53:54) [GCC 14.2.0] usage: yade-double-batch [options] [ TABLE [SIMULATION.py] | SIMULATION.py[/nCores] [...] ]

       yade-double-batch runs yade simulation multiple times with different parameters. See https://yade-dem.org/sphinx/user.html#batch-queuing-andexecution-yade-batch for details. Batch can be specified
       either  with  parameter  table TABLE (must not end in .py), which is either followed by exactly one SIMULATION.py (must end in .py), or contains !SCRIPT column specifying the simulation to be run.
       The second option is to specify multiple scripts, which can optionally have /nCores suffix to specify number of cores for that particular simulation (corresponds to !THREADS column in the  parame‐
       ter table), e.g. sim.py/3.

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -j, --jobs NUM
              Maximum number of simultaneous threads to run (default: number of cores, further limited by OMP_NUM_THREADS if set by the environment: 6)

       -v, --version
              Print version and exit.

       --job-threads NUM
              Default number of threads for one job; can be overridden by per-job with !THREADS (or !OMP_NUM_THREADS) column. Defaults to 1.

       --force-threads
              Force jobs to not use more cores than the maximum (see \-j), even if !THREADS colums specifies more.

       --log FORMAT
              Format of job log files: must contain a $, % or @, which will be replaced by script name, line number or by description column respectively (default: $.@.log)

       --global-log FILE
              Filename where to redirect output of yade-batch itself (as opposed to \-\-log); if not specified (default), stdout/stderr are used

       -l, --lines LIST
              Lines of TABLE to use, in the format 2,3-5,8,11-13 (default: all available lines in TABLE)

       --nice NICE
              Nice value of spawned jobs (default: 10)

       --cpu-affinity
              Bind  each  job to specific CPU cores; cores are assigned in a quasi-random order, depending on availability at the moment the jobs is started. Each job can override this setting by setting
              AFFINE column.

       --executable FILE
              Name of the program to run (default: /build/reproduciblepath/yade-2025.2.0/debian/tmp/usr/bin/yade-double).  Jobs can override with !EXEC column.

       --gnuplot FILE
              Gnuplot file where gnuplot from all jobs should be put together

       --dry-run
              Do not actually run (useful for getting gnuplot only, for instance)

       --http-wait
              Do not quit if still serving overview over http repeatedly

       --plot-update TIME
              Interval (in seconds) at which job plots will be updated even if not requested via HTTP. Non-positive values will make the plots not being updated and saved unless requested via  HTTP  (see
              \-\-plot-timeout for controlling maximum age of those). Plots are saved at exit under the same name as the log file, with the .log extension removed. (default: 120 seconds)

       --plot-timeout TIME
              Maximum age (in seconds) of plots served over HTTP; they will be updated if they are older. (default: 30 seconds)

       --refresh TIME
              Refresh rate of automatically reloaded web pages (summary, logs, ...).

       --timing COUNT
              Repeat each job COUNT times, and output a simple table with average/variance/minimum/maximum job duration; used for measuring how various parameters affect execution time. Jobs can override
              the global value with the !COUNT column.

       --timing-output FILE
              With \-\-timing, save measured durations to FILE, instead of writing to standard output.

       --randomize
              Randomize job order (within constraints given by assigned cores).

       --disable-pynotify
              Disable screen notifications

       -L, --libs IMPLIBRARIES
              import  libraries  at startup before importing yade libs. May be used when the ordering of imports matter (see e.g. https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/1183402 /comments/3). The option can
              be used multiple times, as in "yade -Llib1 -Llib2"
