NAME
     mkrc — bless files into a dotfile managed by rcm

SYNOPSIS
     mkrc [-ChoqSsVvUu] [-t tag] [-d dir] [-B hostname] files ...

DESCRIPTION
     This program adds files to your dotfiles directory then installs it back into your home directory. It can install files under a tag or different source directory.  It supports these options:

     -B HOSTNAME
             use the supplied hostname instead of computing one. Implies -o.

     -C      copy instead of symlinking when installing the rc file back into your home directory

     -d DIR  install dotfiles under the specified directory. This can be specified multiple times.

     -h      show usage instructions.

     -o      install dotfiles into the host-specific directory

     -q      decrease verbosity

     -S      treat the specified rc files as files to be symlinked, even if they are directories

     -s      if the rc file is a file, symlink it; otherwise, make a directory structure as described in rcup(1) in the section ALGORITHM.  This is the default.

     -t TAG  install dotfiles according to tag

     -U      the specified files or directories are to be installed without a leading dot.

     -u      the specified files or directories are to be installed with a leading dot. This is the default.

     -v      increase verbosity. This can be repeated for extra verbosity.

     -V      show the version number.
