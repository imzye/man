NAME
       InfluxDB::HTTP - The Perl way to interact with InfluxDB!

VERSION
       Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
       InfluxDB::HTTP allows you to interact with the InfluxDB HTTP API. The module essentially provides one method per InfluxDB HTTP API endpoint, that is "ping", "write" and "query".

           use InfluxDB::HTTP;

           my $influx = InfluxDB::HTTP->new();

           my $ping_result = $influx->ping();
           print "$ping_result\n";

           my $query = $influx->query(
               [ 'SELECT Lookups FROM _internal.monitor.runtime WHERE time > '.(time - 60)*1000000000, 'SHOW DATABASES'],
               epoch => 's',
           );

           print "$query\n";

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   RETURN VALUES AND ERROR HANDLING
       "Object::Result" is relied upon for returning data from subroutines. The respective result object can always be used as string and evaluated on a boolean basis. A result object evaluating to false
       indicates an error and a corresponding error message is provided in the attribute "error":

           my $ping = $influx->ping();
           print $ping->error unless ($ping);

       Furthermore, all result objects provide access to the "HTTP::Response" object that is returned by InfluxDB in the attribute "raw".

   new host => 'localhost', port => 8086, timeout => 600
       Passing "host", "port" and/or "timeout" is optional, defaulting to the InfluxDB defaults or to 3 minutes for the timeout. The timeout is in seconds.

       Returns an instance of InfluxDB::HTTP.

   ping
       Pings the InfluxDB instance configured in the constructor (i.e. by "host" and "port").

       Returned object evaluates to true or false depending on whether the ping was successful or not.  If true, then it contains a "version" attribute that indicates the InfluxDB version running on the
       pinged server.

       The "version" attribute is extracted from the "X-Influxdb-Version" HTTP response header, which is part of the HTTP response from the pinged InfluxDB instance.

           my $ping = $influx->ping();
           print $ping->version if ($ping);

   query query, database => "DATABASE", chunk_size => CHUNK_SIZE, epoch => "ns"
       Used to query the InfluxDB instance. All parameters but the first one are optional. The "query" parameter can either be a String or a Perl ArrayRef of Strings, where every String contains a valid
       InfluxDB query.

       If the returned object evaluates to true, indicating that the query was successful, then the returned object's "data" attribute contains the entire response from InfluxDB as Perl hash.
       Additionally the attribute "request_id" provides the request identifier as set in the HTTP reponse headers by InfluxDB. This can for example be useful for correlating requests with log files.

   write measurement, database => "DATABASE", precision => "ns", retention_policy => "RP"
       Writes data into InfluxDB. The parameter "measurement" can either be a String or an ArrayRef of Strings, where each String contains one valid InfluxDB LineProtocol statement. All of those
       mesaurements are then sent to InfluxDB and the specified database. The returned object evaluates to true if the write was successful, and otherwise to false.

       The optional argument precision can be given if a precsion different than "ns" is used in the line protocol. InfluxDB docs suggest that using a coarser precision than ns can save space and
       processing. In many cases "s" or "m" might do.

       The optional argument retention_policy can be used to specify a retention policy other than the default retention policy of the selected database.

   get_lwp_useragent
       Returns the internally used LWP::UserAgent instance for possible modifications (e.g. to configure an HTTP proxy).
