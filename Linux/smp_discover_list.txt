NAME
       smp_discover_list - invoke DISCOVER LIST SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_discover_list  [--adn] [--brief] [--cap] [--descriptor=TY] [--dsn] [--filter=FI] [--help] [--hex] [--ignore] [--interface=PARAMS] [--num=NUM] [--one] [--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--summary]
       [--verbose] [--version] [--zpi=FN] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends one or more SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) DISCOVER LIST function requests to an SMP target and decodes or outputs the responses. The SMP target is identified by  the  SMP_DEVICE  and  the
       SAS_ADDR.  Depending on the interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE.  The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differen‐
       tiate between HBAs if there are multiple present.

       If the --phy=ID option is not given then --summary is assumed. When --summary is given or assumed, this utility shows the disposition of each active expander phy in table form. One row  is  shown  for
       each  phy  and is described in the SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT section below. For this purpose disabled expander phys and those with errors are considered "active" and can be suppressed from the output
       by adding the --brief option.

       The DISCOVER LIST response may contain up to 8 descriptors when the "descriptor type" field in the request is set to 0 (e.g. --descriptor=0). The DISCOVER LIST response may contain up to  40  descrip‐
       tors when the "descriptor type" field in the request is set to 1 (e.g. --descriptor=1). Multiple DISCOVER LIST requests will be made if more descriptors are requested (e.g. --summary requests 254) and
       the previous response indicates that more descriptors may be available.

       Rather than supply options and SMP_DEVICE[,N] on every invocation some can be supplied via environment variables. See the section on ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -A, --adn
              causes the "attached device name" field to be output when the --one or --summary option is also given. See the section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT. Note the "attached device name" field
              is not available in the short format (e.g. --descriptor=1).

       -b, --brief
              reduce the decoded response output.

       -c, --cap
              decode  and print phy capabilities bits fields (see SNW-3 in draft). Each expander phy has three of these fields: programmed, current and attached.  By default these fields are only printed out
              in hex, or not at all if the --brief option is given or implied. Of the three the attached phy capability field is probably the most interesting. If the --verbose option is given, then the var‐
              ious "G" identifiers are expanded (e.g. instead of "G4:" it prints "G4 (12 Gbps):").

       -d, --descriptor=TY
              set the "descriptor type" field in the request. When TY is 0 then the 120 byte response defined by the DISCOVER function response (less its CRC field) is placed in the descriptors of this func‐
              tion's response. When TY is 1 the short format (i.e. 24 byte per descriptor) information is placed in the descriptors of this function's response.

       -D, --dsn
              outputs the device slot number at the end of each summary line. In summary mode one line is output per expander phy. It is output in the form "dsn=<val>" where <val> is  decimal  in  the  range
              from  0  to  254  inclusive.   It is not output if it is not available or has the value 255. The device slot number is not available in short format, so with this option in summary mode, if the
              --descriptor=1 is not given, then the longer format is chosen. An expander typically contains a SES device which yields device slot numbers in its Additional Element Status diagnostic page.

       -f, --filter=FI
              set the filter field in the request. When FI is 0 (default) fetch descriptors for all phys. When FI is 1 only fetch descriptors for phys attached to (other) expanders. When FI is 2  only  fetch
              descriptors for phys attached to expanders, SAS or SATA devices. When FI is 1 or 2, expander phys that would yield "phy vacant" (indicating they are hidden by zoning) are filtered out.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -i, --ignore
              sets the Ignore Zone Group bit in the SMP Discover list request.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -n, --num=NUM
              maximum  number of descriptors fetch. If any descriptors are in the response the first phy id will be greater than or equal to the argument of --phy=ID. Note that maximum SMP frame size is 1032
              bytes (including a trailing 4 byte CRC) which may limit the number of descriptors that can be fetched by a single DISCOVER LIST function (especially when '--descriptor=0').

       -o, --one
              use one line (summarized) format for each descriptor in the response.  The default action when this option is not given is to output multiple indented lines for each descriptor in the response.
              See the section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT.

       -p, --phy=ID
              phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and 254.  This is the starting (lowest numbered) phy id to fetch in the response.  Note that due to the filter field setting, the first phy id in the re‐
              sponse may be greater than the argument to this option.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the target's SAS address within it.  The  SAS_ADDR  is  in
              decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -S, --summary
              output  a multi line summary, with one line per active phy. Checks up to 254 phys starting at phy identifier ID (which defaults to 0).  Equivalent to '-o -d 1 -n 254 -b' unless the --adn option
              was also given, in which case it is equivalent to '-o -d 0 -n 254 -b' . See the section below on SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

       -Z, --zpi=FN
              FN is a file that will be created or truncated then have zone phy information written to it in a format suitable  for  input  to  the  smp_conf_zone_phy_info  utility's  --pconf=FN  option.  If
              --num=NUM is not given it is set to 254. The output will start from phy_id 0 unless --phy=ID is given.

SINGLE LINE PER PHY FORMAT
       The --summary (or --one) option causes SMP DISCOVER LIST descriptors to be compressed to one line per phy. To save space SAS addresses are shown in hex without a '0x' prefix or 'h' suffix.  The header
       section outputs information found in the DISCOVER LIST response's header section.

       For each descriptor in the DISCOVER LIST response, one line is output starting with "  phy  <n>:" where <n> is the phy identifier (and they are origin zero). That is followed by the routing  attribute
       represented by a single letter which is either "D" for direct routing, "S" for subtractive routing, "T" or "U". Both "T" and "U" imply table routing, the difference is that if REPORT GENERAL indicates
       "table to table supported" then "U" is output to indicate that phy can be part of an enclosure universal port; otherwise "T" is used. Next comes the negotiated physical link rate which is either "dis‐
       abled", "reset problem" or "spinup hold". Other states are mapped to "attached". This includes enabled phys with nothing connected which appear as "attached:[0000000000000000:00]".

       Information  shown  between the brackets is for the attached device. Phys that are connected display something like: "attached:[5000c50000520a2a:01 " where the first number is the attached SAS address
       (in hex) and the second number is the attached device's phy identifier. If the attached device type is other than an SAS or SATA device then one of these abbreviations is output: "exp" (for expander),
       "fex"  (for  fanout  expander)  or  "res" (for unknown attached device type). If a phy is flagged as "virtual" then the letter "V" appears next. Next are the protocols supported by the attached device
       which are shown as "i(<list>)" for initiator protocols and/or "t(<list>)" for target protocols. The <list> is made up of "PORT_SEL", "SSP", "STP", "SMP" and "SATA" with "+" used as a  separator.   For
       example a SAS host adapter will most likely appear as: "i(SSP+STP+SMP)".  This completes the information about the attached phy, hence the closing right bracket.

       If  appropriate,  the negotiated physical link rate is shown in gigabits per second. Here is an example of a line for expander phy identifier 11 connected to a SATA target (or SATA "device" to use the
       t13.org term):

         phy  11:T:attached:[500605b000000afb:00  t(SATA)]  1.5 Gbps

       If the expander has zoning enabled (i.e. REPORT GENERAL response bit for 'zoning enabled' is set) and a phy's zone group is other than zg 1 then the phy's zone group is shown (e.g. "ZG:2").

       If the --adn option is given then after the attached SAS address and the attached device's phy identifier are output an extra field is inserted containing the "attached device name" field. For  a  SAS
       disk  this  should be its target device name (in NAA-5 format) and for a SATA disk its WWN (if provided, also in NAA-5 format). Also when the --adn option is given the phy speed and zone group are not
       output in order to keep the line length reasonable.

       If the --dsn option is given and device slot number information is available for the current phy, then "dsn=<num>" is appended to the line.  Device slot numbers range from 0 to 254  with  255  meaning
       there is no corresponding slot so it is not listed.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       If SMP_DEVICE[,N] is not given then the SMP_UTILS_DEVICE environment variable is checked and if present its contents are used instead.

       If  the SAS address (of the SMP target) is not given and it is required (i.e.  it is not implicit in SMP_DEVICE[,N]) then the SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR environment variable is checked and if present its con‐
       tents are used as the SAS address. SAS addresses are usually given in hex indicated by a leading '0x' or trailing 'h'.

       A device slot number (dsn) is important for establishing the relationship between an expander phy and a SES array element. Newer expanders (e.g. SAS-3) support dsn_s  in  the  DISCOVER  (and  DISCOVER
       LIST)  functions.  These can be shown, if available, with the --dsn option to smp_discover and smp_discover_list utilities.. To ease typing that option often, the SMP_UTILS_DSN environment variableri‐
       able, if present, has the same effect.

NOTES
       In SAS-2 and later both the DISCOVER and DISCOVER LIST functions are available. The DISCOVER LIST function should be favoured for several reasons: its response can hold up to 40 descriptors  each  de‐
       scribing the state of one expander phy. The vast majority of expander chips on the market support 36 phys or less so one DISCOVER LIST response will summarize the states of all its phys. With the DIS‐
       COVER function only one expander phy's state is returned in its response. Other advantages of the DISCOVER LIST function are its "phy filter" and "descriptor type" function request fields.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP DISCOVER LIST function was introduced in SAS-2 . After SAS-2 the protocol sections of SAS were split into another document series known as the SAS Protocol Layer (SPL) and it was  standardized
       as  SPL ANSI INCITS 476-2011. Next came SPL-2 which was standardized as SPL-2 ANSI INCITS 505-2013.  Then came SPL-3 which was standardized as SPL-3 ANSI INCITS 492-2015. SPL-4 is near standardization
       and its most recent draft is spl4r13.pdf while SPL-5 work has started and its most recent draft is spl5r03.pdf.
