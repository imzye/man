NAME
       claws-mail-spam-report - report spam messages to various sites

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-spam-report package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-spam-report is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin allows sending reports about received spam messages to online spam harvesters, in order to improve the shared databases of known spam.

       Support includes two Internet sites: signal-spam.fr¹ and spamcop.net², and also the Debian lists spam nomination system³.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...” dialog, click on the “Load plugin...” button and select the plugin file, named spam_report.so, and press the
       “Open” button.
