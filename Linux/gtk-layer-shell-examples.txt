NAME
       gtk-layer-demo - Demonstrate the functionality of the Layer Shell Wayland protocol

SYNOPSIS
       gtk-layer-demo [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       GTK  Layer  Shell is a library to write GTK applications that use Layer Shell. Layer Shell is a Wayland protocol for desktop shell components, such as panels, notifications and wallpapers. You can
       use it to anchor your windows to a corner or edge of the output, or stretch them across the entire output. This library only makes sense on Wayland compositors that support Layer Shell,  and  will
       not work on X11. It supports all Layer Shell features including popups and popovers (GTK popups Just Work™).

       gtk-layer-demo is a GTK application for demonstrating the functionality of the Layer Shell Wayland protocol as addressed by the GTK Layer Shell library.
