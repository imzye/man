NAME
       R - a language for data analysis and graphics

SYNOPSIS
       R [options] [< infile] [> outfile]
       R CMD command [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       Start R, a system for statistical computation and graphics, with the specified options, or invoke an R tool via the 'R CMD' interface.

       R is a language which bears a passing resemblance to the S language developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories.  It provides support for a variety of statistical and graphical analyses.  R is a true computer
       language which contains a number of control-flow constructions for iteration and alternation.  It allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions.

       On systems which have the GNU readline(3) library, R will maintain a command history, so that commands can be recalled, edited and re-executed.

OPTIONS
       Most options control what happens at the beginning and at the end of an R session, in particular which files are being read and written, and how much memory is reserved for the R process.
