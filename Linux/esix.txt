NAME
       esix - script to copy and run ESI-X

SYNOPSIS
       esix

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the esix command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       The  esix  script prepares an ESI-X system in the directory it is run in, and then executes it using the SIMH pdp8 emulator.  If the binary file or simh config file are not present, it copies them
       from /usr/share/esix into the current directory.  Then it starts the pdp8 emulator using the esix config file.
