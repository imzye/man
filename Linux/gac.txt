GAC(1)                           User Commands                          GAC(1)

NAME
       gac - Compile GAP input files

SYNOPSIS
       gac [-d] [-c|-C] [-o <output>] {-f<option>} <input> ...

DESCRIPTION
       GAC  compiles  GAP  input  files, which must be GAP source code (suffix
       '.g' or ´.gap'), C source code (suffix '.c'), or  compiled  code  files
       (suffix '.o').

OPTIONS
       If  neither  -c nor -C is given, then gac compiles the code completely,
       producing a new kernel for static compilation or a dynamically loadable
       '.so' file for dynamic compilation.

       -d, --dynamic
              Compile for dynamic loading.

       -c, --compile
              Only compile the input files to '.o' object files, which must be
              further linked to make a static kernel or  dynamically  loadable
              module.

       -C, --create-c
              Only  compile the input files to C code, which will require com‐
              pilation and linking to be usable.

       -r     Statically compiled files are assumed to be given  by  pathnames
              relative  to  the  GAP  root, and will be compiled for automatic
              loading when files are sought relative to the GAP root.

       -o, --output <output>
              Set the name of the output file.

       -ffast-int-arith
              Emit code for arithmetic operations which works faster  if  both
              operands are small integers, and slower otherwise.

       -ffast-plain-lists
              Emit  code  for  list access which works faster if the list is a
              plain list, and slower otherwise.

       -ffast-list-funcs
              Inline the list functions 'Add' and 'Length', for a small  speed
              boost.

       -fno-check-types
              Emit  no  error checks for element types, which improves perfor‐
              mance but may result in a crash if an error happens.

       -fno-check-list-elms
              Emit no error checks for list access, which improves performance
              but may result in a crash if an error happens.

       -p <option>
              Pass the given option to the C compiler.

       -P <option>
              Pass the given option to the C linker.

       -k, --gap-compiler <path>
              Use  the  given  path to find the GAP binary, instead of the de‐
              fault.

       -i, --gap-include <path>
              Use the given path to find the GAP header files, instead of  the
              default.

       -l, --gap-binary <path>
              Use  the given path to find the GAP binary directory, instead of
              the default.
