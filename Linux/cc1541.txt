NAME
       cc1541 - A tool for creating Commodore floppy disk images in D64, D71 or D81 format

SYNOPSIS
       cc1541 [options] image.[d64|d71|d81]

OPTIONS
   Disk Related
       -n diskname
           Disk name, default=cc1541.

       -i id
           Disk ID, default=00 2a.

       -4
           Use tracks 35-40 with SPEED DOS BAM formatting.

       -5
           Use tracks 35-40 with DOLPHIN DOS BAM formatting.

       -d track
           Maintain a shadow directory (copy of the actual directory without a valid BAM).

       -g filename
           Write additional g64 output file with given name.

       -H message
           Hidden BAM message. Only for D64 (up to 85 chars) or SPEED DOS (up to 20 chars).

       -p t,s,o,file
           Write binary patch from file to track t, sector s, offset o.

       -V
           Do not modify image unless it is in valid CBM DOS format.

   File Related
       -w localname
           Write local file to disk, if filename is not set then the local name is used. After file written, the filename is unset.

       -f filename
           Use filename as name when writing next file, use prefix # to include arbitrary PETSCII characters (e.g. -f "start#a0,8,1").

       -T filetype
           Filetype for next file, allowed parameters are PRG, SEQ, USR, REL and DEL, or a decimal number between 0 and 255. Default is PRG.

       -P
           Set write protect flag for next file.

       -O
           Set open flag for next file.

       -B numblocks
           Write the given value as file size in blocks to the directory for the next file. Not applicable for Transwarp files.

       -L
           Add dir entry without writing file (track and sector will be 0), requires a filename given with -f.

       -l filename
           Write loop file (an additional dir entry) to existing file to disk. Wildcards * and ? are supported. Set filename with -f.

       -N
           Force creation of a new directory entry, even if a file with the same name exists already.

       -o
           Do not overwrite if file with same name exists already.

       -X filename
           Extract file from disk image. Wildcards * and ? are supported.

   Track/Sector Control
       -S value
           Default sector interleave, default=10. Not applicable for D81.

       -s value
           Next file sector interleave, valid after each file. The interleave value falls back to the default value set by -S after the first sector of the next file. Not applicable for D81 or Transwarp
           files.

       -e
           Start next file on an empty track (default start sector is current sector plus interleave).

       -E
           Try to fit file on a single track.

       -r track
           Restrict next file blocks to the specified track or higher.

       -b sector
           Set next file beginning sector to the specified value. Not applicable for D81 or Transwarp files.

       -F value
           Next file first sector on a new track (default=0). Any negative value assumes aligned tracks and uses current sector + interleave - value. After each file, the value falls back to the default.
           Not applicable for D81.

       -t
           Use directory track to also store files (makes -x useless) (default no).

       -u numblocks
           When using -t, amount of dir blocks to leave free (default=2).

       -x
           Don’t split files over directory track hole (default split files).

       -c
           Save next file cluster-optimized (d71 only).

   Fastloader Specific
       -M numchars
           Hash computation maximum filename length, this must match loader option FILENAME_MAXLENGTH in Krill’s loader. Default is 16.

       -m
           Ignore filename hash collisions, without this switch a collision results in an error.

       -W localname
           Like -w, but encode file in Transwarp format. Provide Transwarp bootfile as last file using "-f transwarp vX.YZ -w transwarp vX.YZ.prg"

       -A value
           Select allocation strategy for Transwarp files (default 1). 0: allocate in the order given on the commandline. 1: save disk space by reordering transwarp files.

       -K key
           Set an encryption key for Transwarp files, a string of up to 29 characters.

   Miscellaneous
       -h
           Print this command line help.

       -v
           Be verbose.

       -q
           Be quiet.

       -U mapping
           Print PETSCII as Unicode (requires Unicode 13.0 font, e.g. UNSCII). Use mapping 0 for ASCII output, 1 for upper case, 2 for lower case, default is 0.

       -R level
           Try to restore deleted and formatted files. level 0: Only restore dir entries without touching any t/s links. level 1: Fix dir entries for files with valid t/s chains. level 2: Also add wild
           sector chains with valid t/s chains. level 3: Also fix dir entries with invalid t/s chains. level 4: Also add and fix wild invalid t/s chains. level 5: Also add reasonable wild single blocks.

       -a
           Print command line options that would create the same directory as the one in the given image (for directory art import).

EXIT STATUS
       0
           Success.

       -1
           Failure.
