NAME
       UGENE - integrated bioinformatics suite

SYNOPSIS
       ugene -ui

       ugene [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       UGENE is a cross-platform environment for DNA and protein sequence analysis. UGENE integrates the most popular bioinformatics computational algorithms and provides both GUI and command line inter‐
       face for performing complex analysis of the genomic data.

       The main features of UGENE:

       *      View and analysis of annotated DNA or protein sequences

       *      Chromatograms visualization and editing

       *      Integrated 3D viewer for files in PDB and MMDB formats

       *      Integrated support of search requests to NCBI databases

       *      Multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE3, MUSCLE4 and KAlign

       *      HMM profiles build and search, based on the source of HMMER2 and HMMER3

       *      Modern protein secondary structure prediction algorithms based on GORIV and PsiPred

       *      Phylogenetic analysis with Phylip

       *      PCR Primers design using Primer3 package

       *      Cloning in silico

       *      Search for transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences using SITECON

       *      Search for restriction enzymes and integration with REBASE

       *      Search for direct and invert repeats

       *      DNA reference assembly using Bowtie

       *      Protein back translation

       *      Search for ORFs

       *      Designer for complex computational workflows and queries

       UGENE  has  modular  structure  and almost all its functionality comes within plugins. Internally UGENE is designed with support of parallelism to make profit from using multicore computers. Every
       computational task in UGENE is performed in background and does not block user interaction with graphical interface.
