NAME
       hut - A CLI tool for sr.ht

SYNOPSIS
       hut [commands...] [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       hut is a CLI companion utility to interact with sr.ht.

       Resources  (such  as build jobs, todo tickets, lists patchsets, git repositories, and so on) can be specified in multiple forms: name, owner and name, or full URL. For instance, the repository hut
       owned by ~emersion on git.sr.ht can be referred to via:

       •   "hut"
       •   "~emersion/hut"
       •   "https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/hut"

       Additionally, mailing lists can be referred to by their email address.

       hut commands that read input, like hut graphql or hut builds user-webhook create read input depending on whether their stdin is on a terminal or not:

       •   If stdin is not on a terminal, for example, because stdin is redirected from a file or from a pipe, hut reads input from stdin.

       •   Otherwise, if option --stdin is specified to the command, hut reads input from stdin.

       •   Otherwise, hut assumes to run in a terminal and starts the command provided by environment variable $EDITOR to read input.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Show help message and quit. Can be used after a command to get more information it.

       --config

           Prints the command's underlying GraphQL request to stderr.

       graphql <service>
           Write a GraphQL query and execute it. The JSON response is written to stdout. service is the sr.ht service to execute the query on (for instance "meta" or "builds").

           A tool like jq(1) can be used to prettify the output and process the data. Example:

               hut graphql meta <<EOF | jq '.me'
               query {
                    me { canonicalName }

CONFIGURATION
       Generate a new OAuth2 access token on meta.sr.ht.

       On startup hut will look for a file at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hut/config. If unset, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config/.

           instance "sr.ht" {
                access-token "<token>"
                # As an alternative you can specify a command whose first line of output
                # will be parsed as the token
                access-token-cmd pass token
                meta {
                     # You can set the origin for each service. As fallback hut will
                     # construct the origin from the instance name and the service.
                     origin "https://meta.sr.ht"
                }
           }

Project configuration file
       The project configuration file is a top-level file called .hut.scfg in a repository, where the assosciated tracker and development mailing list can be specified. These resources will be used when‐
       ever a command is called which needs a tracker/mailing list and none is explicitly set. Furthermore it is possible to configure that patches should contain the repository name in their prefix. The
       hut git clone command will configure a freshly cloned repository to make contributing easier.
