NAME
       Lingua::GA::Gramadoir - Check the grammar of Irish language text

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::GA::Gramadoir;

         my $gr = new Lingua::GA::Gramadoir;

         my $errors = $gr->grammatical_errors( $text );
         foreach my $error (@$errors) {
               # process $error appropriately
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains the code for segmentation, spell checking, part-of-speech tagging, and grammar checking used by "An Gramadóir", an open-source grammar and style checker that can be used with
       vim, emacs, OpenOffice, or through a command-line interface.  An Gramadóir is intended as a platform for the development of sophisticated natural language processing tools for languages with
       limited computational resources.

       The Perl code contained in this module is generated automatically from a higher-level representation of the grammatical rules and should not be edited directly.  Anyone interested in helping
       improve the lexicon or the rule sets should download the developers' pack from the An Gramadóir web site: <http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/>.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new %PARAMS
           Constructs  an  instance  of the grammar checker and loads the lexicon into memory.  It should only be called once.   Options may be specified by passing a hash containing any of the following
           keys:

           fix_spelling => 0

           Suggest replacements for misspelled or unknown words.

           use_ignore_file => 0

           Read a file containing words to be ignored when checking spelling and grammar.

           unigram_tagging => 1

           Resolve ambiguous part of speech according to frequency.  This should be set to false only for debugging purposes because the  pattern  matching  for  grammatical  errors  relies  on  complete
           disambiguation.

           interface_language => ""

           Specify  the  language  of output messages (not necessarily the language of the text to be checked).  With the default value, Locale::Maketext attempts to determine the correct language to use
           based on things like your environment variables.

           input_encoding => 'ISO-8859-1'

           Specify the encoding for all texts passed to one of the module's exported functions.   There is no currently no way to change the encoding of  the  data  returned  by  the  exported  functions
           (always encoded as perl strings).

METHODS
       get_sentences TEXT
           Splits the input TEXT up into sentences and returns a reference to an array containing the sentences.

       tokenize TEXT
           Splits the input TEXT up into orthographic words and returns a reference to an array containing the words.

       spell_check TEXT
           Returns a reference to an array containing the misspelled words appearing in the input text.

       all_possible_tags WORD
           Takes the input WORD and returns it with (XML-style) markup indicating all of its possible parts of speech.

       add_tags TEXT
           Takes the input TEXT and returns a reference to an array of sentences with (XML-style) *disambiguated* part-of-speech tags.  Does not do any grammatical rule checking.

       xml_stream TEXT
           Takes  the  input  TEXT  and  returns it as well-formed XML (encoded as perl strings, not utf-8) with full grammatical markup.   Error messages are not localized.  This function should only be
           exported for debugging/development purposes.  Use "grammatical_errors" (which is basically "xml_stream" plus some whittling down) as an interface with other programs.

       grammatical_errors TEXT
           Returns the grammatical errors in the input TEXT as a reference to an array, one error per element of the array, with each error given in a simple XML  format  usable  by  other  applications.
           Error messages are localized according to locale settings as determined by Locale::Maketext.

BUGS
       The  grammar  checker  does  not attempt a full parse of the input sentences nor does it attempt to exploit any semantic information.  There are, therefore, certain constructs that cannot be dealt
       with correctly. See <http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/bugs.html> for a detailed discussion and specific examples.
