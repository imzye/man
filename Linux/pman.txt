NAME
       pman - show a module's man page

DESCRIPTION
       Send a module's pod through pod2text and your pager.

       This is mostly here for people too lazy to type

           $ pod2text `pmpath CGI` | $PAGER

EXAMPLES
           $ pman CGI
           $ pman Curses

       Or running under different versions of Perl:

           $ oldperl -S pman CGI
           $ filsperl -S pman Threads
