NAME
       9mount, 9bind, 9umount - mount/unmount 9p filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       9mount [ insuvx ] [ -a SPEC ] [ -c CACHE ] [ -d DEBUG ] [ -m MSIZE ] DIAL MOUNTPT

       9bind OLD NEW

       9umount MOUNTPT

DESCRIPTION
       9mount mounts a 9p filesystem served at DIAL on MOUNTPT. MOUNTPT must be writable by you and not sticky. DIAL is a dial string assuming one of the forms:

       unix!SOCKET
       tcp!HOST[!PORT]
       virtio!CHANNEL
       -

       where  SOCKET is the name of a file representing a socket, HOST is a hostname, PORT is a port number or service name, and CHANNEL is a virtio channel name (currently ignored). - indicates that 9p mes‐
       sages should be read/written on stdin/stdout.  9mount has several options:

       -i     mount the file system with your uid/gid

       -n     dry-run, print mount command to stderr but don't actually mount anything

       -s     single attach mode - all users accessing the mount point see the same filesystem (by default they'll each see a unique attach)

       -u     use the 9P2000.u extensions

       -v     use device mapping

       -x     exclusive access - other users cannot access the mount point

       -a SPEC
              SPEC determines which file tree to mount when attaching to file servers that export multiple trees

       -c CACHE
              turns on caching using CACHE mode. Supported modes are loose (suitable for exclusive read-only mounts), fscache, and mmap.

       -d DEBUG
              comma seperated list of channels for which to enable debug output. Possible channels include: err, devel, 9p, vfs, conv, mux, trans, alloc, fcall.

       -m MSIZE
              specifies the maximum length of a single 9p message in bytes. Must be less than or equal to 8192 for non-root users.

       9bind performs a bind mount, making the tree visible at directory OLD also visible at mount point NEW.

       9umount unmounts a 9p filesystem previously mounted by you.

ENVIRONMENT
       $USER  the uname to provide to the server.

EXAMPLES
       9mount -i 'unix!/tmp/ns.'$USER'.:0/factotum' $HOME/n/factotum
              mount p9p's factotum interface

       9mount 'tcp!sources.cs.bell-labs.com' $HOME/n/sources
              import plan 9's "sources"

       9mount -u -a/home/sqweek/mail 'tcp!wren!5640' $HOME/mail
              import my maildir from my server(wren), being served by ufs

       9mount -i 'tcp!wren' $HOME/n/wren; 9bind $HOME/n/wren/home/sqweek/mail $HOME/mail
              again importing my maildir, this time serving via u9fs

BUGS
       9mount truncates user names and SPECs to 249 characters.  9umount doesn't know this, so you won't be able to unmount anything outside your home directory. But you probably never bother logging out  if
       your user name is that long.

       9mount doesn't update /etc/mtab.

       9bind only does a "shallow", non-recursive bind - any mounted filesystems under the OLD tree will not appear mounted in the NEW tree.

       If you 9bind a non-9p filesystem outside your home directory, 9umount won't let you unmount it.
