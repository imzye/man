NAME
       lshmc - list HMC drive DVD contents

SYNOPSIS
       lshmc [OPTIONS] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       List  files  on  a  DVD in the DVD drive of the Hardware Management Console (HMC).  By default, the command lists all files in the root directory of the DVD.
       Use FILE to list a different set of files.  FILE can specify the path, relative to the DVD root directory, for a directory and file and can contain the * and
       ? wildcard characters.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help text, then exit.

       -v, --version
              Print version information, then exit.

       -s, --short
              Print only regular files (no directories, symbolic links and special files), in a short listing format.

EXAMPLES
       To list the files in a HMC drive DVD root directory use:

              # lshmc

       In case the kernel module hmcdrv was not loaded in advance use:

              # modprobe hmcdrv
              # lshmc

       To list all HTML files in subdirectory www use:

              # lshmc /www/*.html

DIAGNOSTICS
       The lshmc command needs access to device node /dev/hmcdrv.  This node is created automatically when the hmcdrv kernel module is loaded (see Linux kernel con‐
       figuration option CONFIG_HMC_DRV).  The user process that runs the lshmc command must have sufficient privileges to read from and write to node  /dev/hmcdrv.
       Use the commands chown(1), chgrp(1) and/or chmod(1) on node /dev/hmcdrv to ensure this condition.
