Test::Routine::Common(3pm)                                                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                          Test::Routine::Common(3pm)

NAME
       Test::Routine::Common - a role composed by all Test::Routine roles

VERSION
       version 0.031

OVERVIEW
       Test::Routine::Common provides the "run_test" method described in the docs on writing tests in Test::Routine.

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That
       is, if the most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
