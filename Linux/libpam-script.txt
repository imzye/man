PAM-SCRIPT(7)                                                                         Miscellaneous Information Manual                                                                        PAM-SCRIPT(7)

NAME
       pam-script - a PAM module that can invoke scripts within the PAM stack.

SYNOPSIS
       pam-script.so [onerr=(success|fail)][dir=/some/path/]

DESCRIPTION
       pam-script allows you to execute scripts during authorization, passwd changes, and on session opening or closing.

       Such scripts can perform necessary tasks or influence the outcome of the PAM stack.  For example, if the following entry was included in pam.conf
         sshd auth required  pam_script

       then if the script, pam_script_auth, exits with a non-zero value this would cause the user to be denied SSH access to the machine.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       onerr=(success|fail)
              the default behavior if the module can not find or execute the script.  The default is to fail if the option is not given.

       dir=/some/path/
              where to find the pam-scripts to invoke for each of the various module-types as described below.  The default is dir=/usr/share/libpam-script if not given.

              List of scripts

       pam_script_auth
              Executed under auth which handles the authentication stage of establishing the user via some challenge-response (i.e. username/password)

       pam_script_acct
              invoked under account module-type for non-authentication based account management.

       pam_script_passwd
              invoked under passwd for changing the password tokens.

       pam_script_ses_open
              invoked when a session is first opened.

       pam_script_ses_close
              run after a session is first closed.

              All  the  scripts  will  be  passed  several  environment  variables:  PAM_USER,  PAM_RUSER,  PAM_RHOST,  PAM_SERVICE,  PAM_AUTHTOK, PAM_TTY, and PAM_TYPE referring to the module-type.  The
              pam_script.so arguments in the pam.conf will be passed on the command line, which can be used to modify the script behavior.
