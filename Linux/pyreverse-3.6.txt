NAME
       pyreverse - parse python sources files and extract diagrams from them.

SYNOPSIS
       pyreverse [options] <modules>

DESCRIPTION
       pyreverse  is  a  python source analyzer. It parses python packages and
       produces UML diagrams in different output formats.  (dot,  all  formats
       available for dot, and vcg).  With different options, you can have fine
       tuning on what and how modules, classes and attributes will be shown in
       the  diagram.   You  can combine several modules in one project (except
       with -c ).

       If no -c and no --diadefs option specified, pyreverse will create
        - a diagram 'classes_<name>' for the classes in <modules> and
          ( if there is more than one module in <projects> )
        - a diagram 'packages_<name>' for the package  dependencies  in  <mod‐
       ules>

       With  -c  <class>,  pyreverse  creates  a diagram for that <class> with
       filename <class>.<format>.  You can do -c <class1> , -c <class2>.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show help message and exit

       -p<name>, --project=<name>
              set project name to <name> if not using -c option.  (default:'No
              Name')

       --ignore=<file[,file...]>
              add  files  or directories to the blacklist. They should be base
              names, not paths. [current: CVS]

       -f<mode>, --filter-mode=<mode>
              filter attributes and functions according  to  <mode>.  You  can
              combine  modes using '+' like 'SPECIAL+OTHER'. Correct modes are
              :
               - 'PUB_ONLY' : filter all non public attributes (default)
               - 'ALL' : no filter
               - 'SPECIAL' : filter Python special functions except  construc‐
              tor
               -  'OTHER'  : filter protected and private attributes [current:
              PUB_ONLY]

       -d<file>, --diadefs=<file>
              create diagram according to the diagram definitions in <file>

       -c <class>, --class=<class>
              create a class diagram  with  all  classes  related  to  <class>
              [current:  none]  the  class  must  be in the file <modules>. By
              default, this will include all ancestors and associated  classes
              of <class> and include module names (i.e. '-ASmy' ).

       -a <ancestor>, --show-ancestors=<ancestor>
              show   <ancestor>   generations   of  ancestor  classes  not  in
              <projects>

       -A, --all-ancestors=[yn]
              show all ancestors off all classes in <projects> [current: none]

       -s <ass_level>, --show-associated=<associated>
              show <ass_level> associated  classes.  <ass_level>=1  will  only
              take  classes  directly  related to the classes  in the project,
              while <ass_level>=2 will also take all classes related to  those
              fetched by<depth>=1.

       -S, --all-associated=[yn]
              show recursively all associated off all associated classes [cur‐
              rent: none]

       -b, --builtin
              include builtin objects in representation of  classes  [current:
              False]

       -m [yn], --module-names=[yn]
              include  module  name  in  representation  of classes. This will
              include the full module path in the class name. [current: none]

       -k, --only-classnames
              don't show attributes and methods in the class boxes; this  dis‐
              ables -f values [current: False]

       -o <format>, --output=<format>
              create  a  *.<format> output file if format available. Available
              formats are all formats that dot can produce and vcg.  [default:
              dot]

EXAMPLES
       Here are some examples for command line options:

       pyreverse <project> -a1 -s1 -m

              -a1  -s1  will  include  one  level  of  ancestor and associated
              classes in the diagram  of the <project> modules, while -m  will
              show the full module path of each class. You can use the -a, -s,
              -A, -S options in the same way.  Note  that  on  class  diagrams
              (using  -c ) -a and -s will rather reduce than enlarge your dia‐
              gram.

       pyreverse mod/foo.py mod/fee.py -k

              This is interesting if the diagram for <project>=mod is too com‐
              plicated:  you  can  show only the class names (no attributes or
              methods, option -k); or take only the modules you are interested
              in (here fee.py and foo.py).
