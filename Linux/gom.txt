NAME
       gomconfig - configuration tool for gom, a generic audio mixer

SYNOPSIS
       gomconfig [--version | --force | --purge]

VERSION
       This manual page was distributed with gom 0.30.5 (31 May 2004).

DESCRIPTION
       gomconfig is an interactive, text based configuration tool for gom. It deals with files in ~/.gom/ for a normal user, and with files in /etc/gom/ for the superuser.

       If gomconfig is run without arguments, it will check the validity of the current configuration and only go interactive if it is invalid.

       Please see gom(1) for details about gom's configuration.

OPTIONS
       --version
              Display version information.

       --force
              Forces reconfiguration (even if current configuration is valid).

       --purge
              Removes configuration directory (~/.gom or /etc/gom, respectively) completely. This will run non-interactively, but will create a temporary backup.

BUGS
       Gomconfig is probably overkill; you might prefer to simply use an editor (and gom itself) to change the configuration.
