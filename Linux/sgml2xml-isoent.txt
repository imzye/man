NAME
       sgml2xml-isoent - Convert SGML to XML with support for ISO entities

SYNOPSIS
       sgml2xml-isoent [sgml-document]

DESCRIPTION
       sgml2xml-isoent  converts an SGML document to XML, with support for the
       ISO entities.  This is done by using sgml2xml(1) from  the  SP  package
       (or  osx(1)  from  the OpenSP package), and the declaration for the XML
       version of the ISO entities is added to the output.   This  means  that
       the output of this conversion should work as-is with any XML tool.

       This  program  is often used for processing SGML DocBook documents with
       XML-based tools. In particular, db2x_xsltproc(1) calls this program  as
       part  of its --sgml option. On the other hand, it is probably not help‐
       ful for migrating a source SGML text file to XML, since the  conversion
       mangles the original formatting.

       Since the XML version of the ISO entities are referred to directly, not
       via a DTD, this tool also works with document types other than DocBook.

NOTES
       The  ISO  entities  are  referred  using  the  public  identifiers  ISO
       8879:1986//ENTITIES//...//EN//XML.   The catalogs used when parsing the
       converted document should resolve these  entities  to  the  appropriate
       place  (on  the  local filesystem). If the entities are not resolved in
       the catalog, then the fallback is to get  the  entity  files  from  the
       http://www.docbook.org/ Web site.
