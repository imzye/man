NAME
       redirsniff6

SYNOPSIS
       redirsniff6 interface victim-ip destination-ip original-router [new-router [new-router-mac]]

       Implant a route into victim-ip, which redirects all traffic to destination-ip to new-router. This is done on all traffic that flows by that matches victim->target. You must know the router which would
       handle the route.  If the new-router/-mac does not exist, this results in a DOS.  You can supply a wildcard ('*') for victim-ip and/or destination-ip.
