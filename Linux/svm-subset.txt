NAME
       svm-subset - a subset selection tool for LIBSVM

SYNOPSIS
       svm-subset [ -s method ] dataset number [ output1 ] [ output2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Training large data is time consuming. Sometimes one should work on a smaller subset first. The python script subset.py randomly selects a specified number of samples. For classification data, we pro‐
       vide a stratified selection to ensure the same class distribution in the subset.

OPTIONS
       -s method

       0      -- stratified selection (classification only) (default)

       1      -- random selection

       output1
              The subset. If output1 is omitted, the subset will be printed on the screen.

       output2
              The rest of data.

FILES
       See svm-train(1) for the format of dataset

EXAMPLES
              svm-subset heart_scale 100 file1 file2

       From heart_scale 100 samples are randomly selected and stored in file1. All remaining instances are stored in file2.

BUGS
       Please report bugs to the Debian BTS.
