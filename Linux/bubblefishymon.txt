NAME
       bubblefishymon - system load meter with ducks and fish

SYNOPSIS
       bubblefishymon [options] [program] [program]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the bubblefishymon command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       bubblefishymon  is  a  dockapp-style system monitor for CPU, memory, swap, load average and network traffic.  Based on wmfishtime(1) and bubblemon, this program has been considerably improved over
       the parent code.

       The higher the water level, the more memory is in use.  The more profuse the bubbles, the higher the CPU usage.  Fish represent network traffic direction and speed.

       When the mouse is moved into the window, the display will change to chow the load history, or, if the right Shift key is held, the current memory usage.  If you press the right mouse  button,  the
       window will freeze in that state until you move the mouse out then back into the window.

       program1 and program2 are the programs to spawn when either the left or middle mouse buttons are pressed, respectively.

       -d     disable swimming duck.

       -u     disable upside-down duck.
