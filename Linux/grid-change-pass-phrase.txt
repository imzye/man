SYNOPSIS

       grid-change-pass-phrase [-file PRIVATE-KEY]

DESCRIPTION
       The grid-change-pass-phrase program changes the pass phrase protecting
       a private key or PKCS12 bundle containing a private key and
       certificate. By default, grid-change-pass-phrase uses the X509_USER_KEY
       environment variable to locate the private key. If that is not set,
       then it looks for $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem and
       $HOME/.globus/usercred.p12 in succession. The path to a key can be
       specified by using the -file command-line option.
