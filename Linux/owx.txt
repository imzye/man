NAME
       owx - utility to program Wouxun dual-band handheld radios

SYNOPSIS
       owx-check [ -v | -h ] [ -f ] [ -p <port> ] [ -t <timeout> ]
       owx-get [ -v | -h ] [ -f ] [ -p <port> ] [ -t <timeout> ] -o <path>
       owx-put [ -v | -h ] [ -f ] [ -p <port> ] [ -t <timeout> ] -i <path> -r <path>
       owx-export [ -v | -h ] -i <bin path> -o <csv path>
       owx-import [ -v | -h ] -i <csv path> -o <bin path>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the owx commands.

       owx is a set of commands that will allow you to fetch and update configuration on your Wouxun handheld radio. It is made of multiple commands.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These options are common to all commands.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -v     Show version of program.

       -c <command>
              Invoke owx-<command>. Makes sense only if called directly as owx.

OPTIONS FOR check, get AND put
       -f     Force  operation even if your radio identifies different from a KG669V.  Use this option with extreme caution - it is very possible that your radio will be rendered unusable after you use this.
              It was NEVER tested with any radio different from mentoined above.

       -p <port>
              Use port <port>, defaults to /dev/ttyUSB0. Of course you must have appropriate read and write permissions for this device.

       -t <timeout>
              Specify the receive timeout for communication with radio. If you disable it (by setting to 0) and the communication fails, the program will hang forever. You probably don't need to  change  the
              default value (5 seconds).

USAGE
       owx-check
              This program just checks for the connection and identification string. It can be used to check that your cable and port works.

       owx-get
              This program downloads memory map from radio to binary file.

              Options:

              -o <path>: binary file to write to

       owx-put

              This program uploads memory map from binary file to radio.

              Options:

              -i <path>: binary file to read from
              -r <path>: reference file

              Option  -r  is  not mandatory, but recommended. You can specify original, unchanged file (exactly as downloaded using owx-get) and this will speed up memory uploading, as owx will compare input
              file to this reference file and upload only changed memory pages. When using this option, be sure that nothing has changed in the radio (even the  currently  selected  memory  channel)  between
              downloading reference file and using it for upload. This is important as some variables that cross the page boundaries (if there are any in the memory map) could be corrupted by this.

              Example:

              owx-get -o file.bin
              cp file.bin backup.bin
              owx-export -i file.bin -o wouxun.csv
              oocalc wouxun.csv
              owx-import -i wouxun.csv -o file.bin
              owx-put -i file.bin -r backup.bin

              Please do yourself a favour and double-check that you upload the correct file. If you try to upload incorrect or corrupted file, your radio will power down and fail to power up. owx will refuse
              to upload any file with incorrect size, but this is the only safety check.

       owx-export

              This program exports channel data from binary file to CSV file. This file can be later edited using your favourite spreadsheet editor or even text editor.

              Options:

              -i <path>: binary file to read from
              -o <path>: csv file to write to

       owx-import

              This program reads the specified, possibly edited by you CSV file, and patches existing binary file with this updated data. The file is now prepared to be uploaded with owx-put.

              Options:

              -i <path>: csv file to read from

              -o <path>: binary file to write to (must already exist)
