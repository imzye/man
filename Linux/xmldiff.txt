NAME
       xmldiff - Create a diff for two XML files

SYNOPSIS
       xmldiff [-h] [-v] [-f {xml,diff,old}] [-w] [-p] [-F F]
               [--unique-attributes [UNIQUE_ATTRIBUTES]]
               [--ratio-mode {accurate,faster,fast}] [--fast-match]
               file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       xmldiff  is  a library and a command-line utility for making diffs out of XML. This may seem like something that doesn't need a dedicated utility, but change detection in hierarchical data is very
       different from change detection in flat data. XML type formats are also not only used for computer readable data, it is also often used as a format for hierarchical data that can be rendered  into
       human  readable  formats. A traditional diff on such a format would tell you line by line the differences, but that would not be readable by a human.  xmldiff provides tools to make human readable
       diffs in those situations.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

       -v, --version
              Display version and exit.

       -f, --formatter
              Possible choices: xml, diff, old Formatter selection.  Default: "diff"

       -w, --keep-whitespace
              Do not strip ignorable whitespace.  Default: False

       -p, --pretty-print
              Try to make XML output more readable.  Default: False

       -F     A value between 0 and 1 that determines how similar nodes must be to match.

       --unique-attributes
              A comma separated list of attributes that uniquely identify a node. Can be empty.  Unique attributes for certain  elements  can  be  specified  in  the  format  {NS}element@attr.   Default:
              "{http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}id"

       --ratio-mode
              Possible choices: accurate, faster, fast Choose the node comparison optimization.  Default: "fast"

       --fast-match
              A faster, less optimal match run.  Default: False

EXAMPLE
       Common usage:

           $ xmldiff file1.xml file2.xml

       Making an output a bit more human readable by structuring it with whitespace:

           $ xmldiff -f xml -p file1.xml file2.xml
