NAME
       Crypt::OpenSSL::Guess - Guess OpenSSL include path

SYNOPSIS
           use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
           use Crypt::OpenSSL::Guess;

           WriteMakefile(
               # ...
               LIBS => [openssl_lib_paths() . ' -lssl -lcrypto'],
               INC  => openssl_inc_paths(), # guess include path or get from $ENV{OPENSSL_PREFIX}
           );

DESCRIPTION
       Crypt::OpenSSL::Guess provides helpers to guess OpenSSL include path on any platforms.

       Often macOS's homebrew OpenSSL cause a problem on installation due to include path is not added.  Some CPAN module provides to modify include path with configure-args, but Carton or
       Module::CPANfile is not supported to pass configure-args to each modules. Crypt::OpenSSL::* modules should use it on your Makefile.PL.

       This module resolves the include path by Net::SSLeay's workaround.  Original code is taken from "inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm" by Net::SSLeay.

FUNCTIONS
       openssl_inc_paths()
           This functions returns include paths in the format passed to CC. If OpenSSL could not find, then empty string is returned.

               openssl_inc_paths(); # on macOS: "-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"

       openssl_lib_paths()
           This functions returns library paths in the format passed to CC. If OpenSSL could not find, then empty string is returned.

               openssl_lib_paths(); # on macOS: "-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"

       find_openssl_prefix([$dir])
           This function returns OpenSSL's prefix. If set "OPENSSL_PREFIX" environment variable, you can overwrite the return value.

               find_openssl_prefix(); # on macOS: "/usr/local/opt/openssl"

       find_openssl_exec($prefix)
           This functions returns OpenSSL's executable path.

               find_openssl_exec(); # on macOS: "/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/openssl"

       ($major, $minor, $letter) = openssl_version()
           This functions returns OpenSSL's version as major, minor, letter.

               openssl_version(); # ("1.0", "2", "n")
