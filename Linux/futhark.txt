NAME
       futhark-repl - interactive Futhark read-eval-print-loop

SYNOPSIS
       futhark repl [program.fut]

DESCRIPTION
       Start  an  interactive Futhark session.  This will let you interactively enter expressions and declarations which are then immediately interpreted.  If the entered line can be either a declaration
       or an expression, it is assumed to be a declaration.  The input msut fit on a single line.

       Futhark source files can be loaded using the :load command.  This will erase any interactively entered definitions.  Use the :help command to see a list of commands.   All  commands  are  prefixed
       with a colon.

       futhark repl uses the Futhark interpreter, which grants access to the #[trace] and #[break] attributes.  See futhark-run for a description.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print help text to standard output and exit.

       -V     Print version information on standard output and exit.
