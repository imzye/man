NAME
       ts-shell - Login shell for terminal servers over z/VM IUCV

SYNOPSIS
       ts-shell [-h|--help]
       ts-shell [-v|--version]

DESCRIPTION
       ts-shell  is  a  login  shell for terminal server environments using the IUCV terminal applications.  ts-shell authorizes Linux users based on user names and
       group memberships for accessing terminals.  Linux users can list the authorizations and access terminals.  If a user is authorized to access a terminal,  ts-
       shell establishes the terminal connection using the iucvconn(1) program.

       Apart  from  iucvconn  the IUCV terminal applications include iucvtty.  iucvtty(1) provides full-screen terminal access to a Linux instance running as a z/VM
       guest operating system.

       iucvconn(1) can also establish terminal connections to z/VM IUCV hypervisor console (HVC) device drivers. The Hypervisor Console (HVC) is a generic  TTY  de‐
       vice driver for the Linux kernel providing terminals. One of the terminals can be used as the Linux console.

       The  Linux  instances  where ts-shell and iucvconn run and the target Linux instance must be z/VM guest operating systems of the same z/VM instance.  Because
       z/VM IUCV is independent from TCP/IP, you can access Linux instances with no external network connection.

              Display the version information, then exit.

USAGE
   Terminal server shell commands
       The terminal server shell provides the following commands:

       list
           The list command lists z/VM guest virtual machines to which the Linux user is authorized to connect.

           The output of the list command depends on the configured authorization method which can be "list" or "regex". The available authorization methods are ex‐
           plained in section "Configure terminal authorization for Linux users".

           The output for "list" authorization is a list of z/VM guest virtual machines, for example:

             user@ts-shell> list
             guest1
             guest2
             guest3
             guest5

           The output for "regex" authorization is a list of one or more regular expressions, for example:

             user@ts-shell> list
             Regular expressions for your authorization:
             (?i-xsm:lnx\w{5})
             (?i-xsm:^palim$)

           If  ts-shell  is  configured to connect to particular z/VM guest virtual machines only, the output for "regex" authorization is followed by a list of the
           user IDs that match at least one of the regular expressions:

             user@ts-shell> list
             Regular expressions for your authorization:
             (?i-xsm:lnx\w{5})
             (?i-xsm:^palim$)

             You are authorized to connect to these z/VM guest virtual machines:
             LNXSYS42
             LNXSYS01

       connect vm_guest [terminal_id]
           connect establishes a terminal connection to a particular z/VM guest virtual machine specified as vm_guest.  vm_guest consists of up  to  eight  alphanu‐
           meric characters.

           An  optional  terminal  identifier  can be specified with terminal_id.  If not specified, the default terminal identifier is used.  To change the default
           terminal identifier, use the terminal command.

           In the following example, a user opens a terminal connection to the Linux instance in z/VM guest virtual machine LNXSYS01:

             user@ts-shell> connect LNXSYS01
             ts-shell: Connecting to LNXSYS01 (terminal identifier: lnxterm)...
               ...
             ts-shell: Connection ended

       terminal [identifier]
           The terminal command displays or sets the default terminal identifier that is used by subsequent connect commands.  identifier is case-sensitive and con‐
           sists of up to eight alphanumeric characters.

           If terminal is called with the identifier being specified, identifier is set as the new default terminal identifier.  If identifier is not specified, the
           current default terminal identifier is displayed:

             user@ts-shell> terminal
             lnxterm

       quit, exit
           Exit the terminal server shell session.

       help
           Display the help about terminal server shell commands.

       version
           Display the ts-shell version.

CONFIGURATION
       To set up a Linux system as a terminal server and to use ts-shell for Linux users, complete the following configuration steps:

       1.  Authorize the terminal server z/VM guest virtual machine for IUCV.

       2.  Create a terminal server shell configuration file.

       3.  List z/VM guest virtual machines providing terminal access over IUCV.

       4.  Configure terminal session transcripts.

       5.  Configure terminal authorizations for Linux users.

       6.  Install ts-shell as the login shell for Linux users.

   Authorize the terminal server z/VM guest virtual machine for IUCV
       The z/VM guest virtual machine on which the terminal server shell runs needs particular authorization to establish IUCV communication  paths  to  other  z/VM
       guest virtual machines.

       A typical IUCV authorization statement in the z/VM directory entry of the terminal server z/VM guest virtual machine might be:

         IUCV ANY
         OPTION MAXCONN 256

       The  example  allows  the terminal server shell to establish IUCV communication paths with any z/VM guest virtual machine.  The number of IUCV connections is
       limited to 256.

       See the af_iucv(7) manual page for further details.

   Create a terminal server shell configuration file
       When ts-shell starts, it reads its configuration from the /etc/iucvterm/ts-shell.conf configuration file. The file contains configuration options that  spec‐
       ify further configuration files with lists of z/VM guest virtual machines and terminal authorization definitions.

       Supported configuration options (with default settings) are:

           ts-systems = /etc/iucvterm/ts-systems.conf
                  The ts-systems configuration option specifies a file that lists z/VM guest virtual machines. ts-shell permits connections to these z/VM guest vir‐
                  tual machines only.

                  See also section "List z/VM guest virtual machines providing terminal access over IUCV".

           ts-authorization = /etc/iucvterm/ts-authorization.conf
                  The ts-authorization option specifies a file containing the terminal authorization definitions for Linux users.

                  See section "Configure terminal authorization for Linux users" about the file format.

           transcript-systems = /etc/iucvterm/ts-audit-systems.conf
                  The transcript-systems option specifies a file that lists z/VM guest virtual machines for which terminal sessions are logged.

                  See section "Configure terminal session transcripts" for details.

           transcript-directory = /var/log/ts-shell
                  The transcript-directory option specifies a directory where the terminal session transcripts are saved.

                  See section "Configure terminal session transcripts" for details.

   List z/VM guest virtual machines providing terminal access over IUCV
       ts-shell establishes terminal connections only if a Linux user has been authorized. In some cases, the administrator might want to explicitly  restrict  con‐
       nections to particular z/VM guest virtual machines independent of the user.

       The  ts-systems  configuration option specifies a file that lists z/VM guest virtual machines to which ts-shell is permitted to connect.  The file lists each
       z/VM guest virtual machine on a separate line.  If a line contains "[*ALL*]", ts-shell is permitted to connect to any z/VM guest virtual machine.

       Note:  The ts-systems options applies to the ts-shell program only.  If necessary, further restrictions can be configured for the z/VM guest virtual  machine
              itself using the IUCV z/VM directory statement.  See the section about IUCV authorizations in the af_iucv(7) manual page.

   Create lists of z/VM guest virtual machines
       A convenient method for creating lists of z/VM guest virtual machines is to use the information from the z/VM user directory, which contains all the names of
       the z/VM guest virtual machines that are defined on a z/VM operating system instance.

       For example, to create a list of all z/VM guest virtual machines with names that start with "LINUX" and are followed by digits, use:

         vmur receive -H -t 1234 -O |grep -E "^USER LINUX[0-9]+" |cut -d" " -f2

       Spool ID 1234 refers to the z/VM user directory file in the z/VM virtual reader device.
       The output of the command can be saved in a file. The file can then be specified for the ts-systems or transcript-systems configuration options  in  the  ts-
       shell.conf file.  In addition, use these files to configure list authorizations.

   Configure terminal session transcripts
       ts-shell can create transcripts of terminal sessions to z/VM guest virtual machines.

       The  ts-audit-systems.conf  configuration file lists z/VM guest virtual machines for which terminal sessions are logged. If the file contains "[*ALL*]", each
       terminal session is logged.  To create a list of z/VM guest virtual machines, see section "Create lists of z/VM guest virtual machines".

       For saving the terminal session transcripts, ts-shell requires a directory that is specified by the transcript-directory option in the ts-shell.conf configu‐
       ration file.

       Note:  The terminal session transcript directory must be writable by all ts-shell users. The system administrator might use a "ts-shell" group containing all
              ts-shell users as members. The directory can be made writable for the "ts-shell" group only.

       ts-shell uses a combination of the Linux user name, z/VM guest virtual machine and a time stamp for creating new terminal session transcript files.

       The format is as follows:
           /var/log/ts-shell/user_name/VMGUEST_YY-MM-DD-HHMMSS

       Terminal session transcripts consist of three different files: the raw terminal data stream, timing data information and connection information.   See  iucv‐
       conn(1) for more details about terminal session transcripts.

   Configure terminal authorizations for Linux users
       ts-shell  performs authorization checks for Linux users before connecting to z/VM guest virtual machines.  The authorization configuration grants Linux users
       or groups to establish terminal connections only to particular z/VM guest virtual machines.  These authorization definitions are stored in the  ts-authoriza‐
       tion.conf configuration file.

       This configuration file consists of authorization mappings where mappings can be created for Linux users or groups.  For the specification of z/VM guest vir‐
       tual machines, a list or regular expression is used.
       A Linux user is referenced by the user name; a Linux group is referenced by the group name and prefixed with "@".

       Here is an example of a Linux user and group authorization:

         alice  =  list:guest01,guest02
         @users =  list:guest03,guest04

       To create lists of z/VM guest virtual machines, use the following prefixes:

           list:   followed by a comma-separated list of names.

           file:   followed by a file path.  The file lists z/VM guest virtual machines, each name on a separate line.

       The following example shows the usage of the file: prefix:

         @testgrp = file:/etc/iucvterm/auth/test-systems.list
         @prodgrp = file:/etc/iucvterm/auth/production-systems.list

       See section "Create lists of z/VM guest virtual machines" above about creating lists of z/VM guest virtual machines with names that match a specific pattern.

       Instead of listing each z/VM guest virtual machine individually, regular expressions can be used to match names of z/VM guest virtual  machines.   If  naming
       schemes exist for z/VM guest virtual machines, using regular expressions might be more efficient and allow for future additions.
       The regex: prefix starts the definition of a regular expression to match the names of z/VM guest virtual machines. The regular expression must be a Perl-com‐
       patible or an extended regular expression (ERE) as documented in POSIX.  Basic regular expressions (BRE) cannot be used. See regex(7) for POSIX extended reg‐
       ular expressions; and the Perl reference manual perlre about regular expression in Perl.

       To  authorize  user  bob for all z/VM guest virtual machines with names that start with "lnx" and are followed with at least three but not more than five al‐
       phanumeric characters, use:

         bob = regex:lnx\w{3,5}

       If a naming scheme exists for z/VM guest virtual machines belonging to the test or production environment: authorize all users in the "testgrp" group for all
       systems in the test environment; and respectively, authorize all users in the "prodgrp" group for all systems in the production environment:

         @testgrp = regex:test\w+
         @prodgrp = regex:prod\w+

       You  can have multiple authorizations for the same user, either directly through user authorizations or indirectly through authorizations for groups that the
       user is a member of.  Be aware that ts-shell accepts only one type of authorization, list or regex, for a particular user. The first  type  of  authorization
       that  is  found  for  a user sets the authorization type for this user. Further authorizations of the same type are accumulated.  Authorizations of the other
       type are ignored.

       Example:

         @users = list:guest01,guest03,guest05
         alice = list:guest02,guest04
         eve = regex:guest0[7890]

       If both alice and eve are members of group users, alice is authorized for guest01, guest02, guest03, guest04, and guest05. For eve, the regular expression is
       ignored and the authorizations are for guest01, guest03, guest05 as defined for the group.

   Install ts-shell as login shell for Linux users
       To use the ts-shell as the login shell for Linux users, follow these steps:

       1.  Add the path of the ts-shell program to the /etc/shells file that contains the list of valid login shells:

         echo $(which ts-shell) >> /etc/shells

       2.  Change the login shell of a particular Linux user using the chsh(1) program:

         chsh -s $(which ts-shell) alice

FILES
       /etc/iucvterm/ts-shell.conf
              General terminal server shell configuration file.

       /etc/iucvterm/ts-systems.conf, /etc/iucvterm/unrestricted.conf
              The  ts-systems.conf  file  lists  z/VM guest virtual machines to which connections are permitted.  unrestricted.conf contains "[*ALL*]" to permit ts-
              shell(1) to connect to any z/VM guest virtual machine.

              The ts-systems configuration option in the ts-shell.conf file might specify one of these files.

       /etc/iucvterm/ts-authorization.conf
              The ts-authorization.conf file grants Linux users or groups to establish terminal connections only to particular z/VM guest virtual machines.

       /etc/iucvterm/ts-audit-systems.conf
              The ts-audit-systems.conf file lists z/VM guest virtual machines for which terminal sessions are logged.

       /var/log/ts-shell
              Directory for saving terminal session transcripts.

ENVIRONMENT
       PAGER  The PAGER environment variable designates a program used as pager for the list command of the terminal server shell.  If PAGER is not  set  or  empty,
              less(1) is used.

       LESSSECURE
              ts-shell sets this variable to run less(1) in "secure" mode. See the SECURITY section in the less(1) man page.
