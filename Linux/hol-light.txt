NAME
       hol-light - HOL Light interactive theorem prover

SYNOPSIS
       hol-light [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       The command hol-light is a simple wrapper for calling ocaml and loading the HOL Light basic definitions (by loading /usr/share/hol-light/hol.ml instead of .ocamlinit as initialization file). Load‐
       ing these definitions takes about 2 minutes on modern hardware, please be patient. All options and other arguments are passed as options to ocaml.

       If  you  have  a  readline-editor such as rlwrap, ledit or rlfe installed, the hol-light ocaml toplevel is wrapped in readline-editor.  Install just one of these readline editors or configure your
       preferred one via the alternative system.
