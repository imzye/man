NAME
       credential-sheets - Account Credential Sheets Tool

SYNOPSIS
       credential-sheets [ [options] <CSV-file-1> [<CSV-file-2> [...]]  ]

DESCRIPTION
       After  mass  import of user accounts (e.g. into LDAP) or mass creation of WiFi voucher codes, most site administrators have to create information sheets (or snippets) containing those new  creden‐
       tials (like username, password, policy of usage, etc.).

       With this tiny tool, providing these pieces of information to multiple users, becomes really simple. Account data is taken from a CSV file and the sheets are output as  PDF  using  easily  config‐
       urable LaTeX template files.

OPTIONS
       credential-sheets command accepts the following command line options:

       --help Display a help with all available command line options and exit.

       --template=<tpl-name>
              Name of the template to use.

       --cols=<x>
              Render <x> columns per sheet.

       --rows=<y>
              Render <y> rows per sheet.

       --zip  Do create a ZIP file at the end.

       --zipfilename=<zip-file-name>
              Alternative ZIP file name (default: name of parent folder).

       --debug
              Don't remove temporary files.

CSV FILE FORMAT
       The credential-sheets tool can handle any sort of column arrangement in given CSV file(s). It expects the CSV file(s) to have column names in their first line.

       The given column names have to map to the "VAR-<column-name>" placeholders in credential-sheets's LaTeX templates.

       The shipped-with templates "students" and "teachers" can handle these column names:

         * login -- The user account's login id (uid)
         * lastName -- The user's last name(s)
         * firstName -- The user's first name(s)
         * password -- The user's password
         * form -- The form name/ID (student template only)
         * subjects -- Subjects taught by a teacher (teachers template only)

       The shipped-with template "wifivouchers" can handle these column names:

         * essid -- The WiFi network's ESSID (network name)
         * login -- The voucher´s login id (if any)
         * code -- The voucher´s login code
         * duration -- The validity period of a voucher code

       If  you  create  your own templates, you can be very flexible in using your own column names and template names. Only make sure that the column names provided in the CSV file(s)'s first line match
       the variables used in the customized LaTeX template. See below for details.

CUSTOMIZATIONS
       The shipped-with credential sheets templates are expected to be installed in ``/usr/share/credential-sheets/`` for system-wide installations. When customizing templates, simply  place  a  modified
       copy of any of those files into ``~/.credential-sheets/`` or ``/etc/credential-sheets/``. For further details, see below.

       The credential-sheets tool uses these *configuration* files:

         * header.tex (LaTeX file header)
         * <tpl-name>-template.tex (whereas <tpl-name> "students",
           "teachers" and "wifivouchers" are provided on default installations, this
           is extensible by defining your own template files, see below).
         * footer.tex (LaTeX file footer)

       Search paths for configuration files (in listed order):

         * $HOME/.credential-sheets/
         * ./
         * /etc/credential-sheets/
         * /usr/local/share/credential-sheets/
         * /usr/share/credential-sheets/

       You can easily customize the resulting PDF files generated with this tool by placing your own template files, header and footer where appropriate.

FILES
       /usr/share/credentail-sheets/*.tex

       /etc/credential-sheets/*.tex (optional)
