NAME
       qhold - hold pbs batch jobs

SYNOPSIS
       qhold [-h hold_list] [-t array_range] job_identifier ...

DESCRIPTION
       The qhold command requests that a server place one or more holds on a job.  A job that has a hold is not eligible for execution.  There are three supported holds: USER, OTHER (also known as operator),
       and SYSTEM.

       A user may place a USER hold upon any job the user owns.  An "operator", who is a user with "operator privilege," may place ether an USER or an OTHER hold on any  job.   The  batch  administrator  may
       place any hold on any job.

       If no -h option is given, the USER hold will be applied to the jobs described by the job_identifier operand list.

       If the job identified by job_identifier is in the queued, held, or waiting states, then all that occurs is that the hold type is added to the job.  The job is then placed into held state if it resides
       in an execution queue.

       If the job is in running state, then the following additional action is taken to interrupt the execution of the job.  If checkpoint / restart is supported by the host system, requesting a  hold  on  a
       running job will (1) cause the job to be checkpointed, (2) the resources assigned to the job will be released, and (3) the job is placed in the held state in the execution queue.

       If checkpoint / restart is not supported, qhold will only set the the requested hold attribute.  This will have no effect unless the job is rerun with the qrerun command.

       The qhold command sends a Hold Job batch request to the server as described in the general section.

OPTIONS
       -h hold_list   Defines the types of holds to be placed on the job.

                      The hold_list argument is a string consisting of one or more of the letters "u", "o", or "s" in any combination.  The hold type associated with each letter is:

                      u - USER

                      o - OTHER

                      s - SYSTEM

       -t array_range The array_range argument is an integer id or a range of integers. Multiple ids or id ranges can be combined in a comma delimted list. Examples: -t 1-100 or -t 1,10,50-100

                      If  an  array  range isn't specified, the command tries to operate on the entire array. The command acts on the array (or specified range of the array) just as it would on an individual
                      job.

OPERANDS
       The qhold command accepts one or more job_identifier operands of the form: sequence_number[.server_name][@server]

STANDARD ERROR
       The qhold command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qhold command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qhold command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
