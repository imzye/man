NAME
       M1 - The universal Macro assembler

SYNOPSIS
       M1 --architecture ARCHITECTURE --file FILE [--output FILE --octal    --binary --big-endian --little-endian]

DESCRIPTION
       M1 is the most minimal cross-platform macro assembler possible

       Leveraging a few grammar details to provide the user with a rich vocabulary of ways of expressing their desired output and input; thus eliminating surprise from the generation process.
       At it's core is DEFINE MACRO EXPANDED
       Where one can define an assembly instruction like: DEFINE INT_80 CD80 and know that everywhere INT_80 is placed in the input file there will be the hex encoding of that instruction in the output
       file or if no output file is specified the output will be send to standard out.

       The supported ARCHITECTURES are as follows: knight-native, knight-posix, x86, amd64, armv7l and aarch64.  If you fail to specify an architecture, the default of knight-native will be used.

       M1 also supports the generation of 8, 16 and 32bit integers provided they are encoded as !NUM, @NUM or %NUM respectively.  eg !-1, @42 and %8675309 You however can not mix integers with defini‐
       tions as macros are always applied first and will not be evaluated further.

       Should you wish to specify the bit and byte encoding of the integers to match your target --big-endian and --little-endian

       Should you wish for the output to be something other than hex format, you can specify the exact output you desire with: --octal or --binary

EXAMPLES
       Typically, M1 will be called in scripts used in bootstrapping
       # M1 -f x86.defs -f libc-core.M1 -f cc.M1 -f cc-footer.M1             --little-endian --architecture x86 -o cc.hex2

COMPATIBILITY
       M1 is compatible with all Turing complete machines; even the ones that try to be Turing complete -1
