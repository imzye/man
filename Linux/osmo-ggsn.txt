NAME
       osmo-ggsn - Gateway GPRS Support Node.

SYNOPSIS
       osmo-ggsn --help

       osmo-ggsn --version

       osmo-ggsn [ --help ] [ --daemonize ] [ --config-file file ] [ --version ]

DESCRIPTION
       osmo-ggsn  is  part of the OsmoGGSN project, and implements a Gateway GPRS Support Node. It is used by mobile operators as the interface between the Internet and the rest of the mobile network in‐
       frastructure.

       The GPRS functionality and protocols has been standardised by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). According to the 3GPP specifications a GGSN has two interfaces: The  Gn/Gp  interface
       and the Gi interface.

       The  Gn/Gp  interface  can be seen as the downlink interface of the GGSN. It is used for communicating with the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) which again interfaces to the radio access network.
       The Gn/Gp interface uses the GPRS tunneling protocol (GTP). User data packets (typically IP packets) are tunneled over GTP, which again uses UDP over IP.

       The other interface can be thought of as the uplink interface, and interfaces the GGSN to an external data network. Gi is most often an interface to the Internet.  osmo-ggsn uses the TUN/TAP  dri‐
       ver for the Gi interface. A tun network interface is established when the osmo-ggsn is started.

       osmo-ggsn will accept incoming connections from mobile stations through the radio access network and the SGSN. When a connection request is received the ggsn will allocate a dynamic IP address for
       the mobile station, and allow the mobile station to access the Gi interface. Connections are terminated by either the mobile station or the SGSN. Runtime errors are reported using the Osmocom log‐
       ging framework.

       Typically  osmo-ggsn will be deployed with two Ethernet interfaces. One for the Gn/Gp interface, and one for the Gi interface. Policy routing and firewall rules should be used in order to separate
       Gi traffic from Gn/Gp traffic.

OPTIONS
       --help Print help and exit.

       --version
              Print version and exit.

       --daemonize
              Run in background as a daemon (default = off)

       --config-file file
              Read configuration file (default = ./openggsn.cfg)

FILES
       ./osmo-ggsn.cfg
              The configuration file for osmo-ggsn.
       /var/run/osmo-ggsn.pid
              Process ID file.
       /var/lib/osmo-ggsn
              Directory holding nonvolatile data.

BUGS
       Report all bugs to the OsmoGGSN bug tracking list at https://osmocom.org/projects/openggsn

       osmo-ggsn has very limited management support. Currently both SNMP as well as billing mechanisms are missing.

NOTES
       Besides the long options documented in this man page osmo-ggsn also accepts a number of short options with the same functionality. Use osmo-ggsn --help for a full list of  all  the  available  op‐
       tions.

       The  TUN/TAP  driver is required for proper operation of osmo-ggsn.  For linux kernels later than 2.4.7 the TUN/TAP driver is included in the kernel, but typically needs to be loaded manually with
       modprobe tun.  For automatic loading the line alias char-major-10-200 tun can be added to /etc/modules.conf.  For other platforms see http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/ for information on how to in‐
       stall and configure the tun driver.

       osmo-ggsn uses the GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) as specified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). 3GPP protocols specifications can be found at http://www.3gpp.org
