NAME
       Net::CUPS::Destination - CUPS Destination Object

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::CUPS::Destination;

         my $printer = $cups->getDestination( "lj4200dn" );

         my $name = $printer->getName();

         my @options = $printer->getOptions();

         my $jobid = $printer->printFile( $filename, $title );

DESCRIPTION
       Net::CUPS is an object oriented interface to the Common Unix Printing System.

       Net::CUPS::Destination is an abstraction of the concept of a destination in CUPS.  Destinations will most likely be a printer, but it can be any type of target in which a file is sent for
       processing.

METHODS
       addOption
           $dest->addOption( $name, $value );

           Method to add another option name/value pair to the destination.

       cancelJob
           my $dest->cancelJob( $jobid );

           Method to chancel a job sent to this destination.

       getDescription
           my $description = $dest->getDescription();

           Provides the description string associated with this printer.

       getError
           my $error = $dest->getError();

           Utility method for returning the last error that occurred.

       getName
           my $name = $dest->getName();

           Method to return the name of the destination.

       getJob
           my $job = $dest->getJob( $jobid )

           Method to get a specific job as a hash of attributes.

       getJobs
           my @jobs = $dest->getJobs( $whose, $scope );

           This method will return an array of job identifiers.  $whose is 0 for all users and 1 is just for the selected user.  $scope is -1 for all jobs, 0 for active jobs and 1 for completed jobs.

       getLocation
           Returns the location string for this destination.

       getOptionValue
           my $value = $dest->getOptionValue( $name );

           This utility method will return the value of the selected option.

       getOptions
           my @options = $dest->getOptions();

           This method will return an array of the options currently set on the destination.

       printFile
           my $jobid = $dest->printFile( $filename, $title );

           I  know  this  is the method that you have been looking for.  This is what you will use to send a file to handled by the destination.  You must provide the name of the file and a title for the
           job.

       getUri
           my $uri = $dest->getUri();

           This function returns the device URI of a destination.  For example, a network printer might appear as socket://192.168.1.1

       getState
           my $state = $dest->getState();

           This function returns the state of a destination.  The value is an enumeration type with 3 meaning 'idle', 4 'processing' and 5 'stopped'.
