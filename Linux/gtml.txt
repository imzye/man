NAME
       gtml - an HTML pre-processor

SYNOPSIS
        gtml [-D macro] [-F file] [-h|--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       GTML is an HTML pre-processor which adds some extra features specially designed for maintaining multiple web pages.  HTML files generated by GTML are just like any other HTML files.  Because GTML
       does not attempt to interpret your HTML commands in any way, it's fully compatible with all version of HTML, and does not require any specific browser or server.

OPTIONS
       -Dmacro[=definition]
           Define constant <macro> eventually to be <definition>.

       -Ffile
           Do not process all files in the next project, but <file>.

       -h, --help
           Show this help.

       --version
           Get the gtml current version.

NOTES
       This man page is not part of the gtml source package.  It was created for the Debian GNU/Linux Project.
