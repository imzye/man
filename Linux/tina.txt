NAME
       tina-convert — convert Tina database files from one format to another

SYNOPSIS
       tina-convert [-d | --debug] [-v | --verbose] convert [-I infmt] [-O outfmt] [-o target] source
       tina-convert [-d | --debug] [-v | --verbose] list formats
       tina-convert [-h | --help] [-V | --version]

DESCRIPTION
       The tina-convert tool is used to read a tree of tina database items and represent it in a different format.  It currently supports three formats passed via the -I and/or -O command-line options:

       tina    The native tina database format.

       json    A hierarchical structure represented as a JSON object.

       yaml    A hierarchical structure represented as a YAML object.

FILES
       If the source filename is specified as “-”, tina-convert will read the data from its standard input stream.  If a target filename is not specified via the -o command-line option, or if it is spec‐
       ified as “-”, tina-convert will write the converted entries to its standard output stream.

EXIT STATUS
       The tina-convert utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       Read the tina database, represent it as JSON:

             tina-convert convert -O json ~/.tina

       Do the same and save the result as a file:

             tina-convert convert -O json -o tina.json ~/.tina

       Read that file and convert it back to the native format, needlessly specifying the output format since tina is the default for both input and output:

             tina-convert convert -I json -O tina tina.json
