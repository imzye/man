DESCRIPTION
       This modules handles International Standard Book Numbers, including ISBN-10 and ISBN-13.

       The data come from Business::ISBN::Data, which means you can update the data separately from the code. Also, you can use Business::ISBN::Data with whatever RangeMessage.xml you like if you have
       updated data. See that module for details.

   Function interface
       valid_isbn_checksum( ISBN10 | ISBN13 )
           This function is exportable on demand, and works for either 10 or 13 character ISBNs).

                   use Business::ISBN qw( valid_isbn_checksum );

           Returns 1 if the ISBN is a valid ISBN with the right checksum.

           Returns 0 if the ISBN has valid prefix and publisher codes, but an invalid checksum.

           Returns undef if the ISBN does not validate for any other reason.

   Object interface
       new($isbn)
           The constructor accepts a scalar representing the ISBN.

           The  string representing the ISBN may contain characters other than "[0-9xX]", although these will be removed in the internal representation.  The resulting string must look like an ISBN - the
           first nine characters must be digits and the tenth character must be a digit, 'x', or 'X'.

           The constructor attempts to determine the group code and the publisher code.  If these data cannot be determined, the constructor sets "$obj->error" to something  other  than  "GOOD_ISBN".  An
           object  is  still  returned and it is up to the program to check the "error" method for one of five values or one of the "error_*" methods to check for a particular error. The actual values of
           these symbolic versions are the same as those from previous versions of this module which used literal values:

                   Business::ISBN::INVALID_PUBLISHER_CODE
                   Business::ISBN::INVALID_GROUP_CODE
                   Business::ISBN::BAD_CHECKSUM
                   Business::ISBN::GOOD_ISBN
                   Business::ISBN::BAD_ISBN

           If you have one of these values and want to turn it into a string, you can use the %Business::ISBN::ERROR_TEXT hash, which is exportable by asking for it explicitly in the import list:

                   use Business::ISBN qw(%ERROR_TEXT);

           As of version 2.010_01, you can get this text from "error_text" so you don't have to import anything.

           The string passed as the ISBN need not be a valid ISBN as long as it superficially looks like one.  This allows one to use the fix_checksum() method.  Despite the disclaimer in the  discussion
           of  that  method,  the  author has found it extremely useful.  One should check the validity of the ISBN with is_valid() rather than relying on the return value of the constructor.  If all one
           wants to do is check the validity of an ISBN, one can skip the object-oriented interface and use the valid_isbn_checksum() function which is exportable on demand.

           If the constructor decides it cannot create an object, it returns "undef".  It may do this if the string passed as the ISBN cannot be munged to the internal format meaning  that  it  does  not
           even come close to looking like an ISBN.

   Instance methods
       input_isbn
           Returns the starting ISBN. Since you may insert hyphens or fix checksums, you might want to see the original data.

       common_data
           Returns the starting ISBN after normalization, which removes anything that isn't a digit or a valid checksum character.

       isbn
           Returns the current value of ISBN, even if it has an invalid checksum.  This is the raw data so it doesn't have the hyphens. If you want hyphenation, try "as_string".

           The "isbn" method should be the same as as_string( [] ).

       error
           Return the error code for the reason the ISBN isn't valid. The return value is a key in %ERROR_TEXT.

       error_is_bad_group
       error_is_bad_publisher
       error_is_article_out_of_range
       error_is_bad_checksum
           Returns true if the ISBN error is that type.

       error_text
           Returns a text version of the error text

       is_valid
           Return true if the ISBN is valid, meaning that it has a valid prefix (for ISBN-13), group code, and publisher code; and its checksum validates.

       type
           Returns either "ISBN10" or "ISBN13".

       prefix
           Returns the prefix for the ISBN. This is currently either 978 or 979 for ISBN-13. It returns the empty string (so, a defined value) for ISBN-10.

       group_code
           Returns the group code for the ISBN. This is the numerical version, for example, '0' for the English group. The valid group codes come from "Business::ISBN::Data".

       group
           Returns the group name for the ISBN. This is the string version. For instance, 'English' for the '0' group. The names come from "Business::ISBN::Data".

       publisher_code
           Returns the publisher code for the ISBN. This is the numeric version, for instance '596' for O'Reilly Media.

       article_code
           Returns the article code for the ISBN. This is the numeric version that uniquely identifies the item.

       article_code_length
           Returns the article code length for the ISBN.

       article_code_min
           Returns the minimum article code length for the publisher code.

       article_code_max
           Returns the max article code length for the publisher code.

       checksum
           Returns the checksum code for the ISBN. This checksum may not be valid since you can create an object an fix the checksum later with "fix_checksum".

       is_valid_checksum
           Returns "Business::ISBN::GOOD_ISBN" for valid checksums and "Business::ISBN::BAD_CHECKSUM" otherwise. This does not guarantee that the rest of the ISBN is actually assigned to a book.

       fix_checksum
           Checks the checksum and modifies the ISBN to set it correctly if needed.

       as_string(), as_string([])
           Return  the  ISBN as a string.  This function takes an optional anonymous array (or array reference) that specifies the placement of hyphens in the string.  An empty anonymous array produces a
           string with no hyphens. An empty argument list automatically hyphenates the ISBN based on the discovered group and publisher codes.  An ISBN that is not valid may produce strange results.

           The positions specified in the passed anonymous array are only used for one method use and do not replace the values specified by the constructor. The method assumes that you know what you are
           doing and will attempt to use the least three positions specified.  If you pass an anonymous array of several positions, the list will be sorted and the lowest three positions  will  be  used.
           Positions less than 1 and greater than 12 are silently ignored.

           A terminating 'x' is changed to 'X'.

       as_isbn10
           Returns  a  new ISBN object. If the object is already ISBN-10, this method clones it. If it is an ISBN-13 with the prefix 978, it returns the ISBN-10 equivalent. For all other cases it returns
           undef.

       as_isbn13
           Returns a new ISBN object. If the object is already ISBN-13, this method clones it. If it is an ISBN-10, it returns the ISBN-13 equivalent with the 978 prefix.

       increment
           Returns the next "Business::ISBN" by incrementing the article code of the specified ISBN (object or scalar).

           Returns undef, if the parameter is invalid or equals the maximum possible ISBN for the publisher.

                   $isbn = Business::ISBN->new('1565922573');  # 1-56592-257-3
                   $next_isbn = $isbn->increment;              # 1-56592-258-1

           If the next article code would exceed the maximum possible article code (such as incrementing 999 to 1000), this returns ARTICLE_CODE_OUT_OF_RANGE as the error.

       decrement
           Returns the previous "Business::ISBN" by decrementing the article code of the specified ISBN (object or scalar).

           Returns undef, if the parameter is invalid or equals the minimum possible ISBN for the publisher.

                   $isbn = Business::ISBN->new('1565922573');  # 1-56592-257-3
                   $prev_isbn = $isbn->decrement;              # 1-56592-256-5

           If the next article code would exceed the maximum possible article code (such as incrementing 000 to -1), this returns ARTICLE_CODE_OUT_OF_RANGE as the error.

       png_barcode
           Returns image data in PNG format for the barcode for the ISBN. This works with ISBN-10 and ISBN-13. The ISBN-10s are automaically converted to ISBN-13.

           This requires "GD::Barcode::EAN13".

BUGS
TO DO
       * i would like to create the bar codes with the price extension
