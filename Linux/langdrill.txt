NAME
       langdrill - simple program to test your vocabulary in foreign languages

SYNOPSIS
       langdrill [file]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the langdrill commands.  langdrill is a simple program for testing your vocabulary. It has complete support for interna‐
       tionalized text and can display languages such as Japanese, Hebrew, Russian and many more. The program was inspired by JavaDrill but the author (Ionutz  Bor‐
       coman)  thinks that langdrill has some improvements: while JavaDrill can handle one definition file at a time, langdrill can handle many definitions sections
       from a single file.

       The default definition file for langdrill default.drill is located by default in one of the following directories:

       /usr/share/langdrill

       /usr/local/share/langdrill

       depending on the system being Debian GNU/Linux or not.  Adding a file on the command line, forces langdrill to use that file instead of the default one.

       langdrill uses GTK 2 and VDK 2.

OPTIONS
       There are no options for langdrill, except the optional description file.
