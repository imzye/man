NAME
       sap - Service Access Point specification

DESCRIPTION
       The  text2sap  and sap2text functions use the format described in this man page. Because all standard ATM tools on Linux use those functions to convert to or from the textual representation of SAP
       specifications, they expect them in the same format too.

       The SAP is divided into two parts: the broadband high layer information (BHLI) and the broadband low layer information (BLLI). A SAP can contain one, both, or none of them. In the latter case, the
       SAP is usually considered as a wildcard SAP, i.e. a SAP that is compatible with any other SAP.

       Each part begins with its name (bhli or blli), followed by a colon and a (non-empty) list of attributes, which are of the form attribute=value. Some attributes have  sub-attributes,  which  follow
       them. Everything that isn't separated by a colon or an equal sign is separated by a comma.

       Values  which  are  a number of bytes are specified as the corresponding sequence of pairs of hex digits. The sequence can be optionally prefixed with 0x. Values with are integers in a given range
       can be specified in decimal (no prefix), octal (0 prefix), and hexadecimal (0x prefix).

       The following, mutually exclusive attributes are allowed in the bhli part (see the corresponding ATM Forum and ITU documents for the semantics):

       iso=1-8 bytes
              ISO

       user=1-8 bytes
              User-specific

       hlp=4 bytes
              High layer profile.  Note that this attribute only exists on UNI 3.0. text2sap only recognizes it if your system is configured to accept UNI 3.0 message formats.

       oui=3 bytes,id=4 bytes
              Vendor-specific application identifier

       The structure of the bhli part is more complex. It distinguishes three layers, l1, l2, and l3, of which the first one is presently unsupported. For layer two, the  following  (mutually  exclusive)
       possibilities exist:

       l2=iso1745
              Basic mode ISO 1745

       l2=q291
              ITU-T Q.291 (Rec. I.441)

       l2=lapb
              Extended LAPB, half-duplex (Rec. T.71)

       l2=iso8802
              LAN LLC (ISO/IEC 8802/2)

       l2=x75 ITU-T X.75, SLP

       l2=x25_ll ...
              ITU-T  X.25,  link layer. This attribute and the following attributes through l2=iso7776 can optionally be followed by one or more of the following sub-attributes: mode=mode (mode of opera‐
              tion, either norm or ext), and window=window size (window size in k, 1-127).

       l2=x25_ml ...
              ITU-T X.25, multilink

       l2=hdlc_arm ...
              HDLC ARM (ISO/IEC 4335)

       l2=hdlc_nrm ...
              HDLC NRM (ISO/IEC 4335)

       l2=hdlc_abm ...
              HDLC ABM (ISO/IEC 4335)

       l2=q992 ...
              ITU-T Q.922

       l2=iso7776 ...
              ISO 7776 DTE-DTE

       l2=user,info=information
              User-specified. information is an integer in the range 0 to 255.

       For layer three, the following (again, mutually exclusive) possibilities exist:

       l3=iso8473
              ITU-T X.233 | ISO/IEC 8473

       l3=t70 ITU-T T.70 minimum network layer

       l3=h321
              ITU-T Recommendation H.321

       l3=x25 ...
              ITU-T X.25, packet layer. This attribute and the following attributes through l3=x223 can optionally be followed by one or more of  the  following  sub-attributes:  mode=mode  (see  above),
              size=default packet size (4-12, corresponding to 16-4096), window=window size (see above).

       l3=iso8208 ...
              ISO/IEC 8208

       l3=x223 ...
              ITU-T X.223 | ISO/IEC 8878

       l3=tr9577,ipi=identifier ...
              ISO/IEC  TR  9577.  identifier  is  the initial protocol identifier in the range 0-255. For SNAP (0x80), the keyword snap can be used, and the following sub-attributes have to be specified:
              oui=3 bytes, and pid=2 bytes.

       l2=user,info=information
              User-specified, see above.

       l3=h310 ...
              ITU-T Recommendation H.310. The sub-attribute term=type (terminal type, rx, tx, or rxtx) is recognized. If present, it enables the two additional sub-attributes  fw_mpx=capability  (forward
              multiplexing capability, ts, ts_fec, ps, ps_fec, or h221) and bw_mpx=capability. Both are optional.

       Note  that  commas must never follow colons or other commas. Also, whitespace is not allowed inside a SAP specification. SAP specifications are case-insensitive. On input, items must be written in
       exactly the order used in this document.
