NAME
       afl-clang-fast - clang wrapper for American Fuzzy Lop (afl)

SYNOPSIS
       CC=/usr/bin/afl-clang-fast ./configure

DESCRIPTION
       This is a helper application which serves as a drop-in replacement for clang, used to recompile third-party code with the required runtime instrumentation for afl-fuzz.

       In contrast to the traditional afl-clang tool, this version is implemented as an LLVM pass and tends to offer improved performance with slow programs.

       A common pattern would be to use this with the CC environment variable.
