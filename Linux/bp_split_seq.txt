NAME
       bp_split_seq - splits a sequence into equal sized chunks with an optional
                   overlapping range

SYNOPSIS
       bp_split_seq -c 10000 [-o 1000] [-i] -f seq.in

DESCRIPTION
       The script will split sequences into chunks

       Mandatory Options:

         -c  Desired length of the resulting sequences.
         -f  Input file (must be FASTA format).

       Special Options:
