NAME
       umps3 – Virtual machine simulator based around the MIPS R2/3000 microprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       umps3 [CONFIGURATION]

DESCRIPTION
       uMPS is an educational computer system architecture and an accompanying emulator designed from the ground up to achieve the right trade-off between simplicity and elegance on one side, and realism
       on the other.  This makes uMPS ideally suited for use in education, such as hands-on operating systems or computer architecture university courses.

       The  uMPS processor implements the MIPS I instruction set, and can therefore be supported out of the box by existing MIPS compilers.  The architecture details a complete set of I/O devices (termi‐
       nals, disks, flash devices, printers, and network adapters) that feature a clean, consistent, programming interface.  The previous revision of the uMPS architecture (uMPS2)  brings  multiprocessor
       support.

       The  emulator  comes  with built-in debugging features and an easy to use graphical user interface.  Apart from the emulator itself, several support utilities are provided that can get you quickly
       started in developing programs for uMPS.
