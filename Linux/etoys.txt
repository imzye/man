SYNOPSIS
       etoys
       etoys [ option... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Squeak  Etoys  was  inspired  by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects
       created by end-users that runs on many platforms, and is free and open source.  It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles, pres-entations, web-pages,  videos,  sound  and  MIDI,
       etc.  It includes the ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.

       The development of Squeak has been done inside the ViewPoint Research Institute for several years. Since last years it's being done in collaboration with the OLPC project.
