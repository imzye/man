NAME
       siril - image processing tool for astronomy and others

SYNOPSIS
       Siril GUI
        siril <file>             Start Siril with file.

       Siril CLI
        siril-cli [-i conf_file] [-f] [-v] [-h] [-p] [-d working_directory] [-s script_file] [image_file_to_open]

DESCRIPTION
       Siril  is  an image processing tool specially tailored for noise reduction and improving the signal/noise ratio of an image from multiple captures, as required in astronomy. Siril can align, stack and
       enhance pictures from various file formats, even image sequences (movies and SER files). It makes use of OpenMP, supports all the cameras supported by libraw, and carries out  its  calculations  in  a
       high precision 32-bit floating point engine.

OPTIONS
       -i     Starts Siril with configuration file which path is given in conf_file

       -f     (or --format) Prints all supported image input formats, depending on the libraries detected at compile-time

       -v     (or --version) Prints program name and version and exits

       -h     (or --help) Short usage help

       -p     Starts  Siril  without  the  graphical  user  interface  and  use  the  named  pipes  to  accept commands and print logs and status information. On POSIX systems, the named pipes are created in
              /tmp/siril_commands.in and /tmp/siril_commands.out

       -d     (or --directory) Setting argument in cwd

       -s     (or --script) Starts Siril without the graphical user interface and run a script instead. Scripts are text files that contain a list of commands to be executed  sequentially.  In  these  files,
              lines starting with a # are considered as comments.

       image_file_to_open
              Open an image or sequence file right after start-up

FILES
       ~/.config/siril/siril.cfg
              User preferences. Overridden by the -i option.
       ~/.siril/siril.css
              The stylesheet used to change colours of the graphical user interface. This is useful for personalisation or if a GTK theme is incompatible with some coloured elements of Siril.
