NAME
       gcov2perl - convert gcov files to Devel::Cover databases

VERSION
       version 1.51

SYNOPSIS
        gcov2perl -h -i -v -db database gcov_files

DESCRIPTION
       Convert gcov files to Devel::Cover databases.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are supported:

        -db database    - specify the database to use

        -h -help        - show help
        -i -info        - show documentation
        -v -version     - show version

DETAILS
       To obtain coverage of XS files they must first be compiled with the appropriate options.  In a standard Makefile environment, such as that created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker, this can be accomplished
       with the command:

        HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES=-MDevel::Cover make test \
          CCFLAGS=-O0\ -fprofile-arcs\ -ftest-coverage \
          OTHERLDFLAGS=-fprofile-arcs\ -ftest-coverage

       If you have already built your object files it may be necessary to run make clean first, or to find some other way to ensure that they get rebuilt with the options gcov requires.

       Now the code coverage data has been collected "gcov" needs to be run:

        gcov Mylib.xs

       This will create one or more gcov files on which you can run "gcov2perl":

        gcov2perl Mylib.xs.gcov

       Finally, "cover" should be run as usual with any options required:

        cover

       If you are running everything with standard options, you can do all this with one command:

        cover -test

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

        0   All files converted successfully
        >0  An error occurred.
