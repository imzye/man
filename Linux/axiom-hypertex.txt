NAME
       axiom-test - run the Axiom regression testsuite

SYNOPSIS
       axiom-test [ suitenames ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       axiom-test is a simple script provided by the Debian Axiom package to allow the user to run the regression test suite or portions thereof on their system af‐
       ter installation.  The full test results performed at build time can be found in /usr/share/doc/axiom-test/test_results.gz.  There is currently  no  facility
       for trapping unexpected errors.

       The optional arguments refer to the .input filename stems found in /usr/share/<axiom version>/input.  Supplying no arguments will run the entire suite.
