NAME
       endless — An SSH tarpit

SYNOPSIS
       endless [-46chsvV] [-d delay] [-f config] [-l max banner length] [-m max clients] [-p port]

DESCRIPTION
       endless is an SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner.

       endless  keeps  SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time.  The purpose is to put your real SSH server on another port and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit instead
       of bothering a real server.

       Since the tarpit is in the banner before any cryptographic exchange occurs, this program doesn't depend on any cryptographic libraries. It's a simple, single-threaded, standalone  C  program.   It
       uses poll() to trap multiple clients at a time.

       The options are as follows:

       -4      Forces endless to use IPv4 addresses only.

       -6      Forces endless to use IPv6 addresses only.

       -d delay
               Message milliseconds delay. Default: 10000

       -f config
               Set and load config file.  By default endless looks for /etc/endlessh/config.

       -h      Print the help message and exit.

       -l max banner length
               Maximum banner line length (3-255). Default: 32

       -m max clients
               Maximum number of clients. Default: 4096

       -p port
               Set the listening port. By default endless listens on port 2222.

       -s      Print diagnostics to syslog. By default endless prints them to standard output.

       -v      Print diagnostics. Can be specified up to twice to increase verbosity.

       -V      Causes endless to print version information and exit.

       If endless receives the SIGTERM signal it will gracefully shut down the daemon, allowing it to write a complete, consistent log.

       A SIGHUP signal requests a reload of its configuration file.

       A SIGUSR1 signal will print connections stats to the log.

FILES
       /etc/endlessh/config  The default endless configuration file.
