NAME
       pmxchords - This script processes pmx files with chord symbols, allowing for key transpositions

SYNOPSIS
       [ texlua ] pmxchords { option | jobname [ .pmx ] } ...

       The default effect is to preprocess each pmx file so that chords are transposed as necessary, generating a temporary pmx file which is then processed by pmxab.  Finally the resulting tex file is
       renamed to have the original jobname.  The default filename for the temporary file is <jobname>_chtr.pmx.

OPTIONS
       -v      output program name and version number, and quit

       -h      output usage summary and quit

       -s      stop after first step (of producing a temporary pmx file with transposed chord symbols).
