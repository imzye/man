NAME
       update-exim4defaults - Manage exim4 daemon default file.

SYNOPSIS
       update-exim4defaults  [ --qflags flags ] [ --queuerunner combined|queueonly|separate|ppp|no|nodaemon ] [ --queuetime time ] [ --commonoptions options ] [ --queuerunneroptions options ] [ --smtplisten‐
       eroptions options ] [ --remove-common options ] [ --remove-queue options ] [ --remove-smtp options ] [ --force|-f ] [ --help|-h ] [ --init ]

DESCRIPTION
       update-exim4defaults allows one to set run parameters for the Exim daemon in /etc/default/exim4.  Its main purpose is for interaction with packages enhancing Exim  like  virus-scanners  that  need  to
       change the way the exim daemon is started.

OPTIONS
       --help|-h
              Print short usage instructions and exit.

       --qflags flags
              Set qflags, special flags given to exim directly after the “-q”. See exim(8) for more information.

       --queuerunner combined|queueonly|separate|ppp|no|nodaemon
              Should  the init script start one daemon that listens on the smtp port for incoming connections and runs the queue at regular intervals (combined) , or should it start two separate daemons, one
              listening on the smtp port, the other running the queue (separate) , or should the queue only be run by /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/exim4 (ppp) , or shouldn't we run the queue at all, for example if you'd
              rather do this with cron ? Or should we only start a queuerunner (queueonly) or no daemon at all (nodaemon) ?

       --queuetime time
              In which intervals should we run the queue? This passed as option -q<qflags>time to Exim, e.g. -q30m or -qq1h.

       --commonoptions options
              Options passed both to queue-running and listening instances of Exim.

       --queuerunneroptions options
              Options only passed to the instance of Exim running the queue.

       --smtplisteneroptions options
              Options only passed to the instance of Exim listening on the SMTP port.

       --force|-f
              Without  this  option  update-exim4defaults exits with an error if at least one of the options --queuetime, --commonoptions, --queuerunneroptions or --smtplisteneroptions is used and the corre‐
              sponding value in /etc/default/exim4 is already set to a nonempty value.

       --remove-common option
              Try to remove the given option from COMMONOPTIONS.

       --remove-queue option
              Try to remove the given option from QUEUERUNNEROPTIONS.

       --remove-smtp option
              Try to remove the given option from SMTPLISTENEROPTIONS.

       The --remove-commands cannot be used at the same time as any of --commonoptions, --queuerunneroptions or --smtplisteneroptions. The --remove-commands will additionally remove whitespace at the  begin‐
       ning and the end of the option and exchange multiple spaces wi a single one.

       --init create  a  default /etc/default/exim4 file and exit immediately. Unless --force was also specified update-exim4defaults exits (successfully) without doing anything if /etc/default/exim4 already
              exists. All other options are ignored.

EXIT STATUS
       0      change was successful or nothing needed to be done.

       1      generic error: wrong options, unreadable configuration file, etc.

       2      QUEUEINTERVAL was already set.

       4      COMMONOPTIONS was already set.

       8      QUEUERUNNEROPTIONS was already set.

       16     SMTPLISTENEROPTIONS was already set.

       32     QFLAGS was already set.

       64     --remove-something failed, i.e. the value of the option was not changed.

       Exit codes 2 to 32 will be summed up, if more than one unsuccessful option was given.

FILES
       /etc/default/exim4
              The configuration file.

       /etc/init.d/exim4
              The Exim init-script.

       /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/exim4
              The queuerunner in this file also uses COMMONOPTIONS and QUEUERUNNEROPTIONS and does not run if QUEUERUNNER=no.

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
