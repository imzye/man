NAME
       OpenPGP_Applet - GNOME applet for OpenPGP text encryption

VERSION
       Version 1.0

DESCRIPTION
       OpenPGP Applet allows encryption and decryption of the clipboard's content with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. This is a graphical frontend on top of GnuPG.

       Asymmetric decryption and clipboard verification are also supported.

PREREQUISITES
       OpenPGP Applet does not handle passphrase input. Since it also does not offer terminal interaction unless explicitly run from there, it relies in practice on some kind of GnuPG agent such as
       pinentry, Seahorse 2.x or GNOME keyring 3.x to manage passphrase input.
