NAME
       smaclient - tool for accessing z/VM System Management functions

SYNOPSIS
       smaclient [FUNCTION] [OPTION] [PARAMETER]
       smaclient [-?|--help]
       smaclient [-T target] [-H host] [-U user] [-P pass] <function>

DESCRIPTION
       smaclient  is a tool which provides a line-mode interface to the z/VM System Management API (SMAPI) for most Unix-compatible systems such as Linux.  Smaclient can exercise all the VM management inter‐
       faces to create, modify and destroy virtual machines without ever logging into z/VM.

       Executing smaclient without any arguments will print a list of available arguments and options.

REQUIRED OPTIONS
       -T, --target=TARGET
              set the target image or authorization entry name

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -H, --smhost=HOST
              hostname/port of SMAPI server. Specify IUCV if SMAPI IUCV is desired

       -U, --smuser=USER
              authorized SMAPI userid

       -P, --smpass=PASS
              authorized SMAPI password

       -?, --help
              output usage information

FUNCTIONS
       supported long function names MUST match SMAPI function name. For a list of supported functions, execute smaclient without arguments.

FILES
       /etc/smaclient.conf
       ~/.smaclient

       For /etc/smaclient.conf and ~/.smaclient, you can specify any or all of the following variables:

       smhost
              For TCP/IP, specify the SMAPI host and port number.  The format is:
                     hostname/portnumber
              For IUCV, specify the literal "IUCV".

       smuser
              For TCP/IP, specify the userid authorized to use SMAPPI.
              For IUCV, there's no need to specify this, but it doesn't hurt.

       smpass
              For TCP/IP, specify the corresponding password.
              For IUCV, there's no need to specify this, but it doesn't hurt.

       An example ~/.smaclient:

       smhost="myzvm/44444"
       smuser="vsmuser"
       smpass="secret"
