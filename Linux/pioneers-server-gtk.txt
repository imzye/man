NAME
       pioneers-server-gtk - graphical game server for Pioneers

SYNOPSIS
       pioneers-server-gtk [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pioneers-server-gtk command.

       Pioneers  is  a  computerized  version  of  a  well  known  strategy  board game. The goal of the game is to colonize an island. The players play the first colonists hence the name pioneers. It uses a
       client/server model for networked play of between two and eight players.  This program provides a GUI-configurable stand-alone server which you connect to from pioneers itself.

OPTIONS
       Pioneers accepts the standard GTK+ commandline options.

ENVIRONMENT
       The default settings of the server can be influenced with the following three environment variables:

       PIONEERS_METASERVER
              The hostname of the metaserver when no metaserver is specified in the user interface. (The settings file takes precedence)

       PIONEERS_SERVER_NAME
              The hostname of the server.  If it is not set, the hostname is determined by hostname(1).  (The settings file takes precedence)

       PIONEERS_DIR
              The path to the game definition files.  If it is not set, the default installation path will be used.
