NAME
       h5pcc - helper script to compile HDF5 C applications

DESCRIPTION
       usage: h5pcc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

              OPTIONS:

       -help  This help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed

       -prefix=DIR
              Prefix directory to find HDF5 lib/ and include/

              subdirectories [default: /usr]

       usage: h5pcc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

              OPTIONS:

       -help  This help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed

       -prefix=DIR
              Prefix directory to find HDF5 lib/ and include/

              subdirectories [default: /usr]

       -show  Show the commands without executing them

       -showconfig
              Show the HDF5 library configuration summary

       -shlib Compile with shared HDF5 libraries [default for hdf5 built without static libraries]

       -noshlib
              Compile with static HDF5 libraries [default for hdf5 built with static libraries]

       <compile line>
              - the normal compile line options for your compiler.

       h5pcc uses the same compiler you used to compile
              HDF5. Check with your compiler's man pages for more information on which options are needed.

              You can override the compiler, linker, and whether or not to use static or shared libraries to compile your program by setting the following environment variables accordingly:

       HDF5_CC
              -  use a different C compiler

       HDF5_CLINKER
              -  use a different linker

       HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
              -  use shared or static version of the HDF5 library

       [default: no except when built with only
              shared libraries]

              You  can  also  add  or change paths and flags to the compile line using the following environment varibles or by assigning them to their counterparts in the 'Things You Can Modify to Over‐
              ride...' section of h5pcc

       Variable
              Current value to be replaced

       HDF5_CPPFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_CFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LDFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LIBS
              ""

              Note that adding library paths to HDF5_LDFLAGS where another hdf5 version is located may link your program with that other hdf5 library version.
