NAME
       pvfs2-mkspace – create storage space for OrangeFS server

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-mkspace  [-adDhvV]  [-c  name] [-i id] [-r handle] [-M range] [-N
       range] [--data-space path] [--meta-space path] directory

DESCRIPTION
       The pvfs2-mkspace utility creates an OrangeFS volume with a single col‐
       lection  or  adds  a  new  collection to an existing storage space.  It
       should be used after changing the storage  configuration  of  a  server
       which has already been initialized.

       The options are as follows:

       -a     Add a collection instead of creating a new storage space.

       -d     Use  all  default options.  The default options can be seen with
              -h.

       -D     Remove (permanently) the storage space.

       -h     Display synopsis.

       -v     Print version number and exit.

       -V     Display verbose messages.

       -c     Use name as the collection name.

       -i     Use id as file system ID.

       -r     Use handle as the root handle.

       -M     Use range as the metadata handle range.

       -N     Use range as the data handle range.

       --data-space
              Use path as the path to the data space.

       --meta-space
              Use path as the path to the metadata space.

ENVIRONMENT
       PVFS2_DEBUGFILE
              If set to the path of a local file, redirect debug output to it.

       PVFS2_DEBUGMASK
              Set the OrangeFS debug mask.  Possible masks are  documented  in
              pvfs2-set-debugmask(1).
