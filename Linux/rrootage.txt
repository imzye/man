NAME
       rRootage - an abstract arcade shooter

SYNOPSIS
       rrootage [-lowres|-mediumres|-highres] [-nosound] [-window] [-fullscreen] [-reverse] [-nowait] [-accframe]

DESCRIPTION
       rRootage is an arcade style shooting game. Avoid the barrage of bullets while using your laser to destroy the enemy's battle ship.

USAGE
       You can play the game with a keyboard or a joystick. On the keyboard the following keys are used:

        - Movement    Arrow keys
        - Fire        Z
        - Special     X
        - Pause       P
        - Leave Game  Escape

       In the initial screen, use X to choose the mode, and Z to select a level.

       The game has the following modes:

   Normal Mode
       This  is  the  standard game mode. Your ship slows down while your laser is being fired. The special key releases a bomb, which destroys enemy bullets. The number of bombs you have is displayed in
       the bottom-right corner.

   PSY Mode
       When bullets graze your ship the graze meter, which is displayed in the bottom-right corner, increases. When the meter becomes full, your ship is temporarily invincible. The special key  increases
       the range within which bullets graze your ship, but also slows your ship down.

   IKA Mode
       Your  ship has two modes, white and black, and the enemy bullets come in white and black varieties. You can absorb bullets with the same colour as the mode of your ship, and they will be converted
       into lasers. The special key switches between white and black mode.

   GW Mode
       Your ship has a bullet reflector, which you activate using the special key.  However, you can only use it while the reflector meter, shown in the bottom right corner, displays "OK".

OPTIONS
       These command line options are available:

       -lowres
              Low resolution mode.

       -mediumres
              Medium resolution mode.

       -highres
              High resolution mode (default).

       -nosound
              Disable sound.

       -window
              Launch the game in a window, rather than fullscreen.

       -fullscreen
              Launch the game in fullscreen mode.

       -reverse
              Reverse the fire key and the special key.

       -nowait
              When there are a large number of bullets on the screen, the game is slowed down. This option prevents this slowdown so that the game speed is constant.

       -accframe
              Use the alternative frame rate management algorithm. (If you have a problem with the frame rate, try this option.)

FILES
       ~/.rr.prf
              This is where rRootage records which levels you have completed in which modes.
