NAME
       lirc-lsplugins - Print dynamic modules info

SYNOPSIS
       lirc-lsplugins [-l] [-q] [-U plugindir] [drivers]

       lirc-lsplugins -e [-q] [-U plugindir]

       lirc-lsplugins -y  [-U plugindir]

DESCRIPTION
       Tool  which  writes  a  simple list with info for each driver found. In
       particular, it writes info if a plugin can't be loaded e.  g.,  due  to
       unresolved references.

       The drivers argument is an optional selector which limits the output to
       matching drivers.  The match is a glob-type match as done by fnmatch()

OPTIONS
       -U --plugindir <path>
              Use <path> to search for plugins.  The  path  is  a':'-separated
              search path similar to e. g., $PATH.

       -q --quiet
              Don't write headers and trailing legend.

       -s --summary
              Just write a summary over number of plugins, drivers and errors.

       -e --errors
              Only list plugins which can't be loaded, or does not contain any
              drivers.

       -y --yaml
              Make a YAML listing reflecting the drivers' configuration  hints
              such  as  the  device_hint. The format is unstable and primarely
              used by lirc-setup(1).

       -l --long
              Add info on driver features.

       -p --default-path
              Print default search path and exit.

       -h --help
              Display usage summary.

       -v --version
              Display version info.

EXAMPLES
           $ lirc-lsplugins -U ../lib/.libs:/usr/local/lib/lirc/plugins tira*

       Lists all drivers with name matching 'tira*' found in plugins living in
       ../lib/.libs or /usr/local/lib/lirc/plugins.

RETURN VALUE
       lirc-lsplugins  returns  a non-zero error code if there is at least one
       plugin from which no driver can be loaded  or  options  and  parameters
       can't be parsed. Otherwise it returns zero.

BUGS
       Some  drivers change their capabilities in runtime after inspecting the
       underlying hardware. These runtime capabilities can not  be  listed  by
       lirc-lsplugins.
