NAME
       cryptopANT - IP Address Anonymization Library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <cryptopANT.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The cryptopANT ip address anonymization library implements techniques for IPv4 and IPv6 address anonymization first described in:

       'Prefix-Preserving IP  Address Anonymization',
                Computer Networks, Volume 46, Issue 2, 7 October 2004, Pages 253-272, Elsevier.

       commonly known as Crypto-PAn.

       This implementation is provided by USC/ISI ANT project: http://ant.isi.edu

   API Overview
       int scramble_init_from_file(const char *keyfile, scramble_crypt_t c4, scramble_crypt_t c6, int *do_mac)

              Initializes  library from a keyfile and sets up underlying cryptographical mechanism for scrambling of IPv4 (c4) and IPv6 (c6) addresses.  See scramble_crypt_t for possible values of c4 and
              c6.  Typically used are: SCRAMBLE_NONE for no scrambling or SCRAMBLE_AES for scrambling using fast AES cypher.  If the keyfile does not exist, it is created.  This function internally calls
              scramble_readstate() and scrable_init().  Returns 0 if successful.  SCRAMBLE_BLOWFISH uses blowfish cypher.  While previously widely used, it's no longer recommended, as scrambling of  ipv6
              addresses can be very slow.

       int32_t   scramble_ip4(uint32_t input, int pass_bits)
       int32_t unscramble_ip4(uint32_t input, int pass_bits)

              Scrambles  or  un-scrambles  (input)  IP  address passing through first (pass_bits); the scrambled ip address is returned.  Please note that even if (pass_bits) is 0, first few bits will be
              passed through to preserve class of the input IP.  Both input and output IPs are in network byte order.  Note that unscrambling is a costly operation and unscrambling a large number of dif‐
              ferent addresses can take a long time.

       void   scramble_ip6(struct in6_addr *input, int pass_bits)
       void unscramble_ip6(struct in6_addr *input, int pass_bits)

              Scrambles or un-scrambles IPv6 address pointed to by (input) in-place , passing through first (pass_bits).  Addresses are in network byte order.  Note that unscrambling is a  costly  opera‐
              tion and unscrambling a large number of different addresses can take a long time.

       int scramble_readstate(const char *keyfile, scramble_state_t *s)
       int scramble_savestate(const char *keyfile, const scramble_state_t *s)

              These  functions  can read scrambling keys from keyfile into memory pointed to by (s), or save/write previously initialized state (s) to a (keyfile).  After state is read, the library still
              needs to be initialized by calling scramble_init() Return 0 on success.

       int scramble_init(const scramble_state_t *s)

              Initializes library using state pointed by (s).  Returns 0 on success.
