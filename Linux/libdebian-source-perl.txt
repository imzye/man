NAME
       Debian::Dependencies - a list of Debian::Dependency objects

SYNOPSIS
           my $dl = Debian::Dependencies->new('perl, libfoo-perl (>= 3.4)');
           print $dl->[1]->ver;      # 3.4
           print $dl->[1];           # libfoo-perl (>= 3.4)
           print $dl;                # perl, libfoo-perl (>= 3.4)

           $dl += 'libbar-perl';
           print $dl;                # perl, libfoo-perl (>= 3.4), libbar-perl

           print Debian::Dependencies->new('perl') + 'libfoo-bar-perl';
                                     # simple 'sum'

           print Debian::Dependencies->new('perl')
                 + Debian::Dependencies->new('libfoo, libbar');
                                     # add (concatenate) two lists

           print Debian::Dependencies->new('perl')
                 + Debian::Dependency->new('foo');
                                     # add dependency to a list

DESCRIPTION
       Debian::Dependencies a list of Debian::Dependency objects, with automatic construction and stringification.

       Objects of this class are blessed array references. You can safely treat them as arrayrefs, as long as the elements you put in them are instances of the Debian::Dependency class.

       When used in string context, Debian::Dependencies converts itself into a comma-delimited list of dependencies, suitable for dependency fields of debian/control files.

   CLASS METHODS
       new(dependency-string)
           Constructs  a new Debian::Dependencies object. Accepts one scalar argument, which is parsed and turned into an arrayref of Debian::Dependency objects.  Each dependency should be delimited by a
           comma and optional space. The exact regular expression is "/\s*,\s*/".

   OBJECT METHODS
       add( dependency[, ... ] )
           Adds dependency (or a list of) to the list of dependencies. If the new dependency is a subset of or overlaps some of the old dependencies, it is not duplicated.

               my $d = Debian::Dependencies('foo, bar (<=4)');
               $d->add('foo (>= 4), bar');
               print "$d";     # foo (>= 4), bar (>= 4)

           dependency can be either a Debian::Dependency object, a Debian::Deendencies object, or a string (in which case it is converted to an instance of the Debian::Dependencies class).

       remove( dependency, ... )
       remove( dependencies, ... )
           Removes a dependency from the list of dependencies. Instances of Debian::Dependency and Debian::Dependencies classes are supported as arguments.

           Any non-reference arguments are coerced to instances of Debian::Dependencies class.

           Only dependencies that are subset of the given dependencies are removed:

               my $deps = Debian::Dependencies->new('foo (>= 1.2), bar');
               $deps->remove('foo, bar (>= 2.0)');
               print $deps;    # bar

           Returns the list of the dependencies removed.

       has( dep )
           Return true if the dependency list contains given dependency. In other words, this returns true if the list of dependencies guarantees that the given dependency will be satisfied. For example,
           "foo, bar" satisfies "foo", but not "foo (>= 5)".

       prune()
           This method is deprecated. If you want to sort the dependency list, either call "sort" or use normal perl sorting stuff on the dereferenced array.

       sort()
           Sorts the dependency list by package name, version and relation.
