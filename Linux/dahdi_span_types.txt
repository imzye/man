NAME
       dahdi_span_types - set line modes of DAHDI spans before assignment

SYNOPSIS
       dahdi_span_types [options] <list|dumpconfig|set> [devpath ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  span  type  (the  line  mode: E1/T1/J1) must be set to a span before DAHDI assigns it a span number, as E1 spans use more channels.  dahdi_span_types applies the span type configuration to an un-
       assigned span.

       Using it only makes sense when the kernel module parameter dahdi.auto_assign_span is unset, otherwise DAHDI automatically assign span numbers during device registration.

       dahdi_span_types takes a command and an optional list of devices. If no device is given, the command is applied to all devices.

       The device is marked as a path in the SysFS tree.

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
              Output usage message and exit

       -n|--dry-run
              During "set" operation, only show what would be done, without actually changing anything.

       -v|--verbose
              During "set" operation, show the actions that are being performed.

       --line-mode=<E1|T1|J1>
              During "dumpconfig" operation, force special generation mode:

              ·  First, generates a "wildcard" entry with the fiven line-mode.

              ·  Comment out all span entries. Each of them may be manually un-commented to override the "wildcard".

SUB-COMMANDS
       set
              Reads settings from span-types.conf and applies them to the device(s) specified in the command line (or all devices, if none specified).

       list
              List line modes for all spans in the system which may be set with dahdi_span_types (E1/T1/J1 spans).

       dumpconfig
              List types for the spans in a format fit to be used in span-types.conf. Use this to generate a configuration file after you have (perhaps manually) set all existing spans.

              dahdi_genconf spantypes uses this command internally.

CONFIGURATION
   General structure
       span-types.conf is a file with lines specifying line modes of spans.

       Empty lines or lines beginning with '#' are ignored.

       Each line is in the format of:

       ID        spanspec ...

       The ID field specifies the DAHDI device and the spanspecs define the line modes of its spans. A line may have multiple spanspecs in a single line (though dumpconfig generates a configuration with  one
       per line).

   Span Identifier
       A  DAHDI  device may be specified either by a hardware identifier (a software readable serial number or whatever) or the location in which it is installed on the system. The former makes it simpler to
       change connector / slot whereas the latter makes it simpler to replace a unit.

       The value in this field is matched (when the command set is used) to the following values:

        hwid
        @location
        devpath

       See above for their descriptions. The value may include shell wildcards: *, ? and [], which are used in the match. The values to be matched are first cleaned up: '!' is replaced with '/' and any char‐
       acter not in "a-zA-Z0-9/:.-" is replaced by "_".

       Note  that while span-types.conf allows an arbitrarily-complex combination of E1, J1 and T1 ports, it would normally have just a single wildcard line setting the line mode (the first line in the exam‐
       ple below).

   Span Specification
       Each line should have one or more span specifications: this is the value used to set span type with DAHDI in the SysFS interface. A specification has two colon-separated fields:

       rel_span_no:span_type

       for instance, the following are four span specifications specify ports 1 and 2 as E1 and ports 3 and 4 as T1: [12]:E1 [34]:T1 .

       rel_span_no
              The relative number of the span in the device. E.g.: port number.  This field may contain shell wildcards (*, ? and [])

       span_type
              E1/T1/J1

   Multiple matches
       During set operation, the dahdi_span_types applies all matching settings to a span. This is done in the order of lines in the configuration files.

       Thus, if there are multiple matches to a span -- the last match will win (all will be applied to the kernel in order. The last one in the file will be applied last).

       Example:
       *             *:T1      # All spans on all devices will be T1
       usb:X1234567  [34]:E1   # Except spans 3,4 on the device which will be E1

ENVIRONMENT
       DAHDICONFDIR
              The directory in which span-types.conf resides. /etc/dahdi if not overridden from the environment.

       DAHDISPANTYPESCONF
              The path to span-types.conf resides. /etc/dahdi/span-types.conf if not overridden from the environment.

FILES
       /etc/dahdi/span-types.conf
              The default location for the configuration file.

       /sys/bus/dahdi_devices/devices/device
              SysFS node for the device. In this directory reside the following files, among others:

              spantype
                     read/write file. Reading from it returns current configuration for spans of the device. Span-specifications can be written to it to change line modes (but only for a  span  that  is  not
                     assigned yet).
