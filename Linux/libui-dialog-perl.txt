NAME
       UI::Dialog::Gauged - wrapper support of gauge related functions.

SYNOPSIS
         use UI::Dialog::Gauged;
         my $d = new UI::Dialog::Gauged ( title => 'Default title',
                                         height => 20, width => 65 ,
                                         listheight => 5,
                                         order => [ 'zenity', 'xdialog' ] );

         # Either a Zenity or Xdialog msgbox widget should popup,
         # with a preference for Zenity.
         $d->msgbox( title => 'Welcome!', text => 'Welcome one and all!' );

ABSTRACT
       UI::Dialog::Gauged is simply another meta-class for UI::Dialog. This class simply has a different order of priority than UI::Dialog and only uses backends that support a standard set of gauge
       related functions.

DESCRIPTION
       This class is simply a nice way to try and ensure a GNOME based widget set.

EXPORT
         None

INHERITS
         UI::Dialog

CONSTRUCTOR
   new( @options )
       EXAMPLE
            my $d = new( title => 'Default Title', backtitle => 'Backtitle',
                         width => 65, height => 20, listheight => 5,
                         order => [ 'zenity', 'xdialog' ] );

       DESCRIPTION
                 This is the Class Constructor method. It accepts a list of key => value pairs and uses them as the defaults when interacting with the various widgets.

       RETURNS
                 A blessed object reference of the UI::Dialog::Gauged class.

       OPTIONS
           The (...)'s after each option indicate the default for the option.

           debug = 0,1,2 (0)
           order = [ zenity, xdialog, cdialog, whiptail ] (as indicated)
           PATH = [ /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, /opt/bin ] (as indicated)
           backtitle = "backtitle" ('')
           title = "title" ('')
           beepbefore = 0,1 (0)
           beepafter = 0,1 (0)
           height = \d+ (20)
           width = \d+ (65)
           listheight = \d+ (5)

WIDGET METHODS
   gauge_start( )
       EXAMPLE
            $d->gauge_start( text => 'gauge...', percentage => 1 );

       DESCRIPTION
                 Display a meter bar to the user. This get's the widget realized but requires the use of the other gauge_*() methods for functionality.

       RETURNS
                 TRUE (1) if the widget loaded fine and FALSE (0) for anything else.

   gauge_inc( )
       EXAMPLE
            $d->gauge_inc( 1 );

       DESCRIPTION
                 Increment the meter by the given amount.

       RETURNS
                 TRUE (1) if the widget incremented fine and FALSE (0) for anything else.

   gauge_set( )
       EXAMPLE
            $d->gauge_set( 99 );

       DESCRIPTION
                 Set the meter bar to the given amount.

       RETURNS
                 TRUE (1) if the widget set fine and FALSE (0) for anything else.

   gauge_text( )
       EXAMPLE
            $d->gauge_text( 'string' );

       DESCRIPTION
                 Set the meter bar message to the given string.

       RETURNS
                 TRUE (1) if the widget set fine and FALSE (0) for anything else.

   gauge_stop( )
       EXAMPLE
            $d->gauge_stop();

       DESCRIPTION
                 End  the  meter  bar  widget process. One of the flaws with gdialog is that the gauge widget does not close properly and requies the end user to close the gauge window when 100% has been
                 reached. This is the second reason why I'm glad gdialog is going the way of the dodo.

       RETURNS
                 TRUE (1) if the widget closed fine and FALSE (0) for anything else.
