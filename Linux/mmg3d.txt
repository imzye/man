NAME
     mmg3d — Adaptation and optimization of a tetrahedral mesh and implicit domain meshing.

DESCRIPTION
     The mmg3d application is dedicated to tetrahedral remeshing.  Both surface and volume mesh are modified.

     By defaults it performs mesh modifications in order to control the surface approximation.
     Providing a metric file, it adapts the mesh to the prescribed sizes at nodes.
     Providing a level-set file containing the values of the level-set function at the mesh nodes, the -ls option allows to explicitly mesh an implicit domain.
     Without metric file, the -optim option allow to improve the mesh quality with respect to the initial mesh size.  -optimLES option allow to improve strongly the isotropic mesh quality for LES simula‐
     tions.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
     1.   Generic options:
          -h                      Print help.
          -v ⟨n⟩                  Tune level of verbosity.
                                  Takes values between -1 and 10.
          -m ⟨n⟩                  Set maximal memory size to n MBytes.
          -d                      Turn on debug mode.
          -default                Write a local parameter file (with extension .mmg3d) with setted values.
          -val                    Print the default parameters values.

     2.   File specifications:
          -in ⟨mesh_file⟩         Input triangulation.
          -out ⟨output_file⟩      Output triangulation.
          -sol ⟨solution_file⟩    Load metric, displacement or level-set file.

          -opnbdy                 Preserve input triangles at the interface of two domains of the same reference.
          -nofem                  Do not force Mmg to create a finite element mesh.

          -optim                  Mesh improvement with respect to the initial mesh size.
          -optimLES               Strong isotropic mesh optimization for LES computations.

RETURN VALUES
     mmg3d returns:
     •   the 0 value if successful;
     •   the 1 value if the process fail but can save a conform mesh;
     •   the 2 value if the process fail and can't save a comform mesh.
