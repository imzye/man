NAME
       fmeasure - Calculates the properly calibrated frequency of a series of test signals

SYNOPSIS
       fmeasure [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       fmeasure is one of suite of command line tools designed to aid frequency measurement. These tools are aimed at those taking part in the ARRL FMT, but are also useful for general frequency measurement
       and calibration. They are included within the WSJT-X package for use with the FreqCal mode of WSJT-X.

       The input FILE is normally the output of the fmtavg(1) tool, after adjusting to remove bad sources. Results are saved in fmeasure.out and are suitable for entry to the ARRL Frequency Measuring Test
       (FMT).
