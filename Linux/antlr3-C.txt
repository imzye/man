   void* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::custom
       Pointer for you, the programmer to add anything you like to an exception.

   ANTLR3_UINT32 ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::decisionNum
       decision number for NVE

       Referenced by noViableAlt().

   ANTLR3_UINT32 ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::expecting
       Indicates the token we were expecting to see next when the error occurred.

       Referenced by displayRecognitionError(), mismatch(), mismatchIsUnwantedToken(), and recoverFromMismatchedToken().

   pANTLR3_BITSET_LIST ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::expectingSet
       Indicates a set of tokens that we were expecting to see one of when the error occurred. It is a following bitset list, so you can use load it and use ->toIntList() on it to generate an array of
       integer tokens that it represents.

       Referenced by displayRecognitionError().

   void(* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::freeCustom) (void *custom)
       Pointer to a routine that is called to free the custom exception structure when the exception is destroyed. Set to NULL if nothing should be done.

       Referenced by antlr3ExceptionFree().

   void(* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::freeEx) (struct ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct *ex)
       Referenced by antlr3ExceptionNew(), freeBR(), and reset().

   ANTLR3_BOOLEAN ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::freeMessage
       If set to ANTLR3_TRUE, this indicates that the message element of this structure should be freed by calling ANTLR3_FREE() when the exception is destroyed.

       Referenced by antlr3ExceptionFree(), and antlr3ExceptionNew().

   ANTLR3_MARKER ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::index
       Indicates the index of the 'token' we were looking at when the exception occurred.

       Referenced by antlr3RecognitionExceptionNew(), displayRecognitionError(), and recognitionException().

   pANTLR3_INT_STREAM ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::input
       Pointer to the input stream that this exception occurred in.

       Referenced by antlr3RecognitionExceptionNew().

   ANTLR3_UINT32 ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::line
       Track the line at which the error occurred in case this is generated from a lexer. We need to track this since the unexpected char doesn't carry the line info.

       Referenced by antlr3RecognitionExceptionNew(), displayRecognitionError(), and recognitionException().

   void* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::message
       The printable message that goes with this exception, in your preferred encoding format. ANTLR just uses ASCII by default but you can ignore these messages or convert them to another format or whatever
       of course. They are really internal messages that you then decide how to print out in a form that the users of your product will understand, as they are unlikely to know what to do with 'Recognition
       exception at: [[TOK_GERUND..... ' ;-)

   void* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::name
       The string name of the exception.

       Referenced by antlr3ExceptionNew(), antlr3MTExceptionNew(), antlr3MTNExceptionNew(), displayRecognitionError(), mismatch(), and recognitionException().

   struct ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::nextException
       Pointer to the next exception in the chain (if any)

       Referenced by antlr3ExceptionFree(), antlr3ExceptionPrint(), and antlr3RecognitionExceptionNew().

   void* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::node
       If this is a tree parser exception then the node is set to point to the node that caused the issue.

   void(* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::print) (struct ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct *ex)

   void* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::ruleName
       Rule name for failed predicate exception.

   ANTLR3_UINT32 ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::state
       State for NVE.

       Referenced by noViableAlt().

   pANTLR3_STRING ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::streamName
       Name of the file/input source for reporting. Note that this may be NULL!!

       Referenced by antlr3RecognitionExceptionNew(), and displayRecognitionError().

   void* ANTLR3_EXCEPTION_struct::token
       Indicates what the current token/tree was when the error occurred. Since not all input streams will be able to retrieve the nth token, we track it here instead. This is for parsers, and even tree
       parsers may set this.
