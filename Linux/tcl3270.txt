NAME
       tcl3270 - IBM host access tool

SYNOPSIS
       tcl3270 [script [script-arg...]] [-- [tcl3270-options] [s3270-options] [host]
       tcl3270 [script [script-arg...]] [-- [tcl3270-options] [s3270-options] [session-file.tcl3270]
       tcl3270 -v
       tcl3270 --help

DESCRIPTION
       tcl3270 opens a telnet connection to an IBM host, then allows a Tcl script to control the host login session.  It is derived from s3270(1), a script-based IBM 3270 emulator.

       For  each  action  supported  by  s3270,  tcl3270 defines a correcponding Tcl command.  The result of the Tcl command is the output of the s3270 action.  If the output is one line, the result is a
       string.  If the output is multiple lines, the result is a list of strings.

       On the command line, a session file can be named either name.tcl3270 or name.s3270.  Resource values, such as those used in -xrm options or in a session file, can be specified as  tcl3270.resource
       or s3270.resource.

TCL3270-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       -d     Turns on debugging information, tracing data going between tcl3270 and s3270.
