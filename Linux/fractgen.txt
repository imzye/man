NAME
       fractgen — Fractal Generator

SYNOPSIS
       fractgen

DESCRIPTION
       fractgen
        FractGen is a simple Qt-based fractal generator program for Mandelbrot
        fractals. The image size is only limited by virtual memory. It is possible
        to zoom into images. Image parameters can be saved in XML files and loaded
        from XML files. Calculated images can be exported as PNG files.
        The intention of this program is to generate graphics to be post-processed
        by other image tools, e.g. in order to generate nice screen backgrounds or
        book covers.
