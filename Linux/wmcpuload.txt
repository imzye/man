NAME
       wmcpuload - A dockapp to display CPU usage

SYNOPSIS
       wmcpuload [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmcpuload command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.

       WMCPULoad  is  a  dockapp  that  is  supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment. It displays the current CPU usage, expressed as a percentile and a
       chart, and has an LCD look-alike user interface. The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button over the application. If the CPU usage hits a  certain  threshold,  an  alarm-mode
       will alert you by turning on back-light.
