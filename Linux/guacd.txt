NAME
       guacctl -  Guacamole control utility

SYNOPSIS
       guacctl [OPTION] [FILE or NAME]...

DESCRIPTION
       Utility for sending Guacamole-specific console codes for controlling a terminal session, such as:

        * Downloading files (SSH only)
        * Setting the destination directory for uploads (SSH only)
        * Redirecting output to a named pipe stream (SSH or telnet)

       This script may also be run as "guacget", in which case the script accepts no options and assumes anything given on the commandline is a file to be downloaded.

OPTIONS

       -d FILE...  download each of the files listed

       -s DIRECTORY
              set the destination directory for future uploaded files

       -o NAME
              redirect output to a new pipe stream with the given name

       -c     close any existing pipe stream and redirect output back to the terminal emulator
