Class::Trait::Base(3pm)                                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                                         Class::Trait::Base(3pm)

NAME
       Class::Trait::Base - Base class for all Traits

SYNOPSIS
       This class needs to be inherited by all traits so they can be identified as traits.

               use Class::Trait 'base';

DESCRIPTION
       Not much going on here, just an AUTOLOAD method to help properly dispatch calls to "SUPER::" and an "apply" method.

   apply
         require TSomeTrait;
         TSomeTrait->apply($object);

       This method allows you to apply a trait to an object.  It returns the trait so you can then reapply it:

        TTricks->apply($dog_object)
               ->apply($cat_object);

       This is merely syntactic sugar for the "Class::Trait::apply" method:

        Class::Trait->apply($dog_object, 'TTricks');
        Class::Trait->apply($cat_object, 'TTricks');
