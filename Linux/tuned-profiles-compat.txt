NAME
       tuned-profiles-compat - description of profiles provided for backward compatibility

DESCRIPTION
       These  profiles are provided for backward compatibility with the tuned-1x.  They are no longer maintained and may be dropped anytime in the future.  It's not recommended to use them for purposes other
       than backward compatibility.  Some of them are only aliases to base TuneD profiles. Please do not use the compat profiles on new installations and rather use profiles from base tuned package or  other
       tuned subpackages.

PROFILES
       The following profiles are considered compatibility profiles:

       default
              It is the lowest of the available profiles in regard to power saving and only enables CPU and disk plugins of TuneD.

       desktop-powersave
              A power saving profile directed at desktop systems. Enables ALPM power saving for SATA host adapters as well as the CPU, ethernet and disk plugins of TuneD.

       server-powersave
              A power saving profile directed at server systems. Enables ALPM power saving for SATA host adapters, and activates the CPU and disk plugins of TuneD.

       laptop-ac-powersave
              Medium power saving profile directed at laptops running on AC. Enables ALPM power saving for SATA host adapters,  WiFi power saving as well as CPU, ethernet and disk plugins of TuneD.

       laptop-battery-powersave
              Strong power saving profile directed at laptops running on battery. Currently an alias to powersave profile.

       spindown-disk
              Strong power saving profile directed at machines with classic HDDs. It enables aggressive disk spin-down. Disk writeback values are increased and disk swappiness is lowered. Log syncing is dis‐
              abled. All partitions are remounted with 'noatime' option.

       enterprise-storage
              Server profile for high disk throughput performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms and enables hugepages. Disk readahead values are increased.  CPU governor is set to performance.
