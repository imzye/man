NAME
       w1retap - Data logger for 1-Wire weather sensors

SYNOPSIS
       w1retap [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The w1retap package reads weather sensors on a 1-Wire bus and data logs the retrieved data to the configured databases or files. It supports a number of different 1-Wire host bus adapters and
       1-Wire sensors designed by Dallas Semiconductor Corp (now Maxim Integrated) and compatible sensors including those from AAG Electrónica and other hobby sensors.

OPTIONS

       -i, --interface=DEVICE
           Interface device, the DEVICE can be serial DS2480 adaptor or a USB DS2490-1 adaptor. Use the serial device node (eg /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyUSB0) for serial or use DS2490-1 to use libusb for a
           USB adaptor.

       -t, --cycle-time=SECS
           Time (secs) between device readings

       -N, --dont-read
           Don’t read sensors (for debugging)

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose messages

       -o, --vane-offset=VAL
           Value for N for weather vane (0-15)

       -V, --version
           Display version number (and exit)

       -s, --simulate
           Simulate readings (for testing, not yet implemented)

       -u, --use-utc
           Store dates as UTC (vice localtime)

       -r, --report-log=FILE
           Report log file

       •   $ w1retap -l -i /dev/ttyUSBS0 -v

SIGNALS
       The w1retap daemon accepts three signals. SIGUSR1 causes it to read all the sensors immediately. SIGUSR2 causes it to print the current configuration. SIGHUP causes it to re-read the
       configuration.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           Returns 0 on success or failure
