NAME
       al_release_haptic_effect - Allegro 5 API

SYNOPSIS
              #include <allegro5/allegro.h>

              bool al_release_haptic_effect(ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_EFFECT_ID *id)

DESCRIPTION
       Releases  a previously uploaded haptic effect from the device it has been uploaded to, allowing for other effects to be uploaded.  The play_id must be a valid ALLEGRO_HAPTIC_EFFECT_ID(3alleg5) ob‐
       tained from al_upload_haptic_effect(3alleg5), al_upload_and_play_haptic_effect(3alleg5) or al_rumble_haptic(3alleg5).

       This function is called automatically when you call al_release_haptic(3alleg5) on a ALLEGRO_HAPTIC(3alleg5) for all effects that are still uploaded to the device.  Therefore this function is  most
       useful if you want to upload and release haptic effects dynamically, for example as a way to circumvent the limit imposed by al_get_max_haptic_effects(3alleg5).

       Returns true on success, false if the effect couldn’t be released for any reason such as when NULL is passed, the effect is not active or failure to release the effect by the driver.

SINCE
       5.1.8

              [Unstable API]: Perhaps could be simplified due to limited support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.  Awaiting feedback from users.
