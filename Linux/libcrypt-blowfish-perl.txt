Blowfish(3pm)                                                                       User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                       Blowfish(3pm)

NAME
       Crypt::Blowfish - Perl Blowfish encryption module

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::Blowfish;
         my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;
         my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
         my $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

         You probably want to use this in conjunction with
         a block chaining module like Crypt::CBC.

DESCRIPTION
       Blowfish is capable of strong encryption and can use key sizes up to 56 bytes (a 448 bit key).  You're encouraged to take advantage of the full key size to ensure the strongest encryption possible
       from this module.

       Crypt::Blowfish has the following methods:

        blocksize()
        keysize()
        encrypt()
        decrypt()

FUNCTIONS
       blocksize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the block cipher.

           Crypt::Blowfish doesn't return a key size due to its ability to use variable-length keys.  More accurately, it shouldn't, but it does anyway to play nicely with others.

       new
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;

           This creates a new Crypt::Blowfish BlockCipher object, using $key, where $key is a key of keysize() bytes (minimum of eight bytes).

       encrypt
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;
                   my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);

           This function encrypts $plaintext and returns the $ciphertext where $plaintext and $ciphertext must be of blocksize() bytes.  (hint:  Blowfish is an 8 byte block cipher)

       decrypt
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;
                   my $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           This function decrypts $ciphertext and returns the $plaintext where $plaintext and $ciphertext must be of blocksize() bytes.  (hint:  see previous hint)

EXAMPLE
               my $key = pack("H16", "0123456789ABCDEF");  # min. 8 bytes
               my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;
               my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt("plaintex");  # SEE NOTES
               print unpack("H16", $ciphertext), "\n";

PLATFORMS
               Please see the README document for platforms and performance
               tests.

NOTES
       The  module  is capable of being used with Crypt::CBC.  You're encouraged to read the perldoc for Crypt::CBC if you intend to use this module for Cipher Block Chaining modes.  In fact, if you have
       any intentions of encrypting more than eight bytes of data with this, or any other block cipher, you're going to need some type of block chaining help.  Crypt::CBC tends to be very good  at  this.
       If you're not going to encrypt more than eight bytes, your data must be exactly eight bytes long.  If need be, do your own padding. "\0" as a null byte is perfectly valid to use for this.
