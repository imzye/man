NAME
       claws-mail-fancy-plugin - HTML rendering of mails using WebKit library

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-fancy-plugin.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-fancy-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin enables viewing HTML mails (and HTML attachments) within the Claws Mail message window using the GTK port of the WebKit library.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named fancy.so, and press the “Open”
       button.
