HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Forbidden(3pm)                                       User Contributed Perl Documentation                                       HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Forbidden(3pm)

NAME
       HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Forbidden - 403 Forbidden

VERSION
       version 0.028

DESCRIPTION
       The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.  Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.  If the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to
       make public why the request has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the reason for the refusal in the entity. If the server does not wish to make this information available to the client, the
       status code 404 (Not Found) can be used instead.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
