INSTALLDEB-HUNSPELL(1)                                                                                                                                                               INSTALLDEB-HUNSPELL(1)

NAME
       installdeb-hunspell - debhelper-like utility for maintainers of  Debian packages

SYNOPSIS
        installdeb-hunspell [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       installdeb-hunspell is a debhelper like program that is responsible for installing appropriate debhelper snippets in a package, according to the Debian Spell Dictionaries and Tools Policy.

       For more details, see
        /usr/share/doc/dictionaries-common-dev/dsdt-policy.txt.gz

       The actions executed by installdeb-hunspell are the following:

       •   Maintainer Scripts

           installdeb-hunspell installs the necessary scraps of code in the postinst and postrm scripts.

       •   Language info file

           installdeb-hunspell also checks a file containing

           information, called debian/info-hunspell or debian/package.info-hunspell.  If this file is successfully parsed, it is installed in the /var/lib/dictionaries-common/hunspell directory.

       •   Substvars substitutions

           This script will populate a substvars file, so Depends line in control file can contain ${hunspell:Depends} to automatically care for dictionaries-common dependencies.

           This requires "Build-Depends" on at least dictionaries-common-dev 1.23.0 and is highly recommended.

       •   Debconf files

           As  opposed  to  installdeb-ispell  and  installdeb-wordlist, neither installdeb-aspell nor installdeb-hunspell do anything related to debconf files, since both aspell and hunspell rely on the
           environment variable "LANG" for default dictionary selection instead of using symlinks set after a debconf question on dictionary installation.  For that reason if  you  need  to  add  debconf
           stuff with debhelper to your aspell or hunspell dictionary package do it in the usual way and call dh_installdebconf(1) as for any other package.

OPTIONS
       The usual dephelper(1) options are accepted.

NOTES
       This program is not part of debhelper, although it is intended to be used in hunspell dictionary packages using debhelper in its building.
