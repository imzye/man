NAME
       MOC - Console audio player

SYNOPSIS
       mocp [OPTIONS] [FILE|DIR ...]

DESCRIPTION
       MOC is a console audio player with simple ncurses interface.  It supports OGG, WAV, MP3 and other formats.  Just run mocp, go to some directory using the menu and press enter to start playing the
       file.  The program will automatically play the rest of the files in the directory.

       With no options and no file arguments the program begins in current directory, or in MusicDir if the StartInMusicDir option is set in the configuration file.  If you give a directory on the com‐
       mand line, MOC will try to go there.  If a playlist is given, then it is loaded.  With multiple files, playlists or directories, everything will be added to the playlist recursively (including the
       contents of any playlist given).  (Note that relative paths in playlists are resolved with respect to the directory of the playlist, or of the symlink being used to reference it.)

OPTIONS
       If an option can also be set in the configuration file the command line overrides it (but see the -O option for the list-valued configuration file options exception).

       -D, --debug
              Run  MOC  in debug mode.  The client and server log a lot of information to debug files.  Don't use this; the server log is large.  This is only available if MOC was compiled without --dis‐
              able-debug.

       -S, --server
              Run only the server and exit.

       -F, --foreground
              Implies -S.  Run the server in foreground and log everything to stdout.

       -R NAME[:...], --sound-driver NAME[:...]
              Use the specified sound driver(s).  They can be OSS, ALSA, JACK, SNDIO or null (for debugging).  Some of the drivers may not have been compiled in.  This option is called SoundDriver in the
              configuration file.

       -m, --music-dir
              Start in MusicDir (set in the configuration file).  This can be also set in the configuration file as StartInMusicDir.

       -q, --enqueue
              Add files given after command line options to the queue.  Don't start the interface.

       -a, --append
              Append files, directories (recursively) and playlists given after command line options to the playlist.  Don't start the interface.

       -c, --clear
              Clear the playlist.

       -p, --play
              Start playing from the first item on the playlist.

       -l, --playit
              Play files given on the command line without modifying the clients' playlists.

       -f, --next
              Request playing the next song from the server's playlist.

       -r, --previous
              Request playing the previous song from the server's playlist.

       -s, --stop
              Request the server to stop playing.

       -x, --exit
              Bring down the server.

       -P, --pause
              Request the server to pause playing.

       -U, --unpause
              Request the server to resume playing when paused.

       -G, --toggle-pause
              Toggle between play and pause.

       -k [+|-]N, --seek [+|-]N
              Seek forward (positive) or backward (negative) by N seconds in the file currently being played.

       -T THEME, --theme THEME
              Use a theme file.  If the path is not absolute, the file will be searched for in /usr/share/moc/themes/ (depends on installation prefix), ~/.moc/themes/ and the current directory.

       -C FILE, --config FILE
              Use the specified configuration file (which must be readable) instead of the default.  As this file can specify commands which invoke other applications MOC will refuse to start  if  it  is
              not owned by either root or the current user, or if it is writable by anyone other than its owner.

       --no-config
              Do not read any configuration file but use the built-in defaults.

       -O NAME[+]=VALUE, --set-option NAME[+]=VALUE
              Override  configuration  file  option NAME with VALUE.  This option can be repeated as many times as needed and the option name is not case sensitive.  Most option values are set before the
              configuration file is processed (which allows the new values to be picked up by substitutions); however, list-valued options are overridden afterwards (which gives the choice of whether the
              configured values are replaced or added to).

              See the example configuration file (config.example) for a description of the options available.

              Examples: -O AutoNext=no
                        -O messagelingertime=1 -O XTerms+=xxt:xwt

              Note that MOC does not perform variable substitution as it does for values read from the configuration file.

       -M DIR, --moc-dir DIR
              Use the specified MOC directory instead of the default.  This also causes the configuration file from that directory to be used.  This can also be specified in the configuration file  using
              the MOCDir option.

       -y, --sync
              This copy of the interface will synchronize its playlist with other clients.  This option is called SyncPlaylist in the configuration file.

       -n, --nosync
              This copy of the interface will not synchronize its playlist with other clients (see above).

       -A, --ascii
              Use ASCII characters to draw lines.  (This helps on some terminals.)

       -i, --info
              Print the information about the file currently being played.

       -Q FORMAT_STRING, --format FORMAT_STRING
              Print information about the file currently being played using a format string.  Replace string sequences with the actual information:

                       %state     State
                       %file      File
                       %title     Title
                       %artist    Artist
                       %song      SongTitle
                       %album     Album
                       %tt        TotalTime
                       %tl        TimeLeft
                       %ts        TotalSec
                       %ct        CurrentTime
                       %cs        CurrentSec
                       %b         Bitrate
                       %r         Rate

              It is also possible to use variables from the FormatString configuration file option.

       -e, --recursively
              Alias of -a for backward compatibility.

       -h, --help
              Print a list of options with short descriptions and exit.

       --usage
              Print a synopsis of the mocp command and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the program version and exit.

       --echo-args
              Print the POPT-interpreted command line arguments and exit.

       -v [+|-]N, --volume [+|-]N
              Adjust the mixer volume.  You can set (-v 50) or adjust (-v +10, -v -10).

       -t OPTION[,...], --toggle OPTION[,...]
       -o OPTION[,...], --on OPTION[,...]
       -u OPTION[,...], --off OPTION[,...]
              Followed  by  a list of identifiers, these will control MOC's playlist options.  Valid identifiers are shuffle, repeat and autonext.  They can be shortened to 's', 'r' and 'n' respectively.
              Both the identifiers and short forms are case insensitive.

              Example: -t shuffle,R,n
                       would toggle shuffle, repeat and autonext all at once.

       -j N{s|%}, --jump N{s|%}
              Jump to some position in the current file.  N is the number of seconds (when followed by an 's') or the percent of total file time (when followed by a '%').

              Examples: -j 10s, -j 50%

USING POPT ALIASES
       MOC uses the POPT library to process its command line.  This allows users to assign MOC options and arguments to an alias of their choosing.  The aliases are just lines in the  ~/.popt  text  file
       and have the general form:

              mocp alias newoption expansion

       This  works  as  if  expansion textually replaces newoption on the command line.  The replacement is recursive; that is, other newoptions can be embedded in the expansion.  The expansion is parsed
       similarly to a shell command, which allows \, ", and ' to be used for quoting.  If a backslash is the final character on a line, the next line in the file is assumed to be a  logical  continuation
       of the line containing the backslash, just as in the shell.  The newoption can be either a short or long option, and any syntactically valid name the user wishes to use.

       If  you  add a description for the new option and/or for any argument by appending the special POPT options --POPTdesc and --POPTargs, then the option will be displayed in the output of --help and
       --usage.  The value for these two options are strings of the form $"string".

       So, for example:

              mocp alias --single -D --set-option autonext=no \
                         --POPTdesc=$"Play just the file selected"

       would allow the user to turn on logging (-D) and override the configuration file's AutoNext option setting just by using --single as an option to the mocp command.

       Sometimes you may wish to provide values to aliased options from the command line.  If just one aliased option has such a value, then it's a simple matter of placing it last:

              mocp alias --yours --sound-driver OSS --theme

       when used like this:

              mocp --yours your_theme

       would result in:

              mocp --sound-driver OSS --theme your_theme

       But aliasing multiple options with such values means making use of the special construct !#:+ (and quoting carefully):

              mocp alias -1 "-R !#:+" "-T my_theme" "-O !#:+"

       when used like this:

              mocp -1 OSS shuffle=yes ~/my_music

       would result in:

              mocp -R OSS -T my_theme -O shuffle=yes ~/my_music

       There is also a ~/.popt entry which allows for the execution of a different program when the associated option is used.  For this, an exec is used in place of the alias and the  expansion  is  the
       program to be executed:

              mocp exec --help /usr/bin/man 1 mocp \
                         POPTdesc=$"Provide the man page instead of help"

       This would override the usual MOC --help output and use the system's man program to present this man page instead.

       Note that while ~/.popt (or /etc/popt) is the default POPT configuration file, you can nominate specific file(s) to be used instead via the MOCP_POPTRC environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables are used directly by MOC.  Additional variables may be relevant to the libraries MOC uses.  Also, any environment environment variable may be substituted into a
       configuration file option value (see the 'config.example' file for details).

       ESCDELAY
              An  ncurses(3X) variable which specifies the delay (in milliseconds) after which it will treat an ESC as a standalone key and not part of an escaped character sequence (such as is generated
              by function keys).  MOC sets this value to 25ms by default, which is sufficient for most systems.

       HOME   Tells MOC where your home directory is located and is used for various purposes, including the default location of the MOC directory.

       MOCP_OPTS
              The value of this variable will be prepended to the command line options before they are processed.

       MOCP_POPTRC
              A colon-separated list of POPT configuration files which will be loaded in sequence by MOC during initialisation.  If the variable is unset then the default POPT configuration file will  be
              used.   If  the  variable  is set but empty then no POPT configuration file will be loaded.  If the variable is set then those files which exist will be loaded and those which don't will be
              skipped.

              As these files can specify commands which invoke other applications, MOC will refuse to start if they are not owned by root or the current user, or they are writable by  anyone  other  than
              their owner.

       TERM and WINDOW
              Used by MOC to distinguish between X-terminals, screen(1) and console terminals.  MOC uses the configuration file options XTerms and ScreenTerms to help make this determination.

FILES
       ~/.moc MOC directory for the configuration file, socket, the pid file and other data.

       ~/.moc/config
              Configuration  file  for  MOC.  The format is very simple; to see how to use it look at the example configuration file (config.example) distributed with the program.  The example file fully
              describes all the configuration options, and so is a useful reference when using the -O option.  As this file can specify commands which invoke other applications MOC will refuse  to  start
              if it is not owned by either root or the current user, or if it is writable by anyone other than its owner.

       ~/.popt
       /etc/popt
              The default files POPT reads to obtain aliased options.  As these files can specify commands which invoke other applications, MOC will refuse to start if it is not owned by root or the cur‐
              rent user, or if it is writable by anyone other than its owner.  (Also see the MOCP_POPTRC environment variable above.)

       ~/.moc/themes
       /usr/share/moc/themes
              Default directories for the theme files.

       /usr/share/moc/decoder_plugins
              Default directories for the audio decoder plugins.

       mocp_client_log
       mocp_server_log
              Client and server log files.  These files are created in the directory in which the client and server are started.  (Also see the -D option.)

BUGS
       Command line options that affect the server behaviour (like --sound-driver) are ignored if the server is already running at the time of executing mocp.  The user is not warned about this.
