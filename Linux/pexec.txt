NAME
       pexec - executing commands in parallel

SYNOPSIS
       pexec [options] [-c|-m] [--] command [arguments] | 'compound command'

DESCRIPTION
       Execute commands or shell scripts in parallel on a single host or on remote hosts using a remote shell.

OPTIONS
   General options:
       -h, --help
              Gives general summary about the command line options.

       --long-help
              Gives a detailed list of command line options.

       --version
              Gives some version information about the program.

       -s, --shell <shell>
              Full path (e.g. /bin/sh) of the shell or interpreter to be used for script execution.

       -c, --shell-command
              Use the specified shell to interpret the command(s) instead of direct execution.

       -m, --multiple-command
              Allow multiple individual shell command scripts to be executed in parallel with the variation of the parameters.

       -e, --environment <variable>
              Name of an environmental variable which is set to the respective parameter before each execution.

       -n, --number <number>
              The maximal number of processes running simultaneously. The <number> itself can even be a complex specification of remote hosts (see documentation for more details).

       -C, --control <port>
              The control port of a hypervisor daemon (full path of a UNIX socket or an INET host specification).

       -p, --list <list>
              The single-argument form of main parameter list.

       -r, --parameters <list>
              The multiple-argument form of the main parameter list.

       -f, --listfile <file>
              The main parameter list file.

       -w, --column <index>
              The column index from where the parameters should be taken if they are read from a parameter file.

       -t, --complete
              Threat the whole line as a single parameter if the parameters are read from a file.

       -z, --nice
              Sets the scheduling priority of pexec and all children (executed processes) to the priority defined by this nice value.

       --     A marker after which the command to execute begins.

   Redirecting standard input, output and error:
       -i, --input <input>
              The (optionally formatted) name of the input file which is used for redirecting the standard input.

       -o, --output <output>
              The (optionally formatted) name of the output file which is used for redirecting the standard output.

       -u, --error <output>
              The (optionally formatted) name of the output error file, which is used for redirecting the standard error.

       -R, --normal-redirection
              Equivalent to specifying --output -, --error - and --input /dev/null.

       -a, --output-format <format>
              The format of the final standard output redirection if the output of all of the processes are gathered into the same file.

       -b, --error-format <format>
              The same final redirection format for the standard error.

       -x, --omit-newlines
              Disable automatic newlines after the output and error formats.

   Execution using remote hosts:
       -g, --remote-shell <remote_shell>
              The name or full path of the remote shell to be used for building the tunnel between the local and the peer host(s). Default: ``/usr/bin/ssh''.

       -P, --pexec <pexec>
              The full path of the pexec program on the remote hosts. If this option is omitted, pexec tries to figure out from the invoking syntax and/or the current path.

       -T, --tunnel
              Internal use only (pexec will start in tunnel daemon mode).

   Remote control, mutual exclusions and atomic command execution:
       -y, --bind <port>
              This option lets pexec to be remote controlled via INET or UNIX domain sockets.

       -E, --pexec-connection-variable <env>
              This  option  overrides  the  default  environment name PEXEC_REMOTE_PORT to the specified value, which is used by the ``-p|--connect auto'' combination to determine the control socket with
              which the running pexec instance can be controlled.

       -j, --remote
              Used to remote control and/or poll the status of other running instances of pexec.

       -p, --connect <port>
              Remote control port to connect to.

       -t, --status
              Prints the actual status of the running jobs in a human-readable form.

       -l, --lock <mutex>
              Locks the specified mutex (if the mutex is not locked by someone else, otherwise it will block until the mutex is released).

       -u, --unlock <mutex>
              Unlocks the specified mutex.

       -m, --mutex <mutex>
              Name of the mutex.

       -d, --dump <filename>
              Dump the content of the given file to standard output, if ``-m|--mutex'' is given, this will be atomic.

       -s, --save <filename>
              Save the content of standard input to the given file, if ``-m|--mutex'' is given, this will be atomic.

       -a, --atomic <command>
              Execute the given command. If ``-m|--mutex'' is given, the exectution is going to be atomic with respect to that mutex.

   Hypervisor mode:
       -H, --hypervisor
              Starts pexec in hypervisor mode.

       -C, --control <port>
              The control port used by the hypervisor.

       -l, --load <window>
              Use load also to limit the number of simultaneous processes with the specified load average interval (0, 1 or 2, or 1min, 5min or 15min, respectively).

       -f, --fifo
              First in first out queue processing.

       -s, --lifo
              Last in first out (stack) queue processing (default).

   Logging:
       -L, --log <file>
              The name of the log file.

       -W, --log-level <level>
              The logging level.

       -V, --verbose
              Increase the log level by one.
