NAME
       icnsutil - Utility to convert between '.iconset' and '.icns' files.

SYNOPSIS
       iconutil -c {icns | iconset} [-o file] file

DESCRIPTION
       icnsutil is intended to be a functional clone of the Darwin iconutil,
        which converts between '.iconset' and '.icns' files. The tool takes a
        single source '.icns' file or '.iconset' and converts it to either a
        '.icns' or '.iconset' depending on the value of the -c flag's
        argument.

        It is possible to specify the name of the output file by passing the
        file path as the argument to the -o flag. If -o is not set iconutil
        will write converted '.icns' file or '.iconset' to the same directory
        as the source file using the same file name with the correct extension
        for the output type.
