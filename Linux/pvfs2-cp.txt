PVFS2-CP(1)                 General Commands Manual                PVFS2-CP(1)

NAME
       pvfs2-cp – copy files to and from OrangeFS volumes

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-cp  [-s  strip_size] [-n num_datafiles] [-b buffer_size_in_bytes]
       [-tv] src_file dst_file

DESCRIPTION
       The pvfs2-cp utility copies the file src_file  to  dst_file  where  the
       files may either be on OrangeFS volumes or local files.  When operating
       on OrangeFS volumes it works  through  the  OrangeFS  library  and  not
       through the kernel interface.

       The options are as follows:

       -s     Specify  a  strip size to use when creating dst_file.  This only
              applies to OrangeFS volumes.

       -n     Specify a number of datafiles to  use  when  creating  dst_file.
              This only applies to OrangeFS volumes.

       -b     Use an intermediate buffer of buffer_size bytes when copying the
              file.

       -t     Report some timing information.

       -v     Print version number and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       PVFS2_DEBUGFILE
              If set to the path of a local file, redirect debug output to it.

       PVFS2_DEBUGMASK
              Set the OrangeFS debug mask.  Possible masks are  documented  in
              pvfs2-set-debugmask(1).

       PVFS2TAB_FILE
              If set, the full pathname for an alternate pvfs2tab file

FILES
       /etc/pvfs2tab

EXAMPLES
       Copy  the  file  /etc/motd to /mnt/bar.  If /mnt is an OrangeFS volume,
       this will copy the file into OrangeFS.

             pvfs2-cp /etc/motd /mnt/bar

CAVEATS
       When dst_file is a directory  the  utility  does  not  work.   In  this
       respect it is different than the cp(1) utility.
