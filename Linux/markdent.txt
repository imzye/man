NAME
       markdent-html - Turn Markdown into HTML with Markdent

VERSION
       version 0.40

SYNOPSIS
           $> markdent-html --file ./path/to/text.md

DESCRIPTION
       This tool turns Markdown into HTML using Markdent.

OPTIONS
       This tool accepts the following command line options:

   --file
       The file containing the Markdown to process. You must provide this or "--text", but not both.

       Pass "-" to read from "STDIN".

   --text
       The Markdown text to process. You must provide this or "--file", but not both.

   --title
       If you pass then the output will be a full HTML document containing this as the "<title>" tag. If this isn't passed then the output will be a HTML fragment with no "<html>" or "<body>" tags.

   --charset
       If you pass with a "--title" it will be used to populate a "<meta charset="...">" tag for the document.

   --language
       If you pass with a "--title" it will be used to set the "lang" attribute for the document's "<html>" tag.

   --dialects
       You can add one or more dialects to the standard parser with this option. This can either be a full class name like "Markdent::Dialect::GitHub" or just a short name like "GitHub".
