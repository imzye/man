NAME
       Dist::CheckConflicts - declare version conflicts for your dist

VERSION
       version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
           use Dist::CheckConflicts
               -dist => 'Class-MOP',
               -conflicts => {
                   'Moose'                => '1.14',
                   'namespace::autoclean' => '0.08',
               },
               -also => [
                   'Package::Stash::Conflicts',
               ];

           __PACKAGE__->check_conflicts;

DESCRIPTION
       One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules. This module attempts to work around this issue by
       allowing you to specify conflicting versions of modules separately, and deal with them after the module is done installing.

       For instance, say you have a module "Foo", and some other module "Bar" uses "Foo". If "Foo" were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would cause "Bar" to break until it is
       updated to use the new API. "Foo" can't just depend on the fixed version of "Bar", because this will cause a circular dependency (because "Bar" is already depending on "Foo"), and this doesn't
       express intent properly anyway - "Foo" doesn't use "Bar" at all. The ideal solution would be for there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that would let CPAN clients
       update conflicting modules automatically after an existing module is upgraded, but until that happens, this module will allow users to do this manually.

       This module accepts a hash of options passed to its "use" statement, with these keys being valid:

       -conflicts
           A hashref of conflict specifications, where keys are module names, and values are the last broken version - any version greater than the specified version should work.

       -also
           Additional  modules  to  get  conflicts  from (potentially recursively). This should generally be a list of modules which use Dist::CheckConflicts, which correspond to the dists that your dist
           depends on. (In an ideal world, this would be intuited directly from your dependency list, but the dependency list isn't available outside of build time).

       -dist
           The name of the distribution, to make the error message from check_conflicts more user-friendly.

       The methods listed below are exported by this module into the module that uses it, so you should call these methods on your module, not Dist::CheckConflicts.

       As an example, this command line can be used  to  update  your  modules,  after  installing  the  "Foo"  dist  (assuming  that  "Foo::Conflicts"  is  the  module  in  the  "Foo"  dist  which  uses
       Dist::CheckConflicts):

           perl -MFoo::Conflicts -e'print "$_\n"
               for map { $_->{package} } Foo::Conflicts->calculate_conflicts' | cpanm

       As an added bonus, loading your conflicts module will provide warnings at runtime if conflicting modules are detected (regardless of whether they are loaded before or afterwards).

METHODS
   conflicts
       Returns the conflict specification (the "-conflicts" parameter to "import()"), as a hash.

   dist
       Returns the dist name (either as specified by the "-dist" parameter to "import()", or the package name which "use"d this module).

   check_conflicts
       Examine the modules that are currently installed, and throw an exception with useful information if any modules are at versions which conflict with the dist.

   calculate_conflicts
       Examine  the  modules  that  are  currently  installed,  and  return  a list of modules which conflict with the dist. The modules will be returned as a list of hashrefs, each containing "package",
       "installed", and "required" keys.
