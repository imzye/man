NAME
       oddjobd-mkhomedir.conf - allow limited use of the mkhomedir functions

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/oddjobd.conf.d/oddjobd-mkhomedir.conf is typically processed along with other files in the /etc/oddjobd.conf.d directory.

       The mkhomedir helper itself accepts these options:

       -q     Refrain from outputting the usual "Creating home directory..." message when it creates a home directory.

       -n     Only create the home directory; do not populate it using the contents of the skeleton directory.

       -s     Override the location of the skeleton directory (by default: /etc/skel).

       -u     Specify  a  umask whose bits are masked off of contents of the skeleton directory while they are copied to the user's new home directory.  The default is read from /etc/login.defs by taking
              HOME_MODE and UMASK values, in this order.  First found value persists.
