NAME
       xmobar - A configurable and extensible status bar for X11 desktops

SYNOPSIS
       xmobar [OPTIONS] [CONFIG_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       xmobar is a minimalistic, text based, status bar.  It was originally designed and implemented by Andrea Rossato to work with xmonad, but it's actually usable with any window-manager.

       xmobar was inspired by the Ion3 (http://tuomov.iki.fi/software/) status bar, and supports similar features, like dynamic color management, output templates, and extensibility through plugins.

       This page documents xmobar 0.16.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       xmobar  can be either configured with a configuration file or with command line options. In the second case, the command line options will overwrite the corresponding options set in the configura‐
       tion file.

       The configuration file is searched for in the following locations, in order:

              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xmobar/xmobarrc (default: ~/.config/xmobar/xmobarrc)
              ~/.xmobarrc

       The first configuration file found will be used. See /usr/share/doc/xmobar/examples for sample configuration files.

       Usage:

             xmobar -B white -a right -F blue -t '%LIPB%' -c '[Run Weather "LIPB" [] 36000]'

       This is the list of command line options (the output of xmobar —help):
