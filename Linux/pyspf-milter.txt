NAME
       pyspf-milter - SPF checking filter for MTAs

VERSION
       3.1.0

SYNOPSIS
       pyspy-milter [configfile]

DESCRIPTION
       pyspf-milter implements the SPF standard for checking e-mail messages on a (mostly) per-domain basis.

       pyspf-milter uses the milter interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of sendmail(8), to provide SPF checking services for mail transiting a milter-aware MTA.

OPTIONS
       See    policyd-spf.conf (5) for information about available options. With the exception of specifying the configuration file to use, pyspf-milter does not support command line option switches.

NOTES
       When  using  DNS  timeouts  be sure not to use a timeout that is larger than the timeout being used for interaction between sendmail and the filter.  Otherwise, the MTA could abort a message while
       waiting for a reply from the filter, which in turn is still waiting for a DNS reply.

EXIT STATUS
       Filter exit status codes are selected according to sysexits(3).

HISTORY
       SPF is an amalgam of several earlier proposals.  It was originally specified in RFC 4408.  The current specification is RFC 7208.  The SPF related processing was developed for use with the Postfix
       unique policy service in the pypolicyd-spf project.  When the milter interface was added, the project was renamed SPF Engine.
