NAME
       ipkungfu - An iptables-based firewall for Linux

SYNOPSIS
       ipkungfu [ -c ] [ -t ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -v ] [ --quiet ] [ --panic ] [ --no-caching

DESCRIPTION
       ipkungfu  is  an iptables-based Linux firewall. The primary design goals are security, ease of use, and performance, in that order. It takes advantage of ad‐
       vanced features of iptables, tcpwrappers, and the Linux kernel. It also simplifies the configuration of internet connection sharing,  advanced  routing,  and
       other networking needs.

OPTIONS
       -c  (or  --check)
                   Check whether ipkungfu is loaded, and report any command line options it may have been loaded with.

       -t  (or  --test)
                   Runs  a  configuration test, and displays the results.  Note that this does not test or display all configuration options.  This gives you an op‐
                   portunity to verify that major configuration options are correct before putting them into action.

       -d  (or  --disable)
                   Disables the firewall.  It is important to know exactly what this option does.  All traffic is allowed in and out, and in the case of a  gateway,
                   all  NATed  traffic  is forwarded (the option retains your connection sharing options).  Custom rules are not implemented, and deny_hosts.conf is
                   ignored.

       -f  (or  --flush)
                   Disables the firewall COMPLETELY.  All rules are flushed, all chains are removed.  Any port forwarding or internet connection sharing will  cease
                   to work.

       -h  (or  --help)
                   Displays brief usage information and exits.

       -v  (or  --version)
                   Displays version information and exits.

       --quiet     Runs ipkungfu with no standard output

       --panic     Drops  ALL  traffic in all directions on all network interfaces.  You should probably never use this option.  The --panic option is available for
                   the highly unusual situation where you know that an attack is underway but you know of no other way to stop it.

       --failsafe  If ipkungfu fails, --failsafe will cause all firewall policies to revert to ACCEPT.  This is useful when working with ipkungfu remotely, to  pre‐
                   vent loss of remote access due to firewall failure.

       --no-caching
                   Disables rules caching feature.
