NAME
       newscache - Cache for Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP)

SYNOPSIS
       newscache [--version] [-h] [-v] [-f] [-c config-file] [-i] [-d] [-p] [-o]

DESCRIPTION
       NewsCache  is a free cache server for USENET News. NewsCache acts to news reading clients like a news server, except that it stores only those articles that have been requested by at least one client.
       NewsCache targets problems of the current News System like network bandwidth consumption or the IO load caused by news clients. NewsCache acts to the upstream news server like a news reader programm.

       It supports principles the following modes (for a detailed description read ServerSpec Configuration Options below):

       cached NewsCache store every retrieved article in his internal cache. If this article is retrieved by another news reader client, then NewsCache can get the article from his cache instead of  retriev‐
              ing this article again from the upstream newsserver.

       not-cached
              NewsCache act as a "proxy" and does'nt store retrieved article in his local cache. This is usefull for combined multiple local newsserver configuration.

       offline
              NewsCache  does'nt  connect  to the upstream newsserver. Only the specified newsgroups are retrieved by updatenews(8) and stored in the cache. This is usefull in dialup configurations. The news
              reader clients can only access this newsgroups.

       semi-offline, cached
              The overview informations are loaded with updatenews(8) and the articles retrieved by NewsCache, if a news reader client request it. The article is stored in the internal cache.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the Info files.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       -f --fqdn
              Print what newscache thinks is the fully qualified domain name.

       -c --configuration config-file

       -i --inetd
              newscache is used with inetd and read from stdin.

       -d --debug
              Do not detach.

       -p --print-parameter
              Print current parameter settings.

       -o --configuration-options
              Print all options specified in the configure phase.

SIGNALS
       SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT, SIGPIPE

              These signals instruct NewsCache to abort any existing transfers, close all connections and terminate the process. If the target of the signal is  the  daemon, all current child  processes  wil
              also be terminated.

       SIGHUP

              This  signal instruct NewsCache to reread its configuration file /etc/newscache.conf

NOTES
       Running NewsCache in inetd mode requires a correct inetd configuration. An example configuration line looks like:

       news stream tcp nowait news /usr/sbin/newscache -i

DIAGNOSTICS
       NewsCache  logs  diagnostics messages with the syslog priority debug. If NewsCache is configured with the --enabe-debug option, he produce much more messages (for details see the INSTALL file).  news‐
       cache -o prints out the actual configuration parameter.  In some error situation you can try to create a core dump file or debug a client process with gdb (for details  see  the  documentation  direc‐
       tory).
