NAME
       morsegen - convert file to ASCII morse code

SYNOPSIS
         morsegen <file>

DESCRIPTION
       This program implements the International Morse Code Standard by converting ASCII text file into morse code ASCII notation.

       Morse code was created for the telegraph in the early 1840s. Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals, punctuation and special
       characters of a given message.

       The morse code standard does not define all characters in ASCII table therefore translation of file into morse notation is only an approximation. The following special translation have been used:

           ASCII           Morse prosign
           ------------    ------------------
           ' ' (space)     Invitation to transmit
           \t              Starting signal
           \r              Wait
           \n              End of work
