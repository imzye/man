NAME
       task - A command line todo manager.

SYNOPSIS
       task <filter> <command> [ <mods> | <args> ]
       task --version

DESCRIPTION
       Taskwarrior is a command line todo list manager. It maintains a list of tasks that you want to do, allowing you to add/remove, and otherwise manipulate them.  Taskwarrior has a rich set of subcommands
       that allow you to do various things with it.

       At the core, Taskwarrior is a list processing program. You add text and additional related parameters and redisplay the information in a nice way.  It turns into a todo list program when you  add  due
       dates and recurrence. It turns into an organized todo list program when you add priorities, tags (one word descriptors), project groups, etc.

FILTER
       The <filter> consists of zero or more search criteria that select tasks.  For example, to list all pending tasks belonging to the 'Home' project:

         task project:Home list

       You can specify multiple filter terms, each of which further restricts the result:

         task project:Home +weekend garden list

       This example applies three filters: the 'Home' project, the 'weekend' tag, and the description or annotations must contain the character sequence 'garden'.  In this example, 'garden' is translated in‐
       ternally to:

         description.contains:garden

       as a convenient shortcut.  The 'contains' here is an attribute modifier, which is used to exert more control over the filter than simply absence or presence.  See the section 'ATTRIBUTE MODIFIERS' be‐
       low for a complete list of modifiers.

       Note  that  a filter may have zero terms, which means that all tasks apply to the command.  This can be dangerous, and this special case is confirmed, and cannot be overridden.  For example, this com‐
       mand:

         task modify +work
         This command has no filter, and will modify all tasks.  Are you sure? (yes/no)

       will add the 'work' tag to all tasks, but only after confirmation.

       More filter examples:

         task                                      <command> <mods>
         task 28                                   <command> <mods>
         task +weekend                             <command> <mods>
         task project:Home due.before:today        <command> <mods>
         task ebeeab00-ccf8-464b-8b58-f7f2d606edfb <command> <mods>

       By default filter elements are combined with an implicit 'and' operator, but 'or' and 'xor' may also be used, provided parentheses are included:

         task '( /[Cc]at|[Dd]og/ or /[0-9]+/ )'      <command> <mods>

       The parentheses isolate the logical term from any default command filter or implicit report filter which would be combined with an implicit 'and'.

       A filter may target specific tasks using ID or UUID numbers.  To specify multiple tasks use one of these forms (space-separated list of ID numbers, UUID numbers or ID ranges):

         task 1 2 3                                    delete
         task 1-3                                      info
         task 1 2-5 19                                 modify pri:H
         task 4-7 ebeeab00-ccf8-464b-8b58-f7f2d606edfb info

MODIFICATIONS
       The <mods> consist of zero or more changes to apply to the selected tasks, such as:

         task <filter> <command> project:Home
         task <filter> <command> +weekend +garden due:tomorrow
         task <filter> <command> Description/annotation text
         task <filter> <command> /from/to/     <- replace first match
         task <filter> <command> /from/to/g    <- replace all matches

SUBCOMMANDS
       Taskwarrior supports different kinds of commands.  There are read commands, write commands, miscellaneous commands and script helper commands.  Read commands do not allow modification of tasks.  Write
       commands  can  alter  almost  any aspect of a task.  Script helper commands are provided to help you write add-on scripts, for example, shell completion (only minimal output is generated, as with ver‐
       bose=nothing).

READ SUBCOMMANDS
       Reports are read subcommands. There are several reports currently predefined in Taskwarrior. The output and sort behavior of these reports can be configured in the configuration file. See also the man
       page taskrc(5).  There are also other read subcommands that are not reports.

       task --version
              This  is  the only conventional command line argument that Taskwarrior supports, and is intended for add-on scripts to verify the version number of an installed Taskwarrior without invoking the
              mechanisms that create default files.

       task <filter>
              With no command specified, the default command is run, and the filter applied.

       task <filter> active
              Shows all tasks matching the filter that are started but not completed.

       task <filter> all
              Shows all tasks matching the filter, including parents of recurring tasks.

       task <filter> blocked
              Shows all tasks matching the filter, that are currently blocked by other tasks.

       task <filter> blocking
              Shows all tasks matching the filter, that block other tasks.

       task <filter> burndown.daily
              Shows a graphical burndown chart, by day.

       task <filter> burndown.weekly
              Shows a graphical burndown chart, by week.  Note that 'burndown' is an alias to the 'burndown.weekly' report.

       task <filter> burndown.monthly
              Shows a graphical burndown chart, by month.

       task calendar [due|<month> <year>|<year>] [y]
              Shows a monthly calendar with due tasks marked.  Shows one horizontal line of months.  If the 'y' argument is provided, will show at least one complete year.  If a year  is  provided,  such  as
              '2015',  then  that full year is shown.  If both a month and a year are specified ('6 2015') then the months displayed begin at the specified month and year.  If the 'due' argument is provided,
              will show the starting month of the earliest due task.

       task colors [sample | legend]
              Displays all possible colors, a named sample, or a legend containing all currently defined colors.

       task columns [substring]
              Displays all supported columns and formatting styles.  Useful when creating custom reports.  If a substring is provided, only matching column names are shown.

       task commands
              Shows all the supported commands, with some details of each.

       task <filter> completed
              Shows all tasks matching the filter that are completed.

       task <filter> count
              Displays only a count of tasks matching the filter.

       task <filter> export
              Exports all tasks in the JSON format.  Redirect the output to a file, if you wish to save it, or pipe it to another command or script to convert it to another format. The standard task  release
              comes with a few example scripts, such as:

                export-csv.pl
                export-sql.py
                export-xml.py
                export-yaml.pl
                export-html.pl
                export-tsv.pl
                export-xml.rb
                export-ical.pl
                export-xml.pl
                export-yad.pl

       task <filter> ghistory.annual
              Shows a graphical report of task status by year.

       task <filter> ghistory.monthly
              Shows a graphical report of task status by month.  Note that 'ghistory' is an alias to 'ghistory.monthly'.

       task help
              Shows the long usage text.

       task <filter> history.annual
              Shows a report of task history by year.

       task <filter> history.monthly
              Shows a report of task history by month.  Note that 'history' is an alias to 'history.monthly'.

       task <filter> ids
              Applies the filter then extracts only the task IDs and presents them as a space-separated list.  This is useful as input to a task command, to achieve this:

                task $(task project:Home ids) modify priority:H

              This example first gets the IDs for the project:Home filter, then sets the priority to H for each of those tasks.  This can also be achieved directly:

                task project:Home modify priority:H

              This command is mainly of use to external scripts.

       task <filter> uuids
              Applies  the filter on all tasks (even deleted and completed tasks) then extracts only the task UUIDs and presents them as a comma-separated list.  This is useful as input to a task command, to
              achieve this:

                task $(task project:Home status:completed uuids) modify status:pending

              This example first gets the UUIDs for the project:Home and status:completed filters, then makes each of those tasks pending again.

              This command is mainly of use to external scripts.

       task udas
              Shows a list of UDAs that are defined, including their name, type, label and allowed values.  Also shows UDA usage and any orphan UDAs.

       task <filter> information
              Shows all data and metadata for the specified tasks.  This is the only means of displaying all aspects of a given task, including the change history.

       task <filter> list
              Provides a standard listing of tasks matching the filter.

       task <filter> long
              Provides the most detailed listing of tasks matching the filter.

       task <filter> ls
              Provides a short listing of tasks matching the filter.

       task <filter> minimal
              Provides a minimal listing of tasks matching the filter.

       task <filter> newest
              Shows the newest tasks matching the filter.

       task <filter> next
              Shows a page of the most urgent tasks, sorted by urgency, which is a calculated value.

       task <filter> ready
              Shows a page of the most urgent ready tasks, sorted by urgency.  A ready task is one that is either unscheduled, or has a scheduled date that is past and has no wait date.

       task <filter> oldest
              Shows the oldest tasks matching the filter.

       task <filter> overdue
              Shows all incomplete tasks matching the filter that are beyond their due date.

       task <filter> projects
              Lists all project names that are currently used by pending tasks, and the number of tasks for each.

       task <filter> recurring
              Shows all recurring tasks matching the filter.

       task <filter> unblocked
              Shows all tasks that are not currently blocked by other tasks, matching the filter.

       task <filter> waiting
              Shows all waiting tasks matching the filter.

WRITE SUBCOMMANDS
       task add <mods>
              Adds a new pending task to the task list.

       task <filter> annotate <mods>
              Adds an annotation to an existing task.

       task <filter> append <mods>
              Appends description text to an existing task.

       task <filter> delete <mods>
              Deletes the specified task from task list.

       task <filter> denotate <mods>
              Deletes an annotation for the specified task. If the provided description matches an annotation exactly, the corresponding annotation is deleted. If the provided description matches annotations
              partly, the first partly matched annotation is deleted.

       task <filter> done <mods>
              Marks the specified task as done.

       task <filter> duplicate <mods>
              Duplicates the specified task and allows modifications.

       task <filter> edit
              Launches  a text editor to let you modify all aspects of a task directly.  In general, this is not the recommended method of modifying tasks, but is provided for exceptional circumstances.  Use
              carefully.

       task import [<file> ...]
              Imports tasks in the JSON format.  Can be used to add new tasks, or update existing ones.  Tasks are identified by their UUID.

              If no file or "-" is specified, import tasks from STDIN.

              Setting rc.recurrence.confirmation to an appropriate level is recommended if import is to be used in automated workflows.  See taskrc(5).

              For importing other file formats, the standard task release comes with a few example scripts, such as:

                import-todo.sh.pl
                import-yaml.pl

       task log <mods>
              Adds a new task that is already completed, to the task list.

       task <filter> modify <mods>
              Modifies the existing task with provided information.

       task <filter> prepend <mods>
              Prepends description text to an existing task.

       task <filter> start <mods>
              Marks the specified tasks as started.

       task <filter> stop <mods>
              Removes the start time from the specified task.

MISCELLANEOUS SUBCOMMANDS
       Miscellaneous subcommands either accept no command line arguments, or accept non-standard arguments.

       task calc <expression>
              Evaluates an algebraic expression. Can be used to test how Taskwarrior parses and evaluates the expression given on the command line.

              Examples:

                  task calc 1 + 1
                  2

                  task calc now + 8d
                  2015-03-26T18:06:57

                  task calc eom
                  2015-03-31T23:59:59

       task config [name [value | '']]
              Add, modify and remove settings directly in the Taskwarrior configuration.  This command either modifies the 'name' setting with a new value of 'value', or adds a new entry that  is  equivalent
              to 'name=value':

                  task config name value

              This command sets a blank value.  This has the effect of suppressing any default value:

                  task config name ''

              Finally, this command removes any 'name=...' entry from the .taskrc file:

                  task config name

       task context <name>
              Sets the currently active context. See the CONTEXT section.

              Example:

                  task context work

       task context delete <name>
              Deletes the context with the name <name>. If the context being deleted is currently set as active, it will be unset.

              Example:

                  task context delete work

       task context define <name> <filter>
              Defines a new context with name <name> and definition <filter>. This command does not affect the currently set context, just adds a new context definition.

              Examples:

                  task context define work project:Work
                  task context define home project:Home or +home
                  task context define superurgent due:today and +urgent

       task context list
              Outputs a list of available contexts along with their definitions.

       task context none
              Clears the currently active context, if any was set.

       task context show
              Shows the currently active context, along with its definition.

       task diagnostics
              Shows  diagnostic information, of the kind needed when reporting a problem.  When you report a bug, it is likely that the platform, version, and environment are important.  Running this command
              generates a summary of similar information that should accompany a bug report.

              It includes compiler, library and software information.  It does not include any personal information, other than the location and size of your task data files.

              This command also performs a diagnostic scan of your data files looking for common problems, such as duplicate UUIDs.

       task execute <external command>
              Executes the specified command.  Not useful by itself, but when used in conjunction with aliases and extensions can provide seamless integration.

       task logo
              Displays the Taskwarrior logo.

       task reports
              Lists all supported reports.  This includes the built-in reports, and any custom reports you have defined.

       task show [all | substring]
              Shows all the current settings.  If a substring is specified just the settings containing that substring will be displayed.

       task <filter> stats
              Shows statistics of the tasks defined by the filter.

       task <filter> summary
              Shows a report of aggregated task status by project.

       task <filter> tags
              Show a list of all tags used. Any special tags used are highlighted. Note that virtual tags are not listed - they don't really exist, and are just a convenient notation for other task metadata.
              It is an error to attempt to add or remove a virtual tag.

       task timesheet [weeks]
              Shows a weekly report of tasks completed and started.

       task undo
              Reverts the most recent action.  Obeys the confirmation setting.

       task version
              Shows the Taskwarrior version number.

       task _get <DOM> [<DOM> ...]
              Accesses and displays the DOM reference(s).  Used to extract individual values from tasks, or the system.  Supported DOM references are:

                rc.<name>
                context.program
                context.args
                context.width
                context.height
                system.version
                system.os
                <id>.<attribute>
                <uuid>.<attribute>

              Note that the 'rc.<name>' reference may need to be escaped using '--' to prevent the reference from being interpreted as an override.

              Note that if the DOM reference is not valid, or the reference evaluates to a missing value, the command exits with 1.

              Additionally, some components of the attributes of particular types may be extracted by DOM references.

                $ task _get 2.due.year
                2015

              For a full list of supported attribute-specific DOM references, consult the online documentation at: <http://taskwarrior.org/docs/dom.html>

ATTRIBUTES AND METADATA
       ID     Tasks  can  be  specified  uniquely by IDs, which are simply the indexes of the tasks in the data file.  The ID of a task may therefore change, but only when a command is run that displays IDs.
              When modifying tasks, it is safe to rely on the last displayed ID.  Always run a report to check you have the right ID for a task. IDs can be given to task as a sequence, for example,
              task 1,4-10,19 delete

       +tag|-tag
              Tags are arbitrary words associated with a task. Use + to add a tag and - to remove a tag from a task. A task can have any quantity of tags.

              Certain tags (called 'special tags'), can be used to affect the way tasks are treated.  For example, if a task has the special tag 'nocolor', then it is exempt from all color rules.   The  sup‐
              ported special tags are:

                  +nocolor     Disable color rules processing for this task
                  +nonag       Completion of this task suppresses all nag messages
                  +nocal       This task will not appear on the calendar
                  +next        Elevates task so it appears on 'next' report

              There are also virtual tags, which represent task metadata in tag form.  These tags do not exist, but can be used to filter tasks.  The supported virtual tags are:

                  ACTIVE       Matches if the task is started
                  ANNOTATED    Matches if the task has annotations
                  BLOCKED      Matches if the task is blocked
                  BLOCKING     Matches if the task is blocking
                  CHILD        Matches if the task has a parent
                  COMPLETED    Matches if the task has completed status
                  DELETED      Matches if the task has deleted status
                  DUE          Matches if the task is due
                  DUETODAY     Matches if the task is due today
                  LATEST       Matches if the task is the newest added task
                  MONTH        Matches if the task is due this month
                  ORPHAN       Matches if the task has any orphaned UDA values
                  OVERDUE      Matches if the task is overdue
                  PARENT       Matches if the task is a parent
                  PENDING      Matches if the task has pending status
                  PRIORITY     Matches if the task has a priority
                  PROJECT      Matches if the task has a project
                  READY        Matches if the task is actionable
                  SCHEDULED    Matches if the task is scheduled
                  TAGGED       Matches if the task has tags
                  TODAY        Matches if the task is due today
                  TOMORROW     Matches if the task is due sometime tomorrow
                  UDA          Matches if the task has any UDA values
                  UNBLOCKED    Matches if the task is not blocked
                  UNTIL        Matches if the task expires
                  WAITING      Matches if the task is waiting
                  WEEK         Matches if the task is due this week
                  YEAR         Matches if the task is due this year
                  YESTERDAY    Matches if the task was due sometime yesterday

              You can use +BLOCKED to filter blocked tasks, or -BLOCKED for unblocked tasks.  Similarly, -BLOCKED is equivalent to +UNBLOCKED. It is an error to attempt to add or remove a virtual tag.

       project:<project-name>
              Specifies the project to which a task is related to.

       priority:H|M|L or priority:
              Specifies High, Medium, Low and no priority for a task.

       due:<due-date>
              Specifies the due-date of a task.

       recur:<frequency>
              Specifies the frequency of a recurrence of a task.

       scheduled:<ready-date>
              Specifies the date after which a task can be accomplished.

       until:<expiration date of task>
              Specifies the expiration date of a task, after which it will be deleted.

       limit:<number-of-rows>
              Specifies the desired number of tasks a report should show, if a positive integer is given.  The value 'page' may also be used, and will limit the report output to as many lines of text as will
              fit on screen.  This defaults to 25 lines.

       wait:<wait-date>
              When a task is given a wait date, it is hidden from most reports by changing its status to 'waiting'. When that date is passed, the status is changed back to 'pending',  and  the  task  becomes
              visible.

       depends:<id1,id2 ...>
              Declares  this  task to be dependent on id1 and id2.  This means that the tasks id1 and id2 should be completed before this task.  Consequently, this task will then show up on the 'blocked' re‐
              port.  It accepts a comma-separated list of ID numbers, UUID numbers and ID ranges.  When prefixing any element of this list by '-', the specified tasks are removed from the dependency list.

       entry:<entry-date>
              For report purposes, specifies the date that a task was created.

ATTRIBUTE MODIFIERS
       Attribute modifiers improve filters.  Supported modifiers are:

              before (synonyms under, below)
              after (synonyms over, above)
              none
              any
              is (synonym equals)
              isnt (synonym not)
              has (synonym contains)
              hasnt
              startswith (synonym left)
              endswith (synonym right)
              word
              noword

       For example:

              task due.before:eom priority.not:L list

       The before modifier is used to compare values, preserving semantics, so project.before:B list  all  projects  that  begin  with  'A'.   Priority  'L'  is  before  'M',  and  due:2011-01-01  is  before
       due:2011-01-02.  The synonyms 'under' and 'below' are included to allow filters that read more naturally.

       The after modifier is the inverse of the before modifier.

       The none modifier requires that the attribute does not have a value.  For example:

           task priority:      list
           task priority.none: list

       are equivalent, and list tasks that do not have a priority.

       The any modifier requires that the attribute has a value, but any value will suffice.

       The is modifier requires an exact match with the value.

       The isnt modifier is the inverse of the is modifier.

       The has modifier is used to search for a substring, such as:

           task description.has:foo list
           task foo                 list

       These are equivalent and will return any task that has 'foo' in the description or annotations.

       The hasnt modifier is the inverse of the has modifier.

       The startswith modifier matches against the left, or beginning of an attribute, such that:

           task project.startswith:H list
           task project:H            list

       are equivalent and will match any project starting with 'H'.  Matching all projects not starting with 'H' is done with:

           task project.not:H         list

       The endswith modifier matches against the right, or end of an attribute.

       The word modifier requires that the attribute contain the whole word specified, such that this:

           task description.word:bar list

       Will match the description 'foo bar baz' but does not match 'dog food'.

       The noword modifier is the inverse of the word modifier.

EXPRESSIONS AND OPERATORS
       You can use the following operators in filter expressions:

         and  or  xor  !               Logical operators
         <  <=  =  ==  !=  !==  >=  >  Relational operators
         (  )                          Precedence

       For example:

         task due.before:eom priority.not:L list
         task '( due < eom or priority != L )' list
         task '! ( project:Home or project:Garden )' list

       The  =  operator tests for approximate equality.  Dates compare equal if they are on the same day (hour and minutes are ignored).  Strings compare equal if the left operand starts with the right oper‐
       and.  The == operator tests for exact equality.  The != and !== operators are the negation of = and == respectively.  The negation operator is !.

       Note that the parentheses are required when using a logical operator other than the 'and' operator.  The reason is that some reports contain filters that must be combined with the command line.   Con‐
       sider this example:

         task project:Home or project:Garden list

       While this looks correct, it is not.  The 'list' report contains a filter of:

         task show report.list.filter

         Config Variable    Value
         -----------------  --------------
         report.list.filter status:pending

       Which means the example is really:

         task status:pending project:Home or project:Garden list

       The implied 'and' operator makes it:

         task status:pending and project:Home or project:Garden list

       This is a precedence error - the 'and' and 'or' need to be grouped using parentheses, like this:

         task status:pending and ( project:Home or project:Garden ) list

       The original example therefore must be entered as:

         task '( project:Home or project:Garden )' list

       This includes quotes to escape the parentheses, so that the shell doesn't interpret them and hide them from Taskwarrior.

       There is redundancy between operators, attribute modifiers and other syntactic sugar.  For example, the following are all equivalent:

         task foo                      list
         task /foo/                    list
         task description.contains:foo list
         task description.has:foo      list
         task 'description ~ foo'      list

SPECIFYING DATES AND FREQUENCIES
   DATES
       Taskwarrior reads dates from the command line and displays dates in the reports.  The expected and desired date format is determined by the configuration variable dateformat

              Exact specification

   FREQUENCIES
       Recurrence periods. Taskwarrior supports several ways of specifying the frequency of recurring tasks.

              daily, day, 1da, 2da, ...
                     Every day or a number of days.

              weekdays
                     Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and skipping weekend days.

              weekly, 1wk, 2wks, ...
                     Every week or a number of weeks.

              biweekly, fortnight
                     Every two weeks.

              monthly, month, 1mo, 2mo, ...
                     Every month.

              quarterly, 1qtr, 2qtrs, ...
                     Every three months, a quarter, or a number of quarters.

              semiannual
                     Every six months.

              annual, yearly, 1yr, 2yrs, ...
                     Every year or a number of years.

              biannual, biyearly, 2yr
                     Every two years.

CONTEXT
       Context  is  a user-defined filter, which is automatically applied to all commands that filter the task list. In particular, any report command will have its result affected by the current active con‐
       text.

           $ task list
           ID Age Project  Description        Urg
           1  2d  Sport    Run 5 miles        1.42
           2  1d  Home     Clean the dishes   1.14

           $ task context home
           Context 'home' set. Use 'task context none' to remove.

           $ task list
           ID Age Project  Description        Urg
           2  1d  Home     Clean the dishes   1.14
           Context 'home' set. Use 'task context none' to remove.

       As seen in the example above, context is applied by specifying its name to the "context" command. To change the currently applied context, just pass the new context's name to the 'context' command.

       To unset any context, use the 'none' subcommand.

           $ task context none
           Context unset.

           $ task list
           ID Age Project  Description        Urg
           1  2d  Sport    Run 5 miles        1.42
           2  1d  Home     Clean the dishes   1.14

       Context can be defined using the 'define' subcommand, specifying both the name of the new context, and it's assigned filter.

           $ task context define home project:Home
           Are you sure you want to add 'context.home' with a value of 'project:Home'? (yes/no) yes
           Context 'home' successfully defined.

       To remove the definition, use the 'delete' subcommand.

           $ task context delete home
           Are you sure you want to remove 'context.home'? (yes/no) yes
           Context 'home' successfully undefined.

       To check what is the currently active context, use the 'show' subcommand.

           $ task context show
           Context 'home' with filter 'project:Home' is currently applied.

       Contexts can store arbitrarily complex filters.

           $ task context define family project:Family or +paul or +nancy
           Are you sure you want to add 'context.home' with a value of 'project:Family or +paul or +nancy'? (yes/no) yes
           Context 'family' successfully defined.

       Contexts are permanent, and the currently set context name is stored in the "context" configuration variable. The context definition is stored in the "context.<name>" configuration variable.

COMMAND ABBREVIATION
       All Taskwarrior commands may be abbreviated as long as a unique prefix is used, for example:

              $ task li

       is an unambiguous abbreviation for

              $ task list

       but

              $ task l

       could be list, ls or long.

       Note that you can restrict the minimum abbreviation size using the configuration setting:

              abbreviation.minimum=3

SPECIFYING DESCRIPTIONS
       Some task descriptions need to be escaped because of the shell and the special meaning of some characters to the shell. This can be done either by adding quotes to the description or escaping the spe‐
       cial character:

              $ task add "quoted ' quote"
              $ task add escaped \' quote

       The argument -- (a double dash) tells Taskwarrior to treat all other args as description:

              $ task add -- project:Home needs scheduling

       In other situations, the shell sees spaces and breaks up arguments.  For example, this command:

              $ task 123 modify /from this/to that/

       is broken up into several arguments, which is corrected with quotes:

              $ task 123 modify "/from this/to that/"

       It is sometimes necessary to force the shell to pass quotes to Taskwarrior intact, so you can use:

              $ task add project:\'Three Word Project\' description

       Taskwarrior supports Unicode using only the UTF8 encoding, with no Byte Order Marks in the data files.

CONFIGURATION FILE AND OVERRIDE OPTIONS
       Taskwarrior stores its configuration in a file in the user's home directory: ~/.taskrc. The default configuration file can be overridden with:

       task rc:<path-to-alternate-file> ...
              Specifies an alternate configuration file.

       TASKRC=/tmp/.taskrc task ..
              The environment variable overrides the default and the command line specification of the .taskrc file.

       task rc.<name>:<value> ...
              task rc.<name>=<value> ...  Specifies individual configuration file overrides.

       TASKDATA=/tmp/.task task ...
              The environment variable overrides the default, the command line, and the 'data.location' configuration setting of the task data directory.

MORE EXAMPLES
       For examples please see the online documentation starting at

              <http://taskwarrior.org/docs>

       Note that the online documentation can be more detailed and more current than this man page.

FILES
       ~/.taskrc
              User configuration file - see also taskrc(5).  Note that this can be overridden on the command line or by the TASKRC environment variable.

       ~/.task
              The default directory where task stores its data files. The location can be configured in the configuration variable 'data.location', or overridden with the TASKDATA environment variable..

       ~/.task/pending.data
              The file that contains the tasks that are not yet done.

       ~/.task/completed.data
              The file that contains the completed ("done") tasks.

       ~/.task/undo.data
              The file that contains information needed by the "undo" command.
