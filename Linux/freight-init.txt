FREIGHT-INIT(1)                                                                                     Freight                                                                                     FREIGHT-INIT(1)

NAME
       freight-init - initialize a Freight directory

SYNOPSIS
       freight init [--libdir varlib] [--cachedir varcache] [--archs archs] [--origin origin] [--label label] [-v] [-h] -g gpg dirname

DESCRIPTION
       freight-init  will setup a directory to be used by Freight. It will generate small wrappers around the original Freight commands. Use freight-add(1) and freight-cache(1) to work against the VARLIB and
       VARCACHE given to freight init.

       The benefit of using freight-init is to automate the setup of Freight and to configure all data to be stored in one directory.

       Configuration is stored in dirname/etc/freight.conf.
