NAME
       Linux::KernelSort - Perl extension for sorting and comparing Linux kernel versions.  The expected kernel version naming convention is the same naming convetion demonstrated by
       http://www.kernel.org.  NOTE:  Currently, only the 2.6.x series of kernels (including -rc's, -git's, and -mm's) are properly evaluated.

SYNOPSIS
         use Linux::KernelSort;
         my $kernel = new Linux::KernelSort;

         my $ret;
         my $version1 = "2.6.19";
         my $version2 = "2.6.19-rc2-git7";
         $ret = $kernel->compare($version1, $version2);

         if ($ret == 0) {
           print "$version1 and $version2 are the same version\n";
         } elsif ($ret > 0) {
           print "$version1 is newer than $version2\n";
         } else {
           print "$version1 is older than $version2\n";
         }

         my @kernel_list = ( '2.6.15',
                             '2.6.18',
                             '2.6.18-rc2',
                             '2.6.18-rc2-git2',
                             '2.6.18-mm1',
                             '2.6.18-rc2-mm1' );

         my @sorted_list = $kernel->sort(@kernel_list);

         print join( ', ', @sorted_list );

DESCRIPTION
       Linux::KernelSort is intended to sort a list of kernel versions into ascending order.  It also provides the capability to compare two kernel versions and determine if one version is newer, older,
       or the same as the other version.

FUNCTIONS
   version_check() Purpose:  Verify the version is valid and follows the proper naming convention demonstrated by http://www.kernel.org Input:    A string containing the kernel version Return:   0 if
       version is valid 1 if version is invalid
   rank()
           Purpose:  Generate a ranking for a given kernel version
           Input:    A string containing the kernel version which
                     follows the proper naming convention demonstrated
                     by http://www.kernel.org
           Return:   Kernel ranking

   compare()
           Purpose:  Compare two kernel versions
           Input:    Strings ($kernel1, $kernel2) each containing a
                     kernel version which follows the proper naming
                     conventaion demonstrated by http://www.kernel.org
           Return   -1 if $kernel1 < $kernel2  (ie $kernel1 is older than $kernel2)
                     0 if $kernel1 == $kernel2 (ie $kernel1 is the same version as $kernel2)
                     1 if $kernel1 > $kernel2  (ie $kernel1 is newer than $kernel2)

   sort()
           Purpose:  Sort a list of kernel versions in ascending order.
                     Uses shell sort algorithm.
           Input:    Array of strings containing kernel versions which
                     follows the proper naming convention demonstrated
                     by http://www.kernel.org
           Return:   Sorted array
