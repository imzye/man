NAME
       b3sum - b3sum

SYNOPSIS
       b3sum [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
   Arguments:
              [FILE]...

              Files to hash, or checkfiles to check

              When no file is given, or when - is given, read standard input.

OPTIONS

       --keyed

              Use the keyed mode, reading the 32-byte key from stdin

       --derive-key <CONTEXT>

              Use the key derivation mode, with the given context string

              Cannot be used with --keyed.

       -l, --length <LEN>

              The number of output bytes, before hex encoding

              [default: 32]

       --seek <SEEK>

              The starting output byte offset, before hex encoding

              [default: 0]

       --num-threads <NUM>

              The maximum number of threads to use

              By default, this is the number of logical cores. If this flag is omitted, or if its value is 0, RAYON_NUM_THREADS is also respected.

       --no-mmap

              Disable memory mapping

              Currently this also disables multithreading.

       --no-names

              Omit filenames in the output

       --raw

              Write raw output bytes to stdout, rather than hex

       --no-names is implied. In this case, only a single input is allowed.

       --tag

              Output BSD-style checksums: BLAKE3 ([FILE]) = [HASH]

       -c, --check

              Read BLAKE3 sums from the [FILE]s and check them

       --quiet

              Skip printing OK for each checked file

              Must be used with --check.

       -h, --help

              Print help (see a summary with '-h')

       -V, --version

              Print version
