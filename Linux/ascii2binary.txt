NAME
       ascii2binary - Convert ASCII numbers to binary

SYNOPSIS
       ascii2binary [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       ascii2binary  reads input consisting of a sequence of ASCII textual representations of numbers, separated by whitespace, and produces as output the binary equivalents.  The type (unsigned integer,
       signed integer, or floating point number) and size of the binary output is selected by means of command line flags. The default is unsigned character.  Input is checked both for format errors  and
       to ensure that the number requested can be represented in a number of the requested binary type and size.

INPUT FORMAT
       The  input  formats  supported are exactly those supported by strtod(3) for floating point numbers, by strtoll(3) for signed integers, and by strtoull(3) for unsigned integers, except that, unlike
       strtod(3) floating point numbers may have thousands separators.  This means that by default integers may be decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, determined by the usual conventions.  The  command  line
       flag -b may be used to specify another base for integer conversions.

COMMAND LINE FLAGS
       Long options may not be available on some systems.

       -b,--base <base>
              set base in range [2,36] for integer conversions. The base may be either an integer or:

              (b)binary

              (o)octal

              (d)ecimal

              (h)exadecimal.

       -h,--help
              print help message

       -L,locale <locale>
              Set the LC_NUMERIC facet of the locale to <locale>.

       -s,--sizes
              print sizes of types on current machine and related information

       -t,--type <type>
              set type and size of output

              The following are the possible output types. Note that some types may not be available on some machines.

              d  double

              f  float

              sc signed char

              ss signed short

              si signed int

              sl signed long

              sq signed long long

              uc unsigned char

              us unsigned short

              ui unsigned int

              ul unsigned long

              uq unsigned long long

       -v,--version
              identify version

       -X,--explain-exit-codes
              print a summary of the exit status codes.

EXIT STATUS
       The following values are returned on exit:

       0 SUCCESS
              The input was successfully converted.

       1 INFO The user requested information such as the version number or usage synopsis and this has been provided.

       2 SYSTEM ERROR
              An error resulted from a failure of the operating system such as an i/o error or inability to allocate storage.

       3 COMMAND LINE ERROR
              The program was called with invalid or inconsistent command line flags.

       4 RANGE ERROR
              This  means  that the input may be well-formed but cannot be represented as the required type. For example, if the input is the string 983 and ascii2binary is requested to convert this into
              an unsigned byte, ascii2binary will exit with a RANGE ERROR because 983 exceeds the maximum value representable in an unsigned byte, which is 255.

       5 INPUT ERROR
              This means that the input was ill-formed, that is that it could not be interpreted as a number of the required type. For example, if the input is 0x2A and a decimal value is called for,  an
              INPUT ERROR will be returned since 0x2A is not a valid representation of a decimal integer.
