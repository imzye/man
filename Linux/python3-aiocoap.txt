NAME
       aiocoap-rd - Resource Directory server

       A plain CoAP resource directory according to RFC9176

       Known Caveats:

          • It is very permissive. Not only is no security implemented.

          • This may and will make exotic choices about discoverable paths whereever it can (see StandaloneResourceDirectory documentation)

          • Split-horizon is not implemented correctly

          • Unless enforced by security (ie. not so far), endpoint and sector names (ep, d) are not checked for their lengths or other validity.

          • Simple registrations don't cache .well-known/core contents

          usage: aiocoap-rd [-h] [--bind BIND] [--credentials CREDENTIALS]
                            [--tls-server-certificate CRT] [--tls-server-key KEY]
                            [--version] [--proxy-domain PROXY_DOMAIN] [--lwm2m-compat]
                            [--no-lwm2m-compat] [--verbose]

NAMED ARGUMENTS
       --bind Host and/or port to bind to (see --help-bind for details)

       --credentials
              JSON file pointing to credentials for the server's identity/ies.

       --tls-server-certificate
              TLS certificate (chain) to present to connecting clients (in PEM format)

       --tls-server-key
              TLS key to load that supports the server certificate

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       --proxy-domain
              Enable the RD proxy extension. Example: proxy.example.net will produce base URIs like coap://node1.proxy.example.net/. The names must all resolve to an address the RD is bound to.

       --lwm2m-compat
              Compatibility mode for LwM2M clients that can not perform some discovery steps (moving the registration resource to /rd)

       --no-lwm2m-compat
              Disable all compativility with LwM2M clients that can not perform some discovery steps (not even accepting registrations at /rd with warnings)

              Default: True

       --verbose
              Increase debug log output (repeat for increased verbosity)

              Default: 0
