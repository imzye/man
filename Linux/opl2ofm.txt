AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              The first PLtoTF program was designed by Leo Guibas in the summer of 1978.  Contributions by Frank Liang, Doug Wyatt, and Lyle Ramshaw also had a sig‐
              nificant effect on the evolution of the present code.

              Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added by D.E. Knuth in 1989.

              Extensions  to  handle  extended font metric files (``OFM'') were added by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996, resulting in the new program
              OPL2OFM.

       The primary authors of Omega were John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous.  Omega (and Aleph) are now maintained as part of TeX Live.

       This manual page was written by C.M. Connelly for the Debian GNU/Linux system. It is also now maintained as part of TeX Live.
