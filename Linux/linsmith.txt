NAME
       linsmith - Smith charting program, designed for educational use.

SYNOPSIS
       linsmith  [-d opts]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents linsmith.  It was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  A more complete manual is included (in PDF
       form) with the installation.

       linSmith is a Smith Charting program, mainly designed for educational use.  As such, there is an emphasis on capabilities that improve the 'showing the effect of'-style of operation.

       It's main features are:
        * Definition of multiple load impedances (at different frequencies)
        * Addition of discrete (L, C, parallel and series LC, and transformer) and line components (open and closed stubs, line segments)
        * Connection in series and parallel
        * Easy experimentation with values using scrollbars
        * A 'virtual' component switches from impedance to admittance to help explaining (or understanding) parallel components
        * The chart works in real impedances (not normalized ones)
        * Direct view of the result on the screen
        * Ability to generate publication quality Postscript output
        * A 'log' file with textual results at each intermediate step
        * Load and circuit configuration is stored separately, permitting several solutions without re-defining the other

OPTIONS
       This program is mainly designed for graphical use, and therefore does not have many options. A summary of options is included below.
