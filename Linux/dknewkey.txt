NAME
       dknewkey - Generates new DKIM public/private key pairs

VERSION
       0.8.0

DESCRIPTION
       dknewykey generates new DKIM keys.

       For RSA keys, it defaults to 2048 bit key size.  This is controlled by the BITS_REQUIRED variable. ed25519 keys do not have a variable size.

       For RSA keys, it uses openssl to do the generation.  By default it assumes this is located at /usr/bin/openssl.  This is controlled by the OPENSSL_BINARY variable.  For ed25519 keys, PyNaCl (python-
       nacl in Debian and derivatives) is used.  For RSA keys k=sha256 is now included in the public DNS record to prevent inadvertent use with the now obsolete sha1 hash algorithm (See RFC 8301).

USAGE
       dknewkey.py [-h] [--ktype {rsa,ed25519}] key_name

       mandatory positional arguments:
         key_name

       optional arguments:
         -h, --help            show this help message and exit
         --ktype {rsa,ed25519}
                               DKIM key type: Default is rsa

       NOTE: Depending on the packaging and distribution, the exact path and name for the executable may vary.
