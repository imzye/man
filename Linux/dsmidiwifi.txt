NAME
       DSMIDIWiFi — DSMI over WLAN server

SYNOPSIS
       DSMIDIWiFi note

DESCRIPTION
       DSMIDIWiFi  is  a  Qt application that serves as the server side of a DSMI (Nintendo® DS MIDI) over WLAN session.  Once started, it initialises the connections between UDP and ALSA MIDI, then will
       simply show a GUI application window with a logo but no interactivity; closing the window will terminate the server.

       DSMIDIWiFi uses the UDP ports 9000 and 9001 for broadcast communication with a Nintendo® DS or another device / application using the DSMI interface.  If the ports cannot be  bound  or  ALSA  MIDI
       cannot be initialised, an error dialogue is shown, and the program should be terminated.

       The mandatory argument note gives the MIDI note that A4 (440 Hz) is supposed to be mapped to.  The standard requires this to be note 69, but some applications are octave-confused and might require
       57 (Piano For You on Android) or 81 (TouchDAW ibidem), or even weirder values.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Some diagnostics are written to stdout.
