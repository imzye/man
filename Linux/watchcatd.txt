NAME
       watchcatd.conf - configuration file for watchcatd(8)

DESCRIPTION
       This  file  holds  all configuartion information for the watchcat(8) daemon. Each option must be written on a line by itself. Comments start with a '#' and go up to the end of the line. Blank
       spaces and empty lines are ignored.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

   Global options
       This section affects watchcatd(8) as a whole.

       realtime = <true|false>
              Turns real-time mode on or off. On real-time mode, watchcatd(8) will lock itself into memory so it is never swapped out.

       priority = <schedule priority>
              Set the schedule priority for realtime mode. This option has no effect if realtime is set to false.

       user = <username>
              Defines the name of the unprivileged user watchcatd(8) will run as.  This users's home directory will be used for chroot and all groups will be applied.

   Master section
       This section defines options that affect the master process of watchcatd(8) .

       master_debug_level = <debug level>
              Sets the debug level for the master process. This can be the sum of zero or more of the values below, resulting in a number between 0 and 63.

              1       Security logs (low volume)
              2       Sent signal logs (moderate to high volume)
              4       Failure to send signal logs (low volume)
              8       Failure on socket read logs (low volume)
              16      Child death logs (low volume)
              32      Child finishing logs (low volume)

       master_pid_file = <file name>
              The file where the server writes its process ID in, or the directory where it will be crested.

   Slave section
       This section defines options that affect the slave process of watchcatd(8) .

       slave_debug_level = <debug level>
              Sets the debug level for the slave process. This can be the sum of zero or more of the values below, resulting in a number between 0 and 2015.

              1       Creation/termination of a cat process logs (high volume)
              2       Header parsing error logs (high volume)
              4       Communication failure with an existing cat. Basically
                      this means socket errors (high volume)
              8       Communication timeout logs (low volume)
              16      Security logs (low volume)
              64      Critical failure logs (low volume)
              128     Warning logs (low to moderate volume)
              256     Connection attempt logs (low to moderate volume)
              512     Successful connection logs (high volume)
              1024    Successful fetching of Process ID logs (high volume)

              Note that the value 32 currently has no use.

       slave_device = <device>
              Defines the absolute path for the watchcat device.

       slave_max_connections = <max. connections>
              Defines the maximum number of client connections that the slave will handle.

       slave_max_connections_per_pid = <max. per pid>
              Defines the maximum number of connections per client that the slave will handle. Use zero for unlimited.
