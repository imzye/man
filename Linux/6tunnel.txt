NAME
       6tunnel - tunnelling for application that don't speak IPv6

SYNOPSIS
       6tunnel [ -146dhfvV ] [ -u username ] [ -i password ] [ -I password ] [ -l local_host ] [ -L limit ] [ -p pid_file ] [ -m map_file ] local_port remote_host [ remote_port ]

DESCRIPTION
       6tunnel  allows  you  to use services provided by IPv6 hosts with IPv4-only applications and vice-versa. It can bind to any of your IPv4 (default) or IPv6 addresses and forward all data to IPv4 or
       IPv6 (default) host. For example

              6tunnel -1 6668 irc6.net 6667

       will be enough to connect to IPv6 irc server with

              irc foobar localhost:6668

       If you don't wish to run 6tunnel every time you want to show your :c001: or :dead: IPv6 address on IRC, you can use -i parameter, which makes 6tunnel ask your client for specified  password.  Just
       run

              6tunnel -i dupa.8 31337 irc6.net 6667

       and then type

              irc foobar localhost:31337:dupa.8

       If your IRC server requires you to send password, specify it with -I parameter -- after successful proxy authentication 6tunnel will send it to the server.

       6tunnel  can  also  be used as a tunnel for all other combinations of IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints. If remote host doesn't have any IPv6 addresses, 6tunnel will use the IPv4 one. In other cases, use -4
       parameter which makes IPv4 address the preferred one. For IPv6-to-any tunnels use -6 which makes 6tunnel bind to IPv6 address.

OPTIONS
       -1     Exit after first connection.

       -4     Prefer IPv4 endpoint if the machine has both address types.

       -6     Listen on IPv6 address (IPv4 is default).

       -d     Don't detach.

       -f     Force tunneling even if remote host is not resolvable at the execution time.

       -h     Print hex dump of every packet received or sent.

       -u username
              Change UID and GID after bind().

       -i password
              Act as an IRC proxy and require user to authenticate.

       -I password
              If you are using 6tunnel as an IRC proxy and the IRC server requires you to send password, place it right here.

       -l local_host
              Listen on specified address (IPv4, or IPv6 if -6 used).

       -L limit
              Limit simultaneous connections.

       -p pid_file
              Write down pid to specified file.

       -s source_host
              Connect to the remote host using specified source address.

       -m map_file
              Binds to specified IPv6 addresses on basis of source IPv4 address. The file contains one mapping per line with IPv4 source address and corresponding IPv6 address. Only listed hosts are  al‐
              lowed to connect. If you want to allow any host, add mapping for default or 0.0.0.0 address. Example:

              192.168.0.2 3ffe:8010:18::1000:2
              192.168.0.3 3ffe:8010:18::1000:3

       -v     Be verbose and don't detach.

       -V     Print version and exit.

NOTES
       Option -H to disable all resolver hints has been removed since proper combination of -4 and -6 will yield in any combination of IPv4 and IPv6 sources and destinations.

SIGNALS
       Sending SIGHUP forces map file reload.

THANKS
       #ipv6 crew, Lam.

BUGS
       Terrible  man  page.  Hex  dump doesn't include IRC proxy authentication.  IRC proxy requires your client to send password first (don't worry ircii, EPIC, BitchX, mIRC and many more will work). No
       logging except debug output.
