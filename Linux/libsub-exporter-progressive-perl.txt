NAME
       Sub::Exporter::Progressive - Only use Sub::Exporter if you need it

VERSION
       version 0.001013

SYNOPSIS
        package Syntax::Keyword::Gather;

        use Sub::Exporter::Progressive -setup => {
          exports => [qw( break gather gathered take )],
          groups => {
            default => [qw( break gather gathered take )],
          },
        };

        # elsewhere

        # uses Exporter for speed
        use Syntax::Keyword::Gather;

        # somewhere else

        # uses Sub::Exporter for features
        use Syntax::Keyword::Gather 'gather', take => { -as => 'grab' };

DESCRIPTION
       Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes great responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties.  This module is a "Sub::Exporter" wrapper that will let your
       users just use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use "Sub::Exporter" if your users try to use "Sub::Exporter"'s more advanced features, like renaming exports, if they try to
       use them.

       Note that this module will export @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package variables for "Exporter" to work.  Additionally, if your package uses advanced "Sub::Exporter" features like
       currying, this module will only ever use "Sub::Exporter", so you might as well use it directly.
