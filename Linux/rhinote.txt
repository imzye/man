NAME
       Rhinote - virtual sticky-notes for your desktop

SYNOPSIS
       rhinote

DESCRIPTION
       Rhinote is a simple program that provides virtual sticky-notes for your desktop. It's handy for jotting down quick notes or holding copied text that you plan to past elsewhere later.

       Notes can be saved as plain text for later viewing/editing with Rhinote or any other text editor.

       Rhinote is designed to be "keyboard friendly", that is, every single action is bound to a specific keystroke.
