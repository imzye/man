NAME
       pymcaroitool - PyMca region-of-interest imaging X application

SYNOPSIS
       pymcaroitool [OPTIONS]... [FILE(S)]

DESCRIPTION
       Start the graphical user interface of the PyMca X-Ray Fluorescence Toolkit region-of-interest imaging tool.

       This  tool is best suited for handling datasets that can be represented by three-dimensional arrays. Typical cases are stacks of images (first dimension is image number) or 2D maps of 1D spectra (last
       dimension is spectrum channel number).

       It allows one to display maps of particular regions of the spectra or spectra of a particular region of the map.

       A system of plugins allows to extend the capabilities of this tool. Plugins for multivariate analysis are already built in.

       If FILE is given, it will be opened in the program provided its format is supported.

EXAMPLES
       pymcaroitool

       Start the program with a file browser to select the input files.

       pymcaroitool --binding=XX

       Start the program using the selected Qt binding. It has to be one of PyQt5 (default), PyQt4, PySide or PySide2.

       pymcaroitool file_0001.edf

       Tries to open the file named file_0001.edf and all indexed files of the form file_????.edf where ???? is a number.

       pymcaroitool --imagestack=1 file_0001.edf

       Tries to open the file named file_0001.edf and all indexed files of the form file_????.edf where ???? is a number as a set of images.

       pymcaroitool uncompressed_tiff_file_0001.tif

       Tries to open a series of uncompressed TIFF files as an image stack.

       pymcaroitool --begin=100 --end=200 --filepattern=file_%05d.edf

       Start the program loading the single indexed files from file_00100.edf to file_00200.edf

       pymcaroitool --begin=10,100 --end=20,200 --filepattern=row%d_col%04d.dat

       Load the double indexed files from row10_col0100.dat, row10_col0101.dat, ...  to row20_col0199.dat, row20_col0200.dat

       pymcaroitool --logging=XX

       Set the logging level. Allowed values are, in increasing order of verbosity: critical, error, warning (default), info, debug.  Alternatively, you can specify a value in range 0 (critical)  to  4  (de‐
       bug).

CAVEATS
       If  files  f_000.xxx and f_001.xxx are present in the same directory, and only one of them is selected, the program will always try to load both of them unless a cumbersome way using a file pattern is
       used.
