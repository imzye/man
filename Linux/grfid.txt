NAME
     GRFID — A tool to extract the (New)GRF ID from a (New)GRF

SYNOPSIS
     [-hvm]
     grfid file

DESCRIPTION
     GRFID tries to find the (New)GRF identifier of that (New)GRF.  Upon failure an error message is given, otherwise the NewGRF identifier is printed hexadecimally to stdout.

OPTIONS
     -h      Display the help message.

     -m file
             Display the MD5 checksum of the given NewGRF. For GRF container format 2 this checksum only contains the data section, i.e. it excludes the sprite section to make it easier to construct NewGRFs
             with different zoom levels.

     -v      Display the version.
