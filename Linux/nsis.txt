NAME
       GenPat - A program to create patch files in VPatch format.

SYNOPSIS

       GenPat [-R] [-B=64] [-V] [-O] [-A=500] [source] [target] [patch.pat]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the GenPat command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian (TM) distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation in the HTML format; see below.

       GenPat is a program that creates installer programs for Windows.

OPTIONS
       -R
           Replace a patch with same contents as source silently if it already exists.

       -B=64
           Set blocksize (default=64), multiple of 2 is required.

       -V
           More verbose information during patch creation.

       -O
           Deactivate match limit of the -A switch (sometimes smaller patches).

       -A=500
           Maximum number of block matches per block (improves performance). Default is 500, larger is slower. Use -V to see the cut-off aborts.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           Success

       1
           Arguments missing

       2
           Other error
