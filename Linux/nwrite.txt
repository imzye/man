NAME
       nwrite - enhanced write

SYNOPSIS
       nwrite [-i minutes] [-a] user[.ttyname] [user[.ttyname] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       nwrite  copies  lines  from your terminal to the terminals of one or more users.  When called, it begins copying lines you type to the recipient's terminal(tty). Before sending the first line of text,
       nwrite prepends the message

         Message from <name> on <tty> [to user [users ...]] at <time> ...

       Communication continues until an end of file is read from the terminal or an interrupt is sent.  At that point nwrite writes `EOF' (or `EOF (sendername)' if whoeof is set) on the  other  terminal  and
       exits.

       If  you  want  to  write  to a user who is logged in more than once, the ttyname argument may be used to indicate the appropriate terminal name, OR, you can let nwrite find the first writable tty, and
       write to that. Additionally, you can use the -i option to specify a number of minutes; ttys more idle than the number you specify will be ignored when looking for ttys to write to.

       Permission to write may be denied or granted by use of the mesg command.  At the outset writing is allowed.  Certain commands, in particular nroff and pr(1) disallow messages in order to prevent messy
       output.

NWRITERC
       To control how incoming nwrites look to you, create a ~/.nwriterc with lines of the form:

         option  value

       Where value is either 0 or 1 (meaning no and yes) and option is one of:

       headers
              Display "user> " before each incoming line.

       beep   Cause the terminal to beep when the message header comes through.

       nodelay
              Do not wait for the first line of input before displaying the message header.

       bold   Takes the following string values:

              never  no bolding (default)

              header message header only

              tag    message header and "login>" line tags

              all    bold everything

       showtarg
              Used to control the behavior of the message header. Takes the following string values:

              never  never show recipient list

              multi  only if more than one recipient (default)

              always always show recipients

       whoeof When sending EOF, append username to differentiate between many Users at once like this: "EOF (user)".

       Note that your home directory must be world executable and the .nwriterc itself must be world readable.

EXAMPLE NWRITERC
        headers        1
        nodelay        0
        beep           0
        bold           header
        showtarg       multi

OPTIONS
       -a     arguments are zeroed so that the process table entry does not reveal who you are writing to.  (Not available on all systems.)

       -i <minutes>
              Ignore ttys more idle than <minutes> minutes.

FILES
       /var/run/utmp
              to find user

       /etc/nwrite.rc
              to set system default preferences

       ~user/.nwriterc
              to obtain target's preferences
