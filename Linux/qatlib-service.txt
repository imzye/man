NAME
       qat_init - QAT resource initializer

       qat_init

SYNOPSIS
       qat_init

DESCRIPTION
       qat_init initializes the Intel© Quick Assist Technology (Intel© QAT) devices in preparation for use by the user space library (qatlib).

       When run on a host system with physical function (PF) QAT devices visible and bound to the QAT device driver, the qat_init script will enable sriov on each of the PF devices. This enables the
       virtual function (VF) devices.

       For each of the QAT VF devices, the qat_init binds the device to the vfio-pci device driver, making it available for applications using the qatlib user space library.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       LKCF_LIST if set, gives a list of VF devices that should be used for accelerating operations from the Linux crypto framework instead of being available for user space applications.

       Example:
       LKCF_LIST="0000:3d:01.0 0000:3f:01.0 0000:da:01.0"
