NAME
       xmorph - image warping and dissolving (morphing) for X window system

       morph - command line interface image morphing program

SYNOPSIS
       xmorph [-start srcimgfile [-finish destimgfile]] [-src srcmeshfile [-dst dstmeshfile ]] [-help]

       morph [-start srcimgfile [-finish destimgfile]] [-src srcmeshfile [-dst dstmeshfile ]] [-out outimgfile ] [-mt morphtween ] [-dt dissolvetween ] [-help]

DESCRIPTION
       xmorph  is a digital image warping and dissolving program, also known as a "morphing" program.  It runs under the X Window System.  The primary use of xmorph is to generate and modify meshes which
       control the shape of an image.  xmorph also has the capacity to dissolve images together, and to generate a sequence of warped and dissolved images.  When this sequence is made into a movie, it is
       called a "morph".

       morph is a morphing program with no graphical user interface.  morph performs image warping and dissolving but provides no means to create or modify meshes.  The  intent  is  to  use  morph  after
       meshes have already been generated with xmorph.  Since morph has no GUI, it can be run as a background job and can be distributed over many machines or processes.  This parallelization of the task
       can significanly speed up the image processing.  morph can run on machines which have no display whatsoever, and is therefore very portable.

       Both xmorph and morph use a library called libmorph which can be used separately in the creation of other morphing programs.

       If  imgfile  names  are  provided on the command line, then those images are loaded in.  Otherwise, xmorph generates images to be used in lieu of images provided by the user.  Images may be loaded
       from menus within xmorph.

       xmorph has built-in help pages that answer questions about the details of its use.  Run xmorph and look at the online help for more information.

OPTIONS
       -start srcimgfile
              Read the srcimgfile as the "source" image.

       -finish destimgfile
              Read the destimgfile as the "destination" image.

       -src srcmeshfile
              Read the srcmeshfile as the "source" mesh.

       -dst destmeshfile
              Read the destimgfile as the "destination" mesh.

       -help  Display command line options.

MORPH OPTIONS
       -out outimgfile
              Write the the output image to outimgfile .

       -mt morphtween
              Use morphtween as the warping tween parameter.  Values are from 0 to 1.  0 means that the shape of the output is according to the source mesh.  1 means that the shape is  according  to  the
              destination mesh.  Default value is 0.

       -dt dissolvetween
              Use  dissolvetween  as the dissolve tween parameter.  Values are from 0 to 1.  0 means that the image of the output is according to the source image.  1 means that the image is according to
              the destination image.  Negative values indicate that a sigmoid sharpening function is to be applied to make the dissolving more concentrated to values near 0.5.  The idea is that the  dis‐
              solvetween value should be the negative of the morphtween value in order to have the dissolve be more rapid during middle values of the warp tween parameter, and less rapid otherwise.  This
              makes the morph more visually acceptable.  Default value is 0.

MAKING MOVIES
       xmorph is NOT a tool for making movies.  xmorph is intended to be used with OTHER tools for editting movies in the digital domain.  I do not intend to add movie making abilities to xmorph.

       Here is a brief explanation of how to make a movie from the images generated by xmorph:

       xmorph  uses  the  TrueVision Targa (TGA) image file format.  You can use PBMplus, netpbm, ImageMagick or some other program to convert Targa to other still image formats.  (This will be necessary
       if, for example, you use the Berkeley MPEG encoder or want to make an animated GIF.)  See, e.g., ftp://ikaros.fysik4.kth.se/pub/netpbm/.

       Use another program, such as Berkeley's mpeg_encode, or SGI's dmconvert, or whirlgif to turn the sequence of images that xmorph created into a single animation.  See, e.g.,  ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berke‐
       ley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/encode/.

       Use another program, such as mpeg_play, xanim or movieplayer, to view the animation.  See, e.g., ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/play/.

       There are plenty of other programs available for viewing movies.

NOTES
       The only image file type currently supported is Truevision Targa (TGA) but xmorph will load any type of Targa, such as 8-bit, 15-bit, or 16-bit colormapped or  grayscale;  24-bit  or  32-bit  true
       color (with or without alpha channel);  run-length encoded or uncompressed.

       Some versions of the program "xv" can not read xmorph's TGA image files.  This is a bug in "xv", not in xmorph.

       Use image conversion programs (such as those listed in the SEE ALSO section) to convert to and from TGA image files for use with xmorph and morph .
