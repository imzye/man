NAME
       axwrapper - Run non-ax.25-aware programs from ax25d

SYNOPSIS
       axwrapper [ -p paclen ] server-program argv[0] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Axwrapper  first  creates  a  pipe and then forks and execs the program
       <server-program> with arguments given at the  axwrapper  command  line.
       The argv[0] argument is mandatory; further arguments are optional.  The
       parent process then sits and waits for any I/O to and from the user and
       converts any carriage return characters from the user to line feeds and
       any line feeds from the program to carriage  returns.  This  is  useful
       when starting non-AX.25-aware programs from ax25d.

OPTIONS
       -c paclen

              Specify  a the size of the output buffer.  The default length is
              256 bytes.
