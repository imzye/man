NAME
       cgx - CalculiX GraphiX

SYNOPSIS
       cgx [options] [parameter] filename [ccxfile]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cgx command. The complete documentation and test files are located in the calculix-cgx-doc package in the /usr/share/doc/calculix-cgx-doc/ directory.

PARAMETERS
       -a     auto-mode, geometry file derived from a cad-file must be provided

       -b     build-mode, geometry (command) file must be provided

       -bg    background, suppress creation of graphic output otherwise as -b a geometry (command) file must be provided

       -c     read an solver input file (ccx)

       -duns2d
              read duns result files (2D)

       -duns3d
              read duns result files (3D)

       -foam  read openFoam result files

       -isaac2d [-pref<val> -tref<val> -R<val>]
              read isaac result files (2D)

       -isaac3d [-pref<val> -tref<val> -R<val>]
              read isaac result files (3D)

       -f06   read Nastran f06 file

       -ng    read Netgen native format

       -step  read a step file (only points and lines)

       -stepsplit
              read step and write its single parts to the filesystem

       -stl   read stl triangles

       -v     (default) read a result file in frd-format and optional a solver input file (ccx) which provides the sets and loads used in the calculation.

       SPECIAL PURPOSE OPTIONS

       -mksets
              make node-sets from *DLOAD-values (setname:''_<value>'')

       -read  forces the program to read the complete result-file at startup
