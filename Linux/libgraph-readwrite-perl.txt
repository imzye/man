NAME
       Graph::Reader::HTK - read an HTK lattice in as an instance of Graph

SYNOPSIS
         use Graph::Reader::HTK;

         $reader = Graph::Reader::HTK->new;
         $graph = $reader->read_graph('mylattice.lat');

DESCRIPTION
       This module can be used to read a directed graph in the HTK <http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk> lattice format. It returns an instance of the Graph class.
