NAME
       flow-mask - Apply tags to flow files.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-mask [ -hk ]  [ -b big|little ]  [ -C comment ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -m mask_fname ]  [ -M active_def... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-mask utility is used to modify the source and destination mask length's in flow records.

OPTIONS
       -b big|little
              Byte order of output.

       -C Comment
              Add a comment.

       -d debug_level
              Enable debugging.

       -h     Display help.

       -k     Keep time from input.

       -m mask_fname
              Load masks from mask_name. Defaults to /etc/flow-tools/cfg/mask

       -M mask_def
              Use active_def as the active tag definition(s).

       The configuration file is a collection of definitions. A definition lists a sequence of prefixes and the mask length to replace the matching prefix with.  Lines begining with # are treated as comments
       and ignored.
