SYNOPSIS
           use strict;
           #Declare
           use Spreadsheet::XLSX::Utility2007 qw(ExcelFmt ExcelLocaltime LocaltimeExcel);

           #Convert localtime ->Excel Time
           my $iBirth = LocaltimeExcel(11, 10, 12, 23, 2, 64);
                                      # = 1964-3-23 12:10:11

DESCRIPTION
       Spreadsheet::XLSX::Utility2007 exports utility functions concerned with Excel format setting.

       ExcelFmt is used by Spreadsheet::XLSX::Fmt2007.pm which is used by Spreadsheet::XLSX.

Functions
       This module can export 3 functions: ExcelFmt, ExcelLocaltime and LocaltimeExcel.

   ExcelFmt
       $sTxt = ExcelFmt($sFmt, $iData [, $i1904]);

       $sFmt is a format string for Excel. $iData is the target value.  If $flg1904 is true, this functions assumes that epoch is 1904.  $sTxt is the result.

       For more detail and examples, please refer sample/chkFmt.pl in this distribution.

       ex.

   ExcelLocaltime
       ($iSec, $iMin, $iHour, $iDay, $iMon, $iYear, $iwDay, $iMSec) =
                   ExcelLocaltime($iExTime [, $flg1904]);

       ExcelLocaltime converts time information in Excel format into Perl localtime format.  $iExTime is a time of Excel. If $flg1904 is true, this functions assumes that epoch is 1904.  $iSec, $iMin,
       $iHour, $iDay, $iMon, $iYear, $iwDay are same as localtime.  $iMSec means 1/1,000,000 seconds(ms).

   LocaltimeExcel
       $iExTime = LocaltimeExcel($iSec, $iMin, $iHour, $iDay, $iMon, $iYear [,$iMSec] [,$flg1904])

       LocaltimeExcel converts time information in Perl localtime format into Excel format .  $iSec, $iMin, $iHour, $iDay, $iMon, $iYear are same as localtime.

       If $flg1904 is true, this functions assumes that epoch is 1904.  $iExTime is a time of Excel.

   col2int
       $iInt = col2int($sCol);

       converts a excel row letter into an int for use in an array

       This function was contributed by Kevin Mulholland.

   int2col
       $sCol = int2col($iRow);

       convert a column number into column letters NOET: This is quite a brute force coarse method does not manage values over 701 (ZZ)

       This function was contributed by Kevin Mulholland.

   sheetRef
       ($iRow, $iCol) = sheetRef($sStr);

       convert an excel letter-number address into a useful array address NOTE: That also Excel uses X-Y notation, we normally use Y-X in arrays $sStr, excel coord (eg. A2).

       This function was contributed by Kevin Mulholland.

   xls2csv
       $sCsvTxt = xls2csv($sFileName, $sRegion, $iRotate);

       convert a chunk of an excel file into csv text chunk $sRegions = "sheet-colrow:colrow" (ex. '1-A1:B2' means 'A1:B2' for sheet 1) $iRotate  = 0 or 1 (output should be rotated or not)

       This function was contributed by Kevin Mulholland.
