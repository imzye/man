NAME
       .acheck - Acheck configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       This is the configuration file for acheck. If it exists, it must be at the top of your home directory ($HOME). This file is optional unless you don't want to use default values.

       Lines beginning with a number sign (`#') and empty lines will be ignored.  Spaces at the beginning and the end of a line will also be ignored as well as tabulators.  If you need spaces at the end
       or the beginning of a value you can use apostrophes (`"').  An option line starts with it's name followed by a value. An equal sign is optional.  A comment starts with the number sign, there can
       be any number of spaces and/or tab stops in front of the #.  Some possible examples:

        # this line is ignored
        option   value
        option = value                               # this is a comment
        option        "value ending with space   "

       You have to escape number signs with a backslash (`\') to use it in a value.

       Default values are provided into square brackets, they should be suitable for most installations.

SPELLING
       Define if you want to use ispell for checking spelling and how to use it.

       check_spelling
           use Aspell for spelling if set to `yes' [yes]

       dictionary
           Language dictionary to use with Aspell, use default if empty [empty]

       word_letters
           regular expression to define characters allowed to write a word, pattern matches according locale [\w]

       $review_mode
           set to `yes' if you want review comments to be added in the output file after parsed line, otherwise just fix error [no]

COLORS
       Set text colors for clear presentation.

       The  recognized  colors  (all  of which should be fairly intuitive) are: clear, reset, dark, bold, underline, underscore, blink, reverse, concealed, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
       white, on_black, on_red, on_green, on_yellow, on_blue, on_magenta, on_cyan, and on_white.  Case is not significant.  Underline and underscore are  equivalent,  as  are  clear  and  reset,  so  use
       whichever is the most intuitive to you.  The color alone sets the foreground color, and on_color sets the background color.

       Note that not all colors are supported by all terminal types, and some terminals may not support any of these sequences.  Dark, blink, and concealed in particular are frequently not implemented.

       error_color
           color used to highlight errors, this should highlight space characters [bold on_red]

       fix_color
           color used to highlight suggestions, this should highlight space characters [bold on_green]

       error_head_color
           color used to display the error line header [bold red]

       error_color
           color used to display the suggestion line header [bold green]

       comment_color
           color used for comments and hints [cyan]

OTHERS
