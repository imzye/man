NAME
       hnb - Hierarchical notebook

SYNOPSIS
       hnb [file] [options] [command [command] .. ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the hnb hierarchical notebook.

       hnb  is  an  ncurses program to organize many kinds of data in one place, for example addresses, todo lists, ideas, book reviews or to store snippets of brainstorming, to make a structured packing
       list or just to take random notes.  It can export ascii/html/latex/postscript, supports todo checkboxes, checkbox trees with percentages and searching.

       hnb uses a simple ascii file for storing your notes. This file can be specified on the command line. If not specified, ~/.hnb is loaded (or created if missing).

OPTIONS
       hnb can be invoked with the following options:

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       -t, --tutorial
              Load the tutorial instead of a database.

       -rc <file>
              Load another config file than default.

       -ui <curses|cli>
              Specify user interface to use.

       -e     Run commands in noninteractive mode (start hnb with the cli ui and type `help' to get more information).

FILES
       ~/.hnb The default file for your notes. To use another, specify its name on the command line.

       ~/.hnbrc
              The default configuration file. To load another config file than default, use the -rc command-line option.
