NAME
       loki - Reversible jump MCMC linkage analysis in general pedigrees

SYNOPSIS
       prep controlfile
       loki -v
       loki paramfile

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the prep and loki commands. Other post-hoc analysis scripts are available; please see the complete documentation.  This manual page was written for the Debian
       GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in PostScript format; see below.

       loki, written by Simon C. Heath, implements segregation and linkage analysis on possibly large and complex pedigrees, by means of a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique.   prep  per‐
       forms previous data preparation.

OPTIONS
       -v     Show version of the program.

SEE ALSO
       The programs are documented fully in /usr/share/doc/loki-doc/ if you have installed the loki-doc package.
