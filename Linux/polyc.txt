NAME
       polyc - Compile and link a Standard ML program using Poly/ML

SYNOPSIS
       polyc sourcefile

DESCRIPTION
       polyc  is  a  script that compiles a Standard ML program using the Poly/ML compiler and creates an executable program from it.  It can also be used to link object files created using the PolyML.export
       function with the Poly/ML libraries or to produce an object file.  When used to compile a Standard ML program it expects the main function to be called "main" e.g.  fun main() = print "Hello World\n";

       If the source file is a text file it is assumed to be ML source.  If it is a binary file it is assumed to be an object file and will be linked with the Poly/ML library.

OPTIONS
       -c Compile but do not link.  The object file is written to a file whose name is based on the source file name with any extension replaced with .o

       -o output
              Write the executable file to "output".

       --help Write a list of the arguments and exit.
