NAME
       release - convenient script for "releasing" an upstream project for Ubuntu

SYNOPSIS
       release

DESCRIPTION
       Note that you must prepare the current directory by first running release-build(1), before running release(1).

       This script will work on a bzr(1) branch with debian packaging in the current directory, officially "releasing" it.  It will:
        * automatically determine the project/package name and version by parsing the debian/changelog file
        * update the changelog timestamp
        * tag the release in bzr
        * debcommit(1) with an appropriate release message
        * gpg(1) sign the original tarball
        * open the next release for development

       After the script performs these actions, the final steps to push the release are printed to the screen, for the user to copy-and-paste.  These steps include:
        * the 'bzr push' command
        * the URL to the Launchpad 'addrelease' project action
        * the dputP(1) commands for pushing to PPAs and the official Ubuntu archive
