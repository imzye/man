PKG-JS-AUTOPKGTEST(7)                                                                 Miscellaneous Information Manual                                                                PKG-JS-AUTOPKGTEST(7)

NAME
       pkg-js-autopkgtest - autopkgtest runner to automatically test Node.js packages

SYNOPSIS
        • in debian/control, insert "Testsuite: autopkgtest-pkg-nodejs"

        • write upstream test in debian/tests/pkg-js/test (will be launched by
          sh -e)

        • if some other files than "test*" and "debian/tests/test_modules/*"
          and installed files are needed, write a "debian/tests/pkg-js/files" with
          all needed directories/files

       That's all, other debian/tests files will be written on-the-fly by
       autodep8 during autopkgtest

       If you want to launch the same test during build, simply add
       dh-sequence-nodejs in build dependencies

HOW IT WORKS
        • if directory debian/tests/test_modules exists, NODE_PATH will be set
          to NODE_PATH=debian/tests/test_modules:node_modules

        • if additional modules were linked during build, they will be linked into
          node_module (debian/nodejs/extlinks)

        • if additional modules were copies during build, they will be copied into
          node_module (debian/nodejs/extcopies)

        • if package contains some other components, they will be linked into
          node_module

        • autopkgtest will launch 2 tests:

         • a "require" test (see below)

         • the test defined in debian/tests/pkg-js/test in a temporary dir (it
           links installed files)

        • if dh-sequence-nodejs is a build dependency, dh_auto_test will
          launch the same test (debian/tests/pkg-js/test) if exists, else just a
          node -e &quot;require(&#39;.&#39;)&quot;. Note that you can override test during build
          using debian/nodejs/test

        • if file debian/tests/pkg-js/require-name exists, its content will be used
          as module name in "require" test (instead of using package.json value)

FULL EXAMPLE
        • debian/control

         ...
         Testsuite: autopkgtest-pkg-nodejs
         Build-Depends: dh-sequence-nodejs
         ...

        • debian/tests/pkg-js/test

         mocha -R spec

ADDITIONAL TEST PACKAGES OR TEST RESTRICTIONS
       autodep8 allows one to add additional packages during autopkgtest (and/or
       additional restrictions) by using a debian/tests/autopkgtest-pkg-nodejs.conf
       file:
         extra_depends=mocha, npm
         extra-restrictions=needs-internet

ENABLE proto
       Since version 0.15.0, pkg-js-autopkgtest launches Node.js with
       --disable-proto=throw. This causes tests to fail if
       Object.prototype.__proto__ property is used.

       If a package can use this feature without security hole (for test for example),
       it is possible to disable this nodejs option by creating an empty
       debian/tests/pkg-js/enable_proto file, until Debian's Node.js enables this
       feature by default.

THE REQUIRE TEST
   How it works
       First, pkg-js-autopkgtest searches the module name.

        • if debian/tests/pkg-js/require-name exists, its content will be used as
          module name

        • else if looks at package.json "name" field:

         • if debian/nodejs/main exists, like dh-sequence-nodejs, it uses the
           package.json from this directory

         • else it uses ./package.json

       Then pkg-js-autopkgtest looks at package.json fields, not using the file
       mentioned above, but using the file installed by the Debian package to test
       (ie /usr/share/nodejs/<module-name>/package.json):

        • if type equals module, then:

         • it builds a node_modules directory with all available dependencies of
           the module

         • it builds a test.mjs file that tries to import the module to test and
           launch it

        • if main isn't defined and index.js doesn't exist, it skip the test
          (this avoids to try to test @types/<foo> modules)

        • else it simply launches a nodejs -e &quot;require(&#39;$moduleName&#39;)&quot;

       Since version 0.10.0, pkg-js-autopkgtest does the same test for all other
       modules installed in nodejs root directories (components installed by
       dh-sequence-nodejs using debian/nodejs/root_modules file). If one fail, the
       whole test is marked as failed.

       Returned values:

        • 0 if all tests succeed (even if some secondary modules are skipped)

        • 77 if all tests succeed but the main module test was skipped. This value
          is used by autopkgtest to report a SKIP instead of a failure.

        • else, the number of failure. Then autopkgtest considers the test as FAIL

   Customize require test
       If you want to skip some secondary module tests, simply list them in
       debian/tests/pkg-js/require-SKIP (one module per line).

       If you want to skip the whole "require" test, use this:
         echo require > debian/tests/pkg-js/SKIP

THE MAIN TEST
       pkg-js-autopkgtest uses the same test than dh-sequence-nodejs: it
       launches sh -ex debian/tests/pkg-js/test but using the files installed by
       the Debian package.

   How main test works
       pkg-js-autopkgtest search for module name using the same way than "require"
       test. Then it prepares the test environment:

        • it creates a temporary directory

        • it links all files installed in the directory corresponding to module name
          /usr/share/nodejs/<module-name>

        • it creates a node_modules directory and links into it:

         • all modules listed in debian/nodejs/extlinks

         • all modules present in debian/build_modules and debian/tests/test_modules

         • all other modules installed by the Debian package in nodejs root directories
           debian/nodejs/root_modules

        • it copies in node_modules directory all modules listed in
          debian/nodejs/extcopies

        • if looks at debian/tests/pkg-js/files

         • if it exists, it copies all files/directories listed in it from source
           directory to temporary one

         • else it copies from source directory to temporary one:

          • all test* files

          • all Makefile like files (rollup.config.js, gulpfile.js,... )

       Then it changes its directory to the temporary one launches the test using
       sh -ex debian/tests/pkg-js/test.
