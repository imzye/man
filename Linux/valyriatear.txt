NAME
     valyriatear — free 2D J-RPG based on the Hero of Allacrost engine

SYNOPSIS
     valyriatear [options]

DESCRIPTION
     Valyria Tear is a free (as in the GNU General Public License) 2D J-RPG game based on the Hero of Allacrost engine.

     You can play it very much like a typical console role-playing game.  You can explore maps and talk to non-playable characters (NPCs), fight active-time battles against multiple enemies, and manage your
     characters and equipment through a series of menus.  Valyria Tear runs in a series of “game modes” which represent different states of operation in the game.

     -d, --debug args
             enables debug statements in specified sections of the program, where args can be: all, audio, battle, boot, data, global, input, map, mode_manager, pause, quit, scene, system, utils, video

             Disables loading and playing audio

     -h, --help

     Valyria Tear players can input commands to the game either through the keyboard or a gamepad/joystick.  Mouse input is not supported.
