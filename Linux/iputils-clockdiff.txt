NAME
       clockdiff - measure clock difference between hosts

SYNOPSIS

       clockdiff [-o] [-o1] [--time-format ctime iso] [-V] {destination}

DESCRIPTION
       clockdiff Measures clock difference between us and destination with 1 msec resolution using ICMP TIMESTAMP [2] packets or, optionally, IP TIMESTAMP option [3] added to ICMP ECHO. [1]

OPTIONS
       -o
           Use IP TIMESTAMP with ICMP ECHO instead of ICMP TIMESTAMP messages. It is useful with some destinations, which do not support ICMP TIMESTAMP (f.e. Solaris <2.4).

       -o1
           Slightly different form of -o, namely it uses three-term IP TIMESTAMP with prespecified hop addresses instead of four term one. What flavor works better depends on target host. Particularly,
           -o is better for Linux.

       -T, --time-format ctime iso
           Print time stamp in output either ISO-8601 format or classical ctime format. The ctime format is default. The ISO time stamp includes timezone, and is easier to parse.

       -I
           Alias of --time-format iso option and argument.

       -h, --help
           Print help and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

WARNINGS
           • Some nodes (Cisco) use non-standard timestamps, which is allowed by RFC, but makes timestamps mostly useless.

           • Some nodes generate messed timestamps (Solaris>2.4), when run xntpd. Seems, its IP stack uses a corrupted clock source, which is synchronized to time-of-day clock periodically and jumps
           randomly making timestamps mostly useless. Good news is that you can use NTP in this case, which is even better.

           • clockdiff shows difference in time modulo 24 days.
