NAME
       Template::Plugin::GD::Graph::area - Create area graphs with axes and legends

SYNOPSIS
           [% USE g = GD.Graph.area(x_size, y_size); %]

EXAMPLES
           [% FILTER null;
               data = [
                   ["1st","2nd","3rd","4th","5th","6th","7th", "8th", "9th"],
                   [    5,   12,   24,   33,   19,    8,    6,    15,    21],

               ];

                       zero_axis => 1,
                       transparent => 0,
               );
               my_graph.set_legend('left axis', 'right axis' );

DESCRIPTION
       The GD.Graph.area plugin provides an interface to the GD::Graph::area class defined by the GD::Graph module. It allows one or more (x,y) data sets to be plotted as lines with the area between the
       line and x-axis shaded, in addition to axes and legends.

       See GD::Graph for more details.
