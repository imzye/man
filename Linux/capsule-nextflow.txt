NAME
       capsule-nextflow - packaging and development tool for JVM applications

SYNOPSIS
       capsule-nextflow jarFile

DESCRIPTION
       capsule-nextflow allows one to create capsules, which are single executable JARs containing everything an application needs to run in the form of embedded files or as declarative metadata.

       It launches the application in the JAR file jarFile.  This JAR file must contain the Capsule.class file, the JAR of the application to be run, and a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file mentioning Capsule as
       its Main-Class and Premain-Class, and the main class of the application to be run as its Application-Class. The minimal Manifest file would contain
               Manifest-Version: 1.0
               Main-Class: Capsule
               Premain-Class: Capsule
               Application-ID: test
               Application-Version: 1.0
               Application-Class: path.to.main.Class

       where Application-ID and Application-Version fields are chosen by the user, and Application-Class is the main class of the application.
