NAME
       Acme::Bleach - For really clean programs

SYNOPSIS
           use Acme::Bleach;

           print "Hello world";

DESCRIPTION
       The first time you run a program under "use Acme::Bleach", the module removes all the unsightly printable characters from your source file.  The code continues to work exactly as it did before,
       but now it looks like this:

           use Acme::Bleach;

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Can't bleach '%s'"
           Acme::Bleach could not access the source file to modify it.

       "Can't rebleach '%s'"
           Acme::Bleach could not access the source file to execute it.
