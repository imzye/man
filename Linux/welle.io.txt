WELLE-CLI(1)                                                                                   User Commands                                                                                   WELLE-CLI(1)

NAME
       welle-cli - welle.io command line interface

SYNOPSIS
       welle-cli [OPTION]
       welle-cli -w <port> [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       welle-cli is welle.io's command line interface.

OPTIONS
   Tuning:
       -c channel
              Tune to <channel> (eg. 10B, 5A, LD...).

       -p programme
              Play <programme> with ALSA (text name of the radio: eg. GRIFF).

   Dumping:
       -D     Dump FIC and all programmes to files (cannot be used with -C).  This generates: dump.fic; <programme_name.msc> files; <programme_name.wav> files.

       -d     Dump programme to <programme_name.msc> file.

   Web server mode:
       -w port
              Enable web server on port <port>.

       -C number
              Number of programmes to decode in a carousel (to be used with -w, cannot be used with -D).  This is useful if your machine cannot decode all programmes simultaneously, but you still want to
              get an overview of the ensemble.

       -P     Without the -P option, welle-cli will switch every 10 seconds.  With the -P option, welle-cli will switch once DLS and a slide were decoded, staying at most 80 seconds on a given programme.

   Backend and input options:
       -f file
              Read an IQ file <file> and play with ALSA IQ file format is u8, unless the file ends with FORMAT.iq

       -u     Disable coarse corrector, for receivers who have a low frequency offset.

       -g gain
              Set input gain to <gain> or -1 for auto gain.

       -F driver
              Set  input  driver  and  arguments. Default: "auto".  Valid drivers depending on compilation options at build time are: airspy, rtl_sdr, android_rtl_sdr, rtl_tcp, soapysdr.  With "rtl_tcp",
              host IP and port can be specified as "rtl_tcp,<HOST_IP>:<PORT>".

       -s args
              SoapySDR Driver arguments.

       -A antenna
              Set input antenna to ANT (for SoapySDR input only).

       -T     Disable TII decoding to reduce CPU usage.

   Other options:
       -t test_id
              Run test <test_id>.  To understand what the tests do, please see source code.

       -h     Display this help and exit.

       -v     Output version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
       welle-cli -c 10B -p GRRIF

              Read IQ file './ofdm.iq' (in u8 format) and play programme 'GRIFF' with ALSA.

       welle-cli -f ./ofdm.iq -t 1

              Read IQ file './ofdm.iq' (in u8 format), and run test 1.

       welle-cli -c 10B -D

              Dump FIC and all programmes of channel 10B to files.

       welle-cli -c 10B -w 8000

              Enable web server on port 8000, decode programmes on channel 10B on demand (http://localhost:8000).

       welle-cli -c 10B -Dw 8000

              Enable web server on port 8000, decode all programmes on channel 10B.

       welle-cli -c 10B -C 1 -w 8000

              Enable web server on port 8000, decode programmes one by one in a carousel on channel 10B; welle-cli will switch every 10 seconds.

       welle-cli -c 10B -PC 1 -w 8000

              Enable web server on port 8000, decode programmes one by one in a carousel on channel 10B; welle-cli will switch once DLS and a slide were decoded, staying at most 80  seconds  on  a  given
