NAME
       amavisd-new - Interface between MTA and virus scanner/content filters

SYNOPSIS
       amavisd-new [ -u userid ] [ -g groupid ] [ -c config-file ]...  [ start | stop | reload | debug | debug-sa | foreground ]

DESCRIPTION
       amavisd is a high-performance interface between message transfer agent (MTA) and virus scanners and/or spam scanners.

       This is the amavisd-new incarnation of amavisd.  It is a performance-enhanced and feature-enriched version of the original amavisd program.

       Amavisd-new works as a SMTP proxy.  Email is fed to it through SMTP, processed, and fed back to the MTA through a new SMTP connection.  There is no buffering to disk by amavis, it will report that
       the transfer was sucessfull only after the forwarding MTA has accepted the message.

       It is possible to use the sendmail milter interface instead of the SMTP proxy method, as well.

OPTIONS
       -c configfile
              Use the specified configuration file instead of using run-parts(8) to find config files in /usr/share/amavis/conf.d and /etc/amavis/conf.d (this is a Debian extension to Amavisd-new).  More
              than one -c option can be specified and the files will be read in the order given.

       -u userid
              Try to switch to that user id.

       -g groupid
              Try to switch to that group id.

       start  Starts amavisd-new

       stop   Stops a running amavisd-new

       reload Reloads configuration from config file (may in fact just restart amavisd-new)

       debug  Runs amavisd-new in debug mode

       debug-sa
              Runs amavisd-new in spamassassin debug mode

       foreground
              Does not fork to background
