NAME
       bkt - A subprocess caching utility

SYNOPSIS
       bkt [OPTIONS] -- <COMMAND>...

DESCRIPTION
       CLI and Rust library for caching subprocess invocations

   Arguments:
       <COMMAND>...
              The command to run

OPTIONS
       --ttl <DURATION>
              Duration the cached result will be valid for [env: BKT_TTL=] [default: 60s] [aliases: time-to-live]

       --stale <DURATION>
              Duration after which the result will be asynchronously refreshed

       --warm Asynchronously execute and cache the given command, even if it's already cached

       --force
              Execute and cache the given command, even if it's already cached

       --cwd  Includes the current working directory in the cache key, so that the same command run in different directories caches separately [aliases: use-working-dir]

       --env <NAME>
              Includes the given environment variable in the cache key, so that the same command run with different values for the given variables caches separately [aliases: use-environment]

       --modtime <FILE>
              Includes the last modification time of the given file(s) in the cache key, so that the same command run with different modtimes for the given files caches separately [aliases: use-file-mod‐
              time]

       --discard-failures
              Don't  cache  invocations  that fail (non-zero exit code). USE CAUTION when passing this flag, as unexpected failures can lead to a spike in invocations which can exacerbate ongoing issues,
              effectively a DDoS

       --scope <NAME>
              If set, all cached data will be scoped to this value, preventing collisions with commands cached with different scopes [env: BKT_SCOPE=]

       --cache-dir <DIR>
              The directory under which to persist cached invocations; defaults to the system's temp directory. Setting this to a directory backed by RAM or an SSD, such as a tmpfs partition,  will  sig‐
              nificantly reduce caching overhead [env: BKT_CACHE_DIR=]

       -h, --help
              Print help

       -V, --version
              Print version
