NAME
       screenFetch - The Bash Screenshot Information Tool

SYNOPSIS
       screenfetch [OPTIONAL FLAGS]

DESCRIPTION
       This handy Bash script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots nowadays. It will auto-detect your distri‐
       bution  and  display an ASCII version of that distribution's logo and some valuable information to the right. There are options to specify no ASCII art, colors, taking a screenshot upon displaying
       info, and even customizing the screenshot command!  This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended.

OPTIONS
       -v     Verbose output.

       -o 'OPTIONS'
              Allows for setting script variables on the command line. Must be in the following format: 'OPTION1="OPTIONARG1";OPTION2="OPTIONARG2"'

       -d '+var;-var;var'
              Allows for setting what information is displayed on the command line. You can add displays with +var,var.  You can delete displays with -var,var. Setting without + or - will set display  to
              that explicit combination. Add and delete statements may be used in conjunction by placing a ; between them as so: +var,var,var;-var,var.

       -n     Do not display ASCII distribution logo.

       -L     Display ASCII distribution logo only.

       -N     Strip all color from output.

       -w     Wrap long lines.

       -t     Truncate output based on terminal width (Experimental!).

       -p     Output in portrait mode, with logo above info.

       -s [-u IMGHOST]
              Using  this  flag  tells the script that you want it to take a screenshot. Use the -u flag if you would like to upload the screenshots to one of the pre-configured locations. These include:
              teknik, imgur, mediacrush and hmp.

       -c string
              You may change the outputted colors with -c. The format is as follows: [0-9][0-9],[0-9][0-9]. The first argument controls the ASCII logo colors and the label  colors.  The  second  argument
              controls the colors of the information found. One argument may be used without the other.

       -a 'PATH'
              You  can specify a custom ASCII art by passing the path to a Bash script, defining startline and fulloutput variables, and optionally labelcolor and textcolor. See the asciiText function in
              the source code for more information on the variables format.

       -S 'COMMAND'
              Here you can specify a custom screenshot command for the script to execute. Surrounding quotes are required.

       -D 'DISTRO'
              Here you can specify your distribution for the script to use. Surrounding quotes are required.

       -A 'DISTRO'
              Here you can specify the distribution art that you want displayed. This is for when you want your distro detected but want to display a different logo.

       -E     Suppress output of errors.

       -V, --version
              Display current script version.

       -h, --help
