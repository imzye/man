SIGNALS
       On receipt of a SIGHUP, the daemon will close and reopen its log file, and reread the configuration file.

       On receipt of a SIGUSR1, the daemon dumps the currently loaded configuration into the log file.

       On receipt of a SIGUSR2, the daemon saves its state into the state file.
