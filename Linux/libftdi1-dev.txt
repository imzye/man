NAME
       libftdi1-config - script to get information about the installed version of libftdi1

SYNOPSIS
       libftdi1-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags] [LIBRARIES]

DESCRIPTION
       libftdi1-ftdi is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use libftdi1.

OPTIONS
       libftdi1-config accepts the following options:

       LIBRARIES
               This argument is currently ignored as libftdi1 as only one library.

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of libftdi1 on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a libftdi1 program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a libftdi1 program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified,  use  PREFIX  instead of the installation prefix that libftdi1 was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the
               exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that libftdi1 was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be  specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
