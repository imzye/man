NOBODD-PREP(1)                                                                                  nobodd                                                                                  NOBODD-PREP(1)

NAME
       nobodd-prep - nobodd-prep - prepare an OS image for NBD netboot

       Customizes  an OS image to prepare it for netbooting via TFTP. Specifically, this expands the image to a specified size (the assumption being the image is a copy of a minimally sized template
       image), then updates the kernel command line on the boot partition to point to an NBD server.

SYNOPSIS
          usage: nobodd-prep [-h] [--version] [-s SIZE] [--nbd-host HOST]
                             [--nbd-name NAME] [--cmdline NAME]
                             [--boot-partition NUM] [--root-partition NUM]
                             [-C PATH] [-R PATH] image

OPTIONS
       image  The target image to customize

       -h, --help
              show the help message and exit

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -s SIZE, --size SIZE
              The size to expand the image to; default: 16GB

       --nbd-host HOST
              The hostname of the nbd server to connect to for the root device; defaults to the local machine's FQDN

       --nbd-name NAME
              The name of the nbd share to use as the root device; defaults to the stem of the image name

       --cmdline NAME
              The name of the file containing the kernel command line on the boot partition; default: cmdline.txt

       --boot-partition NUM
              Which partition is the boot partition within the image; default is the first FAT partition (identified by partition type) found in the image

       --root-partition NUM
              Which partition is the root partition within the image default is the first non-FAT partition (identified by partition type) found in the image

       -C PATH, --copy PATH
              Copy the specified file or directory into the boot partition. This may be given multiple times to specify multiple items to copy

       -R PATH, --remove PATH
              Delete the specified file or directory within the boot partition. This may be given multiple times to specify multiple items to delete

       --serial HEX
              Defines the serial number of the Raspberry Pi that will be served this image. When this option is given,  a  board  configuration  compatible  with  nobodd-tftpd  may  be  output  with
              --tftpd-conf

       --tftpd-conf FILE
              If specified, write a board configuration compatible with nobodd-tftpd to the specified file; requires --serial to be given. If "-" is given, output is written to stdout.

       --nbd-conf FILE
              If specified, write a share configuration compatible with nbd-server(1) to the specified file. If "-" is given, output is written to stdout.

USAGE
       Typically  nobodd-prep  is  called with a base OS image. For example, if ubuntu-24.04-server.img.xz is the Ubuntu 24.04 Server for Raspberry image, we would decompress it (we can only work on
       uncompressed images), use the tool to expand it to a reasonable disk size (e.g. 16GB like an SD card), and customize the kernel command line to look for the rootfs on our NBD server:

          $ sudo umount mnt/

       Note, the only reason we are listing partitions and mounting the boot partition above is to demonstrate the change to the kernel command line in cmdline.txt. Ordinarily, usage of  nobodd-prep
       is as simple as:

          $ unxz ubuntu-24.04-server.img.xz
          $ nobodd-prep --size 16GB ubuntu-24.04-server.img

       Typically  nobodd-prep  will  detect  the  boot  and  root  partitions  of  the  image  automatically.  The  boot  partition  is  defined  as the first partition that has a FAT partition type
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type> (on MBR-partitioned  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record>  images),  or  Basic  Data  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_ba‐
       sic_data_partition>  or  EFI System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition> partition type (on GPT-partitioned <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table> images), which
       contains a valid FAT file-system (the script tries to determine the FAT-type of the contained file-system, and only counts those partitions on which it can determine a valid FAT-type).

       The root partition is the exact opposite; it is defined as the first partition that doesn't have  a  FAT  partition  type  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type>  (on  MBR-partitioned
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record>  images), or Basic Data <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_basic_data_partition> or EFI System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_sys‐
       tem_partition> partition type (on GPT-partitioned <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table> images), which contains something other than a valid FAT file-system (again, the  script
       tries to determine the FAT-type of the contained file-system, and only counts those partitions on which it cannot determine a valid FAT-type).

       There  may  be  images  for which these simplistic definitions do not work. For example, images derived from a NOOBS/PINN <https://github.com/procount/pinn> install may well have several boot
       partitions for different installed OS'. In this case the boot or root partition (or both) may be specified manually on the command line:

          $ fdisk -l pinn-test.img
          Disk pinn-test.img: 29.72 GiB, 31914983424 bytes, 62333952 sectors
          Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
          Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
          I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
          Disklabel type: dos
          Disk identifier: 0x2e779525

          $ nobodd-prep --boot-partition 10 --root-partition 11 pinn-test.img

       nobodd-prep also includes several facilities for customizing the boot partition beyond re-writing the kernel's cmdline.txt.  Specifically, the --remove and --copy options.

       The --remove option can be given multiple times, and tells nobodd-prep to remove the specified files or directories from the boot partition. The --copy  option  can  also  be  given  multiple
       times, and tells nobodd-prep to copy the specified files or directories into the root of the boot partition. In both cases, directories that are specified are removed or copied recursively.

       The  --copy option is particularly useful for overwriting the cloud-init <https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> seeds on the boot partition of Ubuntu Server images, in case you want to
       provide an initial network configuration, user setup, or list of packages to install on first boot:

          $ cat user-data
          chpasswd:
            expire: true
            users:
            - name: ubuntu
              password: raspberry
              type: text

          ssh_pwauth: false

          package_update: true
          package_upgrade: true
          packages:
          - avahi-daemon
          $ nobodd-prep --copy user-data ubuntu-24.04-server.img

       There is no need to --remove files you wish to --copy; the latter option will overwrite where necessary. The exception to this is copying directories; if you are copying a directory that  al‐
       ready  exists  in the boot partition, the new content will be merged with the existing content. Files under the directory that share a name will be overwritten, files that do not will be left
       in place. If you wish to replace the directory wholesale, specify it with --remove as well.

       The ordering of options on the command line does not affect the order of operations in the utility. The order of operations in nobodd-prep is strictly as follows:

       1. Detect partitions, if necessary

       2. Re-size the image, if necessary

       3. Remove all items on the boot partition specified by --remove

       4. Copy all items specified by --copy into the boot partition

       5. Re-write the root= option in the cmdline.txt file

       This ordering is deliberate, firstly to ensure directories can be replaced (as noted above), and secondly to ensure cmdline.txt can be customized by --copy prior  to  the  customization  per‐
       formed by the utility.
