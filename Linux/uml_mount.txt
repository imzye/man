NAME
       uml_mount — allows to mount UMLFS file system using the fuse libraries

SYNOPSIS
       uml_mount [mount-point]  [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the uml_mount command.

       This command uses the FUSE (File system in USErspace) libraries and invokes the FUSE_MOUNT function which expects a mount point and some parameters as arguments.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. For a practical example, please refer to the link below.

       uml_mount is used to mount UMLFS file system.
