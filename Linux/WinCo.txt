NAME
       WinCommand - AfterStep module for choosing and manipulating windows based on patterns

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
DESCRIPTION
       WinCommand  is  a  command  line  tool  which  allows  you  to select windows based on their name and to then manipulate them in various ways. Actions currently supported are: "center", "center jump",
       "iconify", "jump", "kill", "move", "resize" and "sendtodesk".

DEFAULTS
       The default pattern is "", meaning all windows will be selected.

       All other default-values depend on the action you would like WinCommand to take. If more than one action is specified, default-values are set depending on the last action specified.

ACTIONS
       center

              Place matching windows into the center of the screen.

       center jump:

              Places first window that matches into the center of the screen and jumps to it.

       iconify:

              Iconifies matching windows.

       jump:

              Jumps to the first window which matches.

       kill:

              Kills all matching windows.

       move:

              Moves all matching windows to x/y. x and y are specified using the -x and -y flags.

       resize:

              Resize all matching windows. The two parameters width and height are specified using the -width and -height flags.

       send_to_desk:

              Send all matching windows to desk specified with the -new_desk flag.

OPTIONS
       -all

              Operate on all windows which match the given pattern. This is set by default unless the action is either "jump" or "center jump".

       -alldesks

              Windows on all desks will be taken into account. This is set by default if action is either "jump" or "center jump".

       -desk

              Windows on the whole desk will be taken into account.

       -x/-y

              These are required when issuing the move-command.

       -width/-height

              These are required whenever you want to resize windows.

              Examples WinCommand -pattern term iconify

              This command will iconify all terminals. Since the specified pattern is a regular expression, something like this also works:

              WinCommand -pattern "(term)|(moz)" iconify

              This will iconify all terminals and mozilla-browser windows.

              WinCommand -pattern xmm jump

              will jump to your xmms. In this situation, it's far more advisable to use GWCommand though.

              It is probably not a good idea to delete windows while windows are being arranged.
