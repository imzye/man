SCTP(7)                                                                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                                                                  SCTP(7)

NAME
       sctp - SCTP protocol.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>
       #include <netinet/in.h>
       #include <netinet/sctp.h>

       sctp_socket = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP);
       sctp_socket = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_SEQPACKET, IPPROTO_SCTP);

DESCRIPTION
       This  is an implementation of the SCTP protocol as defined in RFC4960. It is a message oriented, reliable transport protocol with direct support for multihoming that runs on top of ip(7), and sup‐
       ports both v4 and v6 versions.

       Like TCP, SCTP provides reliable, connection oriented data delivery with congestion control. Unlike TCP, SCTP also provides message boundary preservation, ordered and unordered  message  delivery,
       multi-streaming  and  multi-homing.  Detection of data corruption, loss of data and duplication of data is achieved by using checksums and sequence numbers. A selective retransmission mechanism is
       applied to correct loss or corruption of data.

       This implementation supports a mapping of SCTP into sockets API as defined in the RFC6458(Sockets API extensions for SCTP). Two styles of interfaces are supported.

       A one-to-many style interface with 1 to MANY relationship between socket and associations where the outbound association setup is implicit. The syntax of a one-to-many style socket() call is

       sd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_SEQPACKET, IPPROTO_SCTP);

       A typical server in this style uses the following socket calls in sequence to prepare an endpoint for servicing requests.

            1. socket()
            2. bind()
            3. listen()
            4. recvmsg()
            5. sendmsg()
            6. close()

       A typical client uses the following calls in sequence to setup an association with a server to request services.

            1. socket()
            2. sendmsg()
            3. recvmsg()
            4. close()

       A one-to-one style interface with a 1 to 1 relationship between socket and association which enables existing TCP applications to be ported to SCTP with very little effort. The syntax of a one-to-
       one style socket() call is

       sd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP);

       A typical server in one-to-one style uses the following system call sequence to prepare an SCTP endpoint for servicing requests:

            1. socket()
            2. bind()
            3. listen()
            4. accept()

       The accept() call blocks until a new association is set up. It returns with a new socket descriptor. The server then uses the new socket descriptor to communicate with the client, using recv() and
       send() calls to get requests and send back responses. Then it calls

            5. close()

       to terminate the association. A typical client uses the following system call sequence to setup an association with a server to request services:

            1. socket()
            2. connect()

       After returning from connect(), the client uses send() and recv() calls to send out requests and receive responses from the server. The client calls

            3. close()

       to terminate this association when done.

ADDRESS FORMATS
       SCTP is built on top of IP (see ip(7)).  The address formats defined by ip(7) apply to SCTP.  SCTP only supports point-to-point communication; broadcasting and multicasting are not supported.

SYSCTLS
       These variables can be accessed by the /proc/sys/net/sctp/* files or with the sysctl(2) interface.  In addition, most IP sysctls also apply to SCTP. See ip(7).

       Please check kernel documentation for this, at Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.rst.

STATISTICS
       These variables can be accessed by the /proc/net/sctp/* files.

       assocs Displays the following information about the active associations.  assoc ptr, sock ptr, socket style, sock state, association state, hash bucket, association id, bytes  in  transmit  queue,
              bytes  in receive queue, user id, inode, local port, remote port, local addresses, remote addresses, heartbeat interval, in streams, out streams, max retransmissions, init retries, shutdown
              retries, retransmitted chunks, sock transmit queue committed bytes, sock transmit queue bytes, and sock send and receive buffer bytes.

CONTROL MSGS
       The  ancillary data is carried in msg_control field of struct msghdr, which is used in sendmsg(2) and recvmsg(2) call. The SCTP stack uses the ancillary data to communicate the attributes, such as
       SCTP_RCVINFO, of the message stored in msg_iov to the socket endpoint.  Each ancillary data item is preceded by a struct cmsghdr, see cmsg(3).  The different cmsg types for SCTP are listed  below,
       and all these related macros and structures are defined in /usr/include/netinet/sctp.h.

       SCTP_INIT
              This cmsg provides information for initializing new SCTP associations for sendmsg() with struct sctp_initmsg, which is the same as SCTP_INITMSG socket option's data structure.

       SCTP_SNDRCV
              This  cmsg  specifies  SCTP options for sendmsg() and describes SCTP header information about a received message through recvmsg() with struct sctp_sndrcvinfo. It mixes the send and receive
              path, and SCTP_SNDINFO and SCTP_RCVINFO split this information, so these structures should be used, when possible, since SCTP_SNDRCV is deprecated.  sctp_sendmsg(3) and sctp_send(3) provide
              a simple way to use this cmsg.

              Note that an application must use the SCTP_RECVRCVINFO socket option to enable the delivery of this information.

       SCTP_EXTRCV
              This cmsg specifies SCTP options for SCTP header information about a received message via recvmsg() with struct sctp_extrcvinfo, and this structure is an extended  version  of  SCTP_SNDRCV.
              Note  that data in the next message is not valid unless the current message is completely read, i.e., unless the MSG_EOR is set. SCTP_NXTINFO should be used when possible, since SCTP_EXTRCV
              is considered deprecated.  sctp_recvmsg(3) provides a simple way to use this cmsg.

              Note that an application must use the SCTP_RECVNXTINFO socket option to enable the delivery of this information.

       SCTP_RCVINFO, SCTP_NXTINFO
              These cmsgs describe SCTP receive information about a received message through recvmsg() with struct sctp_rcvinfo, and SCTP receive information of the next message that  will  be  delivered
              through recvmsg() if this information is already available when delivering the current message with struct sctp_nxtinfo.  sctp_recvv(3) provides a simple way to use these cmsgs.

              Note that an application must use the SCTP_RECVRCVINFO and SCTP_RECVNXTINFO socket options accordingly to enable the delivery of this information.

       SCTP_SNDINFO, SCTP_PRINFO, SCTP_AUTHINFO, SCTP_DSTADDRV4, SCTP_DSTADDRV6
              These  cmsgs  specifie a couple of SCTP options for sendmsg() for SEND, PRSCTP, AUTH and DSTADDR information with struct sctp_sndinfo, sctp_prinfo, sctp_authinfo and in(6)_addr accordingly.
              sctp_sendv(3) provides a simple way to use these cmsgs.

EVENTS and NOTIFICATIONS
       An SCTP application may need to understand and process events and errors that happen on the SCTP stack. These events include network status changes, association startups,  remote  operational  er‐
       rors,  and undeliverable messages.  When a notification arrives, recvmsg() returns the notification in the application-supplied data buffer via msg_iov, and sets MSG_NOTIFICATION in msg_flags. See
       socket option SCTP_EVENT for the event enabling. The different events are listed below, and all these related macros and structures are defined in /usr/include/netinet/sctp.h.

       SCTP_ASSOC_CHANGE
              Communication notifications inform the application that an SCTP association has either begun or ended. The notification format is struct sctp_assoc_change.

       SCTP_PEER_ADDR_CHANGE
              When a destination address of a multi-homed peer encounters a state change, a peer address change event is sent. The notification format is struct sctp_paddr_change.

       SCTP_REMOTE_ERROR
              A remote peer may send an Operation Error message to its peer.  This message indicates a variety of error conditions on an association.  The notification format is struct sctp_remote_error.

       SCTP_SEND_FAILED
              If SCTP cannot deliver a message, it can return back the message as a notification if the SCTP_SEND_FAILED event is enabled. The notification format is struct sctp_send_failed. Please  note
              that this notification is deprecated. Use SCTP_SEND_FAILED_EVENT instead.

       SCTP_SHUTDOWN_EVENT
              When a peer sends a SHUTDOWN, SCTP delivers this notification to inform the application that it should cease sending data. The notification format is struct sctp_shutdown_event.

       SCTP_ADAPTATION_INDICATION
              When  a  peer sends an Adaptation Layer Indication parameter, SCTP delivers this notification to inform the application about the peer's adaptation layer indication. The notification format
              is struct sctp_adaptation_event.

       SCTP_PARTIAL_DELIVERY_EVENT
              When a receiver is engaged in a partial delivery of a message, this notification will be used to indicate various events. The notification format is struct sctp_pdapi_event.

       SCTP_AUTHENTICATION_EVENT
              This is used to report different events relating to the use of the extension to authenticate SCTP messages. The notification format is struct sctp_authkey_event.

       SCTP_SENDER_DRY_EVENT
              When the SCTP stack has no more user data to send or retransmit, this notification is given to the user.  Also, at the time when a user app subscribes to this event, if there is no data  to
              be sent or retransmit, the stack will immediately send up this notification. The notification format is struct sctp_sender_dry_event.

       SCTP_SEND_FAILED_EVENT
              If SCTP cannot deliver a message, it can return back the message as a notification if the SCTP_SEND_FAILED_EVENT event is enabled. The notification format is struct sctp_send_failed_event.

SOCKET OPTIONS
       To  set  or get a SCTP socket option, call getsockopt(2) to read or setsockopt(2) to write the option with the option level argument set to SOL_SCTP.  Note that all these macros and structures de‐
       scribed for parameters are defined in /usr/include/netinet/sctp.h, and for one-to-one style sockets a specified assoc_id works the same as SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC.

       SCTP_RTOINFO.
              This option is used to get or set the protocol parameters used to initialize and bound retransmission timeout(RTO).

              The parameter type is struct sctp_rtoinfo, for reading and writing.  srto_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC.

              Default: srto_max=sysctl_net.sctp.rto_max, srto_min=sysctl_net.sctp.rto_min, srto_initial=sysctl_net.sctp.rto_initial.

       SCTP_ASSOCINFO
              This option is used to both examine and set various association and endpoint parameters.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_assocparams, for reading and writing.  sasoc_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC. Note that some fields of this structure are for reading
              only:

                struct sctp_assocparams {
                        sctp_assoc_t    sasoc_assoc_id;
                        __u16           sasoc_asocmaxrxt; (RW)
                        __u16           sasoc_number_peer_destinations; (R)
                        __u32           sasoc_peer_rwnd; (R)
                        __u32           sasoc_local_rwnd; (R)
                        __u32           sasoc_cookie_life; (RW)
                };

              Default: sasoc_asocmaxrxt=sysctl_net.sctp.association_max_retrans, sasoc_cookie_life=sysctl_net.sctp.valid_cookie_life.

       SCTP_INITMSG
              This option is used to get or set the protocol parameters for the default association initialization.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_initmsg, for reading and writing.

              Default: sinit_num_ostreams=10, sinit_max_instreams=10, sinit_max_attempts=sysctl_net.sctp.max_init_retransmits, sinit_max_init_timeo=sysctl_net.sctp.rto_max.

       SCTP_NODELAY
              Turn on/off any Nagle-like algorithm. This means that packets are generally sent as soon as possible and no unnecessary delays are introduced, at the cost of more packets in the network.

              The parameter type is int boolean, for reading and writing.

              Default: 0.

       SCTP_AUTOCLOSE
              This socket option is applicable to the one-to-many style socket only.  When set it will cause associations that are idle for more than the specified  number  of  seconds  to  automatically
              close. An association being idle is defined an association that has NOT sent or received user data within a period.

              The parameter type is int(seconds), for reading and writing. 0 indicates that no automatic close of any associations should be performed.

              Default: sysctl_net.sctp.max_autoclose.

       SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR
              Requests that the peer mark the enclosed address as the association primary. The enclosed address must be one of the association's locally bound addresses.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_setpeerprim, for writing only.  sspp_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id.

              Default: the 1st local address added.  Require: SCTP_ASCONF_SUPPORTED.

       SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR
              Requests that the local SCTP stack use the enclosed peer address as the association primary. The enclosed address must be one of the association peer's addresses.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_prim, for writing only. ssp_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id.

              Default: the 1st peer address added.  Require: SCTP_ASCONF_SUPPORTED.

       SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS
              If enabled no SCTP message fragmentation will be performed. Instead if a message being sent exceeds the current PMTU size, the message will NOT be sent and an error will be indicated to the
              user.

              The parameter type is int boolean, for reading and writing.

              Default: 0.

       SCTP_PEER_ADDR_PARAMS
              Using  this  option,  applications can enable or disable heartbeats for any peer address of an association, modify an address's heartbeat interval, force a heartbeat to be sent immediately,
              and adjust the address's maximum number of retransmissions sent before an address is considered unreachable.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_paddrparams, for reading and writing.  spp_address is a specified transport address or 0, spp_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC.

              Default: hbinterval=sysctl_net.sctp.hb_interval, pathmaxrxt=sysctl_net.sctp.path_max_retrans,  pathmtu=dev/route's,  sackdelay=sysctl_net.sctp.sack_timeout,  param_flags=HB_ENABLE|PMTUD_EN‐
              ABLE|SACKDELAY_ENABLE, flowlabel=0, dscp=0.

       SCTP_DEFAULT_SEND_PARAM
              Applications  that  wish to use the sendto() system call may wish to specify a default set of parameters that would normally be supplied through the inclusion of ancillary data. This option
              has been obsoleted by SCTP_DEFAULT_SNDINFO.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_sndrcvinfo. For reading, sinfo_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC. For writing, sinfo_assoc_id is  a  specified  assoc_id  or  SCTP_{FU‐
              TURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC.

              Default: default_stream=0, default_flags=0, default_ppid=0, default_context=0, default_timetolive=0.

       SCTP_EVENTS
              This socket option is used to specify various notifications and ancillary data the user wishes to receive. This option has been obsoleted by SCTP_EVENT.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_event_subscribe, for reading and writing.

              Default: 0.

       SCTP_I_WANT_MAPPED_V4_ADDR
              This  socket  option  is used to turn on or off mapped V4 addresses. If this option is turned on and the socket is type PF_INET6, then IPv4 addresses will be mapped to V6 representation. If
              this option is turned off, then no mapping will be done of V4 addresses and a user will receive both PF_INET6 and PF_INET type addresses on the socket.

              The parameter type is int boolean, for reading and writing.

              Default: 1.

       SCTP_MAXSEG
              This socket option specifies the maximum size to put in any outgoing SCTP DATA chunk. If a message is larger than this size it will be fragmented by SCTP into the specified size. Note  that
              the  underlying SCTP implementation may fragment into smaller sized chunks when the PMTU of the underlying association is smaller than the value set by the user. 0 indicates the user is NOT
              limiting fragmentation and only the PMTU will effect SCTP's choice of DATA chunk size.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_assoc_value, for reading and writing.  assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC.

              Default: 0(no limit).

       SCTP_STATUS
              Applications can retrieve current status information about an association, including association state, peer receiver window size, number of unacked data chunks, and number of  data  chunks
              pending receipt.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_status, for reading only. sstat_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id.

       SCTP_GET_PEER_ADDR_INFO
              Applications can retrieve information about a specific peer address of an association, including its reachability state, congestion window, and retransmission timer values.

              The parameter type is struct sctp_paddrinfo, for reading only. spinfo_address is a specified transport address, sas_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC.

       SCTP_GET_ASSOC_STATS

              The parameter type is struct sctp_assoc_stats, for reading only.  sas_assoc_id is a specified assoc_id.

       SCTP_DELAYED_ACK, SCTP_DELAYED_ACK_TIME, SCTP_DELAYED_SACK
              These options will affect the way delayed SACKs are performed. They allow the application to get or set the delayed SACK time, in milliseconds, and also allow changing the delayed SACK fre‐
              quency. Changing the frequency to 1 disables the delayed SACK algorithm. Note that if sack_delay or sack_freq is 0 when setting this option, the current values will remain unchanged.

       SCTP_CONTEXT
              This  option  allows  the setting, on an association basis, of a default context that will be received on reading messages from the peer.  This is especially helpful for an application when
              using one-to-many style sockets to keep some reference to an internal state machine that is processing messages on the association.  Note that the setting of this  value  only  affects  re‐
              ceived messages from the peer and does not affect the value that is saved with outbound messages.

              The  parameter  type  is  struct  sctp_assoc_value.  For  reading,  assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC. For writing, assoc_id is a specified assoc_id or SCTP_{FUTURE|CUR‐

              Setting this to a lower value will cause partial deliveries to happen more often.  This option expects an integer that sets or gets the partial delivery point in bytes.  Note also that  the
              call  will fail if the user attempts to set this value larger than the socket receive buffer size. Note that any single message having a length smaller than or equal to the SCTP partial de‐
              livery point will be delivered in a single read call as long as the user-provided buffer is large enough to hold the message.

              The parameter type is uint32_t, for reading and writing.

              Default: 0.

              This  option  gets  the current number of associations that are attached to a one-to-many style socket. Note that this number is only a snapshot.  This means that the number of associations
              may have changed when the caller gets back the option result.

              The parameter type is uint32_t, for reading only.

       SCTP_GET_ASSOC_ID_LIST
              This option gets the current list of SCTP association identifiers of the SCTP associations handled by a one-to-many style socket. It uses struct sctp_assoc_ids  and  must  provide  a  large
