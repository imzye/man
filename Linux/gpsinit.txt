NAME
       gpsinit - initialize CAN kernel modules for GPSD

SYNOPSIS
       gpsinit [-n control] [-s speed] module_name [interface_name]

       gpsinit -h

       gpsinit -v

DESCRIPTION
       gpsinit initializes whatever kernel-level modules are needed to enable
       special non-serial hardware to communicate with a gpsd instance. Note:
       it will need root permissions to load modules and perform other special
       operations, such as changing kernel-interface baudrates.

       At present, all modes of this tool are concerned with setting up
       kernel-level interfaces to hardware on a CAN (Control Area Network)
       speaking NMEA2000.

       The program accepts the following options:

       -h
           Display a brief help text.

       -v
           Display the version of gpsinit.

       -n
           Set the CAN network number. The default is 0.

       -s
           Set the baudrate to be used to communicate over the serial line to
           the CAN hardware. The default is 38400 baud.

       The parameter module_name is mandatory. The socket CAN driver module
       module_name.ko will be loaded.  gpsinit recognize the following module
       names:

       plx_pci, esd_usb2, vcan, slcan
           The parameter interface_name and -s speed can used here.

       beaglebone
           The dcan module needed for the beaglebone is part of the Linux
           kernel, so no module is loaded in this case.

       The parameter interface_name is needed for slcan hardware only. It
       gives the name of the serial device to which the SL CAN hardware is
       connected. The default is /dev/ttyUSB0.

EXAMPLES
       sudo gpsinit plx_pci
           Attempt to load the module plx_pci and initialize net 0 for the
           connection to a NMEA2000 network. It will set the baudrate to
           250kBits.

       sudo gpsinit -n 1 plx_pci
           As above, but use net 1.

       sudo gpsinit -s 38400 slcan /dev/ttyUSB0
           Attempt to load the module slcan and talk to the hardware at 38400
           baud connected to port /dev/ttyUSB0.

       gpsinit -h
           Display a brief help message.

       gpsinit -v
           Display the version of gpsinit.
