NAME
       fs_mark - Benchmark synchronous/async file creation

SYNOPSIS
       fs_mark [OPTIONS] -d DIRECTORY [-d DIRECTORY ...]

DESCRIPTION
       fs_mark is meant to give some low level bashing to file systems. The write pattern that it concentrates on is heavily synchronous IO across multiple directories, drives, etc.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print usage and exit.

       -k     Keep files after each iteration.

       -F     Run until filesystem is full.

       -SSyncmethod
              Method to be used for synchronizing changes to disk:

              0: No Sync

              1: fsyncBeforeClose

              2: sync/1_fsync

              3: PostReverseFsync

              4: syncPostReverseFsync

              5: PostFsync

              6: syncPostFsync

       -Dnumber
              Use number subdirectories.

       -Nnumber
              Use number files in each subdirectory in round robin mode.

       -ddirectory
              Use directory. Can be specified multiple times.

       -llogfile
              Log to logfile.

       -Lnumber
              Repeat the benchmark number of iterations.

       -nnumber
              Use number of files per iteration.

       -pnumber
              Use number of total bytes file names.

       -rnumber
              Use number of random bytes in file names.

       -sbyte_count
              Use number of bytes as size of each file.

       -tnumber
              Use number of threads.

       -wnumber
              Use number (of bytes per write() syscall.
