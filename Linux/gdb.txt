NAME
       gcore - Generate core files for running processes

SYNOPSIS
       gcore [-a] [-o filename] pid[s]

DESCRIPTION
       gcore generates a core file for the process(es) specified by process IDs, pid[s]. By default, each core file is written to core.pid, in the current directory.

       -a     (Linux only) ignore /proc/PID/coredump_filter and also dump memory mappings marked with the 'VM_DONTDUMP' flag. See info node Core File Generation for longer explanation.

       -o filename
              write core file to filename if one PID, or filename.pid if multiple PIDs, instead of default core.pid
