NAME
       jester - an X-based game similar to Othello(tm)

SYNOPSIS
       jester [{-display, -d, --display} display] [{-h, -help, --help}] [-2players] [-ai {white, black}]

DESCRIPTION
       jester is an X-based game similar to the board game Othello.  jester allows you to waste hours of otherwise productive time that could be spent playing Solitaire instead.

GAME PLAY
       There are two players, one playing the white pieces, the other playing the black pieces.  Each player takes turns placing a piece of his or her color on an 8x8 board.  Each piece must be placed so
       as to bracket a line of the opponent's pieces between two of the current player's pieces.  When this happens, the opponent's pieces are replaced by pieces of the current player's color.

       When  the  cursor is over a square that it is legal for the current player to play in, the cursor will change to a pointing hand.  A small rectangle in the upper right side of the window shows the
       color of the current player.

       The game ends when a player cannot make a move, either because the board is full or because the position of the pieces makes it impossible to make a move.  At this point, the player with the  most
       pieces on the board is the winner.  You will be offered the option of starting a new game.

       You may exit at any time by clicking the “Exit” button.

   OPTIONS
       -d, -display, --display display
              Display on display.

       -h, -help, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -2players
              Play against another person at the same console.

       -ai {white, black}
              Tell the computer which side to play.  The default behavior is equivalent to -ai black.

ENVIRONMENT
       jester uses the environment variable “DISPLAY” as the default display.  This can be overridden on the command line.
