NAME
       sreview-import - Import an event schedule from an event's upstream

SYNOPSIS
       sreview-import

DESCRIPTION
       "sreview-import" instantiates a "schedule_format" schedule parser, and makes sure that first, all events and talks in the parsed schedule exist in the SReview database, and second, that all events
       and talks which exist in the SReview database for a found event but which do not exist in the parsed schedule are marked as "ignored". Parsers are implemented as classes under the
       "SReview::Schedule::" namespace; e.g., the SReview::Schedule::Penta class implements the "penta" parser.

       The location of the event schedule is to be passed to the schedule parser using the relevant option of that parser; most support the "url" option for a URL.

CONFIGURATION
       "sreview-import" considers the following configuration values:

       dbistring
           The DBI string used to connect to the database. Required.

       schedule_format
           The format of the schedule. Required. Must be implemented as a subclass of "SReview::Schedule::Base".

       schedule_options
           Any  options to be provided to the parser. Should be a hash; which keys are supported depends on the relevant parser. See the parser's documentation for details (e.g., SReview::Schedule::Penta
           for the "penta" parser.
