NAME
       ppmwheel - make a PPM image of a color wheel

SYNOPSIS
       ppmwheel diameter

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmwheel  produces a PPM image of a color wheel of the specified diame‐
       ter inside a white square just large enough to hold it.

       The color wheel is based on the HSV color model.  Hues are  distributed
       angularly around the circle and the values are distributed radially and
       the saturation is zero everywhere.  The values are zero at the  center,
       increasing  linearly  to maximum at the edge.  The maximum value corre‐
       sponds to the maxval of the PPM image.

       Hence, the image contains all of the secondary colors based on the red,
       green,  and blue primary colors.  A secondary color is one that is com‐
       posed of light of at most two of the three primary colors.

OPTIONS
       None.
