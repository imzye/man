       ftpusers — file which lists users who are not allowed to use ftp

DESCRIPTION

       ``news'' should be listed in this file.  Blank lines and lines beginning with `#' are ignored.

       Note: a lines with `#' in the middle is not a comment. Don't put `#' after a name to comment it; use another line, or things will silently fail on you.

       #
