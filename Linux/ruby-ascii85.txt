NAME
       ascii85 - encodes or decodes files using Ascii85 ruby library

SYNOPSIS
       ascii85 [OPTIONS] FILES

DESCRIPTION
       Ascii85 (also called "Base85") is a form of binary-to-text encoding, which is mainly used in Adobe's PostScript and PDF format.

       ascii85 is a command line utility, modeled after base64(1) from the GNU coreutils, can encode text files to Ascii85 or decode Ascii85 files to text, and then print the result to the standard
       output.

       If no file is given on the command line, ascii85 reads from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       -w, --wrap COLUMN
           Wrap lines at COLUMN. Default is 80, use 0 for no wrapping

       -d, --decode
           Decode the input

       -h, --help
           Display a usage message and exit

       --version
           Output version information
