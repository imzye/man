NAME
       pidcat - log filter and viewer for Android development

SYNOPSIS
       pidcat [-h] [-w N] [-l {loglevel}] [--color-gc] [--always-display-tags] [-s DEVICE_SERIAL] [-d] [-e] [package [package ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       An update to Jeff Sharkey's excellent logcat color script which only shows log entries for processes from a specific application package.

       During application development you often want to only display log messages coming from your app. Unfortunately, because the process ID changes every time you deploy to the phone it becomes a chal‐
       lenge to grep for the right thing.

       This script solves that problem by filtering by application package. Supply the target package as the sole argument to the python script and enjoy a more convenient development process.

   Required Arguments:
       package
              Application package name(s)

   Optional Arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -w N, --tag-width N
              Width of log tag

       -l {V,D,I,W,E,F}, --min-level {V,D,I,W,E,F}
              Minimum level to be displayed

       --color-gc
              Color garbage collection

       --always-display-tags
              Always display the tag name

       -s DEVICE_SERIAL, --serial DEVICE_SERIAL
              Device serial number (adb -s option)
