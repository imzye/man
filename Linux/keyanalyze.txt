NAME
       keyanalyze - Web of Trust analysis

SYNTAX
       keyanalyze [ -h1 ] [ -i infile ] [ -o outdir ]

DESCRIPTION
       keyanalyze analyses the web of trust within a group of keys.  It takes preprocessed keys as input (see process_keys(1)) and produces an output directory full of statistics about the keys.

       Usually called like
        $ pgpring -S -k ./keyring.gpg | process_keys > preprocess.keys
        $ keyanalyze

OPTIONS
       -i infile
              Read from infile instead of preprocess.keys.

       -o outdir
              Put the results in outdir instead of output/.  The directory will be created if it does not already exist.

       -h     Print help.

       -1     Per default, keyanalyze writes the output into subdirectories named after the first two characters of the key ID. This options disables this; useful for small keyrings.
