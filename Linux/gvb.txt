NAME
       gvb - simulate 1 and 2-dimensional vibrations in a nice GUI

SYNOPSIS
       gvb

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gvb command.

       gvb is a program that lets the user simulate waves and vibrations with given starting positions, calculation method and graphical appearance.
       It's  easy  to get the GUI nearly stuck if started with too much points; the maximum of points that an average computer can manage while remaining responsive is probably about 200. An exception is
       given by the fact that if you are dumping frames to create an animation, probably you want a good quality and won't mind if the GUI is almost stuck.
       Also pay attention to the fact that the "eig" mode requires a lot of precalculation; in this mode, calculating in 2 dimensions with just 15 points per dimension can already require  some  minutes,
       depending on CPU power.
