HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWiki(3pm)                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                  HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWiki(3pm)

NAME
       HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWiki - Convert HTML to DokuWiki markup

SYNOPSIS
         use HTML::WikiConverter;
         my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'DokuWiki' );
         print $wc->html2wiki( $html );

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains rules for converting HTML into DokuWiki markup. See HTML::WikiConverter for additional usage details.

ATTRIBUTES
       In addition to the regular set of attributes recognized by the HTML::WikiConverter constructor, this dialect also accepts the following attributes:

   camel_case
       Boolean indicating whether CamelCase links are enabled in the target DokuWiki instance. Enabling CamelCase links will turn HTML like this

         <p><a href="/wiki:camelcase">CamelCase</a> links are fun.</p>

       into this DokuWiki markup:

         CamelCase links are fun.

       Disabling CamelCase links (the default) would convert that HTML into

         [[CamelCase]] links are fun.
