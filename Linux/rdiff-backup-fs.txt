NAME
       rdiff-backup-fs - Filesystem for accessing rdiff-backup archives.

SYNOPSIS
       rdiff-backup-fs <mount_point> <repository> [repositories ...] [-option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       rdiff-backup-fs is a filesystem in userspace that reads rdiff-backup archives and provides convenient access.

OPTIONS
       --debug <0-4>
              Run rdiff-backup-fs in foreground with given verbosity of debug messages.

       -f, --full
              Store information about all revisions in memory. CAUTION: this may take a lot of memory if your archive contains many revisions.

       -l, --last
              Displays files from the most recent increment as directories, each holding every version of the file. CAUTION: this stores information about all revisions in memory and therefore may take a
              lot of memory if archive contains many revisions.

       -c <n>, --caching <n>
              How  many  files  retrieved  from  the rdiff-backup archive may be cached by filesystem. By default rdiff-backup-fs will cache up to 10 files. If this switch is set to 0, no caching will be
              done.

       -r <n>, --revisions <n>
              How many revisions should be stored in memory for on demand revision retrieval. By default rdiff-backup-fs will store up to 10 revisions in memory.

       -d, --directory <path>
              Set directory for directory with temporary files. By default rdiff-backup-fs uses /tmp.

       -v, --version
              Print version of rdiff-backup-fs and exit.
