NAME
       reswrap - wrap icon resources into C code

SYNOPSIS
       reswrap [options] [-o[a] outfile] files...

DESCRIPTION
       Reswrap is a tool to turn images, text, and other resource files into C++ data arrays.  This allows various binary resources to be embedded in the source code, and compiled into an application.

       In  development  of  graphical  applications  with FOX, it is used to embed icons and images for the user interface into the executable and eliminate the need to distribute separate icon and image
       files.

       Reswrap is typically invoked as a part of the build process to generate C++ source files from a collection of icons and images and other binary resources.

       By default reswrap will interpret the files listed as a stream of raw bytes and output them as an initialized data array to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -o[a] outfile
              Write the result into the file outfile instead of writing to stdout. With -o the outfile will be overwritten with the data from the input.  With the -oa option, the resulting  code  is  ap‐
              pended to the output file, allowing multiple input files to be placed into one single source file.

       -h     Print a short usage message.

       -v     Just print out the version number and license information.

       -d     Write data as decimal numbers instead of using the default hexadecimal numbers.

       -m     Read files with MS-DOS mode (default is binary).  This replaces "\r\n" with "\n" when reading the resource file.

       -x     Write data as hexadecimal numbers (default).

       -t[a]  Write data as a text string, with each byte represented as a hexadecimal excape sequence, as in "\x33".

              Note that the C++ compiler appends a nul-character at the end of the text string, thus making the data array one character longer than the file.

              With the a option, printable ascii characters are passed unescaped, while special characters like tabs and newlines are given the usual escape codes.

       -e     Places  the  storage modifier extern in front of the data array, ensuring that the data array can be linked with other compilation units.  Normally, constant declarations are not visible in
              other compilation units.

       -i     Instead of generating an array definition only write a declaration, which can be included as a header file.

       -k     This option causes reswrap to keep the file extension, replacing the "."  with an underscore "_".  Usage of this option is recommended as it reduces errors when using the data arrays.

       -s     This option suppresses comments inserted by reswrap to indicate the original file name from which the data statement was generated.

       -p prefix
              Prepend the given prefix in front of the name of the resource; this may be used to generate class names or namespace names in front of symbols.

       -n namespace
              Generate all declarations inside the given C++ namespace declaration.  Using a namespace may be used to ensure that declarations are only accessible within the given scope, and  thus  won't
              clash with symbols.

       -c cols
              Writes  cols  columns instead of the default number of columns in the data statements generated by reswrap.  The default number of columns for decimal and hex printout is 16 characters; the
              default for text string printout is 80 characters.

       -u     Force output as unsigned chars in text mode.

       -z     Output the size of the resource in the declaration of a resource-array.  This allows the C++ sizeof() operator to return the correct size of the resource  even  for  external  declarations.
              Note that in text mode, (-t option), an extra byte is added to the size for the end of string character.

       -r name
              Instead of using a resource name based on the filename, reswrap substitutes name for the resource name used in the declaration or definition for the following resource file.  This is useful
              if the filename can not be used as an identifier, for example if the filename is a reserved word in C or C++, like "while".

CAVEATS
       When using the text string mode, please remember the C compiler appends one nul-character after the string, making the data array one element longer than the resource file.
