NAME
       bps - List all BPF programs. 'ps' for BPF programs.

SYNOPSIS
       bps [bpf-prog-id]

DESCRIPTION
       bps lists all BPF programs loaded into the kernel.  It is similar to the ps command but for the BPF programs.

       Each loaded bpf program is identified by an unique integer (i.e.  bpf-prog-id or simply BID).  If a bpf-prog-id is specified, the maps used by bpf-prog-id will also be listed.

EXAMPLES
       List all BPF programs loaded into the kernel:
              bps

       Show the details and maps of BID 6:
              bps 6

BPF PROGRAM FIELDS
       BID    BPF program ID.  It ends with '-' if it is not jitted.

       TYPE   The type of a BPF program. e.g. kprobe, tracepoint, xdp...etc.

       UID    The user ID that loaded the BPF program.

       #MAPS  Total number of maps used by a BPF program.

       LoadTime
              When was the BPF program loaded?

       NAME   The  name  of a BPF program.  The user space library (like bcc ) usually uses the C function name of the original BPF's source code as the program name.  It could be empty if the user space
              did not provide a name.

BPF MAP FIELDS
       MID    BPF map ID.

       TYPE   The type of a BPF map. e.g. hash, array, stack trace...etc.

       FLAGS  The flags used to create the BP map.

       KeySz  The key size of a BPF map.

       ValueSz
              The value size of a BPF map.

       MaxEnts
              The maximum number of entries of a map.

       NAME   The name of a BPF map.  The user space library (like bcc ) usually uses the C variable name of the BPF map as its name.  It could be empty if the user space did not provide a name.

SOURCE
       This is from bcc.
