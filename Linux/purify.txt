NAME
       purify - Reconstruct images from radio interferometers using PADMM

SYNOPSIS
       purify --measurement_set path --name path [options]

DESCRIPTION
       PURIFY  is a tool for radio interferometric imaging including file handling (for both visibilities and fits files), implementation of the measurement operator and set-up of the different optimiza‐
       tion problems used for image deconvolution.

       The code is given for educational purpose. The code is in beta and still under development.

OPTIONS
       --measurement_set
              Path of measurement set. (required)

       --name Path of file output. (required)

       --noise
              Path of measurement_set with Stokes V noise estimate.  (Assumes Stokes V of measurement set).

       --niters
              Number of iterations.

       --stokes
              Choice of stokes I, Q, U, or V (I is default).

       --cellsize
              Size of a pixel in arcseconds.

       --size Image size in pixels.

       --width
              Image width in pixels.

       --height
              Image height in pixels.

       --beta Values used to set the stepsize of PADMM

       --noadapt
              Choose not to update the stepsize.

       --diagnostic
              Save diagnostic information to log file.

       --l2_bound
              Factor to multiply the l2 bound by.

       --relative_variation
              Convergence criteria on relative variation (default is 1e-3).

       --residual_convergence
              Factor to multiply the l2 bound by for convergence. (default is 1)

       --relative_gamma_adapt
              Relative difference criteria for adapting the stepsize gamma (default 0.01).

       --power_iterations
              Maximum iterations for the power method.

       --primary_beam
              Choice of primary beam model. (none is the only option).

       --fft_grid_correction
              Choose calculate the gridding correction using an FFT rather than analytic formula.

       --kernel
              Type of gridding kernel to use, kb, gauss, pswf, box. (kb is default)

       --kernel_support
              Support of kernel in grid cells. (4 is the default)

       --logging_level
              Determines the output logging level for sopt and purify. ("debug" is the default)

       --help Print usage information.
