NAME
       clif - C-like Interpreter Framework (v0.92)

SYNOPSIS
       clif [ option | filename ]...

WARNING
       The information in this manual page can be incomplete. For full documentation see `The Interpreter Clif Programmer's Guide'.

DESCRIPTION
       Clif  -  C-like  Interpreter Framework is open-ended system for fast development of programs with C syntax. The program is compiled and if syntactic correct, code is immediately generated. The code is
       generated for a virtual machine. The virtual machine is a part of the framework.

       The Clif works in two basic modes as an interpreter and/or as a compiler (see `-fhandle-main' option). The interpreter mode is default.  In the interpreter mode, the Clif compiles  each  function  and
       each loop only once and generated code is executed repetitively. (This is kind of optimization; the source code is not parsed over and over again.)

       The  compiler  mode  is  entered if `-fhandle-main' option is specified. The files are compiled and code is generated. When the compilation phase is finished, Clif searches for the `main' function and
       starts execution of it.

       The Clif is submitted with subset of standard C library.  The subset is still under development. Intrinsic functions can be easily enhanced for user's purposes.

       There are interface functions supporting automatic control and data acquisition, that can be optionally compiled with Clif.

       The Clif does not recognize bit-field definition syntax of the C language.  The C preprocessor is not implemented yet.

       There could be discrepancies between the Clif and the ANSI C Standard.  We are working on unifying of semantic of the Clif with the ANSI C Standard.

OPTIONS
       For each command line, one or more filename can be specified (usually with .ci suffix). The files are parsed in order of specification in the command line. The file clif.ini is implicitly  opened.  It
       is an initialization file. Options used invariably are specified in the file.

       Some of -fname options have a -fno-name form. Default value is always mentioned in the option description.  Summary of options follows. Explanations are in next sections.

       Overall Options
              -bc -c -copying -help -v -version -verbose -warranty

       Options Controlling Clif behavior
              -fcall-by-reference -fno-call-by-reference -fcall-by-value -fno-call-by-value -fhandle-main

       Debugging Options
              -g -dy

       Warning Options
              -w -Wcomment -Wformat -Wimplicit -Wreturn-type -Wtrigraphs -Wuninitialized -Wall -W -Waggregate-return -Wunused

OVERALL OPTIONS
       -bc    option specifies number of 512-Byte pages for the Clif environment main memory. The arithmetical and temporary stack is multiple of this option as well.

       -c     Compile only. (Not fully supported yet.)

       -copying
              Show copying.

       -help  Show short help.

       -v, -version
              Show version.

       -verbose
              Prints general purpose of the Clif and authors.

       -warranty
              Show warranty.

OPTIONS CONTROLLING CLIF BEHAVIOR
       -fcall-by-reference
              Specifies parameter passing mechanism (default). If explicitly specified, `-fno-call-by-value' must be specified as well.

       -fno-call-by-reference
              do not pass parameter by reference. If explicitly specified, `-fcall-by-value' must be specified as well.

       -fcall-by-value
              call by value parameter passing mechanism. If explicitly specified, `-fno-call-by-reference' must be specified.

       -fno-call-by-value
              do not pass parameters by value (default). If explicitly specified, `-fcall-by-reference' must be specified.

       -fhandle-main
              simulate compiler-like behavior. The files on the command line and included files are compiled. The `main' function must be defined. After parsing pass, the generated code is executed. The main
              function is the beginning of execution.

DEBUGGING OPTIONS
       -g     produce debugging information. The source lines are output during virtual machine code execution.

       -dy    dump debugging information during parsing to standard error.

WARNING OPTIONS
       -w     Inhibit all warning messages.

       -Wcomment
              Warn when a comment-start sequence `/*' appears in a comment.

       -Wformat
              Check calls to `printf', `scanf', etc., to make sure that the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the specified format string.

       -Wimplicit
              Warn if a function or parameter is implicitly declared.

       -Wreturn-type
              Warn if the return statement is without return value in non-void function, or with a value in `void´ function.

       -Wtrigraphs
              Warn about trigraphs usage.

       -Wuninitialized
              An automatic variable is used without first being initialized.

       -Wall  All of the above warnings.

       -W     Print extra warning messages.

       -Waggregate-return
              Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or called.

       -Wunused
              Warn whenever a variable is unused aside from its declaration.

FILES
       file.ci        Clif source file
       clif.ini       Initialization file
