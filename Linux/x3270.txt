NAME
       x3270 - IBM host access tool

SYNOPSIS
       x3270 [options] [host]
       x3270 [options] session-file.x3270

DESCRIPTION
       x3270 opens a telnet connection to an IBM host in an X window.  It implements RFCs 2355 (TN3270E), 1576 (TN3270) and 1646 (LU name selection), and supports IND$FILE file transfer.  The window cre‐
       ated by x3270 can use its own font for displaying characters, so it is a fairly accurate representation of an IBM 3278 or 3279.  It is similar to tn3270(1) except that it is X11-based, not curses-
       based.
