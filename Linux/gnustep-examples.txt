NAME
       gnustep-examples - various example GNUstep tools/applications

SYNOPSIS
       [ example program ]

DESCRIPTION
       GNUstep  Examples  are  a  compilation of applications and tools to demonstrate and test the abilities of certain GNUstep classes.  Some of them are useful enough on their own; others are included
       purely for testing purposes.

       Here is a short description of the programs in alphabetical order:

       Calculator
              Fully functional, but very simple calculator which supports only basic arithmetic functions.  EdenMath(1) is much more user-friendly and powerful.

       CurrencyConverter
              Simple currency converter.

       Finger An application to perform network operations like finger(1), whois(1), ping(8) and traceroute(1).

       GFractal
              A simple fractal viewer.

       GSTest Tests for various GNUstep GUI classes, combined in one application.

       HostAddress
              Application to convert a hostname to an IP address and vice-versa.

       Ink    A text editor that supports both plain text and RTF/RTFD.  Usually the “standard” test application, especially for the NSDocument class.  See TextEdit(1) for a more capable editor.

       md5Digest
              This tool creates an md5 digest using the example filter based on what type of file is being accessed.

       MyGL   Application that demonstrates the creation of a transparent NSOpenGLView by parsing a COLLADA file.

       NSBrowserTest
              Test application for the NSBrowser class.

       NSImageTest
              Test application for the NSImage class.

       NSPanelTest
              Test application for the NSPanel class.

       NSScreenTest
              Test application for the NSScreen class.  Usually used to check the display's capabilities.

       PowerPaint
              A simple graphic editor.

       TestDrawing
              A test for drawing operations.

OPTIONS
       All programs do not accept any options except the standard GNUstep ones.  md5Digest reads files from the standard input.
