NAME
       lincity, xlincity - a city/country simulation game.

SYNOPSIS
       lincity [-w] [-R red-gamma] [-G green-gamma] [-B blue-gamma] [-m mode]
       xlincity [-v] [-g geometry] [-d] [-r] [-w] [-R red-gamma] [-G green-gamma] [-B blue-gamma]

OPTIONS
       -w     Use a gamma correction for the graphic with the values 1.0 for red, 0.0 for green and 0.4 for blue.
              Please note: The gamma values used are not a gamma correction in the traditional way. Just check it out.

       -R red The value for the gamma correction for red color-part. This option takes a floating point argument.

       -G green
              The value for the gamma correction for green color-part. This option takes a floating point argument.

       -B blue
              The value for the gamma correction for blue color-part. This option takes a floating point argument.

       -m mode
              Set the VGA mode.  This option is ignored on X Windows.  The choices for modes are:
                   lincity -m 10     ## mode 10, 640x480
                   lincity -m 11     ## mode 11, 800x600
                   lincity -m 12     ## mode 12, 1024x768
                   lincity -m 13     ## mode 13, 1280x1024

       -v     Be verbose on startup (this tells the lincity version).

       -g geom
              Specify the X11 geometry argument. E.g. use -g +0+0 to put the window to the upper left corner on startup.

       -d     Perform  pix  doubling.   Pix  doubling renders each pixel as a 2 x 2 square, which has the effect of making the game appear twice as large on the screen.  This option only applies to the X
              Windows version.

       -r     Add an extra border around the game.  This option only applies to the X Windows version.

DESCRIPTION
       Lincity is a city/country simulation game running with SVGA graphics on a Linux console or in an X11 window under Linux and other platforms.

       You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house, provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling,
       or you can go for broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any one place, this is not a  game
       that you can leave for long periods of time.

       For more about how to play, please read the excellent online help provided with the game.  Right click almost anywhere to get help.
