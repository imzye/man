GEN_PACKETS(1)              General Commands Manual             GEN_PACKETS(1)

NAME
       gen_packets - Generate audio file for AX.25 frames.

SYNOPSIS
       gen_packets -o wav-file-out [ options ] [ text-file | - ]

              wav-file-out is the result.  The -o option is required.

              text-file  may  contain AX.25 packets in the standard monitoring
              format.  Use "-" to read from stdin.  If not  specified,  a  de‐
              fault builtin message will be used.

DESCRIPTION
       gen_packets  is  a  test application which converts text to AX.25 audio
       for testing packet decoders.

       It is very flexible allowing a wide range of audio sample  rates,  data
       speeds,  and  AFSK  tones.  It will even generate the scrambled signals
       commonly used for 9600 baud operation.

OPTIONS
       -a n   Signal amplitude in range of 0-200%.   Default  50.   Note  that
              100%  is  corresponds  to  signal  peaks of +/- 16383 so we have
              plenty of headroom to avoid saturation.

       -b n   Bits / second for data.  Default is 1200.

       -B n   Data rate in bits/sec for first channel.   Standard  values  are
              300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600.
                     300 bps defaults to AFSK tones of 1600 & 1800.
                     1200 bps uses AFSK tones of 1200 & 2200.
                     2400 bps uses QPSK based on V.26 standard.
                     4800 bps uses 8PSK based on V.27 standard.
                     9600 bps and up uses K9NG/G3RUH standard.

       -g     Force G3RUH modem regardless of data rate.

       -j     2400 bps QPSK compatible with Dire Wolf <= 1.5.

       -J     2400 bps QPSK compatible with MFJ-2400.

       -m n   Mark frequency.  Default is 1200.

       -s n   Space frequency.  Default is 2200.

       -r n   Audio sample Rate.  Default is 44100.

       -n n   Generate specified number of frames with increasing noise.  (For
              built-in message only.)

       -o file
              Send output to .wav file.

       -8     8 bit audio rather than 16.

       -2     2 channels of audio rather than 1.

EXAMPLES
       gen_packets -o x.wav

              With all defaults, a built-in test  message  is  generated  with
              standard Bell 202 tones used for packet radio on ordinary VHF FM
              transceivers.

       gen_packets -o x.wav -g -b 9600
       gen_packets -o x.wav -B 9600

              Both of these are equivalent.  "-B 9600"  automatically  selects
              scrambled baseband rather than AFSK.

       gen_packets -o x.wav -m 1600 -s 1800 -b 300
       gen_packets -o x.wav -B 300

              Both  of  these generate 200 Hz shift, 300 baud, suitable for HF
              SSB transceiver.

       echo -n 'WB2OSZ>WORLD:Hello, world!' | gen_packets -a 25 -o x.wav -
       atest x.wav

              Read message from stdin and put quarter volume  sound  into  the
              file x.wav.  Decode the sound file.
