NAME
       RDF::DOAP::ChangeSets - create pretty ChangeLogs from RDF

SYNOPSIS
        use RDF::DOAP::ChangeSets;
        use URI::file;

        my $file     = 'path/to/changelog.rdf';
        my $file_uri = URI::file->new_abs($file);

        my $dcs = RDF::DOAP::ChangeSets->new(
                    $file_uri, undef, undef, 'RDFXML');
        print $dcs->to_string;

DESCRIPTION
       This module takes software changelogs written in the RDF DOAP Change Sets vocabulary and produces human-readable changelogs.

       "RDF::DOAP::ChangeSets->new($uri, $data, $type, $fmt)"
           Creates and initialises an object.

           $uri is a URL for the input data. The URL is used to query the RDF data for the heading of the output changelog. It may be passed as either a string, or a URI object.

           $data is the RDF data to use as input. It may be passed as a string, or as an RDF::Trine::Model object. If undefined, this module will attempt to read data from the URL using LWP::Simple.

           $type  gives  the constructor a hint as to the RDF vocabulary you are using. For DOAP Change Sets, use 'current'; for Aaron Cope's Changefile vocab, use 'legacy'; to autodetect, use 'auto'. By
           default, performs autodetection. This module may crash and burn if you try to mix both vocabs!!

           $fmt provides a hint as to what RDF format you're using. By default, Turtle is assumed. Valid values are whatever RDF::Trine::Parser->new accepts.

       "$changeset->is_legacy"
           Boolean, indicating if a legacy vocab is being used.

       "$changeset->is_current"
           Boolean, indicating if the current vocab is being used.

       "$changeset->model"
           RDF::Trine::Model object representing the changelog data.

       "$changeset->uri"
           String representing the changelog URI.

       "$changeset->to_string"
           Creates a human-readable representation of the changelog.

       "$changeset->to_file($filename)"
           Same as "to_string", but outputs to a file.
