NAME
       corosync-qnetd-certutil - tool to generate qnetd TLS certificates

SYNOPSIS
       corosync-qnetd-certutil [-i|-s] [-c certificate] [-n cluster_name]

DESCRIPTION
       corosync-qnetd-certutil is a frontend for the NSS certutil, it is used for generating the QNetd CA (Certificate Authority), server certificate and signing cluster certificate used by corosync-qde‐
       vice when using the model 'net'.

OPTIONS
       -i     Initialize  the  QNetd  NSS  certificate  database  and generate the QNetd CA and server certificates.  The default directory for the database is /etc/corosync/qnetd. This directory must be
              writeable by the current user. The QNetd CA certificate is also exported into the file /etc/corosync/qnetd/nssdb/qnetd-cacert.crt.

       -s     Sign the cluster certificate. It is necessary to pass the cluster name (as configured in corosync.conf) and the certificate request file - see options below.  The signed certificate will be
              written to the file /etc/corosync/qnetd/nssdb/cluster-$ClusterName.crt

       -c     Certificate request file to sign.

       -G     Do not set group write bit for new files. This option has effect only when used together with -i option. It is useful when extended security is needed and it's viable to prohibit daemon  to
              change its configuration. Expected usage is to first set owner of the /etc/corosync/qnetd directory to root:$COROQNETD with permissions 0750 and then create database (as a root):

              # corosync-qnetd-certutil -i -G

       -n     Name of the cluster.

NOTES
       If  qnetd  is  executed by a non root user, /etc/corosync/qnetd and its subdirectories must be owned by (or have group access for) the given user. If corosync-qnetd-certutil is executed as root it
       tries to copy the owner and group of /etc/corosync/qnetd to all of the created files.
