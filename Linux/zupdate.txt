NAME
       zupdate - recompress bzip2, gzip, xz files to lzip format

SYNOPSIS
       zupdate [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       Zupdate recompresses files from bzip2, gzip, and xz formats to lzip format. Each original is compared with the new file and then deleted.  Only regular files with standard file name extensions are re‐
       compressed, other files are ignored. Compressed files are decompressed and then recompressed on the fly; no temporary files are created. The lzip format is chosen as destination because it is the most
       appropriate for long-term data archiving.

       If no files are specified, recursive searches examine the current working directory, and nonrecursive searches do nothing.

       If the lzip compressed version of a file already exists, the file is skipped unless the '--force' option is given. In this case, if the comparison with the existing lzip version fails, an error is re‐
       turned and the original file is not deleted. The operation of zupdate is meant to be safe and not produce any data loss. Therefore, existing lzip compressed files are never overwritten nor deleted.

       Exit status is 0 if all the compressed files were successfully recompressed (if needed), compared and deleted (if requested). Non-zero otherwise.
