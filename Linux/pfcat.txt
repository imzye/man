NAME
       pfcat - grep out function definitions from perlfunc

DESCRIPTION
       This program uses podgrep program to search your configuration's
       perlfunc for function definitions.  It honors a -f flag to format
       through pod2text and a -p flag to send the output through the pager.
       (Actually, it just passes these to podgrep.)

EXAMPLES
           $ pfcat seek
           (find all seek functions (including sysseek))

           $ pfcat -pf sprintf
           (sprintf function is formated and sent to pager)

           $ pfcat -f '\bint\b'
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/pod/perlfunc.pod chunk 506
           int EXPR
           int

           Returns the integer portion of EXPR. If EXPR is omitted, uses
           `$_'. You should not use this for rounding, because it truncates
           towards `0', and because machine representations of floating point
           numbers can sometimes produce counterintuitive results. Usually
           `sprintf()' or `printf()', or the `POSIX::floor' or `POSIX::ceil'
           functions, would serve you better.

       You can also run this using alternate perl binaries, like so:

           $ oldperl -S pfcat open
           ....
