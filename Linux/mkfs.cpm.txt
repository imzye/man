NAME
       mkfs.cpm - make a CP/M file system

SYNOPSIS
       mkfs.cpm [-f format] [-b boot] [-L label] [-t] [-u] image

DESCRIPTION
       mkfs.cpm makes a CP/M file system on an image file or device.

OPTIONS
       -f format
              Use the given CP/M disk format instead of the default format.

       -b bootblock
              Write  the  contents  of the file bootblock to the system tracks
              instead of filling them with 0xe5.  This option can be  used  up
              to  four  times.   The file contents (typically boot block, CCP,
              BDOS and BIOS) are written to sequential sectors,  padding  with
              0xe5 if needed.

       -L label
              Label the file system.  This is only supported by CP/M Plus.

       -t     Create time stamps.

       -u     Show all CP/M file names in upper case.
