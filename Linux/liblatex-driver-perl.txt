NAME
       latex2dvi - script to convert LaTeX file to DVI

USAGE
         latex2dvi [OPTIONS] [-o output] [sourcefile]

DESCRIPTION
       "latex2dvi" is a simple script to invoke the "LaTeX::Driver" module to convert a LaTeX file to DVI (TeX's device independent output format).

OPTIONS
       "-output=FILE"
           specifies  that  the  formatted  file  should be written to "FILE".  If this option is not specified, or is specified as ""-"" then the file will be written to standard output, otherwise if an
           input file is specified then the it will be formatted in place and the output file will have the same name as the input file, but with the original extension replaced with ".dvi".

       "-tt2"
           specifies that the source document should be taken to be a Template Toolkit template and processed through that before being fed to the "LaTeX::Driver" module for latex formatting.

       "-define=NAME=VALUE"
           defines the template variable NAME to have the value VALUE.  Multiple template variables may be defined and these are passed to the Template Toolkit processing stage (they are ignored  if  the
           "-tt2" option is not specified).
