NAME
       runprove -- A command-line tool for running tests against Test::Run

SYNOPSIS
       runprove [options] [files/directories]

       Options:

           -b, --blib      Adds blib/lib to the path for your tests, a la "use blib".
           -d, --debug     Includes extra debugging information.
           -D, --dry       Dry run: Show the tests to run, but don't run them.
               --ext=x     Extensions (defaults to .t)
           -h, --help      Display this help
           -H, --man       Longer manpage for runprove
           -I              Add libraries to @INC, as Perl's -I
           -l, --lib       Add lib to the path for your tests.
           -r, --recurse   Recursively descend into directories.
           -s, --shuffle   Run the tests in a random order.
           -T              Enable tainting checks
           -t              Enable tainting warnings
               --timer     Print elapsed time after each test file
           -v, --verbose   Display standard output of test scripts while running them.
           -V, --version   Display version info

       Single-character options may be stacked.  Default options may be set by specifying the PROVE_SWITCHES environment variable.

OVERVIEW
       runprove is a command-line interface to the test-running functionality of "Test::Run".  With no arguments, it will run all tests in the current directory.

       Shell metacharacters may be used with command lines options and will be exanded via "glob".

RUNPROVE VS. "MAKE TEST"
       runprove has a number of advantages over "make test" when doing development.

       •   runprove is designed as a development tool

           Perl users typically run the test harness through a makefile via "make test".  That's fine for module distributions, but it's suboptimal for a test/code/debug development cycle.

       •   runprove is granular

           runprove let your run only the files you want to check.  Running "runprove t/live/ t/master.t" checks every *.t in t/live, plus t/master.t.

       •   prove has an easy verbose mode

           runprove has a "-v" option to see the raw output from the tests.  To do this with "make test", you must set "HARNESS_VERBOSE=1" in the environment.

       •   runprove can run under taint mode

           runprove's "-T" runs your tests under "perl -T", and "-t" runs them under "perl -t".

       •   runprove can shuffle tests

           You can use runprove's "--shuffle" option to try to excite problems that don't show up when tests are run in the same order every time.

       •   runprove doesn't rely on a make tool

           Not everyone wants to write a makefile, or use ExtUtils::MakeMaker to do so.  runprove has no external dependencies.

       •   Not everything is a module

           More and more users are using Perl's testing tools outside the context of a module distribution, and may not even use a makefile at all.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
   -b, --blib
       Adds blib/lib to the path for your tests, a la "use blib".

   -d, --debug
       Include debug information about how runprove is being run.  This option doesn't show the output from the test scripts.  That's handled by -v,--verbose.

   -D, --dry
       Dry run: Show the tests to run, but don't run them.

   --ext=extension
       Specify extensions of the test files to run.  By default, these are .t, but you may have other non-.t test files, most likely .sh shell scripts.  The --ext is repeatable.

   -I
       Add libraries to @INC, as Perl's -I.

   -l, --lib
       Add "lib" to @INC.  Equivalent to "-Ilib".

   -r, --recurse
       Descends into subdirectories of any directories specified, looking for tests.

   -s, --shuffle
       Sometimes tests are accidentally dependent on tests that have been run before.  This switch will shuffle the tests to be run prior to running them, thus ensuring that hidden dependencies in the test
       order are likely to be revealed.  The author hopes the run the algorithm on the preceding sentence to see if he can produce something slightly less awkward.

   -t
       Runs test programs under perl's -t taint warning mode.

   -T
       Runs test programs under perl's -T taint mode.

   --timer
       Print elapsed time after each test file

   -v, --verbose
       Display standard output of test scripts while running them.  Also sets TEST_VERBOSE in case your tests rely on them.

   -V, --version
       Display version info.
