NAME
       fgjs - FlightGear joystick utility

SYNOPSIS
       fgjs [--help] [--fg-root=rootdir]

DESCRIPTION
       fgjs  is  a  joystick utility for the FlightGear flight simulator which
       allows you to generate a configuration file for your joystick  interac‐
       tively.

       To  use  it,  launch  the  program with your joystick(s) connected. The
       utility will first prompt you to move each joystick around in the  dead
       band,  that  is,  the area where it is centered and should not generate
       any input. Afterwards, you will be asked to move the  control/push  the
       button you would like to use for each function.

       The  configuration  will  be  saved in the current working directory in
       several files named jsI.xml, where I is the progressive number assigned
       to  each  detected  joystick. You will need to move them to ~/.fgfs/In‐
       put/Joysticks for them to be used by FlightGear.

OPTIONS
       --help Display usage information and exit.

       --fg-root=rootdir
              Set the FlightGear data root directory ($FG_ROOT) to rootdir.

ENVIRONMENT
       FG_ROOT
           If FG_ROOT is set and --fg-root is not set, it specifies  the  root
           data directory to use.

FILES
       ~/.fgfsrc.hostname, ~/.fgfsrc
           Configuration  files  containing  command-line options for fgfs(1).
           The --fg-root command-line option is searched there if  it  is  not
           passed as a command-line argument to fgjs.
