NAME
       mercurial-importdsc - Import exiting package into Mercurial repository.

SYNOPSIS
       mercurial-importdsc [option] ... dscfile

DESCRIPTION
       Import  an existing source package into a Mercurial repository.  The diffs and upstream sources are extracted from the contents of the .dsc file.  mercurial-
       importorig(1) is called to import the upstream source into the upstream branch, which is then merged into the default branch, and the diffs  are  applied  to
       the  default  branch.   It  is  possible to use mercurial-importdsc multiple times to import several versions, but the versions must be imported sequentially
       starting with the earliest version.

OPTIONS
       --version, -V

              Output version and exit.

       --verbose, -v

              Increase verbosity level.  Can be used several times.

EXAMPLES
       mercurial-importdsc ../mypack_1.2-3.dsc

              Import package mypack version 1.2-3 into the repository in the current directory.  After the import, the repository will have the tags mypack_1.2  and
              mypack_1.2-3.
