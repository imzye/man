NAME
       lordsawar-import - Transfer your scenarios from Warlords II

SYNOPSIS
       lordsawar-import [OPTION...] [FILE]
       lordsawar-import [OPTION...] [DIRECTORY]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool converts Warlords II .SCZ files into LordsAWar! map files.  Alternatively this tool can operate on a directory that contains the unpacked SCZ file.  In particular, the directory must contain
       .SCN, .ITM, .RD, .MAP, .SPC, and .SGN files.

       No attempt is made to import the graphics from the Warlords scenario.

       This tool does not support the importing of .SZP files, or saved game files.

       The resulting file is saved as the basename of your FILE or directory, with a .map extension added.  For example, if you converted a directory called  ERYTHEA/,  the  converted  file  will  be  called
       ERYTHEA.map.

OPTIONS
       -a, --army-file FILE
              Use this Warlords 2 army file.  It is a .DAT file, 1798 bytes long.

       -h, --help
              Give this help list.

BUGS
       The bottommost row of converted scenarios can often have errors on it.

       Unfortunately this tool does not import the contents of cities -- the cities themselves will be imported, but they won't have any armies that can be produced.

       Ruin defenders are not imported, and neither are the rewards (items) that can be found inside ruins.
