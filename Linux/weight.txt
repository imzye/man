NAME
       weight - calculates sequence weights for an alignment

SYNOPSIS
       weight [-options] <alignment file>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the weight command.

       weight is a program that calculates weights for a sequence alignment.

OPTIONS
       Available options:

       -b <f> Use BLOSUM weighting scheme at <f> fractional identity.

       -f <f> Filter out seqs w/ fractional ident > <x> [0-1].

       -h     Help; print version and usage info.

       -o <file>
              Save weight-annotated alignment in <outfile>.

       -p     Use position based weight scheme (Henikoff & Henikoff).

       -s <n> Sample <n> sequences at random into a new alignment.

       -v     Use Voronoi weight scheme (Sibbald & Argos).

       --informat <s>
              Specify alignment file format <s>.
              Allowed formats: SELEX, MSF, Clustal, a2m, PHYLIP.

       --quiet
              Suppress verbose banner.
