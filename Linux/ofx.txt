NAME
       ofx2qif - convert OFX files to QIF format

SYNOPSIS
       ofx2qif path_to_ofx_file/ofx_filename > output_filename.qif

DESCRIPTION
       ofx2qif is a OFX "file" to QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) converter.  It was written as a second code example, and as a way for LibOFX to immediately provide something useful, and to give people
       a reason to try the library.  It is not recommended that financial software use the output of this utility for OFX support.  The QIF file format is very primitive, and much information is lost.
       The utility currently supports every transaction tags of the QIF format except the address lines, and supports many of the !Account tags.  It should generate QIF files that will import
       successfully in just about every software with QIF support.

OPTIONS
       This program does not accept any command-line options.

CAVEATS
       The libofx maintainer does not plan on improving this utility much further, but contributions and patches are gladly accepted. If you are interested in hacking on ofx2qif, links to QIF
       documentation are available on the LibOFX home page.

       Note that all error output is disabled by default.
