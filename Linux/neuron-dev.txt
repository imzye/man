NAME
       nrnivmodl - Compile special version of NEURON with custom mechanisms

SYNOPSIS
       nrnivmodl [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the nrnivmodl command.

       nrnivmodl is part of the NEURON simulation environment for computational models of physiological neurons. Its purpose is to compile membrane mechanisms with user-defined properties.

       If  .mod files are supplied as FILES nrnivmodl will compile them into a dedicated version of NEURON called special with the new mechanisms included.  The new NEURON version is put into a subdirec‐
       tory named after the current CPU architecture.

       If no file arguments are present, nrnivmodl adds all the files in the current working directory that have the suffix .mod to special.  In order to construct an executable, the  model  descriptions
       first have to be translated into C code, which is then compiled using the default C compiler.

       Such  models must contain a NEURON block which specifies the type of model (density mechanism or point process), the names of ions it uses, and which variables are to be treated as range variables
       in the interface to OC.
