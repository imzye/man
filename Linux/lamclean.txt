NAME
       lamclean - Attempt to clean entire LAM system.

SYNOPSIS
       lamclean [-hv]

OPTIONS
       -h      Print the command help menu.

       -v      Be verbose.

DESCRIPTION
       The  lamclean command attempts to remove all user processes and messages from all nodes.  It also de-allocates all user allocated resources and cancels all user process registrations.  This happens by
       invoking many different remote services which have previously been invoked individually by several other commands.  These commands should still be used when partial selective removal of user  presence
       is desired.  Otherwise, lamclean is a quick and convenient way of starting over after a bad application run without rebooting the system.

       lamclean takes the following actions on the following system processes on all nodes:

       kenyad         The LAM SIGUDIE signal (terminate) is sent to all user processes.  See doom(1).

       bufferd        The entire daemon is reset to its initial state after booting.  See sweep(1).

       filed          All user file descriptors are closed.  See fctl(1).

       traced         All traces are removed.  See lamtrace(1).

       lamclean  will  not succeed if any of the nodes are unreachable due to catastrophic failure or maximum buffer overflow with link jamming.  If lamclean does not return, use lamwipe(1) and lamboot(1) to
       restart the multicomputer.
