NAME
       rpm-plugin-selinux - SELinux plugin for the RPM Package Manager

Description
       The plugin sets SELinux contexts for installed files and executed scriptlets.  It needs SELinux to be enabled to work but will work in both enforcing and permissive mode.

Configuration
       The plugin can be disabled temporarily by passing --nocontexts at the RPM command line or setting the transaction flag RPMTRANS_FLAG_NOCONTEXTS in the API.

       See rpm-plugins(8) on how to control plugins in general.
