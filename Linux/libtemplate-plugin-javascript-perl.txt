NAME
       Template::Plugin::JavaScript - Encodes text to be safe in JavaScript

SYNOPSIS
         [% USE JavaScript %]
         <script type="text/javascript">
         document.write("[% sometext | js %]");
         </script>

DESCRIPTION
       Template::Plugin::JavaScript is a TT filter that filters text so it can be safely used in JavaScript quotes.

         [% USE JavaScript %]
         document.write("[% FILTER js %]
         Here's some text going on.
         [% END %]");

       will become:

         document.write("\nHere\'s some text going on.\n");

AUTHOR
       The original idea comes from Movable Type's "encode_js" global filter.
