NAME
       perlprimer - graphically specify amplicon of DNA or mRNA sequences and design primers

SYNOPSIS
       perlprimer

DESCRIPTION
       PerlPrimer  calculates  primer melting temperature using J. SantaLucia's extensive nearest-neighbour thermodynamic parameters. To adjust for the salt conditions of the PCR, PerlPrimer uses the em‐
       pirical formula derived by von Ahsen, et al. (2001) and allows the user to specify the concentration of Mg2+, dNTPs and primers, or use standard PCR conditions. The result  is  a  highly  accurate
       prediction  of  primer melting temperature, giving rise to a maximum yield of product when amplified.  PerlPrimer is written in Perl and requires Perl/Tk. In addition, for QPCR functionality Perl‐
       Primer requires the open-source Spidey executable from NCBI. The program is designed to be cross-platform compatible and has been developed and tested on both Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux-based
       operating systems. Users have also reported success using the program under Mac OS X.

       A very nice tutorial on http://perlprimer.sourceforge.net is also distributed as a debian package perlprimer-doc.
