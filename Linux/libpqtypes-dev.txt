NAME
       PQspecPrepare - Prepares a libpqtypes specifier format string.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libpqtypes.h>

       int PQspecPrepare(PGconn *conn, const char *name,
                             const char *format, int is_stmt);
       void PQclearSpecs(PGconn *conn);

DESCRIPTION
       PQspecPrepare  allows  an application to prepare specifier format strings that will be used frequently.  By preparing a specifier format string, one avoids the parsing and type handler lookup
       costs.  This becomes a significant win when managing large result sets or arrays, where the specifier format, like "%int4 %text %bytea", must be prepared for each tuple/element.

       As with PQregisterXXX, only specifier format strings prepared prior to the creation of a PGresult or PGparam, will be available for use.  This is because the  prepared  type  spec  is  cached
       within a PGconn object and copied to all subsequent PGparam and PGresult objects.

       Every  prepared  type spec is given a name, which is used as its unique identifier.  To use a prepared type spec, the name is provided where ever a regular specifier format string is allowed,
       like PQputf or PQgetf.  The name must be proceeded by a ´@´ AT sign.  For more information about the syntax, see the pqt-specs(3) man page.

       The format argument is the specifier format string being prepared.  When this is NULL, the name prepared type spec is removed from the PGconn´s internal array.

       The is_stmt argument indicates if a parementerized statement version of format should be cached along with the prepared type spec.  This means all type specifiers  in  format,  like  "%int4",
       will be converted to "$1" syntax.  When is_stmt is non-zero, a statement will created and cached.  For more information on specifer format string to paremterized statements, see the PQputf(3)
       man page.  NOTE: to use a prepared type spec with execution functions like PQexecf, is_stmt must be set to non-zero.

       PQclearSpecs  removes all prepared specifiers from the given PGconn, as opposed to removing them one by one by setting PQspecPrepare's format argument to NULL.  A good use for this is after a
       PQresetXXX call when it might be desired to re-prepare all type specifiers.

       Functions that support the use of a prepared type spec are: PQputf, PQputvf, PQgetf, PQgetvf, PQexecf, PQexecvf, PQsendf, PQsendvf, PQparamExec, PQparamSendQuery.

       HINT: A good rule of thumb for using prepared type specs, is when there are a large number of PQputf/PQgetf calls per statement execution.  This commonly occurs when dealing with large result
       sets and arrays.

RETURN VALUE
       PQspecPrepare and PQclearSpecs return a nonzero value on success and zero if it fails.  Use PQgeterror() to get an error message.

EXAMPLES
       This example prepares a type spec and issues some PQputf calls.

              int i;
              PQparam *param;

              if(!PQspecPrepare(conn, "prepared_spec", "%int4 %text", 0))
              {
                   fprintf(stderr, "PQspecPrepare: %s0, PQgeterror());
                   exit(1);
              }

              /* create after preparing spec */
              param = PQparamCreate(conn);

              for(i=0; i < 100000; i++)
              {
                   /* NOTE: nothing else can be in format string */
                   PQputf(param, "@prepared_spec", 4, "text");
              }

              /* This elects to prepare a statement as well.  After this returns,
               * "SELECT myfunc($1, $2)" will be cached along with the prepared spec.
               */
              PQspecPrepare(conn, "myfunc", "SELECT myfunc(%int4, %text)", 1);

              /* "myfunc" tells execf to execute "SELECT myfunc($1, $2)".  If is_stmt
               * was set to zero during the PQspecPrepare, the below would be invalid
               * because execf doesn't know what to execute.
               */
              PQexecf(conn, "@myfunc", 123, "text");

              /* clear'm all */
              PQclearSpecs(conn);

RATIONALE
       None.
