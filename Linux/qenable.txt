NAME
       qenable - enable input to a pbs destination

SYNOPSIS
       qenable destination ...

DESCRIPTION
       The qenable command directs that a destination should accept batch jobs.

       The qenable command sends a Manage request to the batch server specified by destination.  If the command is accepted, the destination will accept Queue Job requests which specified the queue.

       In order to execute qenable, the user must have PBS Operation or Manager privilege.

OPERANDS
       The qenable command accepts one or more destination operands.  The operands are one of three forms:
            queue
            @server
            queue@server
       If  queue is specified, the request is to enable that queue at the default server.  If the @server form is given, the request is to enable all the queues at that server.  If a full destination identi‐
       fier, queue@server, is given, the request is to enable the named queue at the named server.

STANDARD ERROR
       The qenable command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qenable command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qenable command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
