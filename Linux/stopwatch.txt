NAME
       stopwatch — a stopwatch and timer program

SYNOPSIS
       stopwatch

DESCRIPTION
       stopwatch  does  what its name implies - enables hand timing much like a physical stopwatch. It can also be used as a countdown timer. Stopwatch has millisecond accuracy and no artificial limit on
       hours.

DIRECTIONS
       Press "start" to start the stopwatch and "stop" to stop it. "record" records the current time and selects it so that it can readily be pasted into other programs. Recorded times are marked with an
       L for "lap" or T for "total". When stopped, you can cut/paste/edit the time by hand and set it to any valid time. "zero" resets the time to zero. Holding down the shift key while  pressing  record
       or zero, records and then zeros the time.

       Time  moves  forward or backward according to the Run menu. By default, time is stopped automatically when either the lap or total time reaches zero. To disable the automatic stop, unselect Run ->
       Stop At Zero.
