NAME
       pypy - fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language

SYNOPSIS
       pypy [options] [-c cmd|-m mod|file.py|-] [arg...]

OPTIONS
       -i     Inspect interactively after running script.

       -O     Skip assert statements.

       -OO    Remove docstrings when importing modules in addition to -O.

       -c CMD Program passed in as CMD (terminates option list).

       -S     Do not import site on initialization.

       -s     Don't add the user site directory to sys.path.

       -u     Unbuffered binary stdout and stderr.

       -h, --help
              Show a help message and exit.

       -m MOD Library module to be run as a script (terminates option list).

       -W ARG Warning control (arg is action:message:category:module:lineno).

       -E     Ignore environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH).

       -B     Disable writing bytecode (.pyc) files.

       -X track-resources
              Produce a ResourceWarning whenever a file or socket is closed by the garbage collector.

       --version
              Print the PyPy version.

       --info Print translation information about this PyPy executable.

       --jit ARG
              Low level JIT parameters.  Mostly internal.  Run --jit help for more information.

ENVIRONMENT
       PYTHONPATH
              Add directories to pypy's module search path.  The format is the same as shell's PATH.

       PYTHONSTARTUP
              A script referenced by this variable will be executed before the first prompt is displayed, in interactive mode.

       PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
              If set to a non-empty value, equivalent to the -B option.  Disable writing .pyc files.

       PYTHONINSPECT
              If set to a non-empty value, equivalent to the -i option.  Inspect interactively after running the specified script.

       PYTHONIOENCODING
              If this is set, it overrides the encoding used for stdin/stdout/stderr.  The syntax is encodingname:errorhandler The errorhandler part is optional and has the same meaning as in str.encode.

       PYTHONNOUSERSITE
              If set to a non-empty value, equivalent to the -s option.  Don't add the user site directory to sys.path.

       PYTHONWARNINGS
              If set, equivalent to the -W option (warning control).  The value should be a comma-separated list of -W parameters.

       PYPYLOG
              If set to a non-empty value, enable logging, the format is:

              fname or +fname
                     logging for profiling: includes all debug_start/debug_stop but not any nested debug_print.  fname can be - to log to stderr.  The +fname form can be used if there is a : in fname

              :fname Full logging, including debug_print.

              prefix:fname
                     Conditional logging.  Multiple prefixes can be specified, comma-separated.  Only sections whose name match the prefix will be logged.

              PYPYLOG=jit-log-opt,jit-backend:logfile will generate a log suitable for jitviewer, a tool for debugging performance issues under PyPy.

       PYPY_IRC_TOPIC
              If set to a non-empty value, print a random #pypy IRC topic at startup of interactive mode.

       several environment variables:

       PYPY_GC_NURSERY
              The nursery size.  Defaults to 1/2 of your last-level cache, or 4M if unknown.  Small values (like 1 or 1KB) are useful for debugging.

       PYPY_GC_NURSERY_DEBUG
              If set to non-zero, will fill nursery with garbage, to help debugging.

       PYPY_GC_INCREMENT_STEP
              The  size of memory marked during the marking step.  Default is size of nursery times 2. If you mark it too high your GC is not incremental at all.  The minimum is set to size that survives mi‐
              nor collection times 1.5 so we reclaim anything all the time.

       PYPY_GC_MAJOR_COLLECT
              Major collection memory factor.  Default is 1.82, which means trigger a major collection when the memory consumed equals 1.82 times the memory really used at the end of the previous major  col‐
              lection.

       PYPY_GC_GROWTH
              Major collection threshold's max growth rate.  Default is 1.4.  Useful to collect more often than normally on sudden memory growth, e.g. when there is a temporary peak in memory usage.

       PYPY_GC_MAX
              The  max heap size.  If coming near this limit, it will first collect more often, then raise an RPython MemoryError, and if that is not enough, crash the program with a fatal error.  Try values
              like 1.6GB.

       PYPY_GC_MAX_DELTA
              The major collection threshold will never be set to more than PYPY_GC_MAX_DELTA the amount really used after a collection.  Defaults to 1/8th of the total RAM size (which is constrained  to  be
              at most 2/3/4GB on 32-bit systems).  Try values like 200MB.

       PYPY_GC_MIN
              Don't collect while the memory size is below this limit.  Useful to avoid spending all the time in the GC in very small programs.  Defaults to 8 times the nursery.

       PYPY_GC_DEBUG
              Enable extra checks around collections that are too slow for normal use.  Values are 0 (off), 1 (on major collections) or 2 (also on minor collections).

       PYPY_GC_MAX_PINNED
              The  maximal number of pinned objects at any point in time.  Defaults to a conservative value depending on nursery size and maximum object size inside the nursery.  Useful for debugging by set‐
              ting it to 0.
