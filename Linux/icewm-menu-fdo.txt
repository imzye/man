NAME
        icewm-menu-fdo - menu generator for .desktop files

SYNOPSIS
       icewm-menu-fdo [FILENAME]

DESCRIPTION
       icewm-menu-fdo introduces the XDG menu descriptors (aka FreeDesktop.Org .desktop files) to the menus of IceWM window manager.

ARGUMENTS
       [FILENAME]
           When provided with the optional FILENAME argument that is the name and location of a .desktop file, icewm-menu-fdo will open it and launch the application using the "Exec" line from the desktop
           file.

OPTIONS
       This program doesn't use command line options. In future, it might support the pass-through of arguments to the command run from .desktop file's "Exec" line.

USAGE
       This utility is not normally used directly, but is used as the executable in a menuprog entry in a menu.

EXAMPLES
       The following line in a icewm-menu(5) file will dynamically generate a comprehensive set of menus for easy access to .desktop files.

           menuprog "Desktop Apps" folder icewm-menu-fdo

ENVIRONMENT
       XDG_DATA_HOME or XDG_DATA_DIRS are considered as suggested by XDG Base Directory Specification.

CONFORMING TO
       icewm-menu-fdo complies roughly to the XDG .desktop file and menu specification, see "Desktop Entry Specification", Version 1.2alpha, 2015-03-06 and "Desktop Menu Specification", Version 1.1-draft, 31
       March 2011.

CAVEATS
       The icewm-menu-fdo program is only built when the icewm(1) package is configured with the --enable-menus-fdo option, which requires the glib2-dev package dependency.
