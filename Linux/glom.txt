NAME
       glom — database designer and user interface

SYNOPSIS
       glom

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the glom command.

       This manual page was written for the Ubuntu distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       With  glom you can design table definitions and the relationships between them, plus arrange the fields on the screen. You can edit and search the data in those tables, and specify field val‐
       ues in terms of other fields. It's as easy as it should be.

       The design is loosely based on FileMaker Pro, with the added advantage of separation between interface and data. Its simple framework should be enough to implement most database applications.
       Without Glom these systems normally consist of lots of repetitive, unmaintainable code.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.
