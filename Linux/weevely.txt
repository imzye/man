NAME
       Weevely - Weaponized web shell

DESCRIPTION
       A web shell designed for post-exploitation purposes that can be extended over the network at runtime.

       Upload weevely PHP agent to a target web server to get remote shell access to it.  Once connected you can make use of the more than 30 modules to assist administrative tasks, maintain access, pro‐
       vide situational awareness, elevate privileges, and spread into the target network.

SYNOPSIS
       Run terminal to the target
       weevely <URL> <password> [cmd]

       Generate backdoor agent
       weevely generate <password> <path>

       Load session file
       weevely session <path>

   Features
       • Shell access to the target

       • SQL console pivoting on the target

       • HTTP/HTTPS proxy to browse through the target

       • Upload and download files

       • Spawn reverse and direct TCP shells

       • Audit remote target security

       • Run Meterpreter payloads

       • Port scan pivoting on target

       • Mount the remote filesystem

       • Bruteforce SQL accounts pivoting on the target

   Agent
       The agent is a small, polymorphic PHP script hardly detected by AV and the communication protocol is obfuscated within HTTP requests.
