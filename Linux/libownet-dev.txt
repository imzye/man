FUNCTIONS
   OW_init
       OW_init_string offers the full flexibility of the owfs (1) and owhttpd (1) command line.

       Arguments
              Can  be as simple as jus the device name, a full parameter specification.  One or more device names (includes tcp, serial, usb...) and command line switches. See owfs (1) for full syn‐
              tax.

       Returns
              0 for success. -1 on error and errno will be set.  OW_finish does not need to be called if OW_init fails.

       Sequence
              One of the init functions must be called before accessing the 1-wire bus.  OW_finish is optional.

   OW_init_args
       OW_init_args offers the full flexibility of the owfs (1) and owhttpd (1) command line.

       Arguments
              One or more device names (includes tcp, serial, usb...) and command line switches. See owfs (1) for full syntax. Unlike OW_init_string the arguments are in argv/argc format.

       Returns
              0 for success. -1 on error and errno will be set.  OW_finish does not need to be called if OW_init fails.

       Sequence
              One of the init functions must be called before accessing the 1-wire bus.  OW_finish is optional.

   OW_get
       OW_get is used to get directory listings and file contents. The results are put in a dynamically allocated buffer.

       Arguments
              path is the path to the directory or file (property).  *buffer returns a pointer to a buffer containing the directory (comma separated) or value.  buffer_length returns the  length  of
              the value/string in buffer

       Returns
              number of bytes on success. -1 on error (and errno is set).

       Sequence
              One of the init functions must be called before accessing the 1-wire bus.  OW_finish is optional.

       Important note
              buffer is allocated ( with malloc ) by OW_get but must be freed in your program. See malloc (3) and free (3)

   OW_lread
       OW_lread  is  used to read 1-wire memory chips. Think of it as a combination of lseek and read It allows random-access to the memory, specifying location and length. Unlike OW_get directories
       cannot be obtained and the buffer must be pre-allocated rather than allocated by the routine.  buffer must be at least size length.

       Arguments
              path is the path to the file (property).  buffer is the (pre-allocated) memory area where the value will be placed.  size is the length of bytes requested.  offset is the  position  in
              file to start reading.

       Returns
              number of bytes on success. -1 on error (and errno is set).

       Sequence
              One of the init functions must be called before accessing the 1-wire bus.  OW_finish is optional.

   OW_put
       OW_put is an easy way to write to 1-wire chips.

       Arguments
              path is the path to the file (property).  buffer is the value to be written.  buffer_length is the length of the value buffer.  Returns number of bytes on success. -1 on error (and er‐
              rno is set).

       Sequence
              One of the init functions must be called before accessing the 1-wire bus.  OW_finish is optional.

   OW_lwrite
       OW_lwrite is the companion of OW_lread.  It allows writing to arbitrary positions in 1-wire memory.  Think of it as a combination of lseek and write.  buffer must be at least size length.

       Arguments
              path is the path to the file (property).  buffer is the data to be written.  size is the length of bytes to be written.  offset is the position in file to start writing.

       Returns
              number of bytes on success. -1 on error (and errno is set).

       Sequence
              One of the init functions must be called before accessing the 1-wire bus.  OW_finish is optional.

   OW_finish
       OW_finish cleans up the OWFS 1-wire routines, releases devices and memory.

       Arguments
              None.

       Returns
              None

       Sequence
              OW_finish is optional since cleanup is automatic on program exit.

DESCRIPTION
   1-Wire
       1-wire  is  a  wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector scheme where the data line can also
       provide power.

       Each device is uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety of devices,  including  memory,  sensors  (humidity,  temperature,  voltage,  contact,  current),
       switches, timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also 1-wire devices that have encryption included.

       The  1-wire  scheme  uses  a  single bus master and multiple slaves on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be individually discovered and addressed using
       their unique ID.

       Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB adapters.

   OWFS design
       OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique  ID  being  the
       directory, and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.

       Details  of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or control
       applications. There are some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the  funda‐
       mental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed.

   libowcapi
       libowcapi (1) is an encapsulation of the full libow library for C programs.

       libowcapi  (1)  allows  a C program to use OWFS principles (consistent naming scheme, multiple adapters, devices, and compatibility) directly from a C program. There are analogous modules for
       other programming languages:

       C      libowcapi

       perl   owperl

       php    owphp

       python owpython

       tcl    owtcl

EXAMPLE
       /* Simple directory listing -- no error checking */
       #include <ownetapi.h>
       char * buf;
       size_t s ;
       OWNET_init("localhost:4304");
       OWNET_dirlist("/",&buf,&s) ;
       printf("Directory %s0,buf);
       free(buf);
       OWNET_finish() ;
