NAME
       dfrs - Display file system space usage using graphs and colors

SYNOPSIS
       dfrs [OPTION]...  [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       dfrs  displays  the  amount  of  disk  space available on the file system containing each file name argument. If no file name is given, the space available on all currently mounted file systems is
       shown.

       dfrs(1) is a tool similar to df(1) except that it is able to show a graph along with the data and is able to use colors.

       Without any argument, size is displayed in human-readable format.

OPTIONS
       Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides, or all regular file systems by default.

       -a, --more
           Show more file systems; use -a twice to show all

       -aa, --all
           Show all file systems

       -c
           Force colors even if stdout is not a tty. This is useful with watch -c

       --color [WHEN]
           Colorize the output; WHEN can be 'auto' (default if omitted), 'always', or 'never'

       -i, --inodes
           Show inode instead of block usage

       -h, --human-readable
           Print sizes in powers of 1024 (e.g., 1023M)

       -H, --si
           Print sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., 1.1G)

       --total
           Produce and show a grand total

       -l, --local
           Limit listing to local file systems

       --no-aliases
           Do not resolve file system shorthand aliases (e.g., LVM)

       --columns [COLUMN]...
           Display columns defined as a comma separated list; COLUMN can be: filesystem, type, bar, used, used_percentage, available, available_percentage, capacity, mounted_on

       --mounts [FILE]
           File to get mount information from (e.g., /proc/mounts or /etc/mtab)
