NAME
       dunk - an alternative diff view for Git that is pretty and colorful

SYNOPSIS
       dunk

DESCRIPTION
       Dunk is meant to be used as a filter, receiving the output from git diff as its STDIN:

         git diff | dunk

       dunk will present a two-column, syntax-highlighted view of the differences with the Git index in the current directory.

OPTIONS
       dunk does not have any options.

EXAMPLES
       Given dunk works as a filter, you can specify options to git diff and dunk will work with whatever output it produces:
       Dunk will work with commit ranges or specifying files or directories in your Git repository, as follows:

         git diff HEAD~.. | dunk

       This will present the differences between the immediately past revision to the current one.

       You can also specify specific files within the repository to report:

         git diff README | dunk

       This will only report the differences in the README file.

       For further examples, refer to the syntax of git-diff(1), dunk will work on its produced output.

SEE ALSO
       git-diff(1).
