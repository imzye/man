NAME
       globus_xio_http_driver_instance - Opening/Closing

        - Opening/Closing.

SYNOPSIS
Detailed Description
       Opening/Closing.

       An XIO handle with the http driver can be created with either globus_xio_handle_create() or globus_xio_server_register_accept().

       If the handle is created with globus_xio_server_register_accept(), then an HTTP service handle will be created when globus_xio_register_open() is called. The XIO application must call one of the
       functions in the globus_xio_read() family to receive the HTTP request metadata. This metadata will be returned in the data descriptor associated with that first read: the application should use
       the GLOBUS_XIO_HTTP_GET_REQUEST descriptor cntl to extract this metadata.

       If the handle is created with globus_xio_handle_create(), then an HTTP client handle will be created when globus_xio_register_open() is called. HTTP request headers, version and method may be
       chosen by setting attributes.
