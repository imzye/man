       qbrew [options] file

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the qbrew command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documen‐
       tation in the html format viewable from within the program.

       qbrew is a recipe calculator for homebrewed beers.  In addition to managing recipes, it provides facilities for creating new beer recipes.  It uses Qt for its graphical user interface.
