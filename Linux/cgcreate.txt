NAME
       cgcreate - create new cgroup(s)

SYNOPSIS
       cgcreate [-h] [-t <tuid>:<tgid>] [-a <agid>:<auid>] [-f mode] [-d mode]
       [-s mode] -g <controllers>:<path> [-g ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The command creates new cgroup(s) defined by the options -g.

       -a <agid>:<auid>
              defines the name of the user and the group which own the rest of
              the  defined  control  group’s files. These users are allowed to
              set subsystem parameters  and  create  subgroups.   The  default
              value is the same as has the parent cgroup.

       -d, --dperm=mode
              sets the permissions of a control groups directory.  The permis‐
              sions needs to be specified as octal numbers e.g.  -d 775.

       -f, --fperm=mode
              sets the permissions of the control groups parameters.  The per‐
              missions  needs  to  be specified as octal numbers e.g.  -f 775.
              The value is not used as given because the current owner's  per‐
              missions  are used as an umask (so 777 will set group and others
              permissions to the owners permissions).

       -g <controllers>:<path>
              defines control groups to be added.  controllers is  a  list  of
              controllers  and  path is the relative path to control groups in
              the given controllers list. This option can be specified  multi‐
              ple times.

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -s, --tperm=mode
              sets  the permissions of the control group tasks file.  The per‐
              missions needs to be specified as octal numbers  e.g.   -s  775.
              The  value is not used as given because the current owner's per‐
              missions are used as an umask (so 777 will set group and  others
              permissions to the owners permissions).

       -t <tuid>:<tgid>
              defines  the  name  of  the user and the group, which owns tasks
              file of the defined control group. I.e. this user and members of
              this  group have write access to the file.  The default value is
              the same as has the parent cgroup.
