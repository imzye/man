LSBILIBOP(8)                                                                                 System Administration                                                                                 LSBILIBOP(8)

NAME
       lsbilibop - list BILIBOP tagged devices, display or update some of their udev properties

SYNOPSIS
       lsbilibop [-l]
       lsbilibop [-a|-c|-i] [DEVICE [DEVICE [...]]]
       lsbilibop -h

DESCRIPTION
       lsbilibop  is  a simple shell script that outputs the list of BILIBOP tagged block devices and some of their udev(7) properties, or triggers uevents to update udev rules and properties that can be ap‐
       plied to these devices.

       If the operating system is running from an external and writable support (USB or SD Flash Memory, USB, Firewire or eSATA HDD), then the BILIBOP tagged devices are the block devices whose contents  are
       on  the  same physical disk than the root filesystem. This includes disk, partitions, but also device-mapper and loopback devices, and even block devices containing a filesystem used as lower/readonly
       branch of an aufs(5) or overlay mountpoint (depending on the kernel version). The rules file /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/66-bilibop.rules (or /etc/udev/rules.d/66-bilibop.rules) is used to find and tag such
       devices.

OPTIONS
       Options  must be invoked before arguments.  When invoked without option, lsbilibop just outputs a list of the device(s) given as arguments (if they are BILIBOP tagged block devices), or of all BILIBOP
       tagged block devices if none is specified. Devices are listed in the same order than in /proc/partitions, i.e. in the order they have been discovered by the kernel. Absolute or relative paths and sym‐
       links can be used to specify a device. Shell wildcards are allowed.

       -a  Trigger  'device  add'  uevent for the device(s) given as arguments (if they are BILIBOP tagged block devices), or of all BILIBOP tagged block devices if none is specified, to update their proper‐
           ties. This can be used each time the corresponding BILIBOP_RULES_* variables are modified in bilibop.conf(5), to apply the new settings without need to reboot the operating system.

       -c  Trigger 'device change' uevent for the device(s) given as arguments (if they are BILIBOP tagged block devices), or of all BILIBOP tagged block devices if none is specified, to update their proper‐
           ties. This can be used each time the corresponding BILIBOP_RULES_* variables are modified in bilibop.conf(5), to apply the new settings without need to reboot the operating system.

       -h  Print a help page on standard output and exit.

       -i  Display  some  useful  udev(7)  properties of the device(s) given as arguments (if they are BILIBOP tagged block devices), or of all BILIBOP tagged block devices if none is specified.  This option
           overrides -a and -c options.

           The following properties are only informative. The two last ones are set if and only if udisks 1.x (ID_DRIVE_DETACHABLE) and/or udisks 2.x (UDISKS_CAN_POWER_OFF) are installed.

           DEVNAME
           BILIBOP_DISK
           BILIBOP_PARTITION
           BILIBOP_UNDERLYING_PARTITION
           DEVLINKS

           ID_DRIVE_DETACHABLE
           UDISKS_CAN_POWER_OFF

           The following properties can be used to set BILIBOP_RULES_*_WHITELIST and other variables in bilibop.conf(5):

           ID_FS_LABEL
           ID_FS_TYPE
           ID_FS_USAGE
           ID_FS_UUID

           The following properties can be modified by changing the corresponding BILIBOP_RULES_* variables in bilibop.conf(5).  They are set if and only if udisks 1.x (for the first set) and/or  udisks  2.x
           (for the second set) are installed.

           UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE
           UDISKS_PRESENTATION_ICON_NAME
           UDISKS_PRESENTATION_NAME
           UDISKS_SYSTEM_INTERNAL

           UDISKS_IGNORE
           UDISKS_ICON_NAME
           UDISKS_NAME
           UDISKS_SYSTEM

       -l  Don't rely on the 'BILIBOP' tag to list the devices.  This option is based on the bilibop-common shell library.

ERRORS
       If the 'BILIBOP' tag does not exist in the udev database, then lsbilibop displays a useful error message on stderr, and lists the device nodes whose content is supposed to be written on the same phys‐
       ical disk than the root filesystem (as does the -l option). Exit code is 8.
