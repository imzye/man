NAME
       clustalw - Multiple alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences

SYNOPSIS

       clustalw [-infile] file.ext [OPTIONS]

       clustalw [-help | -fullhelp]

DESCRIPTION
       Clustal W is a general purpose multiple alignment program for DNA or proteins.

       The program performs simultaneous alignment of many nucleotide or amino acid sequences. It is typically run interactively, providing a menu and an online help. If you prefer to use it in
       command-line (batch) mode, you will have to give several options, the minimum being -infile.
