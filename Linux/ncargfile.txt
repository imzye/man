NAME
       ncargfile - NCAR Graphics Files

SYNOPSIS
       ncargfile [-all] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       ncargfile provides the user with access to special NCAR Graphics files or tables.  ncargfile copies the specified file(s) into the current directory.

       In  order  to run ncargfile, you must have your NCARG_ROOT environment variable set to the directory pathname where the NCAR Graphics libraries, binaries, and include files were installed.  If you are
       not sure what NCARG_ROOT should be set to, please check with your system administrator or the site representative for NCAR Graphics.  If the NCAR Graphics libraries, binaries, and include  files  were
       not installed under one root directory, then you will need to set the environment variables NCARG_LIB, NCARG_BIN, and NCARG_INCLUDE instead.  Please see "man ncargintro" for more information.

       Currently, only one table is available with ncargfile, and that is the table of Ezmap Area identifiers, called "ezmap_area_ids".
