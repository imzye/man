NAME
       Class::DBI::Loader::Relationship - Easier relationship specification in CDBI::L

SYNOPSIS
         use Class::DBI::Loader::Relationship;

         my $loader = Class::DBI::Loader->new( dsn => "mysql:beerdb",
                                               namespace => "BeerDB");

       Now instead of saying

           BeerDB::Brewery->has_many(beers => "BeerDB::Beer");
           BeerDB::Beer->has_a(brewery => "BeerDB::Brewery");

           BeerDB::Handpump->has_a(beer => "BeerDB::Beer");
           BeerDB::Handpump->has_a(pub => "BeerDB::Pub");
           BeerDB::Pub->has_many(beers => [ BeerDB::Handpump => 'beer' ]);
           BeerDB::Beer->has_many(pubs => [ BeerDB::Handpump => 'pub' ]);

       Just say

           $loader->relationship( "a brewery produces beers" );
           $loader->relationship( "a pub has beers on handpumps" );

DESCRIPTION
       This module acts as a mix-in, adding the "relationship" method to "Class::DBI::Loader". Since "Class::DBI::Loader" knows how to map between table names and class names, there ought to be no need
       to replicate the names.

       In addition, it is common (but not universal) to want reverse relationships defined for has-many relationships, and for has-a relationships to be defined for the linkages surrounding a many-to-
       many table.

       The aim of "CDBIL::Relationship" is to simplify the declaration of common database relationships by providing both of these features.

       The "relationship" takes a string. It recognises table names (singular or plural, for convenience) and extracts them from the "sentence".
