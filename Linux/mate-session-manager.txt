NAME
       mate-wm - Start the window manager configured by the user

SYNOPSIS
       mate-wm [--default-wm=WINDOWMANAGER] [--sm-client-id=ID]

DESCRIPTION
       The mate-wm program starts the window manager configured by the user. If the user has not chosen a window manager it will launch a MATE compliant window manager.

USAGE
       The user can define his preferred window manager with the /org/mate/desktop/session/required-components/windowmanager dconf key. The value of this key should be the name of the desktop file of the
       desired  window manager, without its .desktop extension. If this key is set to mate-wm, then mate-wm will simply look for an appropriate window manager. The user can also override the selection of
       a window manager by setting the WINDOW_MANAGER environment variable.

       If the --default-wm option is used, mate-wm will use WINDOWMANAGER as window manager if the WINDOW_MANAGER environment variable is not  set  and  if  the  /org/mate/desktop/session/required-compo‐
       nents/windowmanager dconf key does not define a specific window manager, or if the configured window manager cannot be found.

       The --sm-client-id option is translated to an appropriate option depending on which window manager will be started.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --default-wm=WINDOWMANAGER
              Define the default window manager to start if no window manager is configured, or if the configured window manager cannot be found.

       --sm-client-id=ID
              Specify the session management ID when connecting to the session manager.

ENVIRONMENT
       mate-wm uses the value of the WINDOW_MANAGER environment variable to let the user override the configured window manager.
