NAME
       nauty-planarg - test graphs for planarity and find embeddings or obstructions

SYNOPSIS
       planarg [-v] [-nVq] [-p|-u] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              For each input, write to output if planar.

              The output file has a header if and only if the input file does.

       -v     Write non-planar graphs instead of planar graphs

       -V     Write report on every input

       -u     Don't write anything, just count

       -p     Write in planar_code if planar (without -p, same format as input)

       -k     Follow each non-planar output with an obstruction in sparse6 format (implies -v, incompatible with -p)

       -n     Suppress checking of the result

       -q     Suppress auxiliary information

              This program permits multiple edges and loops
