NAME
       pg_upgradecluster - upgrade an existing PostgreSQL cluster to a new major version.

SYNOPSIS
       pg_upgradecluster [-v newversion] oldversion name [newdatadir]

DESCRIPTION
       pg_upgradecluster upgrades an existing PostgreSQL server cluster (i. e. a collection of databases served by a postgres instance) to a new version specified by newversion (default: latest available
       version).  The configuration files of the old version are copied to the new cluster and adjusted for the new version.  The new cluster is set up to use data page checksums if the old cluster uses
       them.

       The cluster of the old version will be configured to use a previously unused port since the upgraded one will use the original port. The old cluster is not automatically removed. After upgrading,
       please verify that the new cluster indeed works as expected; if so, you should remove the old cluster with pg_dropcluster(8). Please note that the old cluster is set to "manual" startup mode, in order
       to avoid inadvertently changing it; this means that it will not be started automatically on system boot, and you have to use pg_ctlcluster(8) to start/stop it. See section "STARTUP CONTROL" in
       pg_createcluster(8) for details.

       The newdatadir argument can be used to specify a non-default data directory of the upgraded cluster. It is passed to pg_createcluster. If not specified, this defaults to
       /var/lib/postgresql/newversion/name.

OPTIONS
       -v newversion
           Set the version to upgrade to (default: latest available).

       --logfile filel
           Set a custom log file path for the upgraded database cluster.

       --locale=locale
           Set the default locale for the upgraded database cluster. If this option is not specified, the locale is inherited from the old cluster.

           When upgrading to PostgreSQL 11 or newer, this option no longer allows to switch the encoding of individual databases. (pg_dumpall(1) was changed to retain database encodings.)

       --lc-collate=locale
       --lc-ctype=locale
       --lc-messages=locale
       --lc-monetary=locale
       --lc-numeric=locale
       --lc-time=locale
           Like --locale, but only sets the locale in the specified category.

       -m, --method=dump|upgrade|link|clone
           Specify the upgrade method.  dump uses pg_dump(1) and pg_restore(1), upgrade uses pg_upgrade(1).  The default is dump.

           link and clone are shorthands for -m upgrade --link and -m upgrade --clone, respectively.

       -k, --link
           In pg_upgrade mode, use hard links instead of copying files to the new cluster.  This option is merely passed on to pg_upgrade.  See pg_upgrade(1) for details.

       --clone
           In pg_upgrade mode, use efficient file cloning (also known as "reflinks" on some systems) instead of copying files to the new cluster. This option is merely passed on to pg_upgrade.  See
           pg_upgrade(1) for details.

       -j, --jobs
           In pg_upgrade mode, number of simultaneous processes to use. This option is merely passed on to pg_upgrade. See pg_upgrade(1) for details.

       --keep-port
           By default, the old cluster is moved to a new port, and the new cluster is moved to the original port so clients will see the upgraded cluster. This option disables that.

       --rename=new cluster name
           Use a different name for the upgraded cluster.

       --old-bindir=directory
           Passed to pg_upgrade.

       --maintenance-db=database
           Database to connect to for maintenance queries.  The default is template1.

       --[no-]start
           Start the new database cluster after upgrading. The default is to start the new cluster if the old cluster was running, or if upgrade hook scripts are present.

HOOK SCRIPTS
       Some PostgreSQL extensions like PostGIS need metadata in auxiliary tables which must not be upgraded from the old version, but rather initialized for the new version before copying the table data. For
       this purpose, extensions (as well as administrators, of course) can drop upgrade hook scripts into /etc/postgresql-common/pg_upgradecluster.d/. Script file names must consist entirely of upper and
       lower case letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens; in particular, dots (i. e. file extensions) are not allowed.

       Scripts in that directory will be called with the following arguments:

       <old version> <cluster name> <new version> <phase>

       Phases:

       init
           A virgin cluster of version new version has been created, i. e.  this new cluster will already have template1 and postgres, but no user databases. Please note that you should not create tables in
           this phase, since they will be overwritten by the dump/restore or pg_upgrade operation.

       finish
           All data from the old version cluster has been dumped/reloaded into the new one. The old cluster still exists, but is not running.

       Failing scripts will abort the upgrade.  The scripts are called as the user who owns the database.
