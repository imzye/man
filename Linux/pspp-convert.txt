NAME
       pspp-convert - convert SPSS data files to other formats

SYNOPSIS
       pspp-convert [options] input output
       pspp-convert --help | -h
       pspp-convert --version | -v

DESCRIPTION
       The  pspp-convert  program  reads  input, which may be an SPSS system file, an SPSS/PC+ system file, an SPSS portable file, or an encrypted SPSS syntax file, and writes it to output, performing format
       conversion as necessary.

       The format of input is automatically detected, when possible.  The character encoding of old SPSS system files cannot always be guessed correctly, and SPSS/PC+ system files do not include any  indica‐
       tion of their encoding.  Use -e encoding to specify the encoding in this case.

       By default, the intended format for output is inferred from its extension:

       csv
       txt    Comma-separated value.  Each value is formatted according to its variable's print format.  The first line in the file contains variable names.

       sav
       sys    SPSS system file.

       por    SPSS portable file.

       sps    SPSS syntax file.  (Only encrypted syntax files may be converted to this format.)

       Use -O extension to override the inferred format or to specify the format for unrecognized extensions.

       pspp-convert can convert most input formats to most output formats.  Encrypted SPSS file formats are exceptions: if the input file is in an encrypted format, then the output file will be the same for‐
       mat (decrypted).  Options for the output format are ignored in this case.

OPTIONS
   General Options
       -O format
       --output-format=format
              Specifies the desired output format.  format must be one of the extensions listed above, e.g. -O csv requests comma-separated value output.

       -c maxcases
       --cases=maxcases
              By default, all cases are copied from input to output.  Specifying this option to limit the number of cases written to output to maxcases.

       -e charset
       --encoding=charset
              Overrides the encoding in which character strings in input are interpreted.  This option is necessary because old SPSS system files do not self-identify their encoding.

       -k var...
       --keep=var...
              Drops all variables except those listed as var, and reorders the remaining variables into the specified order.

       -d var...
       --drop=var...
              Drops each var listed from the output.

   CSV Output Options
       These options affect only output to .csv and .txt files.

       --labels
              By default, pspp-convert writes variables' values to the output.  With this option, pspp-convert writes value labels.

       --no-var-names
              By default, pspp-convert writes the variable names as the first line of output.  With this option, pspp-convert omits this line.

       --recode
              By default, pspp-convert writes user-missing values as their regular values.  With this option, pspp-convert recodes them to system-missing values (which are written as a single space).

       --print-formats
              By default, pspp-convert writes numeric variables as plain numbers.  This option makes pspp-convert honor variables' print formats.

       --decimal=decimal
              This option sets the character used as a decimal point in output.  The default is a period (.).

       --delimiter=delimiter
              This option sets the character used to separate fields in output.  The default is a comma (,), unless the decimal point is a comma, in which case a semicolon (;) is used.

       --qualifier=qualifier
              The option sets the character used to quote fields that contain the delimiter.  The default is a double quote (").

   Password Options
       When the input file is encrypted, pspp-convert needs to obtain a password to decrypt it.  To do so, the user may specify the password with -p (or --password), or the name of a file containing  a  list
       of  possible  passwords  with --password-list, or an alphabet of possible passwords to try along with a maximum length with -a (or --password-alphabet) and -l (or --password-length).  If none of these
       options is used, pspp-convert prompts for the password.  The password options are:

       -p password
       --password=password
              Specifies the password to use to decrypt the input file.

              On multiuser systems, this option may not be safe because other users may be able to see the password in process listings.

       -a alphabet -l max-length
       --password-alphabet=alphabet --password-length=max-length
              These options are an alternative to -p or --password.  They direct pspp-convert to search for the correct password from the set of all passwords of symbols  from  alphabet  (which  may  contain
              character ranges specified with -) and no more than max-length symbols long.  For example, -a a-z -l 5 checks all possible lowercase alphabetic passwords no more than 5 characters long.

              When these options are used, -p may additionally specify a starting point for the search.

       --password-list=file
              Specifies a file to read containing a list of passwords to try, one per line.  If file is -, reads from stdin.

   Other Options
       -h
       --help Prints a usage message on stdout and exits.

       -v
       --version
              Prints version information on stdout and exits.
