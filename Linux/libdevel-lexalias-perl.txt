NAME
       Devel::LexAlias - alias lexical variables

SYNOPSIS
        use Devel::LexAlias qw(lexalias);

        sub steal_my_x {
            my $foo = 1;
            lexalias(1, '$x', \$foo);
        }

        sub foo {
            my $x = 22;
            print $x; # prints 22

            steal_my_x;
            print $x; # prints 1
        }

DESCRIPTION
       Devel::LexAlias provides the ability to alias a lexical variable in a subroutines scope to one of your choosing.

       If you don't know why you'd want to do this, I'd suggest that you skip this module.  If you think you have a use for it, I'd insist on it.

       Still here?

       lexalias( $where, $name, $variable )
           $where refers to the subroutine in which to alias the lexical, it can be a coderef or a call level such that you'd give to "caller"

           $name is the name of the lexical within that subroutine

           $variable is a reference to the variable to install at that location

BUGS
       lexalias  delves  into  the  internals  of  the interpreter to perform its actions and is so very sensitive to bad data, which will likely result in flaming death, or a core dump.  Consider this a
       warning.

       There is no checking that you are attaching a suitable variable back into the pad as implied by the name of the variable, so it is possible to do the following:

        lexalias( $sub, '$foo', [qw(an array)] );

       The behaviour of this is untested, I imagine badness is very close on the horizon though.
