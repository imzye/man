NAME
       run_init - run an init script in the proper SELinux context

SYNOPSIS
       run_init SCRIPT [[ARGS]...]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  a init script under the proper context, which is specified in /etc/selinux/POLICYTYPE/contexts/initrc_context.  It is generally used interactively as it requires either shadow or PAM user au‐
       thentication (depending on compile-time options).  It should be possible to configure PAM such that interactive input is not required.  Check your PAM documentation.

FILES
       /etc/passwd - user account information
       /etc/shadow - encrypted passwords and age information
       /etc/selinux/POLICYTYPE/contexts/initrc_context - contains the context to run init scripts under
