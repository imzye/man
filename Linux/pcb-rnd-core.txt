NAME
       fp2preview - generate a preview for a library footprint

SYNPOSIS
       fp2preview [options] [inputfile]

DECSRIPTION
       fp2preview  invokes pcb-rnd to generate a preview image of a library footprint. Its main use is to have a automated, light-weight footprint preview generator using a static linked pcb-rnd (e.g. on
       web servers).

OPTIONS
       --photo
              draw the footprint in "photo realistic mode"

       -p     same as --photo

       --grid unit
              set grid unit e.g. to mm or mil

       -g unit
              same as --grid

       --mm   use an mm grid instead of a mil grid; shorthand for -g mm

       --annotation types
              turn on annotation types; types is a string that may consist "pins" for pin/pad numbers, "dimname" and "dimvalue" for dimension names and values and "background" for  drawing  a  background
              under annotation text

                                                                                                 2019-10-01                                                                                   fp2preview(1)
