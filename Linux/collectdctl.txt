COLLECTDCTL(1)                     collectd                     COLLECTDCTL(1)

NAME
       collectdctl - Control interface for collectd

SYNOPSIS
       collectdctl [options] <command> [command options]

DESCRIPTION
       collectdctl provides a control interface for collectd, which may be
       used to interact with the daemon using the "unixsock plugin".

OPTIONS
       collectdctl supports the following options:

       -s socket
           Path to the UNIX socket opened by collectd's "unixsock plugin".
           Default: /var/run/collectd-unixsock

       -h  Display usage information and exit.

AVAILABLE COMMANDS
       The following commands are supported:

       getval <identifier>
           Query the latest collected value identified by the specified
           <identifier> (see below). The value-list associated with that data-
           set is returned as a list of key-value-pairs, each on its own line.
           Keys and values are separated by the equal sign ("=").

       flush [timeout=<seconds>] [plugin=<name>] [identifier=<id>]
           Flush the daemon. This is useful, e. g., to make sure that the
           latest values have been written to the respective RRD file before
           graphing them or copying them to somewhere else.

           The following options are supported by the flush command:

           timeout=<seconds>
               Flush values older than the specified timeout (in seconds)
               only.

           plugin=<name>
               Flush the specified plugin only. I. e., data cached by the
               specified plugin is written to disk (or network or whatever),
               if the plugin supports that operation.

               Example: rrdtool.

           identifier=<id>
               If this option is present, only the data specified by the
               specified identifier (see below) will be flushed. Note that
               this option is not supported by all plugins (e. g., the
               "network" plugin does not support this).

           The plugin and identifier options may be specified more than once.
           In that case, all combinations of specified plugins and identifiers
           will be flushed only.

       listval
           Returns a list of all values (by their identifier) available to the
           "unixsock" plugin. Each value is printed on its own line. I. e.,
           this command returns a list of valid identifiers that may be used
           with the other commands.

       putval <identifier> [interval=<seconds>] <value-list(s)>
           Submit one or more values (identified by <identifier>, see below)
           to the daemon which will then dispatch them to the write plugins.
           interval specifies the interval (in seconds) used to collect the
           values following that option. It defaults to the default of the
           running collectd instance receiving the data. Multiple
           <value-list(s)> (see below) may be specified.  Each of them will be
           submitted to the daemon. The values have to match the data-set
           definition specified by the type as given in the identifier (see
           types.db(5) for details).

IDENTIFIERS
       An identifier has the following format:

       [hostname/]plugin[-plugin_instance]/type[-type_instance]

       Examples:
        somehost/cpu-0/cpu-idle
        uptime/uptime
        otherhost/memory/memory-used

       Hostname defaults to the local (non-fully qualified) hostname if
       omitted. No error is returned if the specified identifier does not
       exist (this is a limitation in the "libcollectdclient" library).

VALUE-LIST
       A value list describes one data-set as handled by collectd. It is a
       colon (":") separated list of the time and the values. Each value is
       either given as an integer if the data-type is a counter, or as a
       double if the data-type is a gauge value. A literal "U" is interpreted
       as an undefined gauge value.  The number of values and the data-types
       have to match the type specified in the identifier (see types.db(5) for
       details). The time is specified as epoch (i. e., standard UNIX time) or
       as a literal "N" which will be interpreted as now.

EXAMPLES
       "collectdctl flush plugin=rrdtool identifier=somehost/cpu-0/cpu-wait"
           Flushes all CPU wait RRD values of the first CPU of the local host.
           I. e., writes all pending RRD updates of that data-source to disk.

       "for ident in `collectdctl listval | grep users/users`; do collectdctl
       getval $ident; done"
           Query the latest number of logged in users on all hosts known to
           the local collectd instance.
