NAME
       gdcmviewer - Simple DICOM viewer.

SYNOPSIS
           gdcmviewer [options] file-in

DESCRIPTION
       The gdcmviewer is a simple tool that show how to use vtkGDCMImageReader. The class that use gdcm to make a layer to VTK.  gdcmviewer is basically only just a wrapper around VTK/GDCM.

       This tool is meant for testing integration of GDCM in VTK. You should see it as a demo tool. It does compile with VTK ranging from 4.2 to 5.10, but only with VTK 5.2 (or above) can play with the
       widgets (as described below).

PARAMETERS
           file-in   DICOM input filename

OPTIONS
   specific options
                --force-rescale    force rescale (advanced users)
                --force-spacing    force spacing (advanced users)
             -r --recursive        Recursively descend directory

   general options
             -h   --help
                    print this help text and exit

             -v   --version
                    print version information and exit

             -V   --verbose
                    verbose mode (warning+error).

             -W   --warning
                    warning mode, print warning information

             -E   --error
                    error mode, print error information

             -D   --debug
                    debug mode, print debug information

TYPICAL USAGE
SIMPLE USAGE
       For now gdcmviewer should be started from a command line prompt. The next argument should be the name of the DICOM file you wish to read. For instance:

           $ gdcmviewer -V 012345.002.050.dcm

       gdcmviewer will try to read your file, and then print the vtk information associated with this file. Basically what kind of image you are looking at.

       •   ScalarType is the DICOM Real World Value type

       •   Dimensions is the dimension of the image

       •   Spacing is the spacing of the image

       •   NumberOfScalarComponents should be 1 for grayscale & PALETTE COLOR and 3 for RGB, YBR data.
