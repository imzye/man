NAME
       esdsample - play a sample

SYNOPSIS
       esdsample [-s hostname:port] [-b] [-d] [-e] [-h] [-m] [-r freq] samplename

DESCRIPTION
       The esdsample utility plays a sample using the Enlighted Sound Daemon (esd).

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -s hostname:portContact the esd server on hostname at port.

       -b              Specify that the output should be in 8-bit format. By default, the output is in 16-bit format.

       -d              Play the sample from file as raw data. The default behavior is to read the data from a sound file (.wav, .au, and so on). If this option is chosen, samplename is the name of a file.

       -e              Play the sample from the esd cache. If this option is chosen, samplename  is the name of the sample in the cache.

       -h              Display help text, and exit.

       -m              Specify that the output should be in mono format. By default, the output is in stereo format.

       -r freq         Specify that the output rate should be set to freq. By default, the output rate is set to 44.1 kHz.

OPERANDS
       The following operands are supported:

       samplename      The name of the sample to be played.  If the -e option is used, samplename is the esd  cache name. Otherwise, samplename is a filename.
