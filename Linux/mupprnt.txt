NAME
       mupprnt - print output from Mup music publisher

SYNOPSIS
       mupprnt [mup_options] file

DESCRIPTION
       mupprnt  provides  a way to print Mup output on your printer.  The file
       is Mup input. Any other Mup options can be given, except  -C,  -E,  -f,
       -F, -l, -m, -M, or -v, which don't produce print output.

       Under UNIX, if the environment variable COPIES is set to a number, that
       number of copies will  be  printed.  Otherwise  only  1  copy  will  be
       printed.

       The  GS_DEVICE  shell variable must be set to the proper value for your
       printer type.  Mupprnt is a shell script (under UNIX) or  batch  script
       (under MS‐DOS), so you can customize it if you wish.
