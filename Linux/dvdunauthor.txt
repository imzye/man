NAME
       dvdunauthor - Decodes DVD-Video file structure

SYNOPSIS
       dvdunauthor [ path ]

DESCRIPTION
       dvdunauthor decodes the specified DVD-Video directory structure, putting into the current directory an XML control file and corresponding MPEG-2 files (with a .vob extension) that dvdauthor can (hope‐
       fully) interpret to recreate the DVD-Video directory structure.

USAGE
       dvdunauthor path

CAVEATS
       None.

BUGS
       Depends on libdvdread to decode the DVD-Video structure and to report any errors trying to do so. But libdvdread will sometimes just exit without reporting any error.
