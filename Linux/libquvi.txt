NAME
       libquvi - Overview of the library

DESCRIPTION
       libquvi is a cross-platform library with C API for parsing adobe flash media properties. "quvi" is an acronym for "query video".

ENVIRONMENT
       LIBQUVI_EXCLUSIVE_SCRIPTS_DIR
           When defined, the library will only use those scripts found at the directories specified by the LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_DIR.

               Note
               Useful, for example, when the current set of the scripts at $top_srcdir/share/ (of libquvi-scripts) are being tested by the testsuite of the libquvi-scripts. The library would, otherwise,
               include the scripts from the libquvi-scripts instance built with the library and likely interfere with the tests.

       LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_DIR
           The library will additionally look in the colon-separated list of directories specified by the LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_DIR environment variable.

       LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_VERBOSE
           When defined, enables the output from any libquvi scripts using the debug facility (quvi/debug module).

       LIBQUVI_SHOW_DIR
           When defined, the library will output the paths of the searched directories to the stderr.

       LIBQUVI_SHOW_SCRIPT
           When defined, the library will output the file names of the found scripts to stderr. The output will also indicate whether the script was accepted by the library.

       Proxy
           libquvi uses libcurl(3). See the libcurl documentation (C API and/or curl(1)) for a complete list of the supported proxy environment variables.
