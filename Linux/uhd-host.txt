NAME
       usrpctl - USRP Hardware Driver Peripheral Configuration Tool

DESCRIPTION
       Report detailed information on UHD-supported Software Radio Peripherals attached by USB, network, or embedded configuration.  Allows update and configuration of attached devices.

       The  UHD  package  is the universal hardware driver for Ettus Research products. The goal is to provide a host driver and API for current and future Ettus Research products.  Users will be able to
       use the UHD driver standalone or with 3rd party applications.

       Details include unit names, revision numbers, and available sensors on all attached USRP motherboards and daughterboards.

SYNOPSIS
       usrpctl [ID] COMMAND [OPTIONS]

ID
       ID is the optional device argument. It is used to define a set of USRP devices that COMMAND should be applied to. If ID is omitted COMMAND is applied to all reachable devices.

       usrpctl understands the device args argument used by other UHD tools like uhd_find_devices.

COMMAND
       Is the action the tool is to take. Every command can be either applied to a single device or a group of devices. Commands that run on a group of devices repeat the command for every device.

       - Single device commands:
           - config: Read/write configuration variables (e.g., IP address)
           - probe: reads extended information about the USRP - Multi device commands:
           - update: Update binaries (e.g., FPGA image)
           - reset: Reset the specified subcomponent(s) of the USRP
           - find: finds all available USRPs in this network

OPTIONS
       The options are not always mandatory. It depends on the given COMMAND.

find command
       The find command takes no further options. If ID is not given it scans the system for available, supported devices and prints a list  of  discovered  devices.   The  print  out  is  compatible  to
       uhd_find_devices.  ID can be used to narrow down the list of discovered devices.

probe command
       Print a complete property tree:
              -tree

       The probe command can only be applied to a single device so make sure that
              ID identifies exactly one device. Without arguments it displays detailed information about the device such as name, serial, revision numbers, firmware version sensor information on attached
              motherboard and daughterboards.

reset command
       Reset MPM:
              -mpm

       The reset command resets specified subcomponents of a device. If ID is not
              given, it scans the system for available, supported devices and resets the specified subcomponent of all discovered devices.

EXAMPLES
       usrpctl find
               find all supported devices

       usrpctl type=x300,product=X310 find
               find all x310 devices

       usrpctl name=my_usrp find
               find a device named my_usrp

       usrpctl addr=192.168.10.2 find
               find a device with the given IP.

       usrpctl addr=192.168.10.2 probe
               display device information for USRP with the given ID

       usprctl name=my_usrp probe -tree
               display property tree of device with the name my_usrp

       usrpctl addr=192.168.10.2 reset -mpm
               Resets MPM on the device with the given IP.
