NAME
       updatenews - post articles from outgoing spool directory and prefetch newsgroups

SYNOPSIS
       updatenews [ -h ] [ -v ] [ -a ] [ -g ] [ -o ] [ -l ] [ -w # ]

DESCRIPTION
       Updatenews   submits   all  those  articles  that have been stored within NewsCache's outgoing-queue. If necessary the ActiveDB will be updated (see the -a option to force the update). Afterwards  re‐
       trieves all the articles from the newsgroups listed in the PrefetchFile (This can be configured in newscache.conf).

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       -a, --active
              Force the prefetch the active data base. Updatenews first invalidate the ActiveDB to force the update.

       -g, --group
              Prefetch whole newsgroups.

       -o, --over
              Only prefetch the overview database.

       -l, --lock-group
              Always  lock  the newsgroup while prefetching it. This improves the performance of update- news slightly, but nobody else can read this newsgroup while prefetching.
