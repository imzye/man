WSDL2H(1)                   General Commands Manual                  WSDL2H(1)

NAME
       wsdl2h - the gSOAP WSDL/WADL/XSD processor for C and C++

SYNOPSIS
       wsdl2h [OPTIONS] SOURCE ...

DESCRIPTION
       Please see /usr/share/doc/gsoap-doc/soapdoc2.html for details.

       Converts a WSDL or XSD input file, or from an HTTP address, SOURCE to a
       declaration file that can be parsed by soapcpp2(1). If no SOURCE  argu‐
       ment is specified, read from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -a     Generate  indexed struct names for local elements with anonymous
              types.

       -b     Bi-directional operations (duplex ops) added  to  serve  one-way
              responses.

       -c     Generate C source code.

       -c++   Generate C++ source code (default).

       -c++11 Generate C++11 source code.

       -D     Make  attribute  members with default/fixed values optional with
              pointers.

       -d     Use DOM to populate xs:any, xs:anyType and xs:anyAttribute.

       -e     Do not qualify enum names.

       -F     Add transient members to structs to simulate struct-type deriva‐
              tion in C.

       -f     Generate flat C++ class hierarchy by removing inheritance.

       -g     Generate global top-level element and attribute declarations.

       -h     Display help info and exit.

       -Ipath Use path to locate WSDL and XSD files.

       -i     Do not import (advanced option).

       -j     Do  not  generate  SOAP_ENV__Header and SOAP_ENV__Detail defini‐
              tions.

       -k     Do not generate SOAP_ENV__Header mustUnderstand qualifiers.

       -L     Generate less documentation by removing generic @note comments.

       -l     Display license information.

       -M     Suppress     error     "must     understand     element     with
              wsdl:required='true'".

       -m     Use xsd.h module to import primitive types.

       -Nname Use  name  for  service  prefixes  to produce a service for each
              binding.

       -nname Use name as the base namespace prefix instead of ns.

       -O1    Optimize by omitting duplicate choice/sequence members.

       -O2    Optimize -O1 and omit  unused  schema  types  (unreachable  from
              roots).

       -O3    Optimize -O2 and omit unused schema root attributes.

       -O4    Optimize -O3 and omit unused schema root elements (use only with
              WSDLs).

       -Ow2   Optimize -O2 while retaining all  derived  types  of  used  base
              types.

       -Ow3   Optimize  -O3  while  retaining  all  derived types of used base
              types.

       -Ow4   Optimize -O4 while retaining all  derived  types  of  used  base
              types.

       -ofile Output to file file.

       -P     Do not create polymorphic types inherited from xsd__anyType.

       -p     Create polymorphic types inherited from base xsd__anyType.

       -Q     Make xsd__anySimpleType equal to xsd__anyType to use as the base
              type.

       -qname Use name for the C++ namespace of all declarations.

       -R     Generate REST operations for REST bindings specified in a WSDL.

       -rhost[:port[:uid:pwd]]
              Connect via proxy host, port and proxy credentials uid and pwd.

       -r:uid:pwd
              Connect with authentication credentials uid and pwd.

       -Sname Use name instead of soap for the C++  class  members  with  soap
              contexts.

       -s     Do not generate STL code (no std::string and no std::vector).

       -tfile Use type map file file instead of the default file typemap.dat.

       -U     Allow  UTF-8-encoded  Unicode C/C++ identifiers when mapping XML
              tag names.

       -u     Do not generate unions.

       -V     Display the current version and exit.

       -v     Verbose output.

       -W     Suppress warnings.

       -w     Always wrap response parameters in a  response  struct  (<=1.1.4
              behavior).

       -X     Do  not  qualify part names to disambiguate doc/lit wrapped pat‐
              terns.

       -x     Do not generate _XML any/anyAttribute extensibility elements.

       -y     Generate typedef synonyms for structs and enums.

       -z2    Compatibility with 2.7.7 to  2.7.15:  Qualify  element/attribute
              references.

       -z3    Compatibility  with  2.7.16  to 2.8.7: Qualify element/attribute
              references.

              doc/lit wrapped patterns.
