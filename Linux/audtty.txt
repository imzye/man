NAME
       audtty - Control Audacious from the command line with a friendly ncurses interface

SYNOPSIS
       audtty [<-|+>ahlntV] [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       audtty is a simple application for controlling Audacious from the command line.  It is designed to make common, simple tasks fast and easy to do. It is operated using arrow keys and standard Auda‐
       cious keys, to make it easy and intuitive to learn.

OPTIONS
       To negate a short option, use '+' instead of '-' (e.g.  +a).
       Long-options are negated with no-, (e.g.  --no-read-all).

       The keys for basic control are as follows:
              +-----------------------+
              |     <<  >  || o  >>   |
              +-----------------------+
                     z  x  c  v  b

       -a, --read-all
              Read all titles and lengths on startup (EXTREMELY SLOW) (default off).

       -h, --help
              Print help message.

       -l, --length
              Show length of track in playlist (SLOW) (default on).

       -n, --numbers
              Show numbers in playlist (default on).

       -t, --title
              Read the title from ID3/ogg-tags (SLOW) (default on).

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

       Tip: Things going slow? Try audtty -ntl

       a or A Will add selected file or directory to the playlist.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       /etc/audtty.conf
              Global configuration file.

       $HOME/.audtty.conf
              Local configuration file, specific for each user. Can be used to override the global options.

       The syntax of the configuration files are long options without the '--', one on each line.

       Example:
              numbers
              title
              length no-read-all

BUGS
       The xmms remote controlling library provides no good way of detecting changes in the playlist, and therefore audtty might need to be told to reload the playlist if songs are moved. Do so by press‐
       ing L.  If the length of the playlist changes, audtty will assume the playlist has changed and reload the entire playlist to make sure it is correct.

       Probably lots more.
