NAME
       dbench - Measure disk throughput for simulated netbench run

SYNOPSIS
       dbench [options]numclients
       tbench [options]numclientsserver tbench_srv [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the dbench and tbench benchmarks.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  How‐
       ever, it has fairly easy to read source code.

       Netbench is a terrible benchmark, but it's an "industry standard" and it's what is used in the press to rate windows fileservers like Samba and WindowsNT.
       Given the requirements of running netbench (60 and 150 Windows PCs all on switched fast ethernet and a really grunty server, and a to open up netbench to the masses.
       Both dbench and tbench read a load description file called client.txt that was derived from a capture of a real netbench run. client.txt is about 25MB and describes the 500 thousand operations that  a
       netbench client does in a typical netbench run. They parse client.txt and use it to produce the same load without having to buy a huge lab.
       dbench produces only the filesystem load. It does all the same IO calls that the smbd server in Samba would produce when confronted with a netbench run. It does no networking calls.
       tbench produces only the TCP and process load. It does the same socket calls that smbd would do under a netbench load. It does no filesystem calls. The idea behind tbench is to eliminate smbd from the
       netbench test, as though the smbd code could be made infinately fast.

OPTIONS
       The dbench program takes a number, which indicates the number of clients to run simultaneously.  It can also take the following options:

       -c client.txt
              Use this as the full path name of the client.txt file (the default is /usr/share/dbench/client.txt).

       -s     Use synchronous file IO on all file operations.

       -t TIME
              set the runtime of the benchmark in seconds (default 600)

       -D DIR set the base directory to run the filesystem operations in

       -x     enable xattr support, simulating the xattr operations Samba4 would need to perform to run the load

       -S     Use synchronous IO for all directory operations (unlink, rmdir, mkdir and rename).
              The tbench program takes a number, which indicates the number of clients to run simultaneously, and a server name: tbench_srv should be invoked on that server before  invoking  tbench.   tbench
              can also take the following options:

       -c loadfile
              Use this as the full path name of the client.txt file (the default is /usr/share/dbench/client.txt).

       -T option[,...]
              This  sets  the  socket  options for the connection to the server.  The options are a comma-separated list of one or more of the following: SO_KEEPALIVE, SO_REUSEADDR, SO_BROADCAST, SO_NODELAY,
              SO_LOWDELAY, SO_THROUGHPUT, SO_SNDBUF=number, SO_RCVBUF=number, SO_SNDLOWAT=number, SO_RCVLOWAT=number,  SO_SNDTIMEO=number,and  SO_RCVTIMEO=number.   See  socket(7)  for  details  about  these
              options.
              The tbench_srv can only take one option: -t option[,...]  as documented above.
