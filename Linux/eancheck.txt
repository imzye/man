NAME
       eancheck - check digit validator for EAN, PLU and UPC barcode numbers

SYNOPSIS
       eancheck [EAN code, PLU code or UPC prefixed with 0]

DESCRIPTION
       eancheck  takes a 13 digit EAN (European Article Number, aka a barcode number) or a 4 digit PLU code and runs some simple maths upon it to discover the "check digit". It then compares this against
       the last number of the inputted EAN to check whether that code; if they match, then the EAN/PLU is valid. If they do not, then the opposite applies.

BUGS
       Right now UPC codes need to be prefixed with a zero (i.e turned into EAN codes) to be properly checked.
