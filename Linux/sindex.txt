NAME
       sindex - index a sequence database for sfetch

SYNOPSIS
       sindex [options] seqfile1 [seqfile2...]

DESCRIPTION
       sindex  indexes  one or more seqfiles for future sequence retrievals by sfetch.  An SSI ("squid sequence index") file is created in the same directory with the sequence files. By default, this file is
       called <seqfile>.ssi.

       If there is more than one sequence file on the command line, the SSI filename will be constructed from the last sequence file name. This may not be what you want; see the -o option to specify your own
       name for the SSI file.

       sindex is capable of indexing large files (>2 GB) if optional LFS support has been enabled at compile-time. See INSTALL instructions that came with @PACKAGE@.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print brief help; includes version number and summary of all options, including expert options.

       -o <ssi outfile>
              Direct the SSI index to a file named <outfile>.  By default, the SSI file would go to <seqfile>.ssi.

EXPERT OPTIONS
       --64   Force the SSI file into 64-bit (large seqfile) mode, even if the seqfile is small. You don't want to do this unless you're debugging.

       --external
              Force sindex to do its record sorting by external (on-disk) sorting. This is only useful for debugging, too.

       --informat <s>
              Specify  that  the sequence file is definitely in format <s>; blocks sequence file format autodetection. This is useful in automated pipelines, because it improves robustness (autodetection can
              occasionally go wrong on a perversely malformed file). Common examples include genbank, embl, gcg, pir, stockholm, clustal, msf, or phylip; see the printed documentation for a complete list  of
              accepted format names.

       --pfamseq
              A  hack  for Pfam; indexes a FASTA file that is known to have identifier lines in format ">[name] [accession] [optional description]". Normally only the sequence name would be indexed as a pri‐
              mary key in a FASTA SSI file, but this allows indexing both the name (as a primary key) and accession (as a secondary key).
