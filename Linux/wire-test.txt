WIRE-TEST(8)                System Manager's Manual               WIRE-TEST(8)

NAME
       wire-test - test your network interfaces and local IP address

SYNOPSIS
       wire-test [ host ]

DESCRIPTION
       wire-test is used to find out what amd thinks are the first two network
       interfaces and network names/numbers used, as well as  the  IP  address
       used for amd to NFS-mount itself.

       If host is specified, then wire-test will test for the working combina‐
       tions of NFS protocol and version from the current client  to  the  NFS
       server host.  If not specified, host defaults to "localhost".

SEE ALSO
