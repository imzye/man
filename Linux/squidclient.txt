DESCRIPTION
       squidclient  is  a tool providing a command line interface for retrieving URLs.  Designed for testing any HTTP 0.9, 1.0, or 1.1 web server or proxy.  This tool can be combined with scripts to per‐
       form any basic HTTP operation.  Some additional features for access to the squid proxy object cache and management information are provided.

OPTIONS
       -a          Do NOT include Accept: header.

       -A 'string' Send string as User-Agent: header. To omit the header completely set string to empty ('').

       -h | --host host
                   Retrieve URL from server host.  Default is localhost

       -H 'string' Extra headers to send. Use '\n' for new lines.

       -i time     If-Modified-Since time (in Epoch seconds).

       -j hosthdr  Host header content

       -k          Keep the connection active. Default is to do only one request then close.

       -l | --local host
                   Specify a local IP address to bind to.  Default is none.

       -m method   Request method, default is GET.  Squid also supports a non-standard method called PURGE.  You can use that to purge a specific URL from the cache.  You need to have purge access  setup
                   in squid.conf similar to manager access. Here is an example:
                   acl purge method PURGE
                   http_access deny purge !localhost

       -n          Proxy Negotiate(Kerberos) authentication.
                   Use kinit username@DOMAIN first to get initial TGS.

       -N          WWW Negotiate(Kerberos) authentication.
                   Use kinit username@DOMAIN first to get initial TGS.

       -p port     Port number of cache.  Default is 3128.

       -P file     Request body. Using the named file as data.

       -r          Force cache to reload URL.

       -s          Silent.  Do not print data to stdout.

       -t count    Trace count HTTP relay or proxy hops

       -T timeout  Timeout value (seconds) for read/write operations.

       -u user     Proxy authentication username

       -U user     WWW authentication username

       -v          Verbose. Print outgoing message to stderr.

       -V version  HTTP Version. Use '-' for HTTP/0.9 omitted case

       -w password Proxy authentication password

       -W password WWW authentication password

       --https     Use Transport Layer Security on the HTTP connection.

       --anonymous-tls
                   Use TLS with unauthenticated (anonymous) certificate.

       --cert file File containing client X.509 certificate in PEM format.  May be repeated to load several client certificates.

       --trusted-ca file
                   File containing trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates in PEM format.  May be repeated to load any number of files.

       --params values
                   TLS  library  specific  parameters  for  the  communication  session.  See the library documentation for details on valid parameters.  GnuTLS: http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Prior‐

       --ping [options]
                   Enable ping mode. Optional -g and -I parameters must follow immediately if used.  Repeated use resets to default ping settings.

       -g count    Ping mode, perform count iterations (default is to loop until interrupted).

       -I interval Ping interval in seconds (default 1 second).
