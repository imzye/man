NAME
       ospd-openvas - The OpenVAS Wrapper of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management

SYNOPSIS
       ospd-openvas [-v] [-h]  [-c config-file] [--log-file log-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Greenbone  Vulnerability Management (GVM) is a vulnerability auditing and management framework made up of several modules.  The OSPD OpenVAS Wrapper, ospd-openvas is in charge of the communication
       between the scanner OpenVAS and the clients (GVMd and gvm-tools).

       ospd-openvas inspects the remote hosts to list all the vulnerabilities and common misconfigurations that affects them.

       It is a command line tool with parameters to start a daemon which keeps waiting for instructions to update the feed of vulnerability tests and
        to start a scan.  The second part of the interface is the redis store where the parameters about a scan task need to be placed and from where the results can be retrieved, being the unique commu‐
       nication channel between OSPD-OpenVAS and OpenVAS.

OPTIONS
       -s <config-file>, --config-file<config-file>
              Use the alternate configuration file instead of ~/.config/ospd.conf

              TCP Port to listen on. Default: 0

       -b ADDRESS, --bind-address ADDRESS
              Address to listen on. Default: 0.0.0.0

       -u UNIX_SOCKET, --unix-socket UNIX_SOCKET
              Unix file socket to listen on. Default: /var/run/ospd/ospd.sock

       -c CERT_FILE, --cert-file CERT_FILE
              Server cert file. Default: /usr/var/lib/gvm/CA/servercert.pem

       --ca-file CA_FILE
              CA cert file. Default: /usr/var/lib/gvm/CA/cacert.pem

       -L LOG_LEVEL, --log-level LOG_LEVEL
              Desired level of logging. Default: WARNING

       -f, --foreground
              Run in foreground and logs all messages to console.

       -l LOG_FILE, --log-file LOG_FILE
              Path to the logging file.

       --stream-timeout TIMEOUT
              Set a timeout on socket operations. Default 10 seconds

       --niceness NICENESS
              Start the scan with the given niceness. Default 10

       --scaninfo-store-time TIME
              Time in hours a scan is stored before being considered forgotten and being delete from the scan table. Default 0, disabled.

       --max-scans VALUE
              Max. amount of parallel task that can be started. Default 0, disabled.

       --min-free-mem-scan-queue MB
              Minimum free memory in MB required to run the scan. If no enough free memory is available, the scan is queued. Default 0, disabled.

       --max-queued-scans VALUE
              Maximum number allowed of queued scans before starting to reject new scans.  Default 0, disabled.

THE CONFIGURATION FILE
       The default ospd-openvas configuration file, ~/.config/ospd.conf contains these options under the section [OSPD - openvas]:

       log_level
              Wished level of logging.

       socket_mode
              This option defines the permissions on a socket.  It must be set in octal format. E.g. socket_mode = 0o770

       unix_socket
              This option specifies the socket path.

       pid_file
              Location of the file for the process ID.

       log_file
              Path to the log file. If no log file is given, the system log facility is used by default.

       foreground
              If this option is set to yes, the daemon logs to the standard output instead of logging to a file or syslog.

       niceness
              Start the scan with the given niceness. Default 10

       stream_timeout
              Set a timeout on socket operations. Default 10 seconds

       scaninfo_store_time
              Time in hours a scan is stored before being considered forgotten and being delete from the scan table. Default 0, disabled.

       max_scans
              Max. amount of parallel task that can be started. Default 0, disabled.

       min_free_mem_scan_queue
              Minimum free memory in MB required to run the scan. If no enough free memory is available, the scan is queued. Default 0, disabled.

       max_queued_scans
              Maximum number allowed of queued scans before starting to reject new scans.  Default 0, disabled.
