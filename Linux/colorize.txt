COLORIZE(1)                                                                                    User Commands                                                                                    COLORIZE(1)

NAME
       colorize - colorize text on terminal with ANSI escape sequences

SYNOPSIS
       colorize [option]... (foreground) [-|file]

       colorize [option]... (foreground)/(background) [-|file]

       colorize --clean[-all] [-|file]

       colorize -hV

DESCRIPTION
       Colorizes text read from standard input stream or file by using ANSI escape sequences (and also vice versa, i.e. cleaning text from sequences) and prints resulting output to the terminal.

       When  colorizing  text, (foreground) and eventually (background) may be either one of following color values: none, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, default or random.  First
       character of color name in upper case denotes increased intensity, whereas for lower case colors will be of normal intensity.  If "none" is chosen, no escape sequences will be emitted.

       Color escape sequences are added per each line, hence colored lines can be safely extracted.

       When de-colorizing text, --clean omits color escape sequences which were emitted by colorize (see NOTES for list),  whereas  --clean-all  omits  all  valid  ones.   If  in  doubt,  consider  using
       --clean-all.

OPTIONS
       --attr=ATTR1,ATTR2,...
              set attributes by name
              Attributes: bold, underscore, blink, reverse and concealed.

       --clean
              clean text from color escape sequences emitted by colorize

       --clean-all
              clean text from all valid color escape sequences

       -c, --config=PATH
              alternate configuration file location

       --exclude-random=COLOR
              text color to be excluded when selecting a random foreground color

       --omit-color-empty
              omit printing color escape sequences for empty lines

       -h, --help
              show help screen and exit

       -V, --version
              display version data and exit

FILES
       ~/.colorize.conf
              user configuration file

              If  the  aforementioned  file exists, it is read, parsed and processed prior to handling the command-line options.  Command-line options override configuration values, but are currently not
              capable of unsetting them.  If unsetting is desired, comment them out or remove them.

              Sample configuration file
                     # ~/.colorize.conf
                     attr = bold,underscore
                     color = magenta # favorite one
                     exclude-random = black
                     omit-color-empty = yes

              Configurable options and values
                     attr             (values same as command-line option)
                     color            (value  same as command-line colors)
                     exclude-random   (value  same as command-line option)
                     omit-color-empty (yes/no)

              Syntax
                     Each line ought to start with a name of an option, followed by = and an optional value.  Leaving the value blank, unsets the option.

                     Whitespace is allowed before the option name, after the option name, before the option value and after the option value.

                     Comments may be placed before or after the option is set.  Everything following the '#' sign is treated as being commented out.

NOTES
       The list of color escape sequence codes being emitted and omitted is as follows:

       *   30-37,39 (foreground colors)

       *   1-9;30-37,39 (foreground colors with attributes)

       *   40-47,49 (background colors)

       *   0 (reset)

EXAMPLES
       $ colorize green /etc/motd
              Print file /etc/motd with green as foreground color

       $ colorize green/black /etc/motd
              Print file /etc/motd with green as foreground and black as background color

       $ colorize green /etc/motd | colorize --clean
              Print input from stdin with color escape sequences omitted

       $ git log -1 -p --color | colorize --clean-all
              Print input from stdin with all color escape sequences omitted

       $ colorize --attr=bold green /etc/motd
              Print file /etc/motd with bold green as foreground color
