NAME
       pdfcube - a PDF presentation viewer with 3D effects.

SYNOPSIS
       pdfcube [FILE] [--help] [--bgcolor f:f:f] [--top-color f:f:f] [--no-fullscreen] [--demo] [--program n:x:n:x:...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfcube(1) is a tiny (about 30KiB) viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files that adds spinning cube transition effect to your PDF presentation files. It can also zoom on 5 predefined areas with
       a smooth zooming effect. This program is suited only for landscape PDF files, mostly presentations done with LaTeX (Beamer, Prosper, etc.) or OpenOffice.org Impress.

       If FILE is not given a file-open dialog box is shown to the user.

       pdfcube(1) is an open source, low-effort, spare-time, money-less project. Your help is welcome!

OPTIONS
       -h [ --help ]
              This help message.

       -v [ --version ]
              Version information

       -b [ --bgcolor ] arg
              Background color is 'r:g:b' with real values between 0.0 and 1.0, no spaces.

       -t [ --top-color ] arg
              Cube top color in 'r:g:b' format again with reals in [0,1].

       -n [ --no-fullscreen ]
              Don't activate full-screen mode by default.

       --demo Automatically auto-advance presentation based on the
              frame duration PDF attribute (\transduration when using Latex Beamer) or the specified program (see the --program option).

       --program A program in the form
              n:x:n:x:n:x... where n are durations in seconds and "x" can be either "c" for cube transition and "p" for plain transition. (e.g. --program 5:c:3:p). The last program is used for all  remaining
              slides.

   Notes
       The first (and only) non-option string is treated as the input file.

INTERACTIVE CONTROL
       c, a   Will display the next/previous page with a cube transition effect.

       SPACE, PG-DOWN
              Will switch to the next page with the programmed effect.

       h, j, k, l, z
              Will zoom into the predefined areas.

       g      Will undo any zoom.

       ESC, Ctrl-q
              Will exit pdfcube immediately.

              Will quick-switch to the previous page.

       Right-Arrow
              Will quick-switch to the next page.

       f      Will toggle full-screen mode.

       t      Will toggle auto-advance (demo) mode.

       Ctrl-l Will redraw the screen.

       Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2, ..., Ctrl-9
              Will jump to the page corresponding to the n-th programmed transition (if any).

       1, 2, ..., 9
              Will jump to page 5*(n-1).

CONFIGURATION FILE
       If the ~/.pdfcuberc file exists, it is used as a configuration file. The configuration file uses the same options as the command line (using the boost program options syntax). e.g.

              demo=true
              bgcolor=0:0:0
              program=5:p

EXAMPLES
       pdfcube foo.pdf
              Will display 'foo.pdf' in full-screen.

       pdfcube --demo --program 5:c foo.pdf
              Will display 'foo.pdf' in full-screen and will do a cube transition every 5 seconds.

       pdfcube foo.pdf --bgcolor 0:0:0 --top-color 0.6:0.2:0.2
              Will display 'foo.pdf' with custom background and cube color.

BUGS
       On some systems color values are locale dependent (e.g. you may have to write 0,6 instead of 0.6)
