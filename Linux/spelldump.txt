NAME
       spelldump - Sphinxsearch tool for extract the contents of a dictionary file.

SYNOPSIS
       spelldump [OPTIONS] dictionary affix [result] [locale-name]

DESCRIPTION
       Sphinx is a collection of programs that aim to provide high quality fulltext search.

       spelldump is used to extract the contents of a dictionary file that uses ispell or MySpell format, which can help build word lists for wordforms - all of the possible forms are pre-built for you.

       The two main parameters are the dictionary's main file and its affix file; usually these are named as [language-prefix].dict and [language-prefix].aff and will be available with most common Linux
       distributions, as well as various places online.  [result] specifies where the dictionary data should be output to, and [locale-name] additionally specifies the locale details you wish to use.

       Examples of its usage are:

           spelldump en.dict en.aff
           spelldump ru.dict ru.aff ru.txt ru_RU.CP1251
           spelldump ru.dict ru.aff ru.txt .1251

       The results file will contain a list of all the words in the dictionary in alphabetical order, output in the format of a wordforms file, which you can use to customise for your specific circumstances.

       An example of the result file:

           zone > zone
           zoned > zoned
           zoning > zoning

OPTIONS
       -c [FILE]
           specifies a file for case conversion details.
