NAME
       pammosaicknit - validate a mosaic knitting pattern

SYNOPSIS
       pammosaicknit [in_netpbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pammosaicknit   helps   the   user   create  mosaic  knitting  patterns
       ⟨http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip-stitch_knitting#Mosaic_knitting⟩   .
       The  program  inputs  a  black-and-white  Netpbm image that describes a
       mosaic knitting pattern and outputs a color Netpbm image  of  the  same
       pattern but with invalid runs shown in red.

       A  valid  knitting  pattern starts with a "black" row on the bottom and
       alternates "white" and "black" rows. A  "black"  row  can  contain  any
       arrangement  of  black  pixels but no more than three consecutive white
       pixels. A "white" row can contain any arrangement of white  pixels  but
       no more than three consecutive black pixels. Columns wrap horizontally,
       so a "white" row that both begins and ends with  two  black  pixels  is
       deemed  to  contain  four  consecutive black pixels. Because this is an
       invalid number for a "white" row, those four pixels will  be  recolored
       red in the output image.

       For clarity, there are two shades of red in the output image.  Dark red
       pixels indicate pixels that were black in the  input  image  but  which
       must contain one or more white pixels. Light red pixels indicate pixels
       that were white in the input image but which must contain one  or  more
       black pixels.

       If the output image contains no red pixels, then the input image repre‐
       sents a valid mosaic knitting pattern.

ARGUMENTS
       pammosaicknit's only argument, in_netpbmfile, is the name of  an  image
       file  that  represents  a mosaic knitting pattern. If you don't specify
       in_netpbmfile, the program reads the image from Standard Input.

NOTES
       If the input image is not a black-and-white image,  pammosaicknit  con‐
       verts  it  internally  to  black and white by thresholding each pixel's
       luminosity. The output image is always a color image containing at most
       four colors (black, white, dark red, light red).
