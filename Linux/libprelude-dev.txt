NAME
       libprelude-config - helper script for building with libprelude

SYNOPSIS
       libprelude-config [options]

DESCRIPTION
       libprelude-config is a simple shell script used to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the libprelude library.

OPTIONS
       --prefix=dir   If  specified,  use  dir instead of the installation prefix that the library was built with, when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be
                      specified before any --libs or --cflags options. This option is also used for the exec prefix if the --exec-prefix option is not specified.
       --exec-prefix=dir
                      If specified, use dir instead of the exec installation prefix that the library was built with, when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This  option  must
                      be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.
       --config-prefix
                      Print the directory prefix where libprelude configuration is installed on the standard output.
       --version      Print the currently installed version of the library on the standard output.
       --c++          If specified, indicate that the linkage will be done with a C++ library
       --libs         Print the linker flags that are necessary to link with the specified library.
       --ldflags      Print the LDflags that are necessary to compile a program using the specified library.
       --cflags       Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program using the specified library.
       --pthread-cflags
                      Print the pthread compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program using the specified library.
