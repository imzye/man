NAME
       rt-shredder - Utility to wipe out data from your RT database

SYNOPSIS
         rt-shredder --plugin list
         rt-shredder --plugin help-Tickets
         rt-shredder --plugin 'Tickets=query,Queue="general" and Status="deleted"'

         rt-shredder --sqldump unshred.sql --plugin ...
         rt-shredder --force --plugin ...

DESCRIPTION
       rt-shredder wipes out objects from your RT database. This script uses an API that the RT::Shredder module adds to RT.  This script can also be used as example of usage of the shredder API.

USAGE
       You can use several options to control which objects rt-shredder should wipe out.

       When using other options, the --plugin option must be provided last.

OPTIONS
   --sqldump <filename>
       Outputs INSERT queries into a file for all shredded records.  This dump can be used to restore data after wiping out.

       By default rt-shredder creates files named <ISO_date>-XXXX.sql in the current directory.

   --no-sqldump
       Don't generate the SQL dump file.

       The SQL dump file provides you with a way to "undo" the removal of records from your RT database, if needed. Use this option only if you are sure you have a recent, valid database backup in case you
       need to recover data that may have been shredded in error.

   --object (DEPRECATED)
       Option has been deprecated, use plugin "Objects" instead.

   --plugin '<plugin name>[=<arg>,<val>[;<arg>,<val>]...]'
       You can use plugins to select RT objects with various conditions.  See also --plugin list and --plugin help options.

   --plugin list
       Output list of the available plugins.

   --plugin help-<plugin name>
       Outputs help for specified plugin.

   --force
       Don't prompt with questions before shredding objects.
