NAME
       pw-profiler - The PipeWire profiler

SYNOPSIS
       pw-profiler [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Start profiling a PipeWire instance.

       If  the  server has the profiler module loaded, this program will connect to it and log the profiler data. Profiler data contains times and durations when processing nodes and devices started and com‐
       pleted.

       When this program is stopped, a set of gnuplot files and a script to generate SVG files from the .plot files is generated, along with a .html file to visualize the profiling results in a browser.

OPTIONS
       -r | --remote=NAME

       --version

       -o | --output=FILE
