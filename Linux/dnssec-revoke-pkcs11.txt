DNSSEC-REVOKE(8)                    BIND 9                    DNSSEC-REVOKE(8)

NAME
       dnssec-revoke - set the REVOKED bit on a DNSSEC key

SYNOPSIS
       dnssec-revoke  [-hr]  [-v  level]  [-V] [-K directory] [-E engine] [-f]
       [-R] {keyfile}

DESCRIPTION
       dnssec-revoke reads a DNSSEC key file, sets the REVOKED bit on the  key
       as  defined in RFC 5011, and creates a new pair of key files containing
       the now-revoked key.

OPTIONS
       -h     This option emits a usage message and exits.

       -K directory
              This option sets the directory in which the key files are to re‐
              side.

       -r     This  option indicates to remove the original keyset files after
              writing the new keyset files.

       -v level
              This option sets the debugging level.

       -V     This option prints version information.

       -E engine
              This option specifies the cryptographic hardware  to  use,  when
              applicable.

              When  BIND  9 is built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the
              OpenSSL engine identifier that drives the cryptographic acceler‐
              ator  or  hardware service module (usually pkcs11). When BIND is
              built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (--enable-native-pkcs11),
              it  defaults  to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library speci‐
              fied via --with-pkcs11.

       -f     This option indicates a forced overwrite and  causes  dnssec-re‐
              voke  to  write  the new key pair, even if a file already exists
              matching the algorithm and key ID of the revoked key.

       -R     This option prints the key tag of the key with  the  REVOKE  bit
              set, but does not revoke the key.
