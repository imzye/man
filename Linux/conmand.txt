CONMAND(8)                ConMan: The Console Manager               CONMAND(8)

NAME
       conmand - ConMan daemon

SYNOPSIS
       conmand [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       conmand  is the daemon responsible for managing consoles defined by its
       configuration file as well as listening for connections from clients.

OPTIONS
       -c file
              Specify a configuration file, overriding  the  default  location
              [/etc/conman.conf].

       -F     Run the daemon in the foreground.

       -h     Display a summary of the command-line options.

       -k     Send a SIGTERM to the conmand process associated with the speci‐
              fied configuration, thereby killing the daemon.   Returns  0  if
              the daemon was successfully signaled; otherwise, returns 1.

       -L     Display license information.

       -p port
              Specify the port on which conmand will listen for clients, over‐
              riding both the default port [7890] and the  port  specified  in
              the configuration file.

       -P file
              Specify  the  PID  file for storing the daemon's PID, overriding
              the "server pidfile" directive in the configuration file.

       -q     Displays the PID of the  conmand  process  associated  with  the
              specified  configuration if it appears active.  Returns 0 if the
              configuration appears active; otherwise, returns 1.

       -r     Send a SIGHUP to the conmand process associated with the  speci‐
              fied  configuration,  thereby  re-opening both that daemon's log
              file and individual console log files.  Returns 0 if the  daemon
              was successfully signaled; otherwise, returns 1.

       -v     Enable verbose mode.

       -V     Display version information.

       -z     Truncate  both  the daemon's log file and individual console log
              files at start-up.

SIGNALS
       SIGHUP      Close and re-open both the daemon's log file and the  indi‐
                   vidual  console  log  files.   Conversion specifiers within
                   filenames will be re-evaluated.  This is useful for  logro‐
                   tate configurations.

       SIGTERM     Terminate the daemon.

SECURITY
       Connections to the server are not authenticated, and communications be‐
       tween client and server are not encrypted.  Until this is addressed  in
       a  future  release,  the  recommendation is to bind the server's listen
       socket to the loopback address (by specifying "server  loopback=on"  in
       conman.conf) and restrict access to the server host.

NOTES
       Log  messages  are sent to standard-error until after the configuration
       file has been read, at which time future messages are discarded  unless
       either  the  logfile  or  syslog  keyword has been specified (cf., con‐
       man.conf(5)).

       If the configuration file is modified while the daemon is running and a
       pidfile  was not originally specified, the '-k' and '-r' options may be
       unable to identify the daemon process;  consequently,  the  appropriate
       signal may need to be sent to the daemon manually.

       The number of consoles that can be simultaneously managed is limited by
       the maximum number of file descriptors a process can  have  open.   The
       daemon  sets its "nofile" soft limit to the maximum/hard limit.  If you
       are encountering "too many open files" errors, you may need to increase
       the "nofile" hard limit.
