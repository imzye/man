NAME
       slack.conf - configuration file for slack

DESCRIPTION
       The  file  /etc/slack.conf  contains  configuration  information for slack(8) and its backends.  It should contain one keyword-value pair per line, separated by an '=' sign.  Keywords must consist
       solely of capital letters and underscores.  Values may take any appropriate format, but must not begin with a space.  Comments start with '#', and all text from the '#' to the end of a line is ig‐
       nored.  Trailing whitespace on lines is ignored.  Empty lines or lines consisting of only whitespace and comments are ignored.

       Valid keywords are:

       SOURCE The master source for slack roles.  It can be in one of four forms:

              •      /path/to/dir

                     Use a local directory.

              •      somehost:/path/to/dir

                     Use given directory on a remote host via rsync over SSH.

              •      rsync://somehost/module

                     Use module on a remote rsyncd server (directly over the network).

              •      somehost::module

                     Use the rsync daemon protocol over SSH to the given host.  See “USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION” in rsync(1)

              All forms of SOURCE are passed directly to rsync, so you can do things like add “user@” before the host on any remote forms.  For more about what rsync can  do,  see  its  manual  page,  of
              course.

              For  the  last  form,  however,  we do a little magic.  rsync treats the last two forms equivalently, so we overload the last form by automatically passing “-e ssh” to rsync when we see it.
              This hack lets us tell slack to use this nice feature of rsync just using the SOURCE config option.

       ROOT   The root filesystem into which to install slack roles.  Usually '/'.

       ROLE_LIST
              The location of the role list, which lists the roles to be installed by default on each host.

              This can be a path relative to the source, or can be an entirely separate location if it starts with a slash or a hostname (optionally preceeded by user@).

       CACHE  A local cache directory, used as a local mirror of the SOURCE.

       STAGE  A local staging directory, used as an intermediate stage when installing files.

       BACKUP_DIR
              A directory in which to keep dated backups for rollbacks.

EXAMPLE
       A typical file might look like this:

         # slack.conf configuration file
         SOURCE=slack-master:/slack  # source is on a remote
                                     # host named "slack-master"
         ROLE_LIST=slack-master:/roles.conf
         ROOT=/
         CACHE=/var/cache/slack
         STAGE=/var/lib/slack/stage
         BACKUP_DIR=/var/lib/slack/backups

       /etc/slack.conf
