COMMANDS
   add
       add the specified files on the next commit:

       hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.

       The files will be added to the repository at the next commit.  To  undo
       an add before that, see hg forget.

       If  no  names  are given, add all files to the repository (except files
       matching .hgignore).

       Examples:

          · New (unknown) files are added automatically by hg add:

            $ ls
            foo.c
            $ hg status
            ? foo.c
            $ hg add
            adding foo.c
            $ hg status
            A foo.c

          · Specific files to be added can be specified:

            $ ls
            bar.c  foo.c
            $ hg status
            ? bar.c
            ? foo.c
            $ hg add bar.c
            $ hg status
            A bar.c
            ? foo.c

       Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

       Options:

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   addremove
       add all new files, delete all missing files:

       hg addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Add all new files and remove all missing files from the repository.

       Unless names are given, new files are ignored if they match any of  the
       patterns  in  .hgignore.  As with add, these changes take effect at the
       next commit.

       Use the -s/--similarity option to detect  renamed  files.  This  option
       takes  a percentage between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must be identi‐
       cal) as its parameter. With a parameter greater than 0,  this  compares
       every  removed  file  with  every  added file and records those similar
       enough as renames. Detecting renamed files this way can  be  expensive.
       After  using this option, hg status -C can be used to check which files
       were identified as moved or renamed. If not specified,  -s/--similarity
       defaults to 100 and only renames of identical files are detected.

       Examples:

          · A  number  of  files (bar.c and foo.c) are new, while foobar.c has
            been removed (without using hg remove) from the repository:

            $ ls
            bar.c foo.c
            $ hg status
            ! foobar.c
            ? bar.c
            ? foo.c
            $ hg addremove
            adding bar.c
            adding foo.c
            removing foobar.c
            $ hg status
            A bar.c
            A foo.c
            R foobar.c

          · A file foobar.c was  moved  to  foo.c  without  using  hg  rename.
            Afterwards, it was edited slightly:

            $ ls
            foo.c
            $ hg status
            ! foobar.c
            ? foo.c
            $ hg addremove --similarity 90
            removing foobar.c
            adding foo.c
            recording removal of foobar.c as rename to foo.c (94% similar)
            $ hg status -C
            A foo.c
              foobar.c
            R foobar.c

       Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

       Options:

       -s,--similarity <SIMILARITY>
              guess renamed files by similarity (0<=s<=100)

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   annotate
       show changeset information by line for each file:

       hg annotate [-r REV] [-f] [-a] [-u] [-d] [-n] [-c] [-l] FILE...

       List  changes  in  files,  showing the revision id responsible for each
       line.

       This command is useful for discovering when a change was  made  and  by
       whom.

       If  you  include --file, --user, or --date, the revision number is sup‐
       pressed unless you also include --number.

       Without the -a/--text option, annotate will avoid processing  files  it
       detects  as  binary.  With  -a, annotate will annotate the file anyway,
       although the results will probably be neither useful nor desirable.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions. See also hg help templates.

       lines  List of lines with annotation data.

       path   String. Repository-absolute path of the specified file.

       And  each entry of {lines} provides the following sub-keywords in addi‐
       tion to {date}, {node}, {rev}, {user}, etc.

       line   String. Line content.

       lineno Integer. Line number at that revision.

       path   String. Repository-absolute path of the file at that revision.

       See hg help templates.operators for the list expansion syntax.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              annotate the specified revision

       --follow
              follow copies/renames and list the filename (DEPRECATED)

       --no-follow
              don't follow copies and renames

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -u, --user

              ignore white space when comparing lines

       -b, --ignore-space-change
              ignore changes in the amount of white space

       -B, --ignore-blank-lines
              ignore changes whose lines are all blank

       -Z, --ignore-space-at-eol
              ignore changes in whitespace at EOL

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: blame

   archive
       create an unversioned archive of a repository revision:

       hg archive [OPTION]... DEST

       By default, the revision used is the parent of the  working  directory;
       use -r/--rev to specify a different revision.

       The  archive type is automatically detected based on file extension (to
       override, use -t/--type).

       Examples:

       · create a zip file containing the 1.0 release:

         hg archive -r 1.0 project-1.0.zip

       · create a tarball excluding .hg files:

         hg archive project.tar.gz -X ".hg*"

       Valid types are:

       files

              a directory full of files (default)

       tar

              tar archive, uncompressed

       tbz2

              tar archive, compressed using bzip2

       tgz

              tar archive, compressed using gzip

       uzip

              zip archive, uncompressed

       zip

              zip archive, compressed using deflate

       The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given using a
       format string; see hg help export for details.

       Each  member added to an archive file has a directory prefix prepended.
       Use -p/--prefix to specify a format string for the prefix. The  default
       is the basename of the archive, with suffixes removed.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       --no-decode
              do not pass files through decoders

       -p,--prefix <PREFIX>
              directory prefix for files in archive

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revision to distribute

       -t,--type <TYPE>
              type of distribution to create

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   backout
       reverse effect of earlier changeset:

       hg backout [OPTION]... [-r] REV

       Prepare  a  new  changeset with the effect of REV undone in the current
       working directory. If no conflicts were encountered, it will be commit‐
       ted immediately.

       If  REV is the parent of the working directory, then this new changeset
       is committed automatically (unless --no-commit is specified).

       Note   hg backout cannot be used to fix either an unwanted or incorrect
              merge.

       Examples:

       · Reverse  the  effect  of  the  parent of the working directory.  This
         backout will be committed immediately:

         hg backout -r .

       · Reverse the effect of previous bad revision 23:

         hg backout -r 23

       · Reverse the effect of previous bad  revision  23  and  leave  changes
         uncommitted:

         hg backout -r 23 --no-commit
         hg commit -m "Backout revision 23"

       By  default,  the pending changeset will have one parent, maintaining a
       linear history. With --merge, the pending changeset will  instead  have
       two parents: the old parent of the working directory and a new child of
       REV that simply undoes REV.

       Before version 1.7, the behavior  without  --merge  was  equivalent  to
       specifying  --merge followed by hg update --clean . to cancel the merge
       and leave the child of REV as a head to be merged separately.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       See hg help revert for a way to restore files to the state  of  another
       revision.

       Returns  0  on success, 1 if nothing to backout or there are unresolved
       files.

       Options:

       --merge
              merge with old dirstate parent after backout

       --commit
              commit if no conflicts were encountered (DEPRECATED)

       --no-commit
              do not commit

       --parent <REV>
              parent to choose when backing out merge (DEPRECATED)

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revision to backout

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -t,--tool <TOOL>
              specify merge tool

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -l,--logfile <FILE>
              read commit message from file

       -d,--date <DATE>
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u,--user <USER>
              record the specified user as committer

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   bisect
       subdivision search of changesets:

       hg bisect [-gbsr] [-U] [-c CMD] [REV]

       This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems. To use,
       mark  the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as bad, then
       mark the latest changeset which is  free  from  the  problem  as  good.
       Bisect  will  update  your  working directory to a revision for testing
       (unless the -U/--noupdate option is specified). Once you have performed
       tests,  mark  the  working  directory  as  good or bad, and bisect will
       either update to another candidate changeset or announce  that  it  has
       found the bad revision.

       As  a  shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a revi‐
       sion as good or bad without checking it out first.

       If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic bisection.   The
       environment variable HG_NODE will contain the ID of the changeset being
       tested. The exit status of the command will be used to  mark  revisions
       as  good  or  bad: status 0 means good, 125 means to skip the revision,
       127 (command not  found)  will  abort  the  bisection,  and  any  other
       non-zero exit status means the revision is bad.

       Some examples:

       · start a bisection with known bad revision 34, and good revision 12:

         hg bisect --bad 34
         hg bisect --good 12

       · advance  the current bisection by marking current revision as good or
         bad:

         hg bisect --good
         hg bisect --bad

       · mark the current revision, or a known revision, to be  skipped  (e.g.
         if that revision is not usable because of another issue):

         hg bisect --skip
         hg bisect --skip 23

       · skip all revisions that do not touch directories foo or bar:

         hg bisect --skip "!( file('path:foo') & file('path:bar') )"

       · forget the current bisection:

         hg bisect --reset

       · use 'make && make tests' to automatically find the first broken revi‐
         sion:

         hg bisect --reset
         hg bisect --bad 34
         hg bisect --good 12
         hg bisect --command "make && make tests"

       · see all changesets whose states are  already  known  in  the  current
         bisection:

         hg log -r "bisect(pruned)"

       · see the changeset currently being bisected (especially useful if run‐
         ning with -U/--noupdate):

         hg log -r "bisect(current)"

       · see all changesets that took part in the current bisection:

         hg log -r "bisect(range)"

       · you can even get a nice graph:

         hg log --graph -r "bisect(range)"

       See hg help revisions.bisect for more about the bisect() predicate.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r, --reset
              reset bisect state

       -g, --good
              mark changeset good

       -b, --bad
              mark changeset bad

       -s, --skip
              skip testing changeset

       -e, --extend
              extend the bisect range

       -c,--command <CMD>
              use command to check changeset state

       -U, --noupdate
              do not update to target

   bookmarks
       create a new bookmark or list existing bookmarks:

       hg bookmarks [OPTIONS]... [NAME]...

       Bookmarks are labels on changesets to help track lines of  development.
       Bookmarks  are  unversioned  and  can  be  moved,  renamed and deleted.
       Deleting or moving a bookmark has no effect on the  associated  change‐
       sets.

       Creating  or updating to a bookmark causes it to be marked as 'active'.
       The active bookmark is indicated with a '*'.  When a  commit  is  made,
       the  active bookmark will advance to the new commit.  A plain hg update
       will also advance an active bookmark, if possible.  Updating away  from
       a bookmark will cause it to be deactivated.

       Bookmarks  can  be  pushed and pulled between repositories (see hg help
       push and hg help pull). If  a  shared  bookmark  has  diverged,  a  new
       'divergent  bookmark' of the form 'name@path' will be created. Using hg
       merge will resolve the divergence.

       Specifying bookmark as '.' to -m/-d/-l options is equivalent to  speci‐
       fying the active bookmark's name.

       A  bookmark named '@' has the special property that hg clone will check
       it out by default if it exists.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions such as {bookmark}. See also hg help templates.

       active Boolean. True if the bookmark is active.

       Examples:

       · create an active bookmark for a new line of development:

         hg book new-feature

       · create an inactive bookmark as a place marker:

         hg book -i reviewed

       · create an inactive bookmark on another changeset:

         hg book -r .^ tested

       · rename bookmark turkey to dinner:

         hg book -m turkey dinner

       · move the '@' bookmark from another branch:

         hg book -f @

       · print only the active bookmark name:

         hg book -ql .

       Options:

       -f, --force
              force

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revision for bookmark action

       -d, --delete
              delete a given bookmark

       -m,--rename <OLD>
              rename a given bookmark

       -i, --inactive

   branch
       set or show the current branch name:

       hg branch [-fC] [NAME]

       Note   Branch names are permanent and global. Use hg bookmark to create
              a light-weight bookmark instead. See hg help  glossary for  more
              information about named branches and bookmarks.

       With  no argument, show the current branch name. With one argument, set
       the working directory branch name (the branch will  not  exist  in  the
       repository  until  the  next commit). Standard practice recommends that
       primary development take place on the 'default' branch.

       Unless -f/--force is specified, branch will not let you  set  a  branch
       name that already exists.

       Use  -C/--clean  to  reset  the working directory branch to that of the
       parent of the working directory, negating a previous branch change.

       Use the command hg update to switch to an existing branch. Use hg  com‐
       mit  --close-branch to mark this branch head as closed.  When all heads
       of a branch are closed, the branch will be considered closed.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              set branch name even if it shadows an existing branch

       -C, --clean
              reset branch name to parent branch name

       -r,--rev <VALUE[+]>
              change branches of the given revs (EXPERIMENTAL)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   branches
       list repository named branches:

       hg branches [-c]

       List the repository's named branches, indicating which ones  are  inac‐
       tive.  If  -c/--closed is specified, also list branches which have been
       marked closed (see hg commit --close-branch).

       Use the command hg update to switch to an existing branch.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions such as {branch}. See also hg help templates.

       active Boolean. True if the branch is active.

       closed Boolean. True if the branch is closed.

       current
              Boolean. True if it is the current branch.

       Returns 0.

       Options:

       -a, --active
              show only branches that have unmerged heads (DEPRECATED)

       -c, --closed
              show normal and closed branches

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>

   bundle
       create a bundle file:

       hg bundle [-f] [-t BUNDLESPEC] [-a] [-r REV]... [--base REV]... FILE [DEST]

       Generate  a  bundle  file  containing data to be transferred to another
       repository.

       To create a bundle containing all changesets, use -a/--all  (or  --base
       null).  Otherwise,  hg  assumes the destination will have all the nodes
       you specify with --base  parameters.  Otherwise,  hg  will  assume  the
       repository has all the nodes in destination, or default-push/default if
       no destination is specified, where destination is  the  repository  you
       provide through DEST option.

       You  can  change  bundle  format with the -t/--type option. See hg help
       bundlespec for documentation on  this  format.  By  default,  the  most
       appropriate format is used and compression defaults to bzip2.

       The  bundle  file  can then be transferred using conventional means and
       applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull  command.  This
       is useful when direct push and pull are not available or when exporting
       an entire repository is undesirable.

       Applying bundles preserves all  changeset  contents  including  permis‐
       sions, copy/rename information, and revision history.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if no changes found.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              run even when the destination is unrelated

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              a changeset intended to be added to the destination

       -b,--branch <BRANCH[+]>
              a specific branch you would like to bundle

       --base <REV[+]>
              a base changeset assumed to be available at the destination

       -a, --all
              bundle all changesets in the repository

       -t,--type <TYPE>
              bundle compression type to use (default: bzip2)

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   cat
       output the current or given revision of files:

       hg cat [OPTION]... FILE...

       Print  the  specified  files  as they were at the given revision. If no
       revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used.

       Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the  file  is  given
       using a template string. See hg help templates. In addition to the com‐
       mon template keywords, the following formatting rules are supported:

       %%

              literal "%" character

       %s

              basename of file being printed

       %d

              dirname of file being printed, or '.' if in repository root

       %p

              root-relative path name of file being printed

       %H

              changeset hash (40 hexadecimal digits)

       %R

              changeset revision number

       %h

              short-form changeset hash (12 hexadecimal digits)

       %r

              zero-padded changeset revision number

       %b

              basename of the exporting repository

       \

              literal "" character

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions. See also hg help templates.

       data   String. File content.

       path   String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       Returns 0 on success.

   clone
       make a copy of an existing repository:

       hg clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

       Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.

       If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the base‐
       name of the source.

       The location of the source is added to the  new  repository's  .hg/hgrc
       file, as the default to be used for future pulls.

       Only  local  paths  and  ssh:// URLs are supported as destinations. For
       ssh:// destinations, no working directory or .hg/hgrc will  be  created
       on the remote side.

       If  the  source repository has a bookmark called '@' set, that revision
       will be checked out in the new repository by default.

       To check out a particular version, use -u/--update, or -U/--noupdate to
       create a clone with no working directory.

       To  pull  only  a  subset  of changesets, specify one or more revisions
       identifiers with -r/--rev or branches with -b/--branch.  The  resulting
       clone  will  contain only the specified changesets and their ancestors.
       These options (or 'clone src#rev dest') imply --pull,  even  for  local
       source repositories.

       In normal clone mode, the remote normalizes repository data into a com‐
       mon exchange format and the receiving end translates this data into its
       local  storage  format.  --stream activates a different clone mode that
       essentially copies repository files from the remote with  minimal  data
       processing.  This  significantly  reduces  the CPU cost of a clone both
       remotely and locally.  However, it often increases the transferred data
       size  by  30-40%.  This can result in substantially faster clones where
       I/O throughput is plentiful,  especially  for  larger  repositories.  A
       side-effect  of  --stream  clones is that storage settings and require‐
       ments on the remote are applied locally: a modern  client  may  inherit
       legacy  or inefficient storage used by the remote or a legacy Mercurial
       client may not be able to clone from a modern Mercurial remote.

       Note   Specifying a tag will include the tagged changeset but  not  the
              changeset containing the tag.

       For  efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the source and
       destination are on the same filesystem (note this applies only  to  the
       repository  data, not to the working directory). Some filesystems, such
       as AFS, implement hardlinking incorrectly, but do not report errors. In
       these cases, use the --pull option to avoid hardlinking.

       Mercurial  will  update  the  working directory to the first applicable
       revision from this list:

       a. null if -U or the source repository has no changesets

       b. if -u . and the source repository is local, the first parent of  the
          source repository's working directory

       c. the  changeset  specified  with -u (if a branch name, this means the
          latest head of that branch)

       d. the changeset specified with -r

       e. the tipmost head specified with -b

       f. the tipmost head specified with the url#branch source syntax

       g. the revision marked with the '@' bookmark, if present

       h. the tipmost head of the default branch

       i. tip

       When cloning from servers that support it, Mercurial may fetch pre-gen‐
       erated  data  from  a  server-advertised  URL  or  inline from the same
       stream. When this is done, hooks operating on incoming  changesets  and
       changegroups  may fire more than once, once for each pre-generated bun‐
       dle and as well as for any additional remaining data. In  addition,  if
       an  error occurs, the repository may be rolled back to a partial clone.
       This behavior may change in future releases.  See hg  help  -e  cloneb‐
       undles for more.

       Examples:

       · clone a remote repository to a new directory named hg/:

         hg clone https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/

       · create a lightweight local clone:

         hg clone project/ project-feature/

       · clone from an absolute path on an ssh server (note double-slash):

         hg clone ssh://user@server//home/projects/alpha/

       · do a streaming clone while checking out a specified version:

         hg clone --stream http://server/repo -u 1.5

       · create a repository without changesets after a particular revision:

         hg clone -r 04e544 experimental/ good/

       · clone (and track) a particular named branch:

         hg clone https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/#stable

       See hg help urls for details on specifying URLs.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -U, --noupdate
              the clone will include an empty working directory (only a repos‐
              itory)

       -u,--updaterev <REV>
              revision, tag, or branch to check out

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              do not clone everything, but  include  this  changeset  and  its
              ancestors

       -b,--branch <BRANCH[+]>
              do  not  clone  everything, but include this branch's changesets
              and their ancestors

       --pull use pull protocol to copy metadata

       --uncompressed
              an alias to --stream (DEPRECATED)

       --stream

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   commit
       commit the specified files or all outstanding changes:

       hg commit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Commit changes to the given files into the repository.  Unlike  a  cen‐
       tralized  SCM,  this  operation is a local operation. See hg push for a
       way to actively distribute your changes.

       If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by  hg  status will
       be committed.

       If  you  are committing the result of a merge, do not provide any file‐
       names or -I/-X filters.

       If no commit message is specified,  Mercurial  starts  your  configured
       editor  where  you  can enter a message. In case your commit fails, you
       will find a backup of your message in .hg/last-message.txt.

       The --close-branch flag can be used to mark  the  current  branch  head
       closed.  When all heads of a branch are closed, the branch will be con‐
       sidered closed and no longer listed.

       The --amend flag can be used to amend the parent of the working  direc‐
       tory with a new commit that contains the changes in the parent in addi‐
       tion to those currently reported by hg status, if there  are  any.  The
       old  commit  is  stored  in a backup bundle in .hg/strip-backup (see hg
       help bundle and hg help unbundle on how to restore it).

       Message, user and date are taken from the amended commit unless  speci‐
       fied.  When  a  message isn't specified on the command line, the editor
       will open with the message of the amended commit.

       It is not possible to amend public changesets (see hg help  phases)  or
       changesets that have children.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing changed.

       Examples:

       · commit all files ending in .py:

         hg commit --include "set:**.py"

       · commit all non-binary files:

         hg commit --exclude "set:binary()"

   config
       show combined config settings from all hgrc files:

       hg config [-u] [NAME]...

       With no arguments, print names and values of all config items.

       With  one  argument  of  the form section.name, print just the value of
       that config item.

       With multiple arguments, print names and values  of  all  config  items
       with matching section names or section.names.

       With  --edit,  start  an  editor  on  the  user-level config file. With
       --global, edit the system-wide config  file.  With  --local,  edit  the
       repository-level config file.

       With --debug, the source (filename and line number) is printed for each
       config item.

       See hg help config for more information about config files.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported. See also hg help templates.

       name   String. Config name.

       source String. Filename and line number where the item is defined.

   copy
       mark files as copied for the next commit:

       hg copy [OPTION]... [SOURCE]... DEST

       Mark dest as having copies of source files. If  dest  is  a  directory,
       copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file, the source must be
       a single file.

       By default, this command copies the contents of files as they exist  in
       the  working  directory.  If  invoked with -A/--after, the operation is
       recorded, but no copying is performed.

       This command takes effect with the next commit. To undo a  copy  before
       that, see hg revert.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

       Options:

       -A, --after
              record a copy that has already occurred

       -f, --force
              forcibly copy over an existing managed file

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run

   diff
       diff repository (or selected files):

       hg diff [OPTION]... ([-c REV] | [-r REV1 [-r REV2]]) [FILE]...

       Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

       Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.

       Note   hg  diff may  generate unexpected results for merges, as it will
              default to comparing against the working directory's first  par‐
              ent changeset if no revisions are specified.

       When  two  revision arguments are given, then changes are shown between
       those revisions. If only one revision is specified then  that  revision
       is compared to the working directory, and, when no revisions are speci‐
       fied, the working directory files are compared to its first parent.

       Alternatively you can specify -c/--change with a revision  to  see  the
       changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.

       Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files
       it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway, proba‐
       bly with undesirable results.

       Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff for‐
       mat. For more information, read hg help diffs.

       Examples:

       · compare a file in the current working directory to its parent:

         hg diff foo.c

       · compare two historical versions of a directory, with rename info:

         hg diff --git -r 1.0:1.2 lib/

       · get change stats relative to the last change on some date:

         hg diff --stat -r "date('may 2')"

       · diff all newly-added files that contain a keyword:

         hg diff "set:added() and grep(GNU)"

       · compare a revision and its parents:

         hg diff -c 9353         # compare against first parent
         hg diff -r 9353^:9353   # same using revset syntax
         hg diff -r 9353^2:9353  # compare against the second parent

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>

       --nodates
              omit dates from diff headers

       --noprefix
              omit a/ and b/ prefixes from filenames

       -p, --show-function
              show which function each change is in

       --reverse
              produce a diff that undoes the changes

       -w, --ignore-all-space
              ignore white space when comparing lines

       -b, --ignore-space-change
              ignore changes in the amount of white space

       -B, --ignore-blank-lines
              ignore changes whose lines are all blank

       -Z, --ignore-space-at-eol
              ignore changes in whitespace at EOL

              produce diffs relative to subdirectory

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   export
       dump the header and diffs for one or more changesets:

       hg export [OPTION]... [-o OUTFILESPEC] [-r] [REV]...

       Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.  If  no
       revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used.

       The  information shown in the changeset header is: author, date, branch
       name (if non-default), changeset hash, parent(s) and commit comment.

       Note   hg export may generate unexpected diff output for merge  change‐
              sets,  as  it will compare the merge changeset against its first
              parent only.

       Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the  file  is  given
       using a template string. See hg help templates. In addition to the com‐
       mon template keywords, the following formatting rules are supported:

       %%

              literal "%" character

       %H

              changeset hash (40 hexadecimal digits)

       %N

              number of patches being generated

       %R

              changeset revision number

       %b

              basename of the exporting repository

       %h

              short-form changeset hash (12 hexadecimal digits)

       %m

              first line of the commit message (only alphanumeric characters)

       %n

              zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1

       %r

              zero-padded changeset revision number

       \

              literal "" character

       Without the -a/--text option, export will  avoid  generating  diffs  of
       files  it  detects as binary. With -a, export will generate a diff any‐
       way, probably with undesirable results.

       With -B/--bookmark changesets  reachable  by  the  given  bookmark  are
       selected.

       Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff for‐
       mat. See hg help diffs for more information.

       With the --switch-parent option, the diff will be  against  the  second
       parent. It can be useful to review a merge.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions. See also hg help templates.

       diff   String. Diff content.

       parents
              List of strings. Parent nodes of the changeset.

       Examples:

       · use export and import to transplant a bugfix to the current branch:

         hg export -r 9353 | hg import -

       · export all the changesets between two revisions to a file with rename
         information:

         hg export --git -r 123:150 > changes.txt

       · split  outgoing  changes  into  a  series of patches with descriptive
         names:

         hg export -r "outgoing()" -o "%n-%m.patch"

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -B,--bookmark <BOOKMARK>
              export changes only reachable by given bookmark

       -o,--output <FORMAT>
              print output to file with formatted name

       --switch-parent
              diff against the second parent

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              revisions to export

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       --binary
              generate binary diffs in git mode (default)

       --nodates
              omit dates from diff headers

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   files
       list tracked files:

       hg files [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Print files under Mercurial control in the working directory or  speci‐
       fied  revision for given files (excluding removed files).  Files can be
       specified as filenames or filesets.

       If no files are given to match, this command prints the  names  of  all
       files under Mercurial control.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions. See also hg help templates.

       flags  String. Character denoting file's symlink and executable bits.

       path   String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       size   Integer. Size of the file in bytes.

       Examples:

       · list all files under the current directory:

         hg files .

       · shows sizes and flags for current revision:

         hg files -vr .

       · list all files named README:

         hg files -I "**/README"

       · list all binary files:

         hg files "set:binary()"

       · find files containing a regular expression:

         hg files "set:grep('bob')"

       · search tracked file contents with xargs and grep:

         hg files -0 | xargs -0 grep foo

       See hg help patterns and hg help filesets for more information on spec‐
       ifying file patterns.

       Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              search the repository as it is in REV

       -0, --print0
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   forget
       forget the specified files on the next commit:

       hg forget [OPTION]... FILE...

       Mark  the  specified  files so they will no longer be tracked after the
       next commit.

       This only removes files from the current branch, not  from  the  entire
       project  history,  and  it does not delete them from the working direc‐
       tory.

       To delete the file from the working directory, see hg remove.

       To undo a forget before the next commit, see hg add.

       Examples:

       · forget newly-added binary files:

         hg forget "set:added() and binary()"

       · forget files that would be excluded by .hgignore:

         hg forget "set:hgignore()"

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -i, --interactive
              use interactive mode

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   graft
       copy changes from other branches onto the current branch:

       hg graft [OPTION]... [-r REV]... REV...

       This command uses Mercurial's merge logic to  copy  individual  changes
       from other branches without merging branches in the history graph. This
       is sometimes known as 'backporting' or  'cherry-picking'.  By  default,
       graft will copy user, date, and description from the source changesets.

       Changesets  that  are  ancestors  of  the  current  revision, that have
       already been grafted, or that are merges will be skipped.

       If --log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended of the
       form:

       (grafted from CHANGESETHASH)

       If  --force  is  specified,  revisions will be grafted even if they are
       already ancestors of, or have been grafted to, the  destination.   This
       is useful when the revisions have since been backed out.

       If a graft merge results in conflicts, the graft process is interrupted
       so that the current merge can be manually resolved.  Once all conflicts
       are  addressed,  the  graft process can be continued with the -c/--con‐
       tinue option.

       The -c/--continue option reapplies all the earlier options.

       Examples:

       · copy a single change to the stable branch and edit its description:

         hg update stable
         hg graft --edit 9393

       · graft a range of changesets with one exception, updating dates:

         hg graft -D "2085::2093 and not 2091"

       · continue a graft after resolving conflicts:

         hg graft -c

       · show the source of a grafted changeset:

         hg log --debug -r .

       · show revisions sorted by date:

         hg log -r "sort(all(), date)"

       See hg help revisions for more about specifying revisions.

       Returns 0 on successful completion.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              revisions to graft

       -c, --continue
              resume interrupted graft

       --stop stop interrupted graft

       --abort
              abort interrupted graft

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       --log  append graft info to log message

       --no-commit
              don't commit, just apply the changes in working directory

       -f, --force
              force graft

       -D, --currentdate
              record the current date as commit date

       -U, --currentuser
              record the current user as committer

       -d,--date <DATE>
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u,--user <USER>
              record the specified user as committer

       -t,--tool <TOOL>
              specify merge tool

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   grep
       search revision history for a pattern in specified files:

       hg grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...

       Search revision history for a regular expression in the specified files
       or the entire project.

       By  default,  grep prints the most recent revision number for each file
       in which it finds a match. To get it to print every revision that  con‐
       tains  a  change  in  match  status  ("-"  for  a  match that becomes a
       non-match, or "+" for a non-match that becomes a match), use the --diff
       flag.

       PATTERN can be any Python (roughly Perl-compatible) regular expression.

       If no FILEs are specified (and -f/--follow isn't set), all files in the
       repository are searched, including those that don't exist in  the  cur‐
       rent branch or have been deleted in a prior changeset.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions. See also hg help templates.

       change String. Character denoting insertion + or removal -.   Available
              if --diff is specified.

       lineno Integer. Line number of the match.

       path   String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       texts  List of text chunks.

       And each entry of {texts} provides the following sub-keywords.

       matched
              Boolean. True if the chunk matches the specified pattern.

       text   String. Chunk content.

       See hg help templates.operators for the list expansion syntax.

       Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       -0, --print0
              end fields with NUL

       --all  print all revisions that match (DEPRECATED)

       --diff print all revisions when the term was introduced or removed

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -f, --follow
              follow  changeset  history,  or  file  history across copies and
              renames

       -i, --ignore-case
              ignore case when matching

       -l, --files-with-matches
              print only filenames and revisions that match

       -n, --line-number
              print matching line numbers

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              only search files changed within revision range

       --all-files
              include all files in the changeset while grepping (EXPERIMENTAL)

              list the author (long with -v)

       -d, --date
              list the date (short with -q)

              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   heads
       show branch heads:

       hg heads [-ct] [-r STARTREV] [REV]...

       With no arguments, show  all  open  branch  heads  in  the  repository.
       Branch  heads  are  changesets  that  have  no  descendants on the same
       branch. They are where development generally takes place  and  are  the
       usual targets for update and merge operations.

       If  one  or more REVs are given, only open branch heads on the branches
       associated with the specified changesets are shown. This means that you
       can  use  hg  heads  . to  see  the  heads on the currently checked-out
       branch.

       If -c/--closed is specified, also show branch heads marked closed  (see
       hg commit --close-branch).

       If  STARTREV  is  specified,  only  those heads that are descendants of
       STARTREV will be displayed.

       If -t/--topo is specified, named branch mechanics will be  ignored  and
       only topological heads (changesets with no children) will be shown.

       Returns 0 if matching heads are found, 1 if not.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <STARTREV>
              show only heads which are descendants of STARTREV

       -t, --topo
              show topological heads only

       -a, --active
              show active branchheads only (DEPRECATED)

       -c, --closed
              show normal and closed branch heads

       --style <STYLE>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   help
       show help for a given topic or a help overview:

       hg help [-eck] [-s PLATFORM] [TOPIC]

       With no arguments, print a list of commands with short help messages.

       Given a topic, extension, or command name, print help for that topic.

       Returns 0 if successful.

       Options:

       -e, --extension
              show only help for extensions

       -c, --command
              show only help for commands

       -k, --keyword
              show topics matching keyword

       -s,--system <PLATFORM[+]>
              show help for specific platform(s)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   identify
       identify the working directory or specified revision:

       hg identify [-nibtB] [-r REV] [SOURCE]

       Print  a  summary  identifying the repository state at REV using one or
       two parent hash identifiers, followed by a "+" if the working directory
       has  uncommitted  changes,  the branch name (if not default), a list of
       tags, and a list of bookmarks.

       When REV is not given, print a summary of  the  current  state  of  the
       repository including the working directory. Specify -r. to get informa‐
       tion of the  working  directory  parent  without  scanning  uncommitted
       changes.

       Specifying  a  path to a repository root or Mercurial bundle will cause
       lookup to operate on that repository/bundle.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions. See also hg help templates.

       dirty  String. Character + denoting if the working directory has uncom‐
              mitted changes.

       id     String. One or two nodes, optionally followed by +.

       parents
              List of strings. Parent nodes of the changeset.

       Examples:

       · generate a build identifier for the working directory:

         hg id --id > build-id.dat

       · find the revision corresponding to a tag:

         hg id -n -r 1.3

       · check the most recent revision of a remote repository:

         hg id -r tip https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/

       See hg log for generating more information  about  specific  revisions,
       including full hash identifiers.

       Returns 0 if successful.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              identify the specified revision

       -n, --num
              show local revision number

       -i, --id
              show global revision id

       -b, --branch
              show branch

       -t, --tags
              show tags

       -B, --bookmarks
              show bookmarks

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

              aliases: id

   import
       import an ordered set of patches:

       hg import [OPTION]... PATCH...

       Import a list of patches and commit them individually (unless --no-com‐
       mit is specified).

       To read a patch from standard input (stdin), use "-" as the patch name.
       If a URL is specified, the patch will be downloaded from there.

       Import  first applies changes to the working directory (unless --bypass
       is specified), import will abort if there are outstanding changes.

       Use --bypass to apply and commit patches directly  to  the  repository,
       without  affecting the working directory. Without --exact, patches will
       be applied on top of the working directory parent revision.

       You can import a patch straight from a mail message.  Even  patches  as
       attachments work (to use the body part, it must have type text/plain or
       text/x-patch). From and Subject headers of email message  are  used  as
       default  committer and commit message. All text/plain body parts before
       first diff are added to the commit message.

       If the imported patch was generated by hg export, user and  description
       from  patch override values from message headers and body. Values given
       on command line with -m/--message and -u/--user override these.

       If --exact is specified, import will set the working directory  to  the
       parent  of each patch before applying it, and will abort if the result‐
       ing changeset has a different ID than the one recorded  in  the  patch.
       This  will  guard  against various ways that portable patch formats and
       mail systems might fail to transfer Mercurial data or metadata. See  hg
       bundle for lossless transmission.

       Use --partial to ensure a changeset will be created from the patch even
       if some hunks fail to apply. Hunks that fail to apply will  be  written
       to  a  <target-file>.rej  file.  Conflicts can then be resolved by hand
       before hg commit --amend is run to update the created  changeset.  This
       flag  exists  to let people import patches that partially apply without
       losing the associated metadata (author, date, description, ...).

       Note   When no hunks apply cleanly, hg import --partial will create  an
              empty changeset, importing only the patch metadata.

       With -s/--similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and copies in
       the patch in the same way as hg addremove.

       It is possible to use external patch programs to perform the  patch  by
       setting  the  ui.patch  configuration  option. For the default internal
       tool, the fuzz can also be configured via patch.fuzz.  See hg help con‐
       fig for more information about configuration files and how to use these
       options.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Examples:

       · import a traditional patch from a website and detect renames:

         hg import -s 80 http://example.com/bugfix.patch

       · import a changeset from an hgweb server:

         hg import https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/5ca8c111e9aa

       · import all the patches in an Unix-style mbox:

         hg import incoming-patches.mbox

       · import patches from stdin:

         hg import -

       · attempt to exactly restore an exported changeset (not  always  possi‐
         ble):

         hg import --exact proposed-fix.patch

       · use  an  external  tool  to  apply a patch which is too fuzzy for the
         default internal tool.

            hg import --config ui.patch="patch --merge" fuzzy.patch

       · change the default fuzzing from 2 to a less strict 7

            hg import --config ui.fuzz=7 fuzz.patch

       Returns 0 on success, 1 on partial success (see --partial).

       Options:

              directory strip option for patch. This has the same  meaning  as
              the corresponding patch option (default: 1)

       -b,--base <PATH>
              base path (DEPRECATED)

       -e, --edit

              aliases: patch

   incoming
       show new changesets found in source:

       hg incoming [-p] [-n] [-M] [-f] [-r REV]... [--bundle FILENAME] [SOURCE]

       Show new changesets found in the specified path/URL or the default pull
       location. These are the changesets that would have been  pulled  by  hg
       pull at the time you issued this command.

       See pull for valid source format details.

       With  -B/--bookmarks,  the  result of bookmark comparison between local
       and remote repositories is displayed. With -v/--verbose, status is also
       displayed for each bookmark like below:

       BM1               01234567890a added
       BM2               1234567890ab advanced
       BM3               234567890abc diverged
       BM4               34567890abcd changed

       The  action  taken  locally  when pulling depends on the status of each
       bookmark:

       added

              pull will create it

       advanced

              pull will update it

       diverged

              pull will create a divergent bookmark

       changed

              result depends on remote changesets

       From the point of view of pulling behavior, bookmark existing  only  in
       the  remote  repository  are  treated  as  added, even if it is in fact
       locally deleted.

       For remote repository, using --bundle avoids downloading the changesets
       twice if the incoming is followed by a pull.

       Examples:

       · show incoming changes with patches and full description:

         hg incoming -vp

       · show incoming changes excluding merges, store a bundle:

         hg in -vpM --bundle incoming.hg
         hg pull incoming.hg

       · briefly list changes inside a bundle:

         hg in changes.hg -T "{desc|firstline}\n"

       Returns 0 if there are incoming changes, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              run even if remote repository is unrelated

       -n, --newest-first
              show newest record first

       --bundle <FILE>
              file to store the bundles into

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              a remote changeset intended to be added

       -B, --bookmarks
              compare bookmarks

       -b,--branch <BRANCH[+]>
              a specific branch you would like to pull

       -p, --patch
              show patch

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       -l,--limit <NUM>
              limit number of changes displayed

       -M, --no-merges
              do not show merges

       --stat output diffstat-style summary of changes

       -G, --graph

              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: in

   init
       create a new repository in the given directory:

       hg init [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]

       Initialize a new repository in the given directory. If the given direc‐
       tory does not exist, it will be created.

       If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

       It is possible to specify an ssh:// URL as  the  destination.   See  hg
       help urls for more information.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

   locate
       locate files matching specific patterns (DEPRECATED):

       hg locate [OPTION]... [PATTERN]...

       Print  files  under  Mercurial  control  in the working directory whose
       names match the given patterns.

       By default, this command searches all directories in the working direc‐
       tory.  To search just the current directory and its subdirectories, use
       "--include .".

       If no patterns are given to match, this command prints the names of all
       files under Mercurial control in the working directory.

       If  you  want  to feed the output of this command into the "xargs" com‐
       mand, use the -0 option to both this command  and  "xargs".  This  will
       avoid  the  problem  of  "xargs" treating single filenames that contain
       whitespace as multiple filenames.

       See hg help files for a more versatile command.

       Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              search the repository as it is in REV

       -0, --print0
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs

       -f, --fullpath
              print complete paths from the filesystem root

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   log
       show revision history of entire repository or files:

       hg log [OPTION]... [FILE]

       Print the revision  history  of  the  specified  files  or  the  entire
       project.

       If no revision range is specified, the default is tip:0 unless --follow
       is set, in which case the working  directory  parent  is  used  as  the
       starting revision.

       File  history  is  shown  without  following  rename or copy history of
       files. Use -f/--follow with a filename to follow history across renames
       and copies. --follow without a filename will only show ancestors of the
       starting revision.

       By default this command prints revision number and changeset id,  tags,
       non-trivial  parents,  user, date and time, and a summary for each com‐
       mit. When the -v/--verbose switch is used, the list  of  changed  files
       and full commit message are shown.

       With  --graph the revisions are shown as an ASCII art DAG with the most
       recent changeset at the top.  'o' is a  changeset,  '@'  is  a  working
       directory  parent,  '_' closes a branch, 'x' is obsolete, '*' is unsta‐
       ble, and '+' represents a fork where the changeset from the lines below
       is  a  parent  of the 'o' merge on the same line.  Paths in the DAG are
       represented with '|', '/' and so forth. ':' in place of a '|' indicates
       one or more revisions in a path are omitted.

       Use  -L/--line-range  FILE,M:N  options  to follow the history of lines
       from M to N in FILE. With -p/--patch only diff hunks  affecting  speci‐
       fied line range will be shown. This option requires --follow; it can be
       specified multiple times. Currently, this option is not compatible with
       --graph. This option is experimental.

       Note   hg  log  --patch may  generate  unexpected diff output for merge
              changesets, as it will only compare the merge changeset  against
              its  first  parent. Also, only files different from BOTH parents
              will appear in files:.

       Note   For performance reasons, hg log FILE may omit duplicate  changes
              made  on branches and will not show removals or mode changes. To
              see all such changes, use the --removed switch.

       Note   The history resulting from -L/--line-range  options  depends  on
              diff  options; for instance if white-spaces are ignored, respec‐
              tive changes with only white-spaces in specified line range will
              not be listed.

       Some examples:

       · changesets with full descriptions and file lists:

         hg log -v

       · changesets ancestral to the working directory:

         hg log -f

       · last 10 commits on the current branch:

         hg log -l 10 -b .

       · changesets showing all modifications of a file, including removals:

         hg log --removed file.c

       · all changesets that touch a directory, with diffs, excluding merges:

         hg log -Mp lib/

       · all revision numbers that match a keyword:

         hg log -k bug --template "{rev}\n"

       · the full hash identifier of the working directory parent:

         hg log -r . --template "{node}\n"

       · list available log templates:

         hg log -T list

       · check if a given changeset is included in a tagged release:

         hg log -r "a21ccf and ancestor(1.9)"

       · find all changesets by some user in a date range:

         hg log -k alice -d "may 2008 to jul 2008"

       · summary of all changesets after the last tag:

         hg log -r "last(tagged())::" --template "{desc|firstline}\n"

       · changesets touching lines 13 to 23 for file.c:

         hg log -L file.c,13:23

       · changesets  touching  lines  13  to 23 for file.c and lines 2 to 6 of
         main.c with patch:

         hg log -L file.c,13:23 -L main.c,2:6 -p

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       See hg help revisions for more about specifying and ordering revisions.

       See hg help templates for more about pre-packaged styles and specifying
       custom  templates.  The default template used by the log command can be
       customized via the ui.logtemplate configuration setting.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -f, --follow

          aliases: history

   manifest
       output the current or given revision of the project manifest:

       hg manifest [-r REV]

       Print a list of version controlled files for the given revision.  If no
       revision is given, the first parent of the working directory  is  used,
       or the null revision if no revision is checked out.

       With  -v,  print  file  permissions, symlink and executable bits.  With
       --debug, print file revision hashes.

       If option --all is specified, the list of all files from all  revisions
       is printed. This includes deleted and renamed files.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revision to display

       --all  list files from all revisions

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   merge
       merge another revision into working directory:

       hg merge [-P] [[-r] REV]

       The  current  working directory is updated with all changes made in the
       requested revision since the last common predecessor revision.

       Files that changed between either parent are marked as changed for  the
       next  commit  and a commit must be performed before any further updates
       to the repository are allowed. The next commit will have two parents.

       --tool can be used to specify the merge tool used for file  merges.  It
       overrides  the  HGMERGE  environment  variable  and  your configuration
       files. See hg help merge-tools for options.

       If no revision is specified, the working directory's parent is  a  head
       revision,  and  the current branch contains exactly one other head, the
       other head is merged with by default. Otherwise, an  explicit  revision
       with which to merge with must be provided.

       See hg help resolve for information on handling file conflicts.

       To undo an uncommitted merge, use hg merge --abort which will check out
       a clean copy of the original merge parent, losing all changes.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              force a merge including outstanding changes (DEPRECATED)

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revision to merge

       -P, --preview
              review revisions to merge (no merge is performed)

       --abort
              abort the ongoing merge

       -t,--tool <TOOL>
              specify merge tool

   outgoing
       show changesets not found in the destination:

       hg outgoing [-M] [-p] [-n] [-f] [-r REV]... [DEST]

       Show changesets not found in the specified  destination  repository  or
       the  default  push  location.  These  are  the changesets that would be
       pushed if a push was requested.

       See pull for details of valid destination formats.

       With -B/--bookmarks, the result of bookmark  comparison  between  local
       and remote repositories is displayed. With -v/--verbose, status is also
       displayed for each bookmark like below:

       BM1               01234567890a added
       BM2                            deleted
       BM3               234567890abc advanced
       BM4               34567890abcd diverged
       BM5               4567890abcde changed

       The action taken when pushing depends on the status of each bookmark:

       added

              push with -B will create it

       deleted

              push with -B will delete it

       advanced

              push will update it

       diverged

              push with -B will update it

       changed

              push with -B will update it

       From the point of view of pushing behavior, bookmarks existing only  in
       the  remote  repository  are  treated as deleted, even if it is in fact
       added remotely.

       Returns 0 if there are outgoing changes, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              run even when the destination is unrelated

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>

              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: out

   parents
       show the parents of the working directory or revision (DEPRECATED):

       hg parents [-r REV] [FILE]

       Print the working directory's parent revisions. If a revision is  given
       via  -r/--rev,  the parent of that revision will be printed.  If a file
       argument is given, the revision in which  the  file  was  last  changed
       (before  the  working  directory  revision  or the argument to --rev if
       given) is printed.

       This command is equivalent to:

       hg log -r "p1()+p2()" or
       hg log -r "p1(REV)+p2(REV)" or
       hg log -r "max(::p1() and file(FILE))+max(::p2() and file(FILE))" or
       hg log -r "max(::p1(REV) and file(FILE))+max(::p2(REV) and file(FILE))"

       See hg summary and hg help revsets for related information.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              show parents of the specified revision

       --style <STYLE>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   paths
       show aliases for remote repositories:

       hg paths [NAME]

       Show definition of symbolic path name NAME. If no name is  given,  show
       definition of all available names.

       Option  -q/--quiet  suppresses  all  output when searching for NAME and
       shows only the path names when listing all definitions.

       Path names are defined in the [paths]  section  of  your  configuration
       file  and  in /etc/mercurial/hgrc. If run inside a repository, .hg/hgrc
       is used, too.

       The path names default and default-push have a special  meaning.   When
       performing  a  push or pull operation, they are used as fallbacks if no
       location is specified on the command-line.  When default-push  is  set,
       it  will  be used for push and default will be used for pull; otherwise
       default is used as the fallback for both.  When cloning  a  repository,
       the clone source is written as default in .hg/hgrc.

       Note   default and default-push apply to all inbound (e.g.  hg incoming
              ) and outbound (e.g. hg outgoing, hg email and hg bundle) opera‐
              tions.

       See hg help urls for more information.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported. See also hg help templates.

       name   String. Symbolic name of the path alias.

       pushurl
              String. URL for push operations.

       url    String. URL or directory path for the other operations.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   phase
       set or show the current phase name:

       hg phase [-p|-d|-s] [-f] [-r] [REV...]

       With no argument, show the phase name of the current revision(s).

       With  one  of  -p/--public, -d/--draft or -s/--secret, change the phase
       value of the specified revisions.

       Unless -f/--force is specified, hg phase won't move changesets  from  a
       lower phase to a higher phase. Phases are ordered as follows:

       public < draft < secret

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if some phases could not be changed.

       (For more information about the phases concept, see hg help phases.)

       Options:

       -p, --public
              set changeset phase to public

       -d, --draft
              set changeset phase to draft

       -s, --secret
              set changeset phase to secret

       -f, --force
              allow to move boundary backward

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              target revision

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   pull
       pull changes from the specified source:

       hg pull [-u] [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]

       Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.

       This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path or URL
       and adds them to a local repository (the current one unless -R is spec‐
       ified). By default, this does not update the copy of the project in the
       working directory.

       When cloning from servers that support it, Mercurial may fetch pre-gen‐
       erated  data. When this is done, hooks operating on incoming changesets
       and changegroups may fire more than once, once for  each  pre-generated
       bundle and as well as for any additional remaining data. See hg help -e
       clonebundles for more.

       Use hg incoming if you want to see what would have been added by a pull
       at  the  time  you issued this command. If you then decide to add those
       changes to the repository, you should use hg pull -r X where X  is  the
       last changeset listed by hg incoming.

       If  SOURCE  is  omitted,  the 'default' path will be used.  See hg help
       urls for more information.

       Specifying bookmark as . is equivalent to specifying the  active  book‐
       mark's name.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update had unresolved files.

       Options:

       -u, --update
              update to new branch head if new descendants were pulled

       -f, --force
              run even when remote repository is unrelated

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              a remote changeset intended to be added

       -B,--bookmark <BOOKMARK[+]>
              bookmark to pull

       -b,--branch <BRANCH[+]>
              a specific branch you would like to pull

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   push
       push changes to the specified destination:

       hg push [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]

       Push changesets from the local repository to the specified destination.

       This operation is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull in the
       destination repository from the current one.

       By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at  the  destina‐
       tion,  since multiple heads would make it unclear which head to use. In
       this situation, it is recommended to pull and merge before pushing.

       Use --new-branch if you want to allow push to create a new named branch
       that  is not present at the destination. This allows you to only create
       a new branch without forcing other changes.

       Note   Extra care should be taken with  the  -f/--force  option,  which
              will  push  all  new heads on all branches, an action which will
              almost always cause confusion for collaborators.

       If -r/--rev is used, the specified revision and all its ancestors  will
       be pushed to the remote repository.

       If -B/--bookmark is used, the specified bookmarked revision, its ances‐
       tors, and the bookmark will be pushed to the remote repository.  Speci‐
       fying . is equivalent to specifying the active bookmark's name.

       Please  see  hg  help  urls for important details about ssh:// URLs. If
       DESTINATION is omitted, a default path will be used.

       The --pushvars option sends strings to the server that become  environ‐
       ment  variables  prepended  with  HG_USERVAR_.  For example, --pushvars
       ENABLE_FEATURE=true, provides  the  server  side  hooks  with  HG_USER‐
       VAR_ENABLE_FEATURE=true as part of their environment.

       pushvars  can  provide  for user-overridable hooks as well as set debug
       levels. One example is having a hook  that  blocks  commits  containing
       conflict markers, but enables the user to override the hook if the file
       is using conflict markers for testing purposes or the file  format  has
       strings that look like conflict markers.

       By  default,  servers will ignore --pushvars. To enable it add the fol‐
       lowing to your configuration file:

       [push]
       pushvars.server = true

       Returns 0 if push was successful, 1 if nothing to push.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              force push

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              a changeset intended to be included in the destination

       -B,--bookmark <BOOKMARK[+]>
              bookmark to push

       -b,--branch <BRANCH[+]>
              a specific branch you would like to push

       --new-branch
              allow pushing a new branch

       --pushvars <VALUE[+]>
              variables that can be sent to server (ADVANCED)

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   recover
       roll back an interrupted transaction:

       hg recover

       Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.

       This command tries to fix the repository status  after  an  interrupted
       operation. It should only be necessary when Mercurial suggests it.

       Returns 0 if successful, 1 if nothing to recover or verify fails.

   remove
       remove the specified files on the next commit:

       hg remove [OPTION]... FILE...

       Schedule the indicated files for removal from the current branch.

       This  command schedules the files to be removed at the next commit.  To
       undo a remove before that, see hg revert. To undo added files,  see  hg
       forget.

       -A/--after  can  be  used  to  remove only files that have already been
       deleted, -f/--force can be used to force deletion, and -Af can be  used
       to  remove  files from the next revision without deleting them from the
       working directory.

       The following table details the behavior of remove for  different  file
       states  (columns)  and  option combinations (rows). The file states are
       Added [A], Clean [C], Modified [M] and Missing [!]  (as reported by  hg
       status).  The  actions  are Warn, Remove (from branch) and Delete (from
       disk):

                            ┌──────────┬───┬────┬────┬───┐
                            │opt/state │ A │ C  │ M  │ ! │
                            ├──────────┼───┼────┼────┼───┤

                            └──────────┴───┴────┴────┴───┘

       Note   hg remove never deletes files in Added [A] state from the  work‐
              ing directory, not even if --force is specified.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if any warnings encountered.

       Options:

       -A, --after
              record delete for missing files

       -f, --force
              forget added files, delete modified files

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: rm

   rename
       rename files; equivalent of copy + remove:

       hg rename [OPTION]... SOURCE... DEST

       Mark dest as copies of sources; mark sources for deletion. If dest is a
       directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a  file,  there
       can only be one source.

       By  default, this command copies the contents of files as they exist in
       the working directory. If invoked with  -A/--after,  the  operation  is
       recorded, but no copying is performed.

       This  command  takes effect at the next commit. To undo a rename before
       that, see hg revert.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

       Options:

       -A, --after
              record a rename that has already occurred

       -f, --force
              forcibly copy over an existing managed file

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: move mv

   resolve
       redo merges or set/view the merge status of files:

       hg resolve [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Merges with unresolved conflicts are often the result  of  non-interac‐
       tive  merging using the internal:merge configuration setting, or a com‐
       mand-line merge tool like diff3. The resolve command is used to  manage
       the  files involved in a merge, after hg merge has been run, and before
       hg commit is run (i.e. the working directory must  have  two  parents).
       See hg help merge-tools for information on configuring merge tools.

       The resolve command can be used in the following ways:

       · hg  resolve  [--re-merge]  [--tool TOOL] FILE...: attempt to re-merge
         the specified files, discarding any previous merge attempts. Re-merg‐
         ing  is  not  performed  for  files  already  marked as resolved. Use
         --all/-a to select all unresolved files. --tool can be used to  spec‐
         ify the merge tool used for the given files. It overrides the HGMERGE
         environment variable and your  configuration  files.   Previous  file
         contents are saved with a .orig suffix.

       · hg resolve -m [FILE]: mark a file as having been resolved (e.g. after
         having manually fixed-up the files). The default is to mark all unre‐
         solved files.

       · hg resolve -u [FILE]...: mark a file as unresolved. The default is to
         mark all resolved files.

       · hg resolve -l: list files which had or still have conflicts.  In  the
         printed list, U = unresolved and R = resolved.  You can use set:unre‐
         solved() or set:resolved() to filter the list. See hg  help  filesets
         for details.

       Note   Mercurial  will  not  let you commit files with unresolved merge
              conflicts. You must use hg resolve -m ... before you can  commit
              after a conflicting merge.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions. See also hg help templates.

       mergestatus
              String. Character denoting merge conflicts, U or R.

       path   String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if any files fail a resolve attempt.

       Options:

       -a, --all
              select all unresolved files

       -l, --list
              list state of files needing merge

       -m, --mark
              mark files as resolved

       -u, --unmark
              mark files as unresolved

       -n, --no-status
              hide status prefix

       --re-merge
              re-merge files

       -t,--tool <TOOL>
              specify merge tool

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   revert
       restore files to their checkout state:

       hg revert [OPTION]... [-r REV] [NAME]...

       Note   To check out earlier revisions, you should use  hg  update  REV.
              To  cancel  an uncommitted merge (and lose your changes), use hg
              merge --abort.

       With no revision specified, revert the specified files  or  directories
       to  the contents they had in the parent of the working directory.  This
       restores the contents of files to an unmodified state  and  unschedules
       adds,  removes,  copies,  and renames. If the working directory has two
       parents, you must explicitly specify a revision.

       Using the -r/--rev or -d/--date options,  revert  the  given  files  or
       directories  to  their states as of a specific revision. Because revert
       does not change the working directory parents, this  will  cause  these
       files to appear modified. This can be helpful to "back out" some or all
       of an earlier change. See hg backout for a related method.

       Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting.  To dis‐
       able these backups, use --no-backup. It is possible to store the backup
       files in a custom directory relative to the root of the  repository  by
       setting the ui.origbackuppath configuration option.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       See  hg  help  backout for  a  way  to reverse the effect of an earlier
       changeset.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -a, --all
              revert all changes when no arguments given

       -d,--date <DATE>
              tipmost revision matching date

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revert to the specified revision

       -C, --no-backup
              do not save backup copies of files

       -i, --interactive
              interactively select the changes

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   rollback
       roll back the last transaction (DANGEROUS) (DEPRECATED):

       hg rollback

       Please use hg commit --amend instead of rollback to correct mistakes in
       the last commit.

       This command should be used with care. There is only one level of roll‐
       back, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also restore  the
       dirstate  at  the  time  of  the  last transaction, losing any dirstate
       changes since that time. This command does not alter the working direc‐
       tory.

       Transactions  are  used to encapsulate the effects of all commands that
       create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into  a  reposi‐
       tory.

       For  example,  the  following  commands  are  transactional,  and their
       effects can be rolled back:

       · commit

       · import

       · pull

       · push (with this repository as the destination)

       · unbundle

       To avoid permanent data loss, rollback will refuse to rollback a commit
       transaction  if it isn't checked out. Use --force to override this pro‐
       tection.

       The rollback command can be entirely disabled by setting  the  ui.roll‐
       back configuration setting to false. If you're here because you want to
       use rollback and it's disabled, you can re-enable the command  by  set‐
       ting ui.rollback to true.

       This  command  is  not  intended  for  use on public repositories. Once
       changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction back
       locally  is  ineffective  (someone  else  may  already  have pulled the
       changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of  the  reposi‐
       tory; for example an in-progress pull from the repository may fail if a
       rollback is performed.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.

       Options:

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       -f, --force
              ignore safety measures

   root
       print the root (top) of the current working directory:

       hg root

       Print the root directory of the current repository.

       Returns 0 on success.

   serve
       start stand-alone webserver:

       hg serve [OPTION]...

       Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server. You can use this
       for  ad-hoc  sharing and browsing of repositories. It is recommended to
       use a real web server to serve a repository for longer periods of time.

       Please note that the server does not implement  access  control.   This
       means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and nobody can
       write to it by default. Set the web.allow-push option  to  *  to  allow
       everybody  to  push  to the server. You should use a real web server if
       you need to authenticate users.

       By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and  errors  to  stderr.
       Use the -A/--accesslog and -E/--errorlog options to log to files.

       To  have  the  server choose a free port number to listen on, specify a
       port number of 0; in this case, the server will print the  port  number
       it uses.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -A,--accesslog <FILE>
              name of access log file to write to

       -d, --daemon
              run server in background

       --daemon-postexec <VALUE[+]>
              used internally by daemon mode

       -E,--errorlog <FILE>
              name of error log file to write to

       -p,--port <PORT>
              port to listen on (default: 8000)

       -a,--address <ADDR>
              address to listen on (default: all interfaces)

       --prefix <PREFIX>
              prefix path to serve from (default: server root)

       -n,--name <NAME>
              name to show in web pages (default: working directory)

       --web-conf <FILE>
              name of the hgweb config file (see 'hg help hgweb')

       --webdir-conf <FILE>
              name of the hgweb config file (DEPRECATED)

       --pid-file <FILE>
              name of file to write process ID to

       --stdio
              for remote clients (ADVANCED)

       --cmdserver <MODE>
              for remote clients (ADVANCED)

       -t,--templates <TEMPLATE>
              web templates to use

       --style <STYLE>
              template style to use

       -6, --ipv6
              use IPv6 in addition to IPv4

       --certificate <FILE>
              SSL certificate file

       --print-url
              start and print only the URL

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   status
       show changed files in the working directory:

       hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Show  status of files in the repository. If names are given, only files
       that match are shown. Files that are clean or ignored or the source  of
       a  copy/move operation, are not listed unless -c/--clean, -i/--ignored,
       -C/--copies or -A/--all are given.  Unless options described with "show
       only ..." are given, the options -mardu are used.

       Option  -q/--quiet  hides  untracked (unknown and ignored) files unless
       explicitly requested with -u/--unknown or -i/--ignored.

       Note   hg status may appear to disagree with diff if  permissions  have
              changed  or  a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does
              not report permission changes and diff only reports changes rel‐
              ative to one merge parent.

       If  one  revision  is  given,  it is used as the base revision.  If two
       revisions are given,  the  differences  between  them  are  shown.  The
       --change  option  can  also  be  used as a shortcut to list the changed
       files of a revision from its first parent.

       The codes used to show the status of files are:

       M = modified
       A = added
       R = removed
       C = clean
       ! = missing (deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked)
       ? = not tracked
       I = ignored
         = origin of the previous file (with --copies)

       The -t/--terse option abbreviates the output by showing only the direc‐
       tory  name  if  all  the  files in it share the same status. The option
       takes an argument indicating the statuses to abbreviate: 'm' for 'modi‐
       fied',  'a'  for 'added', 'r' for 'removed', 'd' for 'deleted', 'u' for
       'unknown', 'i' for 'ignored' and 'c' for clean.

       It abbreviates only those statuses which are passed.  Note  that  clean
       and  ignored  files  are  not  displayed  with  '--terse ic' unless the
       -c/--clean and -i/--ignored options are also used.

       The -v/--verbose option shows information when the repository is in  an
       unfinished  merge, shelve, rebase state etc. You can have this behavior
       turned on by default by enabling the commands.status.verbose option.

       You can skip displaying some of these states by  setting  commands.sta‐
       tus.skipstates  to  one  or  more  of:  'bisect',  'graft', 'histedit',
       'merge', 'rebase', or 'unshelve'.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions. See also hg help templates.

       path   String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       source String.  Repository-absolute  path  of the file originated from.
              Available if --copies is specified.

       status String. Character denoting file's status.

       Examples:

       · show changes in the working directory relative to a changeset:

         hg status --rev 9353

       · show changes in the working directory relative to the current  direc‐
         tory (see hg help patterns for more information):

         hg status re:

       · show all changes including copies in an existing changeset:

         hg status --copies --change 9353

       · get a NUL separated list of added files, suitable for xargs:

         hg status -an0

       · show  more  information  about  the  repository  status, abbreviating
         added, removed, modified, deleted, and untracked paths:

         hg status -v -t mardu

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -A, --all
              show status of all files

       -m, --modified
              show only modified files

       -a, --added
              show only added files

       -r, --removed
              show only removed files

       -d, --deleted
              show only deleted (but tracked) files

       -c, --clean
              show only files without changes

       -u, --unknown
              show only unknown (not tracked) files

       -i, --ignored
              show only ignored files

       -n, --no-status
              hide status prefix

       -t,--terse <VALUE>
              show the terse output (EXPERIMENTAL) (default: nothing)

       -C, --copies
              show source of copied files

       -0, --print0
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs

       --rev <REV[+]>
              show difference from revision

       --change <REV>
              list the changed files of a revision

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>

   summary
       summarize working directory state:

       hg summary [--remote]

       This generates a brief summary of the working directory state,  includ‐
       ing parents, branch, commit status, phase and available updates.

       With  the --remote option, this will check the default paths for incom‐
       ing and outgoing changes. This can be time-consuming.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       --remote
              check for push and pull

              aliases: sum

   tag
       add one or more tags for the current or given revision:

       hg tag [-f] [-l] [-m TEXT] [-d DATE] [-u USER] [-r REV] NAME...

       Name a particular revision using <name>.

       Tags are used to name particular revisions of the  repository  and  are
       very  useful  to compare different revisions, to go back to significant
       earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc. Changing an
       existing tag is normally disallowed; use -f/--force to override.

       If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used.

       To  facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags, they
       are stored as a file named ".hgtags"  which  is  managed  similarly  to
       other  project  files  and  can  be hand-edited if necessary. This also
       means that tagging creates a new commit. The  file  ".hg/localtags"  is
       used for local tags (not shared among repositories).

       Tag  commits are usually made at the head of a branch. If the parent of
       the working  directory  is  not  a  branch  head,  hg  tag aborts;  use
       -f/--force to force the tag commit to be based on a non-head changeset.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Since tag names have priority over branch names during revision lookup,
       using an existing branch name as a tag name is discouraged.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -f, --force
              force tag

       -l, --local
              make the tag local

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revision to tag

       --remove
              remove a tag

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -d,--date <DATE>
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u,--user <USER>
              record the specified user as committer

   tags
       list repository tags:

       hg tags

       This lists both regular and local tags. When the -v/--verbose switch is
       used,  a  third  column  "local"  is  printed for local tags.  When the
       -q/--quiet switch is used, only the tag name is printed.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common template
       keywords and functions such as {tag}. See also hg help templates.

       type   String. local for local tags.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   tip
       show the tip revision (DEPRECATED):

       hg tip [-p] [-g]

       The  tip  revision  (usually just called the tip) is the changeset most
       recently added to the  repository  (and  therefore  the  most  recently
       changed head).

       If  you  have  just  made a commit, that commit will be the tip. If you
       have just pulled changes from  another  repository,  the  tip  of  that
       repository becomes the current tip. The "tip" tag is special and cannot
       be renamed or assigned to a different changeset.

       This command is deprecated, please use hg heads instead.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -p, --patch
              show patch

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       --style <STYLE>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   unbundle
       apply one or more bundle files:

       hg unbundle [-u] FILE...

       Apply one or more bundle files generated by hg bundle.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update has unresolved files.

       Options:

       -u, --update
              update to new branch head if changesets were unbundled

   update
       update working directory (or switch revisions):

       hg update [-C|-c|-m] [-d DATE] [[-r] REV]

       Update the repository's working directory to the  specified  changeset.
       If  no  changeset  is specified, update to the tip of the current named
       branch and move the active bookmark (see hg help bookmarks).

       Update sets the working directory's parent revision  to  the  specified
       changeset (see hg help parents).

       If  the changeset is not a descendant or ancestor of the working direc‐
       tory's parent and there are uncommitted changes, the update is aborted.
       With the -c/--check option, the working directory is checked for uncom‐
       mitted changes; if none are found, the working directory is updated  to
       the specified changeset.

       The -C/--clean, -c/--check, and -m/--merge options control what happens
       if the working directory contains uncommitted changes.  At most of  one
       of them can be specified.

       1. If  no  option  is  specified,  and if the requested changeset is an
          ancestor or descendant of the working directory's parent, the uncom‐
          mitted  changes  are  merged  into  the  requested changeset and the
          merged result is left uncommitted. If the requested changeset is not
          an  ancestor  or  descendant (that is, it is on another branch), the
          update is aborted and the uncommitted changes are preserved.

       2. With the -m/--merge option,  the  update  is  allowed  even  if  the
          requested  changeset is not an ancestor or descendant of the working
          directory's parent.

       3. With the -c/--check option, the update is aborted and the  uncommit‐
          ted changes are preserved.

       4. With  the  -C/--clean  option, uncommitted changes are discarded and
          the working directory is updated to the requested changeset.

       To cancel an uncommitted merge (and lose your changes),  use  hg  merge
       --abort.

       Use  null  as  the  changeset  to remove the working directory (like hg
       clone -U).

       If you want to revert just one file to an older revision, use hg revert
       [-r REV] NAME.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

       Options:

       -C, --clean
              discard uncommitted changes (no backup)

       -c, --check
              require clean working directory

       -m, --merge
              merge uncommitted changes

       -d,--date <DATE>
              tipmost revision matching date

       -r,--rev <REV>

   verify
       verify the integrity of the repository:

       hg verify

       Verify the integrity of the current repository.

       This  will  perform  an  extensive check of the repository's integrity,
       validating the hashes and checksums of each  entry  in  the  changelog,
       manifest,  and  tracked  files,  as  well  as  the  integrity  of their
       crosslinks and indices.

BUNDLE FILE FORMATS
       Mercurial supports  generating  standalone  "bundle"  files  that  hold
       repository  data.  These "bundles" are typically saved locally and used
       later or exchanged between different repositories, possibly on  differ‐
       ent  machines.  Example  commands  using  bundles  are hg bundle and hg
       unbundle.

       Generation of bundle files is controlled by  a  "bundle  specification"
       ("bundlespec")  string. This string tells the bundle generation process
       how to create the bundle.

       A "bundlespec" string is composed of the following elements:

       type   A string denoting the bundle format to use.

       compression
              Denotes the compression engine to use compressing the raw bundle
              data.

       parameters
              Arbitrary key-value parameters to further control bundle genera‐
              tion.

       A "bundlespec" string has the following formats:

       <type> The literal bundle format string is used.

       <compression>-<type>
              The compression engine and format are delimited by a hyphen (-).

       Optional parameters follow  the  <type>.  Parameters  are  URI  escaped
       key=value  pairs.  Each pair is delimited by a semicolon (;). The first
       parameter begins after a ; immediately following the <type> value.

   Available Types
       The following bundle <type> strings are available:

       v1     Produces a legacy "changegroup" version 1 bundle.

              This format is compatible  with  nearly  all  Mercurial  clients
              because  it  is  the  oldest.  However, it has some limitations,
              which is why it is no longer the default for new repositories.

              v1 bundles can be used with modern repositories using the  "gen‐
              eraldelta"  storage  format. However, it may take longer to pro‐
              duce the bundle and the resulting bundle  may  be  significantly
              larger than a v2 bundle.

              v1  bundles  can  only use the gzip, bzip2, and none compression
              formats.

       v2     Produces a version 2 bundle.

              Version 2 bundles are an extensible format that can store  addi‐
              tional  repository  data  (such as bookmarks and phases informa‐
              tion) and they can store data  more  efficiently,  resulting  in
              smaller bundles.

              Version  2 bundles can also use modern compression engines, such
              as zstd, making them faster to compress and often smaller.

   Available Compression Engines
       The following bundle <compression> engines can be used:

       bzip2

              An algorithm that produces smaller bundles than gzip.

              All Mercurial clients should support this format.

              This engine will likely produce smaller bundles  than  gzip  but
              will be significantly slower, both during compression and decom‐
              pression.

              If available, the zstd engine can yield similar or  better  com‐
              pression at much higher speeds.

       gzip

              zlib compression using the DEFLATE algorithm.

              All  Mercurial  clients should support this format. The compres‐
              sion algorithm strikes a reasonable balance between  compression
              ratio and size.

       none

              No compression is performed.

              Use this compression engine to explicitly disable compression.

   Examples
       v2

              Produce  a  v2  bundle using default options, including compres‐
              sion.

       none-v1

              Produce a v1 bundle with no compression.

       zstd-v2

              Produce a v2 bundle with  zstandard  compression  using  default
              settings.

       zstd-v1

              This errors because zstd is not supported for v1 types.

COLORIZING OUTPUTS
       Mercurial colorizes output from several commands.

       For example, the diff command shows additions in green and deletions in
       red, while the status command shows modified  files  in  magenta.  Many
       other commands have analogous colors. It is possible to customize these
       colors.

       To enable color (default) whenever possible use:

       [ui]
       color = yes

       To disable color use:

       [ui]
       color = no

       See hg help config.ui.color for details.

       The default pager on Windows does not support color,  so  enabling  the
       pager  will  effectively disable color.  See hg help config.ui.paginate
       to disable the pager.  Alternately, MSYS and Cygwin shells provide less
       as  a  pager, which can be configured to support ANSI color mode.  Win‐
       dows 10 natively supports ANSI color mode.

   Mode
       Mercurial can use various systems to display color. The supported modes
       are  ansi,  win32,  and terminfo.  See hg help config.color for details
       about how to control the mode.

   Effects
       Other effects in addition to color, like bold and underlined text,  are
       also  available.  By default, the terminfo database is used to find the
       terminal codes used to change color and effect.   If  terminfo  is  not
       available, then effects are rendered with the ECMA-48 SGR control func‐
       tion (aka ANSI escape codes).

       The available effects in terminfo  mode  are  'blink',  'bold',  'dim',
       'inverse',  'invisible',  'italic',  'standout',  and  'underline';  in
       ECMA-48 mode, the options are 'bold', 'inverse', 'italic', and  'under‐
       line'.   How  each  is rendered depends on the terminal emulator.  Some
       may not be available for a given terminal type, and  will  be  silently
       ignored.

       If  the terminfo entry for your terminal is missing codes for an effect
       or has the wrong codes, you can add or override  those  codes  in  your
       configuration:

       [color]
       terminfo.dim = \E[2m

       where 'E' is substituted with an escape character.

   Labels
       Text  receives  color effects depending on the labels that it has. Many
       default Mercurial commands emit labelled text. You can also define your
       own labels in templates using the label function, see hg help templates
       . A single portion of text may have more than one label. In that  case,
       effects  given  to the last label will override any other effects. This
       includes the special "none" effect, which nullifies other effects.

       Labels are normally invisible. In order to see these labels  and  their
       position  in  the  text,  use the global --color=debug option. The same
       anchor text may be associated to multiple labels, e.g.

          [log.changeset changeset.secret|changeset:   22611:6f0a53c8f587]

       The following are the default effects for some default labels.  Default
       effects may be overridden from your configuration file:

       [color]
       status.modified = blue bold underline red_background
       status.added = green bold
       status.removed = red bold blue_background
       status.deleted = cyan bold underline
       status.unknown = magenta bold underline
       status.ignored = black bold

       # 'none' turns off all effects
       status.clean = none
       status.copied = none

       qseries.applied = blue bold underline
       qseries.unapplied = black bold
       qseries.missing = red bold

       diff.diffline = bold
       diff.extended = cyan bold
       diff.file_a = red bold
       diff.file_b = green bold
       diff.hunk = magenta

       histedit.remaining = red bold

   Custom colors
       Because  there  are only eight standard colors, Mercurial allows you to
       define color names for other color slots which might be  available  for
       your terminal type, assuming terminfo mode.  For instance:

       color.brightblue = 12
       color.pink = 207
       color.orange = 202

       to  set  'brightblue'  to  color slot 12 (useful for 16 color terminals
       that have brighter colors defined in the upper eight) and,  'pink'  and
       'orange'  to  colors  in  256-color  xterm's default color cube.  These
       defined colors may then be  used  as  any  of  the  pre-defined  eight,
       including appending '_background' to set the background to that color.

DATE FORMATS
       Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:

       · backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.

       · log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.

       Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:

       · Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 (local timezone assumed)

       · Dec 6 13:18 -0600 (year assumed, time offset provided)

       · Dec 6 13:18 UTC (UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)

       · Dec 6 (midnight)

       · 13:18 (today assumed)

       · 3:39 (3:39AM assumed)

       · 3:39pm (15:39)

       · 2006-12-06 13:18:29 (ISO 8601 format)

       · 2006-12-6 13:18

       · 2006-12-6

       · 12-6

       · 12/6

       · 12/6/6 (Dec 6 2006)

       · today (midnight)

       · yesterday (midnight)

       · now - right now

       Lastly, there is Mercurial's internal format:

       · 1165411109 0 (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)

       This  is the internal representation format for dates. The first number
       is the number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01  00:00  UTC).  The
       second  is  the  offset  of  the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC
       (negative if the timezone is east of UTC).

       The log command also accepts date ranges:

       · <DATE - at or before a given date/time

       · >DATE - on or after a given date/time

       · DATE to DATE - a date range, inclusive

       · -DAYS - within a given number of days of today

DEPRECATED FEATURES
       Mercurial evolves over time, some features, options,  commands  may  be
       replaced  by  better and more secure alternatives. This topic will help
       you migrating your existing usage and/or configuration  to  newer  fea‐
       tures.

   Commands
       The following commands are still available but their use are not recom‐
       mended:

       locate

       This command has been replaced by hg files.

       parents

       This command can be replaced by hg summary or hg log  with  appropriate
       revsets. See hg help revsets for more information.

       tip

       The recommended alternative is hg heads.

   Options
       web.allowpull

              Renamed to allow-pull.

       web.allow_push

              Renamed to allow-push.

DIFF FORMATS
       Mercurial's  default format for showing changes between two versions of
       a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can  be
       used by GNU patch and many other standard tools.

       While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the fol‐
       lowing information:

       · executable status and other permission bits

       · copy or rename information

       · changes in binary files

       · creation or deletion of empty files

       Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS which
       addresses  these  limitations.  The  git diff format is not produced by
       default because a few widespread tools still  do  not  understand  this
       format.

       This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository (e.g.
       with hg export), you should be careful about things  like  file  copies
       and  renames  or  other things mentioned above, because when applying a
       standard diff to a different  repository,  this  extra  information  is
       lost.  Mercurial's  internal  operations  (like  push and pull) are not
       affected by this, because they use an internal binary format for commu‐
       nicating changes.

       To  make  Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the --git
       option available for many commands, or set 'git = True' in  the  [diff]
       section  of your configuration file. You do not need to set this option
       when importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       HG     Path to the 'hg' executable, automatically passed  when  running
              hooks,  extensions or external tools. If unset or empty, this is
              the hg executable's name if it's frozen, or an executable  named
              'hg'  (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions
              on Windows) is searched.

       HGEDITOR
              This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See  EDI‐
              TOR.

              (deprecated, see hg help config.ui.editor)

       HGENCODING
              This overrides the default locale setting detected by Mercurial.
              This setting  is  used  to  convert  data  including  usernames,
              changeset  descriptions,  tag  names, and branches. This setting
              can be overridden with the --encoding command-line option.

       HGENCODINGMODE
              This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling  unknown  characters
              while  transcoding  user  input.  The default is "strict", which
              causes Mercurial to abort if it can't  map  a  character.  Other
              settings  include  "replace", which replaces unknown characters,
              and "ignore", which drops them. This setting can  be  overridden
              with the --encodingmode command-line option.

       HGENCODINGAMBIGUOUS
              This  sets  Mercurial's  behavior  for  handling characters with
              "ambiguous" widths like  accented  Latin  characters  with  East
              Asian  fonts. By default, Mercurial assumes ambiguous characters
              are narrow, set this variable to "wide" if such characters cause
              formatting problems.

       HGMERGE
              An  executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program
              will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote  file,
              ancestor file.

              (deprecated, see hg help config.ui.merge)

       HGRCPATH
              A  list  of  files  or  directories  to search for configuration
              files. Item separator is ":" on Unix, ";" on Windows.  If  HGRC‐
              PATH is not set, platform default search path is used. If empty,
              only the .hg/hgrc from the current repository is read.

              For each element in HGRCPATH:

              · if it's a directory, all files ending with .rc are added

              · otherwise, the file itself will be added

       HGPLAIN
              When set, this disables any configuration  settings  that  might
              change  Mercurial's  default  output.  This  includes  encoding,
              defaults, verbose mode, debug mode, quiet mode, tracebacks,  and
              localization.  This  can be useful when scripting against Mercu‐
              rial in the face of existing user configuration.

              In addition to the features disabled by HGPLAIN=, the  following
              values can be specified to adjust behavior:

              +strictflags

                     Restrict parsing of command line flags.

              Equivalent  options  set  via  command line flags or environment
              variables are not overridden.

              See hg help scripting for details.

       HGPLAINEXCEPT
              This is a comma-separated list  of  features  to  preserve  when
              HGPLAIN  is  enabled.  Currently  the  following values are sup‐
              ported:

              alias

                     Don't remove aliases.

              color

                     Don't disable colored output.

              i18n

                     Preserve internationalization.

              revsetalias

                     Don't remove revset aliases.

              templatealias

                     Don't remove template aliases.

              progress

                     Don't hide progress output.

              Setting HGPLAINEXCEPT to anything (even an  empty  string)  will
              enable plain mode.

       HGUSER This  is  the string used as the author of a commit. If not set,
              available values will be considered in this order:

              · HGUSER (deprecated)

              · configuration files from the HGRCPATH

              · EMAIL

              · interactive prompt

              · LOGNAME (with @hostname appended)

              (deprecated, see hg help config.ui.username)

       EMAIL  May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

       LOGNAME
              May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

       VISUAL This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See  EDI‐
              TOR.

       EDITOR Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor for a
              user to modify, for example when writing  commit  messages.  The
              editor it uses is determined by looking at the environment vari‐
              ables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR,  in  that  order.  The  first
              non-empty  one  is  chosen. If all of them are empty, the editor
              defaults to 'vi'.

       PYTHONPATH
              This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need  to
              be  set  appropriately  if  this Mercurial is not installed sys‐
              tem-wide.

USING ADDITIONAL FEATURES
       Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of exten‐
       sions.  Extensions  may  add new commands, add options to existing com‐
       mands, change the default behavior of commands, or implement hooks.

       To enable the "foo" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in  the
       Python  search path, create an entry for it in your configuration file,
       like this:

       [extensions]
       foo =

       You may also specify the full path to an extension:

       [extensions]
       myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py

       See hg help config for more information on configuration files.

       Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons: they can
       increase  startup  overhead; they may be meant for advanced usage only;
       they may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such as  letting  you
       destroy  or modify history); they might not be ready for prime time; or
       they may alter some usual behaviors of stock Mercurial. It is  thus  up
       to the user to activate extensions as needed.

       To  explicitly  disable an extension enabled in a configuration file of
       broader scope, prepend its path with !:

       [extensions]
       # disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
       bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
       # ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
       baz = !

       disabled extensions:

          acl    hooks for controlling repository access

          blackbox
                 log repository events to a blackbox for debugging

SPECIFYING FILE SETS
       Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of files.

       Like other file patterns, this pattern type is indicated by  a  prefix,
       'set:'.  The  language supports a number of predicates which are joined
       by infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.

       Identifiers such as filenames or patterns must be quoted with single or
       double    quotes    if    they    contain    characters    outside   of
       [.*{}[]?/\_a-zA-Z0-9\x80-\xff] or if they match one of  the  predefined
       predicates.  This  generally  applies to file patterns other than globs
       and arguments for predicates. Pattern prefixes such  as  path:  may  be
       specified without quoting.

       Special  characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
       e.g., \n is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being inter‐
       preted, strings can be prefixed with r, e.g. r'...'.

       See also hg help patterns.

   Operators
       There is a single prefix operator:

       not x

              Files not in x. Short form is ! x.

       These are the supported infix operators:

       x and y

              The intersection of files in x and y. Short form is x & y.

       x or y

              The  union  of files in x and y. There are two alternative short
              forms: x | y and x + y.

       x - y

              Files in x but not in y.

   Predicates
       The following predicates are supported:

       added()

              File that is added according to hg status.

       binary()

              File that appears to be binary (contains NUL bytes).

       clean()

              File that is clean according to hg status.

       copied()

              File that is recorded as being copied.

       deleted()

              Alias for missing().

       encoding(name)

              File can be successfully decoded with the given character encod‐
              ing. May not be useful for encodings other than ASCII and UTF-8.

       eol(style)

              File  contains  newlines  of  the  given style (dos, unix, mac).
              Binary files are excluded, files with mixed line  endings  match
              multiple styles.

       exec()

              File that is marked as executable.

       grep(regex)

              File contains the given regular expression.

       hgignore()

              File that matches the active .hgignore pattern.

       ignored()

              File that is ignored according to hg status.

       missing()

              File that is missing according to hg status.

       modified()

              File that is modified according to hg status.

       portable()

              File  that  has a portable name. (This doesn't include filenames
              with case collisions.)

       removed()

              File that is removed according to hg status.

       resolved()

              File that is marked resolved according to hg resolve -l.

       revs(revs, pattern)

              Evaluate set in the specified revisions.  If  the  revset  match
              multiple  revs, this will return file matching pattern in any of
              the revision.

       size(expression)

              File size matches the given expression. Examples:

              · size('1k') - files from 1024 to 2047 bytes

              · size('< 20k') - files less than 20480 bytes

              · size('>= .5MB') - files at least 524288 bytes

              · size('4k - 1MB') - files from 4096 bytes to 1048576 bytes

       status(base, rev, pattern)

              Evaluate predicate using status change  between  base  and  rev.
              Examples:

              · status(3, 7, added()) - matches files added from "3" to "7"

       subrepo([pattern])

              Subrepositories whose paths match the given pattern.

       symlink()

              File that is marked as a symlink.

       tracked()

              File that is under Mercurial control.

       unknown()

              File that is unknown according to hg status.

       unresolved()

              File that is marked unresolved according to hg resolve -l.

   Examples
       Some sample queries:

       · Show  status  of files that appear to be binary in the working direc‐
         tory:

         hg status -A "set:binary()"

       · Forget files that are in .hgignore but are already tracked:

         hg forget "set:hgignore() and not ignored()"

       · Find text files that contain a string:

         hg files "set:grep(magic) and not binary()"

       · Find C files in a non-standard encoding:

         hg files "set:**.c and not encoding('UTF-8')"

       · Revert copies of large binary files:

         hg revert "set:copied() and binary() and size('>1M')"

       · Revert files that were added to the working directory:

         hg revert "set:revs('wdir()', added())"

       · Remove files listed in foo.lst that contain the letter a or b:

         hg remove "set: listfile:foo.lst and (**a* or **b*)"

COMMAND-LINE FLAGS
       Most Mercurial commands accept various flags.

   Flag names
       Flags for each command are listed in hg help for that  command.   Addi‐
       tionally,  some flags, such as --repository, are global and can be used
       with any command - those are seen in hg help -v, and can  be  specified
       before or after the command.

       Every  flag  has at least a long name, such as --repository. Some flags
       may also have a short one-letter name, such as the equivalent -R. Using
       the short or long name is equivalent and has the same effect.

       Flags  that  have  a  short  name  can  also  be bundled together - for
       instance, to specify both --edit (short -e)  and  --interactive  (short
       -i), one could use:

       hg commit -ei

       If  any  of the bundled flags takes a value (i.e. is not a boolean), it
       must be last, followed by the value:

       hg commit -im 'Message'

   Flag types
       Mercurial command-line flags can  be  strings,  numbers,  booleans,  or
       lists of strings.

   Specifying flag values
       The  following  syntaxes  are  allowed, assuming a flag 'flagname' with
       short name 'f':

       --flagname=foo
       --flagname foo
       -f foo
       -ffoo

       This syntax applies to  all  non-boolean  flags  (strings,  numbers  or
       lists).

   Specifying boolean flags
       Boolean  flags do not take a value parameter. To specify a boolean, use
       the flag name to set it to true, or the same name prefixed  with  'no-'
       to set it to false:

       hg commit --interactive
       hg commit --no-interactive

   Specifying list flags
       List  flags take multiple values. To specify them, pass the flag multi‐
       ple times:

       hg files --include mercurial --include tests

   Setting flag defaults
       In order to set a default value for a flag in an hgrc file, it is  rec‐
       ommended to use aliases:

       [alias]
       commit = commit --interactive

       For more information on hgrc files, see hg help config.

   Overriding flags on the command line
       If  the  same  non-list flag is specified multiple times on the command
       line, the latest specification is used:

       hg commit -m "Ignored value" -m "Used value"

       This includes the use of aliases - e.g., if one has:

       [alias]
       committemp = commit -m "Ignored value"

       then the following command will override that -m:

       hg committemp -m "Used value"

   Overriding flag defaults
       Every flag has a default value, and you may also set your own  defaults
       in  hgrc  as  described  above.  Except for list flags, defaults can be
       overridden on the command line simply by specifying the  flag  in  that
       location.

   Hidden flags
       Some flags are not shown in a command's help by default - specifically,
       those that are deemed to be experimental, deprecated  or  advanced.  To
       show all flags, add the --verbose flag for the help command:

       hg help --verbose commit

GLOSSARY
       Ancestor
              Any changeset that can be reached by an unbroken chain of parent
              changesets from a given changeset. More precisely, the ancestors
              of  a  changeset can be defined by two properties: a parent of a
              changeset is an ancestor, and a parent  of  an  ancestor  is  an
              ancestor. See also: 'Descendant'.

       Bookmark
              Bookmarks are pointers to certain commits that move when commit‐
              ting. They are similar to tags in that it  is  possible  to  use
              bookmark names in all places where Mercurial expects a changeset
              ID, e.g., with hg update. Unlike tags, bookmarks move along when
              you make a commit.

              Bookmarks  can  be  renamed,  copied  and deleted. Bookmarks are
              local, unless they  are  explicitly  pushed  or  pulled  between
              repositories.   Pushing  and pulling bookmarks allow you to col‐
              laborate with others  on  a  branch  without  creating  a  named
              branch.

       Branch (Noun)  A  child  changeset  that has been created from a parent
              that is not a head. These are known as topological branches, see
              'Branch,  topological'.  If  a  topological  branch is named, it
              becomes a named branch. If a topological branch is not named, it
              becomes   an  anonymous  branch.  See  'Branch,  anonymous'  and
              'Branch, named'.

              Branches may be created when changes are pulled from  or  pushed
              to  a remote repository, since new heads may be created by these
              operations. Note that the term branch can also  be  used  infor‐
              mally  to describe a development process in which certain devel‐
              opment is done independently of other development. This is some‐
              times  done  explicitly  with a named branch, but it can also be
              done locally, using bookmarks or clones and anonymous branches.

              Example: "The experimental branch."

              (Verb) The action of creating a child changeset which results in
              its parent having more than one child.

              Example: "I'm going to branch at X."

       Branch, anonymous
              Every  time  a new child changeset is created from a parent that
              is not a head and the name of the branch is not changed,  a  new
              anonymous branch is created.

       Branch, closed
              A named branch whose branch heads have all been closed.

       Branch, default
              The  branch  assigned to a changeset when no name has previously
              been assigned.

       Branch head
              See 'Head, branch'.

       Branch, inactive
              If a named branch has no topological heads, it is considered  to
              be  inactive.  As  an example, a feature branch becomes inactive
              when it is merged into the default branch. The hg  branches com‐
              mand shows inactive branches by default, though they can be hid‐
              den with hg branches --active.

              NOTE: this concept is deprecated because  it  is  too  implicit.
              Branches  should  now  be  explicitly  closed  using  hg  commit
              --close-branch when they are no longer needed.

       Branch, named
              A collection of changesets which have the same branch  name.  By
              default, children of a changeset in a named branch belong to the
              same named branch. A child can be explicitly assigned to a  dif‐
              ferent  branch. See hg help branch, hg help branches and hg com‐
              mit --close-branch for more information on managing branches.

              Named branches can be thought of as a kind of namespace,  divid‐
              ing  the  collection  of changesets that comprise the repository
              into a collection of disjoint subsets. A  named  branch  is  not
              necessarily  a topological branch. If a new named branch is cre‐
              ated from the head of  another  named  branch,  or  the  default
              branch,  but  no  further  changesets are added to that previous
              branch, then that previous branch will be a branch in name only.

       Branch tip
              See 'Tip, branch'.

       Branch, topological
              Every time a new child changeset is created from a  parent  that
              is  not  a head, a new topological branch is created. If a topo‐
              logical branch is named, it becomes a named branch. If  a  topo‐
              logical  branch  is not named, it becomes an anonymous branch of
              the current, possibly default, branch.

       Changelog
              A record of the changesets in the order in which they were added
              to  the  repository. This includes details such as changeset id,
              author, commit message, date, and list of changed files.

       Changeset
              A snapshot of the state of  the  repository  used  to  record  a
              change.

       Changeset, child
              The  converse of parent changeset: if P is a parent of C, then C
              is a child of P. There is no limit to  the  number  of  children
              that a changeset may have.

       Changeset id
              A  SHA-1  hash  that  uniquely identifies a changeset. It may be
              represented as either a "long" 40 hexadecimal digit string, or a
              "short" 12 hexadecimal digit string.

       Changeset, merge
              A  changeset  with two parents. This occurs when a merge is com‐
              mitted.

       Changeset, parent
              A revision upon which a child changeset is based.  Specifically,
              a  parent  changeset  of a changeset C is a changeset whose node
              immediately precedes C in the DAG. Changesets have at  most  two
              parents.

       Checkout
              (Noun)  The  working directory being updated to a specific revi‐
              sion. This use should probably be  avoided  where  possible,  as
              changeset  is  much  more appropriate than checkout in this con‐
              text.

              Example: "I'm using checkout X."

              (Verb) Updating the working directory to a  specific  changeset.
              See hg help update.

              Example: "I'm going to check out changeset X."

       Child changeset
              See 'Changeset, child'.

       Close changeset
              See 'Head, closed branch'.

       Closed branch
              See 'Branch, closed'.

       Clone  (Noun)  An  entire  or partial copy of a repository. The partial
              clone must be in the form of a revision and its ancestors.

              Example: "Is your clone up to date?"

              (Verb) The process of creating a clone, using hg clone.

              Example: "I'm going to clone the repository."

       Closed branch head
              See 'Head, closed branch'.

       Commit (Noun) A synonym for changeset.

              Example: "Is the bug fixed in your recent commit?"

              (Verb) The act of recording changes to a repository. When  files
              are  committed  in a working directory, Mercurial finds the dif‐
              ferences between the committed files and their parent changeset,
              creating a new changeset in the repository.

              Example: "You should commit those changes now."

       Cset   A common abbreviation of the term changeset.

       DAG    The  repository  of  changesets of a distributed version control
              system (DVCS) can be  described  as  a  directed  acyclic  graph
              (DAG),  consisting of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to
              changesets and edges imply a  parent  ->  child  relation.  This
              graph  can  be  visualized  by  graphical  tools  such as hg log
              --graph. In Mercurial, the DAG is limited by the requirement for
              children to have at most two parents.

       Deprecated
              Feature  removed  from  documentation,  but  not  scheduled  for
              removal.

       Default branch
              See 'Branch, default'.

       Descendant
              Any changeset that can be reached by a chain of child changesets
              from  a  given  changeset.  More precisely, the descendants of a
              changeset can be defined by  two  properties:  the  child  of  a
              changeset  is  a  descendant, and the child of a descendant is a
              descendant. See also: 'Ancestor'.

       Diff   (Noun) The difference between the  contents  and  attributes  of
              files  in  two changesets or a changeset and the current working
              directory. The difference is usually represented in  a  standard
              form  called  a "diff" or "patch". The "git diff" format is used
              when the changes include copies, renames,  or  changes  to  file
              attributes,  none of which can be represented/handled by classic
              "diff" and "patch".

              Example: "Did you see my correction in the diff?"

              (Verb) Diffing two changesets is the action of creating  a  diff
              or patch.

              Example:  "If  you  diff  with  changeset X, you will see what I
              mean."

       Directory, working
              The working directory represents the state of the files  tracked
              by  Mercurial,  that  will  be  recorded in the next commit. The
              working directory initially corresponds to the  snapshot  at  an
              existing  changeset,  known  as the parent of the working direc‐
              tory. See 'Parent, working directory'. The state may be modified
              by  changes  to the files introduced manually or by a merge. The
              repository metadata exists in the .hg directory inside the work‐
              ing directory.

       Draft  Changesets in the draft phase have not been shared with publish‐
              ing repositories and may thus be safely changed by history-modi‐
              fying extensions. See hg help phases.

       Experimental
              Feature that may change or be removed at a later date.

       Graph  See DAG and hg log --graph.

       Head   The  term 'head' may be used to refer to both a branch head or a
              repository head, depending on the context.  See  'Head,  branch'
              and 'Head, repository' for specific definitions.

              Heads  are  where  development generally takes place and are the
              usual targets for update and merge operations.

       Head, branch
              A changeset with no descendants on the same named branch.

       Head, closed branch
              A changeset that marks a head  as  no  longer  interesting.  The
              closed head is no longer listed by hg heads. A branch is consid‐
              ered closed when all its heads are closed  and  consequently  is
              not listed by hg branches.

              Closed heads can be re-opened by committing new changeset as the
              child of the changeset that marks a head as closed.

       Head, repository
              A topological head which has not been closed.

       Head, topological
              A changeset with no children in the repository.

       History, immutable
              Once committed, changesets cannot be altered.  Extensions  which
              appear  to  change  history  actually create new changesets that
              replace existing ones, and  then  destroy  the  old  changesets.
              Doing  so  in  public  repositories can result in old changesets
              being reintroduced to the repository.

       History, rewriting
              The changesets in a repository are  immutable.  However,  exten‐
              sions  to Mercurial can be used to alter the repository, usually
              in such a way as to preserve changeset contents.

       Immutable history
              See 'History, immutable'.

       Merge changeset
              See 'Changeset, merge'.

       Manifest
              Each changeset has a manifest, which is the list of  files  that
              are tracked by the changeset.

       Merge  Used  to  bring  together  divergent  branches of work. When you
              update to a changeset and  then  merge  another  changeset,  you
              bring  the  history  of  the  latter changeset into your working
              directory. Once conflicts are resolved (and marked), this  merge
              may  be  committed  as  a merge changeset, bringing two branches
              together in the DAG.

       Named branch
              See 'Branch, named'.

       Null changeset
              The empty changeset. It is the parent state of newly-initialized
              repositories  and  repositories with no checked out revision. It
              is thus the parent of root changesets and the effective ancestor
              when merging unrelated changesets. Can be specified by the alias
              'null' or by the changeset ID '000000000000'.

       Parent See 'Changeset, parent'.

       Parent changeset
              See 'Changeset, parent'.

       Parent, working directory
              The working directory parent reflects a virtual  revision  which
              is  the child of the changeset (or two changesets with an uncom‐
              mitted merge) shown by hg  parents.  This  is  changed  with  hg
              update.  Other  commands to see the working directory parent are
              hg summary and hg id. Can be specified by the alias ".".

       Patch  (Noun) The product of a diff operation.

              Example: "I've sent you my patch."

              (Verb) The process of  using  a  patch  file  to  transform  one
              changeset into another.

              Example: "You will need to patch that revision."

       Phase  A  per-changeset  state  tracking  how the changeset has been or
              should be shared. See hg help phases.

       Public Changesets in the public phase have been shared with  publishing
              repositories and are therefore considered immutable. See hg help
              phases.

       Pull   An operation in which changesets in a  remote  repository  which
              are  not  in  the  local  repository  are brought into the local
              repository. Note that this operation without  special  arguments
              only updates the repository, it does not update the files in the
              working directory. See hg help pull.

       Push   An operation in which changesets in a local repository which are
              not  in  a  remote repository are sent to the remote repository.
              Note that this operation only adds changesets  which  have  been
              committed  locally to the remote repository. Uncommitted changes
              are not sent. See hg help push.

       Repository
              The metadata describing all recorded states of a  collection  of
              files.  Each  recorded  state  is  represented by a changeset. A
              repository is usually (but not always) found in the  .hg  subdi‐
              rectory of a working directory. Any recorded state can be recre‐
              ated by "updating" a working directory to a specific changeset.

       Repository head
              See 'Head, repository'.

       Revision
              A state of the repository at some point in time.  Earlier  revi‐
              sions  can be updated to by using hg update.  See also 'Revision
              number'; See also 'Changeset'.

       Revision number
              This integer uniquely  identifies  a  changeset  in  a  specific
              repository.  It  represents  the  order in which changesets were
              added to a repository, starting with  revision  number  0.  Note
              that  the  revision  number  may be different in each clone of a
              repository. To identify changesets  uniquely  between  different
              clones, see 'Changeset id'.

       Revlog History  storage  mechanism  used  by Mercurial. It is a form of
              delta encoding, with occasional full revision of  data  followed
              by  delta  of  each successive revision. It includes data and an
              index pointing to the data.

       Rewriting history
              See 'History, rewriting'.

       Root   A changeset that has only the null changeset as its parent. Most
              repositories have only a single root changeset.

       Secret Changesets in the secret phase may not be shared via push, pull,
              or clone. See hg help phases.

       Tag    An alternative name given to a changeset. Tags can  be  used  in
              all places where Mercurial expects a changeset ID, e.g., with hg
              update. The creation of a tag is stored in the history and  will
              thus automatically be shared with other using push and pull.

       Tip    The  changeset  with  the  highest  revision  number.  It is the
              changeset most recently added in a repository.

       Tip, branch
              The head of a given branch with  the  highest  revision  number.
              When  a  branch name is used as a revision identifier, it refers
              to the branch tip. See also 'Branch, head'.  Note  that  because
              revision  numbers  may  be  different  in  different  repository
              clones, the branch tip may  be  different  in  different  cloned
              repositories.

       Update (Noun) Another synonym of changeset.

              Example: "I've pushed an update."

              (Verb)  This term is usually used to describe updating the state
              of the working directory to that of a specific changeset. See hg
              help update.

              Example: "You should update."

SYNTAX FOR MERCURIAL IGNORE FILES
   Synopsis
       The Mercurial system uses a file called .hgignore in the root directory
       of a repository to control its behavior when it searches for files that
       it is not currently tracking.

   Description
       The  working  directory  of  a  Mercurial repository will often contain
       files that should not be tracked by  Mercurial.  These  include  backup
       files  created  by  editors  and  build  products created by compilers.
       These files can be ignored by listing them in a .hgignore file  in  the
       root of the working directory. The .hgignore file must be created manu‐
       ally. It is typically put under version control, so that  the  settings
       will propagate to other repositories with push and pull.

       An  untracked  file  is  ignored if its path relative to the repository
       root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is matched against any
       pattern in .hgignore.

       For  example,  say  we  have  an  untracked file, file.c, at a/b/file.c
       inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore file.c if any  pattern  in
       .hgignore matches a/b/file.c, a/b or a.

       In  addition,  a  Mercurial  configuration  file can reference a set of
       per-user or global ignore files. See the ignore  configuration  key  on
       the  [ui]  section  of  hg  help config for details of how to configure
       these files.

       To control Mercurial's handling of files that it manages, many commands
       support  the  -I and -X options; see hg help <command> and hg help pat‐
       terns for details.

       Files that are already tracked are not affected by .hgignore,  even  if
       they  appear  in .hgignore. An untracked file X can be explicitly added
       with hg add X, even if X would be excluded by a pattern in .hgignore.

   Syntax
       An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list  of  patterns,
       with  one pattern per line. Empty lines are skipped. The # character is
       treated as a comment character, and the \ character is  treated  as  an
       escape character.

       Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax used is
       Python/Perl-style regular expressions.

       To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:

       syntax: NAME

       where NAME is one of the following:

       regexp

              Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.

       glob

              Shell-style glob.

       The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns  that  fol‐
       low, until another syntax is selected.

       Neither  glob  nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob-syntax pattern of
       the form *.c will match a file ending in .c in  any  directory,  and  a
       regexp pattern of the form \.c$ will do the same. To root a regexp pat‐
       tern, start it with ^.

       Subdirectories can have their own .hgignore settings by  adding  subin‐
       clude:path/to/subdir/.hgignore  to the root .hgignore. See hg help pat‐
       terns for details on subinclude: and include:.

       Note   Patterns specified in other than .hgignore  are  always  rooted.
              Please see hg help patterns for details.

   Example
       Here is an example ignore file.

       # use glob syntax.
       syntax: glob

       *.elc
       *.pyc
       *~

       # switch to regexp syntax.
       syntax: regexp
       ^\.pc/

CONFIGURING HGWEB
       Mercurial's  internal  web  server,  hgweb,  can  serve either a single
       repository, or a tree of repositories. In the second  case,  repository
       paths and global options can be defined using a dedicated configuration
       file common to hg serve, hgweb.wsgi, hgweb.cgi and hgweb.fcgi.

       This file uses the same syntax as other Mercurial  configuration  files
       but recognizes only the following sections:

          · web

          · paths

          · collections

       The web options are thoroughly described in hg help config.

       The  paths  section  maps  URL  paths  to  paths of repositories in the
       filesystem. hgweb will not expose the filesystem directly - only Mercu‐
       rial repositories can be published and only according to the configura‐
       tion.

       The left hand side is the path in the URL.  Note  that  hgweb  reserves
       subpaths like rev or file, try using different names for nested reposi‐
       tories to avoid confusing effects.

       The right hand side is the path in the  filesystem.  If  the  specified
       path  ends with * or ** the filesystem will be searched recursively for
       repositories below that point.  With * it will  not  recurse  into  the
       repositories  it  finds (except for .hg/patches).  With ** it will also
       search inside repository working directories  and  possibly  find  sub‐
       repositories.

       In this example:

       [paths]
       /projects/a = /srv/tmprepos/a
       /projects/b = c:/repos/b
       / = /srv/repos/*
       /user/bob = /home/bob/repos/**

       · The  first two entries make two repositories in different directories
         appear under the same directory in the web interface

       · The third entry will publish  every  Mercurial  repository  found  in
         /srv/repos/, for instance the repository /srv/repos/quux/ will appear
         as http://server/quux/

       · The fourth entry will publish both  http://server/user/bob/quux/  and
         http://server/user/bob/quux/testsubrepo/

       The collections section is deprecated and has been superseded by paths.

   URLs and Common Arguments
       URLs under each repository have the form /{command}[/{arguments}] where
       {command} represents the name of a command or handler  and  {arguments}
       represents any number of additional URL parameters to that command.

       The  web server has a default style associated with it. Styles map to a
       collection of named templates. Each template is used to render  a  spe‐
       cific piece of data, such as a changeset or diff.

       The  style  for the current request can be overwritten two ways. First,
       if {command} contains a hyphen (-), the text before the hyphen  defines
       the  style.  For example, /atom-log will render the log command handler
       with the atom style. The second way to set the style is with the  style
       query string argument. For example, /log?style=atom. The hyphenated URL
       parameter is preferred.

       Not all templates are available for all styles.  Attempting  to  use  a
       style  that  doesn't  have all templates defined may result in an error
       rendering the page.

       Many commands take a {revision} URL parameter. This defines the change‐
       set  to  operate  on. This is commonly specified as the short, 12 digit
       hexadecimal abbreviation for the  full  40  character  unique  revision
       identifier. However, any value described by hg help revisions typically
       works.

   Commands and URLs
       The following web commands and their URLs are available:

   /annotate/{revision}/{path}
       Show changeset information for each line in a file.

       The ignorews, ignorewsamount, ignorewseol, and  ignoreblanklines  query
       string  arguments  have  the  same  meaning  as their [annotate] config
       equivalents. It uses the hgrc boolean parsing logic  to  interpret  the
       value.  e.g.  0  and  false  are  false and 1 and true are true. If not
       defined, the server default settings are used.

       The fileannotate template is rendered.

   /archive/{revision}.{format}[/{path}]
       Obtain an archive of repository content.

       The content and type of the archive is defined by a URL path parameter.
       format  is the file extension of the archive type to be generated. e.g.
       zip or tar.bz2. Not all archive types may be  allowed  by  your  server
       configuration.

       The  optional path URL parameter controls content to include in the ar‐
       chive. If omitted, every file in the specified revision is  present  in
       the  archive.  If  included, only the specified file or contents of the
       specified directory will be included in the archive.

       No template is used for this handler. Raw, binary content is generated.

   /bookmarks
       Show information about bookmarks.

       No arguments are accepted.

       The bookmarks template is rendered.

   /branches
       Show information about branches.

       All known branches are contained in the output, even closed branches.

       No arguments are accepted.

       The branches template is rendered.

   /changelog[/{revision}]
       Show information about multiple changesets.

       If the optional revision URL argument is absent, information about  all
       changesets  starting  at tip will be rendered. If the revision argument
       is present, changesets will be shown starting from the specified  revi‐
       sion.

       If  revision  is  absent, the rev query string argument may be defined.
       This will perform a search for changesets.

       The argument for rev can be a single revision, a  revision  set,  or  a
       literal  keyword  to search for in changeset data (equivalent to hg log
       -k).

       The revcount query string  argument  defines  the  maximum  numbers  of
       changesets to render.

       For non-searches, the changelog template will be rendered.

   /changeset[/{revision}]
       Show information about a single changeset.

       A  URL  path  argument is the changeset identifier to show. See hg help
       revisions for possible values. If not defined, the tip  changeset  will
       be shown.

       The  changeset  template  is  rendered.  Contents  of the changesettag,
       changesetbookmark, filenodelink, filenolink,  and  the  many  templates
       related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.

   /comparison/{revision}/{path}
       Show  a  comparison  between  the  old  and new versions of a file from
       changes made on a particular revision.

       This is similar to the diff handler.  However,  this  form  features  a
       split or side-by-side diff rather than a unified diff.

       The  context  query string argument can be used to control the lines of
       context in the diff.

       The filecomparison template is rendered.

   /diff/{revision}/{path}
       Show how a file changed in a particular commit.

       The filediff template is rendered.

       This handler is registered under both the /diff  and  /filediff  paths.
       /diff is used in modern code.

   /file/{revision}[/{path}]
       Show information about a directory or file in the repository.

       Info about the path given as a URL parameter will be rendered.

       If path is a directory, information about the entries in that directory
       will be rendered. This form is equivalent to the manifest handler.

       If path is a file, information about that file will be  shown  via  the
       filerevision template.

       If  path  is  not defined, information about the root directory will be
       rendered.

   /diff/{revision}/{path}
       Show how a file changed in a particular commit.

       The filediff template is rendered.

       This handler is registered under both the /diff  and  /filediff  paths.
       /diff is used in modern code.

   /filelog/{revision}/{path}
       Show information about the history of a file in the repository.

       The  revcount query string argument can be defined to control the maxi‐
       mum number of entries to show.

       The filelog template will be rendered.

   /graph[/{revision}]
       Show information about the graphical topology of the repository.

       Information rendered by this handler can be used to create visual  rep‐
       resentations of repository topology.

       The  revision  URL  parameter  controls the starting changeset. If it's
       absent, the default is tip.

       The revcount query string argument can define the number of  changesets
       to show information for.

       The  graphtop  query string argument can specify the starting changeset
       for producing jsdata variable that  is  used  for  rendering  graph  in
       JavaScript. By default it has the same value as revision.

       This handler will render the graph template.

   /help[/{topic}]
       Render help documentation.

       This  web  command  is  roughly  equivalent  to  hg help. If a topic is
       defined, that help topic will be rendered. If not, an index  of  avail‐
       able help topics will be rendered.

       The  help  template  will be rendered when requesting help for a topic.
       helptopics will be rendered for the index of help topics.

   /log[/{revision}[/{path}]]
       Show repository or file history.

       For URLs of the form /log/{revision}, a list of changesets starting  at
       the  specified  changeset  identifier  is  shown.  If {revision} is not
       defined, the default is tip. This form is equivalent to  the  changelog
       handler.

       For URLs of the form /log/{revision}/{file}, the history for a specific
       file will be shown. This form is equivalent to the filelog handler.

   /manifest[/{revision}[/{path}]]
       Show information about a directory.

       If the URL path arguments  are  omitted,  information  about  the  root
       directory for the tip changeset will be shown.

       Because  this  handler can only show information for directories, it is
       recommended to use the file handler instead,  as  it  can  handle  both
       directories and files.

       The manifest template will be rendered for this handler.

   /changeset[/{revision}]
       Show information about a single changeset.

       A  URL  path  argument is the changeset identifier to show. See hg help
       revisions for possible values. If not defined, the tip  changeset  will
       be shown.

       The  changeset  template  is  rendered.  Contents  of the changesettag,
       changesetbookmark, filenodelink, filenolink,  and  the  many  templates
       related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.

   /shortlog
       Show basic information about a set of changesets.

       This  accepts  the  same  parameters as the changelog handler. The only
       difference is the shortlog template will be  rendered  instead  of  the
       changelog template.

   /summary
       Show a summary of repository state.

       Information  about the latest changesets, bookmarks, tags, and branches
       is captured by this handler.

       The summary template is rendered.

   /tags
       Show information about tags.

       No arguments are accepted.

       The tags template is rendered.

MERGE TOOLS
       To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.

       A merge tool combines two different versions of a file  into  a  merged
       file.  Merge  tools  are  given  the  two files and the greatest common
       ancestor of the two file versions, so they can  determine  the  changes
       made on both branches.

       Merge tools are used both for hg resolve, hg merge, hg update, hg back‐
       out and in several extensions.

       Usually, the merge tool tries to automatically reconcile the  files  by
       combining  all  non-overlapping changes that occurred separately in the
       two different evolutions of the same initial  base  file.  Furthermore,
       some interactive merge programs make it easier to manually resolve con‐
       flicting merges, either in a graphical way, or by inserting  some  con‐
       flict  markers.  Mercurial  does not include any interactive merge pro‐
       grams but relies on external tools for that.

   Available merge tools
       External merge  tools  and  their  properties  are  configured  in  the
       merge-tools  configuration  section  - see hgrc(5) - but they can often
       just be named by their executable.

       A merge tool is generally usable if its executable can be found on  the
       system and if it can handle the merge. The executable is found if it is
       an absolute or relative executable path or the name of  an  application
       in the executable search path. The tool is assumed to be able to handle
       the merge if it can handle symlinks if the file is a symlink, if it can
       handle binary files if the file is binary, and if a GUI is available if
       the tool requires a GUI.

       There are some internal merge tools which can  be  used.  The  internal
       merge tools are:

       :dump

              Creates  three  versions  of  the files to merge, containing the
              contents of local, other and base. These files can then be  used
              to  perform  a merge manually. If the file to be merged is named
              a.txt,  these  files  will  accordingly  be  named  a.txt.local,
              a.txt.other  and  a.txt.base and they will be placed in the same
              directory as a.txt.

              This implies premerge. Therefore, files aren't dumped,  if  pre‐
              merge  runs successfully. Use :forcedump to forcibly write files
              out.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       :fail

              Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified on both
              branches,  it marks them as unresolved. The resolve command must
              be used to resolve these conflicts.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       :forcedump

              Creates three versions of the files as same as :dump, but  omits
              premerge.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       :local

              Uses the local p1() version of files as the merged version.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       :merge

              Uses  the  internal  non-interactive  simple merge algorithm for
              merging files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave
              markers in the partially merged file. Markers will have two sec‐
              tions, one for each side of merge.

       :merge-local

              Like :merge, but  resolve  all  conflicts  non-interactively  in
              favor of the local p1() changes.

       :merge-other

              Like  :merge,  but  resolve  all  conflicts non-interactively in
              favor of the other p2() changes.

       :merge3

              Uses the internal non-interactive  simple  merge  algorithm  for
              merging files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave
              markers in the partially merged file.  Marker  will  have  three
              sections,  one  from each side of the merge and one for the base
              content.

       :other

              Uses the other p2() version of files as the merged version.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       :prompt

              Asks the user which of the local p1() or the other p2()  version
              to keep as the merged version.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       :tagmerge

              Uses the internal tag merge algorithm (experimental).

       :union

              Uses  the  internal  non-interactive  simple merge algorithm for
              merging files. It will use both left and right  sides  for  con‐
              flict regions.  No markers are inserted.

       Internal  tools  are always available and do not require a GUI but will
       by default not handle symlinks or binary files. See  next  section  for
       detail about "actual capabilities" described above.

   Choosing a merge tool
       Mercurial uses these rules when deciding which merge tool to use:

       1. If  a  tool  has  been  specified with the --tool option to merge or
          resolve, it is used.  If it is the name of a tool in the merge-tools
          configuration,  its  configuration  is used. Otherwise the specified
          tool must be executable by the shell.

       2. If the HGMERGE environment variable is present, its  value  is  used
          and must be executable by the shell.

       3. If the filename of the file to be merged matches any of the patterns
          in the merge-patterns configuration section, the first usable  merge
          tool corresponding to a matching pattern is used.

       4. If  ui.merge  is set it will be considered next. If the value is not
          the name of a configured tool, the specified value is used and  must
          be  executable  by the shell. Otherwise the named tool is used if it
          is usable.

       5. If any usable merge tools are present in the merge-tools  configura‐
          tion section, the one with the highest priority is used.

       6. If  a program named hgmerge can be found on the system, it is used -
          but it will by default not be used for symlinks and binary files.

       7. If the file to be merged is not binary and is not  a  symlink,  then
          internal :merge is used.

       8. Otherwise, :prompt is used.

       For  historical  reason,  Mercurial  treats  merge tools as below while
       examining rules above.

       Each capability column indicates Mercurial behavior for internal/exter‐
       nal merge tools at examining each rule.

       · "o": "assume that a tool has capability"

       · "x": "assume that a tool does not have capability"

       · "?": "check actual capability of a tool"

       If   merge.strict-capability-check  configuration  is  true,  Mercurial
       checks capabilities of merge tools strictly in (*) cases above (=  each
       capability  column  becomes "?/?"). It is false by default for backward
       compatibility.

       Note   After selecting a  merge  program,  Mercurial  will  by  default
              attempt to merge the files using a simple merge algorithm first.
              Only if it doesn't succeed because of conflicting  changes  will
              Mercurial actually execute the merge program. Whether to use the
              simple merge algorithm first can be controlled by  the  premerge
              setting of the merge tool. Premerge is enabled by default unless
              the file is binary or a symlink.

       See the merge-tools and ui sections of hgrc(5) for details on the  con‐
       figuration of merge tools.

PAGER SUPPORT
       Some Mercurial commands can produce a lot of output, and Mercurial will
       attempt to use a pager to make those commands more pleasant.

       To set the pager that should be used, set the application variable:

       [pager]
       pager = less -FRX

       If no pager is set in the user or repository  configuration,  Mercurial
       uses the environment variable $PAGER. If $PAGER is not set, pager.pager
       from the default or system configuration is used. If none of these  are
       set,  a  default pager will be used, typically less on Unix and more on
       Windows.

       On Windows, more is not color aware, so using it  effectively  disables
       color.   MSYS  and  Cygwin shells provide less as a pager, which can be
       configured  to  support  ANSI  color   codes.    See   hg   help   con‐
       fig.color.pagermode to configure the color mode when invoking a pager.

       You  can  disable  the pager for certain commands by adding them to the
       pager.ignore list:

       [pager]
       ignore = version, help, update

       To ignore global commands like hg version or hg help, you have to spec‐
       ify them in your user configuration file.

       To  control whether the pager is used at all for an individual command,
       you can use --pager=<value>:

          · use as needed: auto.

          · require the pager: yes or on.

          · suppress the pager: no or off (any unrecognized  value  will  also
            work).

       To globally turn off all attempts to use a pager, set:

       [ui]
       paginate = never

       which will prevent the pager from running.

FILE NAME PATTERNS
       Mercurial  accepts  several notations for identifying one or more files
       at a time.

       By default, Mercurial treats filenames  as  shell-style  extended  glob
       patterns.

       Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.

       Note   Patterns  specified  in .hgignore are not rooted.  Please see hg
              help hgignore for details.

       To use a plain path name without any pattern matching,  start  it  with
       path:.  These  path names must completely match starting at the current
       repository root, and when the path points to a directory, it is matched
       recursively.  To  match  all  files in a directory non-recursively (not
       including any files in subdirectories), rootfilesin: can be used, spec‐
       ifying an absolute path (relative to the repository root).

       To  use  an extended glob, start a name with glob:. Globs are rooted at
       the current directory; a glob such as *.c will only match files in  the
       current directory ending with .c.

       The  supported glob syntax extensions are ** to match any string across
       path separators and {a,b} to mean "a or b".

       To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with re:.  Regexp
       pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.

       To  read  name  patterns from a file, use listfile: or listfile0:.  The
       latter expects null delimited patterns while the  former  expects  line
       feeds.  Each string read from the file is itself treated as a file pat‐
       tern.

       To read a set of patterns from a file,  use  include:  or  subinclude:.
       include:  will  use all the patterns from the given file and treat them
       as if they had been passed in manually.  subinclude:  will  only  apply
       the  patterns against files that are under the subinclude file's direc‐
       tory. See hg help hgignore for details on the format of these files.

       All patterns, except for glob: specified in command line (not for -I or
       -X  options),  can  match also against directories: files under matched
       directories are treated as matched.  For -I and -X options, glob:  will
       match directories recursively.

       Plain examples:

       path:foo/bar        a name bar in a directory named foo in the root
                           of the repository
       path:path:name      a file or directory named "path:name"
       rootfilesin:foo/bar the files in a directory called foo/bar, but not any files
                           in its subdirectories and not a file bar in directory foo

       Glob examples:

       glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
       *.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
       **.c           any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of the
                      current directory including itself.
       foo/*          any file in directory foo
       foo/**         any file in directory foo plus all its subdirectories,
                      recursively
       foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
       foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of foo
                      including itself.

       Regexp examples:

       re:.*\.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository

       File examples:

       listfile:list.txt  read list from list.txt with one file pattern per line
       listfile0:list.txt read list from list.txt with null byte delimiters

       See also hg help filesets.

       Include examples:

       include:path/to/mypatternfile    reads patterns to be applied to all paths
       subinclude:path/to/subignorefile reads patterns specifically for paths in the
                                        subdirectory

WORKING WITH PHASES
   What are phases?
       Phases  are  a system for tracking which changesets have been or should
       be shared. This helps prevent common mistakes  when  modifying  history
       (for instance, with the mq or rebase extensions).

       Each changeset in a repository is in one of the following phases:

          · public : changeset is visible on a public server

          · draft : changeset is not yet published

          · secret : changeset should not be pushed, pulled, or cloned

       These phases are ordered (public < draft < secret) and no changeset can
       be in a lower phase than its ancestors. For instance, if a changeset is
       public,  all  its  ancestors  are also public. Lastly, changeset phases
       should only be changed towards the public phase.

   How are phases managed?
       For the most part, phases should  work  transparently.  By  default,  a
       changeset  is  created  in the draft phase and is moved into the public
       phase when it is pushed to another repository.

       Once changesets become public,  extensions  like  mq  and  rebase  will
       refuse  to  operate  on  them to prevent creating duplicate changesets.
       Phases can also be manually manipulated with the  hg  phase command  if
       needed. See hg help -v phase for examples.

       To  make your commits secret by default, put this in your configuration
       file:

       [phases]
       new-commit = secret

   Phases and servers
       Normally, all servers are publishing by default. This means:

       - all draft changesets that are pulled or cloned appear in phase
       public on the client

       - all draft changesets that are pushed appear as public on both
       client and server

       - secret changesets are neither pushed, pulled, or cloned

       Note   Pulling a draft changeset from a publishing server does not mark
              it  as  public on the server side due to the read-only nature of
              pull.

       Sometimes it may be desirable to push and pull changesets in the  draft
       phase  to  share unfinished work. This can be done by setting a reposi‐
       tory to disable publishing in its configuration file:

       [phases]
       publish = False

       See hg help config for more information on configuration files.

       Note   Servers running older versions of Mercurial are treated as  pub‐
              lishing.

       Note   Changesets  in  secret  phase are not exchanged with the server.
              This applies to their content: file names,  file  contents,  and
              changeset  metadata. For technical reasons, the identifier (e.g.
              d825e4025e39) of the secret changeset may be communicated to the
              server.

   Examples
          · list changesets in draft or secret phase:

            hg log -r "not public()"

          · change all secret changesets to draft:

            hg phase --draft "secret()"

          · forcibly move the current changeset and descendants from public to
            draft:

            hg phase --force --draft .

          · show a list of changeset revisions and each corresponding phase:

            hg log --template "{rev} {phase}\n"

          · resynchronize draft changesets relative to a remote repository:

            hg phase -fd "outgoing(URL)"

       See hg help phase for more information on manually manipulating phases.

SPECIFYING REVISIONS
       Mercurial supports several ways to specify revisions.

   Specifying single revisions
       A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers  are
       treated  as  sequential offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting the tip,
       -2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.

       A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique  revision  identi‐
       fier.   A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as
       a unique revision identifier and is referred to as a short-form identi‐
       fier.  A  short-form  identifier  is  only valid if it is the prefix of
       exactly one full-length identifier.

       Any other string is treated as a bookmark, tag, or branch name. A book‐
       mark  is  a  movable  pointer  to a revision. A tag is a permanent name
       associated with a revision. A branch  name  denotes  the  tipmost  open
       branch  head  of  that  branch - or if they are all closed, the tipmost
       closed head of the branch. Bookmark, tag, and  branch  names  must  not
       contain the ":" character.

       The reserved name "tip" always identifies the most recent revision.

       The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the revi‐
       sion of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.

       The reserved name "." indicates the working  directory  parent.  If  no
       working  directory  is  checked  out,  it  is equivalent to null. If an
       uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of the first par‐
       ent.

       Finally,  commands  that expect a single revision (like hg update) also
       accept revsets (see below for details). When given a revset,  they  use
       the last revision of the revset. A few commands accept two single revi‐
       sions (like hg diff). When given a revset, they use the first  and  the
       last revisions of the revset.

   Specifying multiple revisions
       Mercurial  supports  a functional language for selecting a set of revi‐
       sions. Expressions in this language are called revsets.

       The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by  infix
       operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.

       Identifiers such as branch names may need quoting with single or double
       quotes if they contain characters like - or if they match  one  of  the
       predefined predicates.

       Special  characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
       e.g., \n is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being inter‐
       preted, strings can be prefixed with r, e.g. r'...'.

   Operators
       There is a single prefix operator:

       not x

              Changesets not in x. Short form is ! x.

       These are the supported infix operators:

       x::y

              A  DAG  range,  meaning all changesets that are descendants of x
              and ancestors of y, including x and y themselves. If  the  first
              endpoint is left out, this is equivalent to ancestors(y), if the
              second is left out it is equivalent to descendants(x).

              An alternative syntax is x..y.

       x:y

              All changesets with revision  numbers  between  x  and  y,  both
              inclusive.  Either  endpoint  can be left out, they default to 0
              and tip.

       x and y

              The intersection of changesets in x and y. Short form is x & y.

       x or y

              The union of changesets in x and y. There  are  two  alternative
              short forms: x | y and x + y.

       x - y

              Changesets in x but not in y.

       x % y

              Changesets  that are ancestors of x but not ancestors of y (i.e.
              ::x - ::y).  This is shorthand  notation  for  only(x,  y)  (see
              below).  The  second  argument  is optional and, if left out, is
              equivalent to only(x).

       x^n

              The nth parent of x, n == 0, 1, or 2.  For n == 0, x; for  n  ==
              1, the first parent of each changeset in x; for n == 2, the sec‐
              ond parent of changeset in x.

       x~n

              The nth first ancestor of x; x~0 is x; x~3 is x^^^.  For n <  0,
              the nth unambiguous descendent of x.

       x ## y

              Concatenate strings and identifiers into one string.

              All  other prefix, infix and postfix operators have lower prior‐
              ity than ##. For example, a1 ## a2~2 is  equivalent  to  (a1  ##
              a2)~2.

              For example:

              [revsetalias]
              issue(a1) = grep(r'\bissue[ :]?' ## a1 ## r'\b|\bbug\(' ## a1 ## r'\)')

              issue(1234)      is      equivalent      to      grep(r'\bissue[
              :]?1234\b|\bbug\(1234\)') in this case. This matches against all
              of "issue 1234", "issue:1234", "issue1234" and "bug(1234)".

       There is a single postfix operator:

       x^

              Equivalent to x^1, the first parent of each changeset in x.

   Patterns
       Where  noted, predicates that perform string matching can accept a pat‐
       tern string. The pattern may be either a literal, or a regular  expres‐
       sion.  If  the pattern starts with re:, the remainder of the pattern is
       treated as a regular expression. Otherwise, it is treated as a literal.
       To  match  a pattern that actually starts with re:, use the prefix lit‐
       eral:.

       Matching is case-sensitive, unless otherwise noted.  To perform a case-
       insensitive  match on a case-sensitive predicate, use a regular expres‐
       sion, prefixed with (?i).

       For example, tag(r're:(?i)release') matches "release" or  "RELEASE"  or
       "Release", etc.

   Predicates
       The following predicates are supported:

       adds(pattern)

              Changesets that add a file matching pattern.

              The  pattern  without explicit kind like glob: is expected to be
              relative to the current directory and match against a file or  a
              directory.

       all()

              All changesets, the same as 0:tip.

       ancestor(*changeset)

              A greatest common ancestor of the changesets.

              Accepts  0  or  more  changesets.   Will  return empty list when
              passed no args.  Greatest common ancestor of a single  changeset
              is that changeset.

       ancestors(set[, depth])

              Changesets  that  are  ancestors of changesets in set, including
              the given changesets themselves.

              If depth is specified, the result only includes changesets up to
              the specified generation.

       author(string)

              Alias for user(string).

       bisect(string)

              Changesets marked in the specified bisect status:

              · good, bad, skip: csets explicitly marked as good/bad/skip

              · goods, bads      : csets topologically good/bad

              · range              : csets taking part in the bisection

              · pruned             : csets that are goods, bads or skipped

              · untested           : csets whose fate is yet unknown

              · ignored            : csets ignored due to DAG topology

              · current            : the cset currently being bisected

       bookmark([name])

              The named bookmark or all bookmarks.

              Pattern  matching  is  supported  for  name.  See  hg help revi‐
              sions.patterns.

       branch(string or set)

              All changesets belonging to the given branch or the branches  of
              the given changesets.

              Pattern  matching  is  supported  for  string. See hg help revi‐
              sions.patterns.

       branchpoint()

              Changesets with more than one child.

       bundle()

              Changesets in the bundle.

              Bundle must be specified by the -R option.

       children(set)

              Child changesets of changesets in set.

       closed()

              Changeset is closed.

       commonancestors(set)

              Changesets that are ancestors of every changeset in set.

       contains(pattern)

              The revision's manifest contains a file  matching  pattern  (but
              might not modify it). See hg help patterns for information about
              file patterns.

              The pattern without explicit kind like glob: is expected  to  be
              relative  to  the  current  directory  and  match against a file
              exactly for efficiency.

       converted([id])

              Changesets converted from the given identifier in the old repos‐
              itory  if  present, or all converted changesets if no identifier
              is specified.

       date(interval)

              Changesets within the interval, see hg help dates.

       desc(string)

              Search commit message for string. The match is case-insensitive.

              Pattern matching is supported for  string.  See  hg  help  revi‐
              sions.patterns.

       descendants(set[, depth])

              Changesets which are descendants of changesets in set, including
              the given changesets themselves.

              If depth is specified, the result only includes changesets up to
              the specified generation.

       destination([set])

              Changesets  that  were  created by a graft, transplant or rebase
              operation, with the given revisions  specified  as  the  source.
              Omitting the optional set is the same as passing all().

       draft()

              Changeset in draft phase.

       extinct()

              Obsolete changesets with obsolete descendants only.

       extra(label, [value])

              Changesets  with the given label in the extra metadata, with the
              given optional value.

              Pattern matching is supported  for  value.  See  hg  help  revi‐
              sions.patterns.

       file(pattern)

              Changesets affecting files matched by pattern.

              For  a faster but less accurate result, consider using filelog()
              instead.

              This predicate uses glob: as the default kind of pattern.

       filelog(pattern)

              Changesets connected to the specified filelog.

              For performance reasons, visits only revisions mentioned in  the
              file-level filelog, rather than filtering through all changesets
              (much faster, but doesn't include deletes or duplicate changes).
              For a slower, more accurate result, use file().

              The  pattern  without explicit kind like glob: is expected to be
              relative to the current  directory  and  match  against  a  file
              exactly for efficiency.

              If  some  linkrev  points  to  revisions filtered by the current
              repoview, we'll work around it to return a non-filtered value.

       first(set, [n])

              An alias for limit().

       follow([file[, startrev]])

              An alias for ::. (ancestors of  the  working  directory's  first
              parent).   If  file pattern is specified, the histories of files
              matching given pattern in the revision  given  by  startrev  are
              followed, including copies.

       followlines(file, fromline:toline[, startrev=., descend=False])

              Changesets modifying file in line range ('fromline', 'toline').

              Line  range  corresponds  to  'file'  content  at 'startrev' and
              should hence be consistent with file size. If  startrev  is  not
              specified, working directory's parent is used.

              By  default,  ancestors of 'startrev' are returned. If 'descend'
              is True, descendants of 'startrev' are returned  though  renames
              are (currently) not followed in this direction.

       grep(regex)

              Like  keyword(string)  but  accepts a regex. Use grep(r'...') to
              ensure special escape characters are handled  correctly.  Unlike
              keyword(string), the match is case-sensitive.

       head()

              Changeset is a named branch head.

       heads(set)

              Members of set with no children in set.

       hidden()

              Hidden changesets.

       id(string)

              Revision  non-ambiguously specified by the given hex string pre‐
              fix.

       keyword(string)

              Search commit message, user name, and names of changed files for
              string. The match is case-insensitive.

              For  a  regular  expression  or  case  sensitive search of these
              fields, use grep(regex).

       last(set, [n])

              Last n members of set, defaulting to 1.

       limit(set[, n[, offset]])

              First n members of set, defaulting to 1, starting from offset.

       matching(revision [, field])

              Changesets in which a given set  of  fields  match  the  set  of
              fields in the selected revision or set.

              To  match  more  than one field pass the list of fields to match
              separated by spaces (e.g. author description).

              Valid fields are most regular revision fields and  some  special
              fields.

              Regular  revision  fields are description, author, branch, date,
              files, phase, parents,  substate,  user  and  diff.   Note  that
              author and user are synonyms. diff refers to the contents of the
              revision. Two revisions matching  their  diff  will  also  match
              their files.

              Special  fields  are  summary  and metadata: summary matches the
              first line of the description.  metadata is equivalent to match‐
              ing  description  user  date  (i.e. it matches the main metadata
              fields).

              metadata is the default field which is used when no  fields  are
              specified. You can match more than one field at a time.

       max(set)

              Changeset with highest revision number in set.

       merge()

              Changeset is a merge changeset.

       min(set)

              Changeset with lowest revision number in set.

       modifies(pattern)

              Changesets modifying files matched by pattern.

              The  pattern  without explicit kind like glob: is expected to be
              relative to the current directory and match against a file or  a
              directory.

       named(namespace)

              The changesets in a given namespace.

              Pattern  matching  is supported for namespace. See hg help revi‐
              sions.patterns.

       none()

              No changesets.

       obsolete()

              Mutable changeset with a newer version.

       only(set, [set])

              Changesets that are ancestors of the  first  set  that  are  not
              ancestors  of  any  other  head  in the repo. If a second set is
              specified, the result is ancestors of the first set that are not
              ancestors of the second set (i.e. ::<set1> - ::<set2>).

       origin([set])

              Changesets  that  were  specified  as  a  source for the grafts,
              transplants or rebases that created the given revisions.   Omit‐
              ting  the  optional  set  is  the  same  as passing all().  If a
              changeset created by these operations is itself specified  as  a
              source  for  one  of these operations, only the source changeset
              for the first operation is selected.

       outgoing([path])

              Changesets not found in the specified destination repository, or
              the default push location.

       p1([set])

              First parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.

       p2([set])

              Second parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.

       parents([set])

              The set of all parents for all changesets in set, or the working
              directory.

       present(set)

              An empty set, if any revision in set isn't found; otherwise, all
              revisions in set.

              If any of specified revisions is not present in the local repos‐
              itory, the query is normally aborted. But this predicate  allows
              the query to continue even in such cases.

       public()

              Changeset in public phase.

       remote([id [,path]])

              Local  revision  that  corresponds  to the given identifier in a
              remote repository, if present. Here, the  '.'  identifier  is  a
              synonym for the current local branch.

       removes(pattern)

              Changesets which remove files matching pattern.

              The  pattern  without explicit kind like glob: is expected to be
              relative to the current directory and match against a file or  a
              directory.

       rev(number)

              Revision with the given numeric identifier.

       reverse(set)

              Reverse order of set.

       revset(set)

              Strictly interpret the content as a revset.

              The  content  of  this special predicate will be strictly inter‐
              preted as a revset. For example, revset(id(0))  will  be  inter‐
              preted  as  "id(0)"  without  possible  ambiguity with a "id(0)"
              bookmark or tag.

       roots(set)

              Changesets in set with no parent changeset in set.

       secret()

              Changeset in secret phase.

       sort(set[, [-]key... [, ...]])

              Sort set by keys. The default sort order is ascending, specify a
              key as -key to sort in descending order.

              The keys can be:

              · rev for the revision number,

              · branch for the branch name,

              · desc for the commit message (description),

              · user for user name (author can be used as an alias),

              · date for the commit date

              · topo for a reverse topographical sort

              The  topo  sort  order  cannot be combined with other sort keys.
              This sort takes one optional argument,  topo.firstbranch,  which
              takes  a  revset  that  specifies what topographical branches to
              prioritize in the sort.

       subrepo([pattern])

              Changesets that add, modify or remove the given subrepo.  If  no
              subrepo pattern is named, any subrepo changes are returned.

       successors(set)

              All successors for set, including the given set themselves

       tag([name])

              The specified tag by name, or all tagged revisions if no name is
              given.

              Pattern matching is  supported  for  name.  See  hg  help  revi‐
              sions.patterns.

       user(string)

              User name contains string. The match is case-insensitive.

              Pattern  matching  is  supported  for  string. See hg help revi‐
              sions.patterns.

   Aliases
       New predicates (known as "aliases") can be defined, using any  combina‐
       tion of existing predicates or other aliases. An alias definition looks
       like:

       <alias> = <definition>

       in the revsetalias section of a Mercurial configuration file. Arguments
       of  the form a1, a2, etc. are substituted from the alias into the defi‐
       nition.

       For example,

       [revsetalias]
       h = heads()
       d(s) = sort(s, date)
       rs(s, k) = reverse(sort(s, k))

       defines three aliases, h, d,  and  rs.  rs(0:tip,  author)  is  exactly
       equivalent to reverse(sort(0:tip, author)).

   Equivalents
       Command line equivalents for hg log:

       -f    ->  ::.
       -d x  ->  date(x)
       -k x  ->  keyword(x)
       -m    ->  merge()
       -u x  ->  user(x)
       -b x  ->  branch(x)
       -P x  ->  !::x
       -l x  ->  limit(expr, x)

   Examples
       Some sample queries:

       · Changesets on the default branch:

         hg log -r "branch(default)"

       · Changesets on the default branch since tag 1.5 (excluding merges):

         hg log -r "branch(default) and 1.5:: and not merge()"

       · Open branch heads:

         hg log -r "head() and not closed()"

       · Changesets  between  tags  1.3  and  1.5 mentioning "bug" that affect
         hgext/*:

         hg log -r "1.3::1.5 and keyword(bug) and file('hgext/*')"

       · Changesets committed in May 2008, sorted by user:

         hg log -r "sort(date('May 2008'), user)"

       · Changesets mentioning "bug" or "issue"  that  are  not  in  a  tagged
         release:

         hg log -r "(keyword(bug) or keyword(issue)) and not ancestors(tag())"

       · Update to the commit that bookmark @ is pointing to, without activat‐
         ing the bookmark (this works because the last revision of the  revset
         is used):

         hg update :@

       · Show  diff between tags 1.3 and 1.5 (this works because the first and
         the last revisions of the revset are used):

         hg diff -r 1.3::1.5

USING MERCURIAL FROM SCRIPTS AND AUTOMATION
       It is common for machines (as opposed to humans) to consume  Mercurial.
       This  help  topic  describes some of the considerations for interfacing
       machines with Mercurial.

   Choosing an Interface
       Machines have a choice of several methods to interface with  Mercurial.
       These include:

       · Executing the hg process

       · Querying a HTTP server

       · Calling out to a command server

       Executing hg processes is very similar to how humans interact with Mer‐
       curial in the shell. It should already be familiar to you.

       hg serve can be used to start a server. By default, this will  start  a
       "hgweb"  HTTP server. This HTTP server has support for machine-readable
       output, such as JSON. For more, see hg help hgweb.

       hg serve can also start a "command server." Clients can connect to this
       server  and issue Mercurial commands over a special protocol.  For more
       details on the command server, including links to client libraries, see
       https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommandServer.

       hg  serve based  interfaces  (the  hgweb  and command servers) have the
       advantage over simple hg process invocations in that  they  are  likely
       more  efficient. This is because there is significant overhead to spawn
       new Python processes.

       Tip    If you need to invoke several hg processes in short order and/or
              performance is important to you, use of a server-based interface
              is highly recommended.

   Environment Variables
       As documented in hg help  environment,  various  environment  variables
       influence  the  operation  of Mercurial. The following are particularly
       relevant for machines consuming Mercurial:

       HGPLAIN
              If not set, Mercurial's output could be influenced by configura‐
              tion  settings that impact its encoding, verbose mode, localiza‐
              tion, etc.

              It is highly recommended for machines to set this variable  when
              invoking hg processes.

       HGENCODING
              If  not  set, the locale used by Mercurial will be detected from
              the environment. If the determined locale does not support  dis‐
              play of certain characters, Mercurial may render these character
              sequences incorrectly (often by using "?" as a  placeholder  for
              invalid characters in the current locale).

              Explicitly  setting this environment variable is a good practice
              to guarantee consistent results. "utf-8" is  a  good  choice  on
              UNIX-like environments.

       HGRCPATH
              If  not  set,  Mercurial will inherit config options from config
              files using the  process  described  in  hg  help  config.  This
              includes inheriting user or system-wide config files.

              When utmost control over the Mercurial configuration is desired,
              the value of HGRCPATH can be set to an explicit file with  known
              good  configs.  In  rare cases, the value can be set to an empty
              file or the null device (often /dev/null) to bypass  loading  of
              any  user or system config files. Note that these approaches can
              have unintended consequences, as  the  user  and  system  config
              files  often define things like the username and extensions that
              may be required to interface with a repository.

   Command-line Flags
       Mercurial's default command-line parser is designed for humans, and  is
       not  robust  against  malicious  input.  For  instance, you can start a
       debugger by passing --debugger as an option value:

       $ REV=--debugger sh -c 'hg log -r "$REV"'

       This happens because several command-line  flags  need  to  be  scanned
       without  using  a  concrete  command table, which may be modified while
       loading repository settings and extensions.

       Since Mercurial 4.4.2, the parsing of such flags may be  restricted  by
       setting  HGPLAIN=+strictflags.  When this feature is enabled, all early
       options (e.g. -R/--repository, --cwd, --config) must be specified first
       amongst  the  other  global options, and cannot be injected to an arbi‐
       trary location:

       $ HGPLAIN=+strictflags hg -R "$REPO" log -r "$REV"

       In earlier Mercurial versions where +strictflags isn't  available,  you
       can mitigate the issue by concatenating an option value with its flag:

       $ hg log -r"$REV" --keyword="$KEYWORD"

   Consuming Command Output
       It is common for machines to need to parse the output of Mercurial com‐
       mands for relevant data. This section describes the various  techniques
       for doing so.

   Parsing Raw Command Output
       Likely  the  simplest and most effective solution for consuming command
       output is to simply invoke hg commands as you would as a user and parse
       their output.

       The  output of many commands can easily be parsed with tools like grep,
       sed, and awk.

       A potential downside with parsing command output is that the output  of
       commands  can  change  when Mercurial is upgraded. While Mercurial does
       generally strive for strong  backwards  compatibility,  command  output
       does  occasionally change. Having tests for your automated interactions
       with hg commands is generally recommended, but is even  more  important
       when raw command output parsing is involved.

   Using Templates to Control Output
       Many hg commands support templatized output via the -T/--template argu‐
       ment. For more, see hg help templates.

       Templates are useful for explicitly controlling output so that you  get
       exactly  the  data you want formatted how you want it. For example, log
       -T {node}\n can be used to print a newline delimited list of  changeset
       nodes  instead  of  a  human-tailored output containing authors, dates,
       descriptions, etc.

       Tip    If parsing raw command output is too complicated, consider using
              templates to make your life easier.

       The  -T/--template argument allows specifying pre-defined styles.  Mer‐
       curial ships with the machine-readable styles json and xml, which  pro‐
       vide  JSON and XML output, respectively. These are useful for producing
       output that is machine readable as-is.

       Important
              The json and xml styles are considered experimental. While  they
              may  be  attractive to use for easily obtaining machine-readable
              output, their behavior may change in subsequent versions.

              These styles may also exhibit unexpected  results  when  dealing
              with  certain  encodings. Mercurial treats things like filenames
              as a series of bytes and normalizing certain byte  sequences  to
              JSON  or  XML  with  certain  encoding settings can lead to sur‐
              prises.

   Command Server Output
       If using the command server to interact with Mercurial, you are  likely
       using  an existing library/API that abstracts implementation details of
       the command server. If so, this interface layer may perform parsing for
       you, saving you the work of implementing it yourself.

   Output Verbosity
       Commands  often  have varying output verbosity, even when machine read‐
       able styles are being used (e.g.  -T  json).  Adding  -v/--verbose  and
       --debug  to  the  command's  arguments  can increase the amount of data
       exposed by Mercurial.

       An alternate way to get the data you need is by explicitly specifying a
       template.

   Other Topics
       revsets
              Revisions  sets  is  a functional query language for selecting a
              set of revisions. Think of it as SQL for Mercurial repositories.
              Revsets are useful for querying repositories for specific data.

              See hg help revsets for more.

       share extension
              The  share  extension provides functionality for sharing reposi‐
              tory data across several working copies. It can  even  automati‐
              cally  "pool"  storage  for  logically related repositories when
              cloning.

              Configuring the share extension can lead to significant resource
              utilization  reduction,  particularly  around disk space and the
              network. This is especially true for continuous integration (CI)
              environments.

              See hg help -e share for more.

SUBREPOSITORIES
       Subrepositories  let  you nest external repositories or projects into a
       parent Mercurial repository, and make commands operate  on  them  as  a
       group.

       Mercurial  currently supports Mercurial, Git, and Subversion subreposi‐
       tories.

       Subrepositories are made of three components:

       1. Nested repository checkouts. They can appear anywhere in the  parent
          working directory.

       2. Nested  repository  references.  They  are  defined in .hgsub, which
          should be placed in the root of working directory,  and  tell  where
          the subrepository checkouts come from. Mercurial subrepositories are
          referenced like:

          path/to/nested = https://example.com/nested/repo/path

          Git and Subversion subrepos are also supported:

          path/to/nested = [git]git://example.com/nested/repo/path
          path/to/nested = [svn]https://example.com/nested/trunk/path

          where path/to/nested is the checkout location relatively to the par‐
          ent  Mercurial root, and https://example.com/nested/repo/path is the
          source repository path. The source can also reference  a  filesystem
          path.

          Note  that  .hgsub  does not exist by default in Mercurial reposito‐
          ries, you have to create and add it to the parent repository  before
          using subrepositories.

       3. Nested  repository states. They are defined in .hgsubstate, which is
          placed in the root of working directory, and capture whatever infor‐
          mation  is required to restore the subrepositories to the state they
          were committed in a parent repository changeset. Mercurial automati‐
          cally  record  the nested repositories states when committing in the
          parent repository.

       Note
          The .hgsubstate file should not be edited manually.

   Adding a Subrepository
       If .hgsub does not exist, create it and add it to  the  parent  reposi‐
       tory. Clone or checkout the external projects where you want it to live
       in the parent repository. Edit .hgsub and add the  subrepository  entry
       as described above. At this point, the subrepository is tracked and the
       next commit will record its state in .hgsubstate and  bind  it  to  the
       committed changeset.

   Synchronizing a Subrepository
       Subrepos  do  not  automatically  track  the  latest changeset of their
       sources. Instead, they are updated to the  changeset  that  corresponds
       with  the  changeset checked out in the top-level changeset. This is so
       developers always get a consistent set of compatible code and libraries
       when they update.

       Thus,  updating  subrepos  is a manual process. Simply check out target
       subrepo at the desired revision, test in the top-level repo, then  com‐
       mit in the parent repository to record the new combination.

   Deleting a Subrepository
       To remove a subrepository from the parent repository, delete its refer‐
       ence from .hgsub, then remove its files.

   Interaction with Mercurial Commands
       add    add does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is  speci‐
              fied.  However, if you specify the full path of a file in a sub‐
              repo, it will be added  even  without  -S/--subrepos  specified.
              Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

       addremove
              addremove does not recurse into subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
              specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a directory
              in  a  subrepo,  addremove  will be performed on it even without
              -S/--subrepos being specified.  Git and Subversion  subreposito‐
              ries will print a warning and continue.

       archive
              archive does not recurse in subrepositories unless -S/--subrepos
              is specified.

       cat    Git subrepositories only support exact file matches.  Subversion
              subrepositories are currently ignored.

       commit commit  creates a consistent snapshot of the state of the entire
              project and its subrepositories.  If  any  subrepositories  have
              been  modified,  Mercurial will abort.  Mercurial can be made to
              instead  commit  all  modified  subrepositories  by   specifying
              -S/--subrepos, or setting "ui.commitsubrepos=True" in a configu‐
              ration file (see hg help config).  After there are no longer any
              modified  subrepositories,  it  records  their state and finally
              commits it in the parent  repository.   The  --addremove  option
              also  honors the -S/--subrepos option.  However, Git and Subver‐
              sion subrepositories will print a warning and abort.

       diff   diff does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is speci‐
              fied.  Changes  are  displayed  as usual, on the subrepositories
              elements.  Subversion  subrepositories  are  currently  silently
              ignored.

       files  files  does  not  recurse  into subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
              specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a  file  or
              directory  in  a  subrepo,  it  will  be  displayed even without
              -S/--subrepos being specified.  Git and Subversion  subreposito‐
              ries are currently silently ignored.

       forget forget  currently  only  handles exact file matches in subrepos.
              Git  and  Subversion  subrepositories  are  currently   silently
              ignored.

       incoming
              incoming  does  not  recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
              specified. Git  and  Subversion  subrepositories  are  currently
              silently ignored.

       outgoing
              outgoing  does  not  recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
              specified. Git  and  Subversion  subrepositories  are  currently
              silently ignored.

       pull   pull  is  not recursive since it is not clear what to pull prior
              to running hg update. Listing and retrieving all subrepositories
              changes referenced by the parent repository pulled changesets is
              expensive at best, impossible in the Subversion case.

       push   Mercurial will automatically push all subrepositories first when
              the  parent  repository  is  being pushed. This ensures new sub‐
              repository changes are available when  referenced  by  top-level
              repositories.  Push is a no-op for Subversion subrepositories.

       serve  serve does not recurse into subrepositories unless -S/--subrepos
              is specified.  Git and Subversion subrepositories are  currently
              silently ignored.

       status status  does not recurse into subrepositories unless -S/--subre‐
              pos is specified. Subrepository changes are displayed as regular
              Mercurial changes on the subrepository elements. Subversion sub‐
              repositories are currently silently ignored.

       remove remove does not recurse into subrepositories unless  -S/--subre‐
              pos  is  specified.  However, if you specify a file or directory
              path in a subrepo, it will be removed even  without  -S/--subre‐
              pos.   Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
              ignored.

       update update restores the subrepos in the state they  were  originally
              committed  in target changeset. If the recorded changeset is not
              available in the current subrepository, Mercurial will  pull  it
              in  first before updating.  This means that updating can require
              network access when using subrepositories.

   Remapping Subrepositories Sources
       A subrepository source location  may  change  during  a  project  life,
       invalidating references stored in the parent repository history. To fix
       this, rewriting rules can be defined in parent repository hgrc file  or
       in  Mercurial  configuration. See the [subpaths] section in hgrc(5) for
       more details.

TEMPLATE USAGE
       Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through templates.
       You  can either pass in a template or select an existing template-style
       from the command line, via the --template option.

       You can customize output for any  "log-like"  command:  log,  outgoing,
       incoming, tip, parents, and heads.

       Some  built-in  styles are packaged with Mercurial. These can be listed
       with hg log --template list. Example usage:

       $ hg log -r1.0::1.1 --template changelog

       A template is a piece of text, with markup to  invoke  variable  expan‐
       sion:

       $ hg log -r1 --template "{node}\n"
       b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746

   Keywords
       Strings  in  curly braces are called keywords. The availability of key‐
       words depends on the exact context of the templater. These keywords are
       usually available for templating a log-like command:

              String.  The  active  bookmark,  if  it  is  associated with the
              changeset.

       latesttag
              List of strings. The global tags on  the  most  recent  globally
              tagged  ancestor  of this changeset.  If no such tags exist, the
              list consists of the single string "null".

              mat. If the changeset has only one "natural" parent (the  prede‐
              cessor revision) nothing is shown.

       peerurls
              A dictionary of repository locations defined in the [paths] sec‐

              bose', or ''.

       The  "date" keyword does not produce human-readable output. If you want
       to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process it.  Fil‐
       ters  are  functions which return a string based on the input variable.
       Be sure to use the  stringify  filter  first  when  you're  applying  a
       string-input  filter to a list-like input variable.  You can also use a
       chain of filters to get the desired output:

       $ hg tip --template "{date|isodate}\n"
       2008-08-21 18:22 +0000

   Filters
       List of filters:

       addbreaks
              Any text. Add an XHTML "<br />" tag before the end of every line
              except the last.

       age    Date.  Returns a human-readable date/time difference between the
              given date/time and the current date/time.

       basename
              Any text. Treats the text as a path, and returns the last compo‐
              nent  of  the  path  after splitting by the path separator.  For
              example, "foo/bar/baz" becomes "baz" and "foo/bar//" becomes "".

       commondir
              List of text. Treats each list item as file name with / as  path
              separator and returns the longest common directory prefix shared
              by all list items.  Returns the empty string if no common prefix
              exists.

              The  list items are not normalized, i.e. "foo/../bar" is handled
              as file "bar" in the directory  "foo/..".  Leading  slashes  are
              ignored.

              For  example,  ["foo/bar/baz",  "foo/baz/bar"] becomes "foo" and
              ["foo/bar", "baz"] becomes "".

       count  List or text. Returns the length as an integer.

       dirname
              Any text. Treats the text as a path, and strips the last  compo‐
              nent of the path after splitting by the path separator.

       domain Any  text.  Finds  the  first  string  that  looks like an email
              address, and extracts just the domain component.  Example:  User
              <user@example.com> becomes example.com.

       email  Any  text.  Extracts  the  first string that looks like an email
              address. Example:  User  <user@example.com>  becomes  user@exam‐
              ple.com.

       emailuser
              Any text. Returns the user portion of an email address.

       escape Any text. Replaces the special XML/XHTML characters "&", "<" and
              ">" with XML entities, and filters out NUL characters.

       fill68 Any text. Wraps the text to fit in 68 columns.

       fill76 Any text. Wraps the text to fit in 76 columns.

       firstline
              Any text. Returns the first line of text.

       hex    Any text. Convert a binary Mercurial node  identifier  into  its
              long hexadecimal representation.

       hgdate Date.  Returns the date as a pair of numbers: "1157407993 25200"
              (Unix timestamp, timezone offset).

       isodate
              Date. Returns the date in ISO  8601  format:  "2009-08-18  13:00
              +0200".

       isodatesec
              Date.  Returns  the  date in ISO 8601 format, including seconds:
              "2009-08-18 13:00:13 +0200". See also the rfc3339date filter.

       json   Any object. Serializes the object to a JSON formatted text.

       lower  Any text. Converts the text to lowercase.

       nonempty
              Any text. Returns '(none)' if the string is empty.

       obfuscate
              Any text. Returns the input text rendered as a sequence  of  XML
              entities.

       person Any text. Returns the name before an email address, interpreting
              it as per RFC 5322.

       revescape
              Any text. Escapes all "special" characters, except  @.   Forward
              slashes  are  escaped  twice  to prevent web servers from prema‐
              turely unescaping them.  For  example,  "@foo  bar/baz"  becomes
              "@foo%20bar%252Fbaz".

       rfc3339date
              Date. Returns a date using the Internet date format specified in
              RFC 3339: "2009-08-18T13:00:13+02:00".

       rfc822date
              Date. Returns a date using the same format used in  email  head‐
              ers: "Tue, 18 Aug 2009 13:00:13 +0200".

       short  Changeset hash. Returns the short form of a changeset hash, i.e.
              a 12 hexadecimal digit string.

       shortbisect
              Any text. Treats label as a bisection status, and returns a sin‐
              gle-character  representing  the  status  (G:  good,  B: bad, S:
              skipped, U: untested, I: ignored). Returns single space if  text
              is not a valid bisection status.

       shortdate
              Date. Returns a date like "2006-09-18".

       slashpath
              Any text. Replaces the native path separator with slash.

       splitlines
              Any text. Split text into a list of lines.

       stringify
              Any  type.  Turns  the value into text by converting values into
              text and concatenating them.

       stripdir
              Treat the text as path and strip a directory level, if possible.
              For example, "foo" and "foo/bar" becomes "foo".

       tabindent
              Any text. Returns the text, with every non-empty line except the
              first starting with a tab character.

       upper  Any text. Converts the text to uppercase.

       urlescape
              Any text. Escapes all "special" characters.  For  example,  "foo
              bar" becomes "foo%20bar".

       user   Any text. Returns a short representation of a user name or email
              address.

       utf8   Any text. Converts from the local character encoding to UTF-8.

       Note that  a  filter  is  nothing  more  than  a  function  call,  i.e.
       expr|filter is equivalent to filter(expr).

   Functions
       In addition to filters, there are some basic built-in functions:

       date(date[, fmt])
              Format  a  date.  See  hg help dates for formatting strings. The
              default is a Unix date format, including the timezone: "Mon  Sep
              04 15:13:13 2006 0700".

       dict([[key=]value...])
              Construct a dict from key-value pairs. A key may be omitted if a
              value expression can provide an unambiguous name.

       diff([includepattern [, excludepattern]])
              Show a diff, optionally specifying files to include or exclude.

       files(pattern)
              All files of the current changeset matching the pattern. See  hg
              help patterns.

       fill(text[, width[, initialident[, hangindent]]])
              Fill  many  paragraphs with optional indentation. See the "fill"
              filter.

       filter(iterable[, expr])
              Remove empty elements from a list or a dict. If expr  specified,
              it's applied to each element to test emptiness.

       get(dict, key)
              Get  an  attribute/key from an object. Some keywords are complex
              types. This function allows  you  to  obtain  the  value  of  an
              attribute on these types.

       if(expr, then[, else])
              Conditionally execute based on the result of an expression.

       ifcontains(needle, haystack, then[, else])
              Conditionally  execute  based on whether the item "needle" is in
              "haystack".

       ifeq(expr1, expr2, then[, else])
              Conditionally execute based on whether 2 items are equivalent.

       indent(text, indentchars[, firstline])
              Indents all non-empty lines with the  characters  given  in  the
              indentchars  string.  An  optional third parameter will override
              the indent for the first line only if present.

       join(list, sep)
              Join items in a list with a delimiter.

       label(label, expr)
              Apply a label to generated content. Content with a label applied
              can result in additional post-processing, such as automatic col‐
              orization.

       latesttag([pattern])
              The global tags matching the given pattern on  the  most  recent
              globally  tagged  ancestor  of  this changeset.  If no such tags
              exist, the "{tag}" template resolves to the string  "null".  See
              hg help revisions.patterns for the pattern syntax.

       localdate(date[, tz])
              Converts a date to the specified timezone.  The default is local
              date.

              Return the author, updated according to the  value  set  in  the
              .mailmap file

       max(iterable)
              Return the max of an iterable

       min(iterable)
              Return the min of an iterable

       mod(a, b)
              Calculate a mod b such that a / b + a mod b == a

       pad(text, width[, fillchar=' '[, left=False[, truncate=False]]])
              Pad text with a fill character.

       relpath(path)
              Convert  a repository-absolute path into a filesystem path rela‐
              tive to the current working directory.

       revset(query[, formatargs...])
              Execute a revision set query. See hg help revset.

       rstdoc(text, style)
              Format reStructuredText.

       separate(sep, args...)
              Add a separator between non-empty arguments.

       shortest(node, minlength=4)
              Obtain the shortest representation of a node.

       startswith(pattern, text)
              Returns the value from the "text" argument if it begins with the
              content from the "pattern" argument.

       strip(text[, chars])
              Strip  characters  from a string. By default, strips all leading
              and trailing whitespace.

       sub(pattern, replacement, expression)
              Perform text substitution using regular expressions.

       word(number, text[, separator])
              Return the nth word from a string.

   Operators
       We provide a limited set of infix arithmetic operations on integers:

       + for addition
       - for subtraction
       * for multiplication
       / for floor division (division rounded to integer nearest -infinity)

       Division fulfills the law x = x / y + mod(x, y).

       Also, for any expression that returns a list, there is a list operator:

       expr % "{template}"

       As seen in the above example, {template} is interpreted as a  template.
       To  prevent  it from being interpreted, you can use an escape character
       \{ or a raw string prefix, r'...'.

       The dot operator can be used as a shorthand for accessing a sub item:

       · expr.member is roughly  equivalent  to  expr  %  '{member}'  if  expr
         returns a non-list/dict. The returned value is not stringified.

       · dict.key is identical to get(dict, 'key').

   Aliases
       New  keywords and functions can be defined in the templatealias section
       of a Mercurial configuration file:

       <alias> = <definition>

       Arguments of the form a1, a2, etc. are substituted from the alias  into
       the definition.

       For example,

       [templatealias]
       r = rev
       rn = "{r}:{node|short}"
       leftpad(s, w) = pad(s, w, ' ', True)

       defines two symbol aliases, r and rn, and a function alias leftpad().

       It's also possible to specify complete template strings, using the tem‐
       plates section. The syntax used is the general template string syntax.

       For example,

       [templates]
       nodedate = "{node|short}: {date(date, "%Y-%m-%d")}\n"

       defines a template, nodedate, which can be called like:

       $ hg log -r . -Tnodedate

       A template defined in templates section can  also  be  referenced  from
       another template:

       $ hg log -r . -T "{rev} {nodedate}"

       but  be  aware that the keywords cannot be overridden by templates. For
       example, a template defined as templates.rev cannot  be  referenced  as
       {rev}.

       A  template  defined  in templates section may have sub templates which
       are inserted before/after/between items:

       [templates]
       myjson = ' {dict(rev, node|short)|json}'
       myjson:docheader = '\{\n'
       myjson:docfooter = '\n}\n'
       myjson:separator = ',\n'

   Examples
       Some sample command line templates:

       · Format lists, e.g. files:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "files:\n{files % '  {file}\n'}"

       · Join the list of files with a ", ":

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "files: {join(files, ', ')}\n"

       · Join the list of files ending with ".py" with a ", ":

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "pythonfiles: {join(files('**.py'), ', ')}\n"

       · Separate non-empty arguments by a " ":

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{separate(' ', node, bookmarks, tags}\n"

       · Modify each line of a commit description:

         $ hg log --template "{splitlines(desc) % '**** {line}\n'}"

       · Format date:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{date(date, '%Y')}\n"

       · Display date in UTC:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{localdate(date, 'UTC')|date}\n"

       · Output the description set to a fill-width of 30:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{fill(desc, 30)}"

       · Use a conditional to test for the default branch:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{ifeq(branch, 'default', 'on the main branch',
         'on branch {branch}')}\n"

       · Append a newline if not empty:

         $ hg tip --template "{if(author, '{author}\n')}"

       · Label the output for use with the color extension:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{label('changeset.{phase}', node|short)}\n"

       · Invert the firstline filter, i.e. everything but the first line:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{sub(r'^.*\n?\n?', '', desc)}\n"

       · Display the contents of the 'extra' field, one per line:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{join(extras, '\n')}\n"

       · Mark the active bookmark with '*':

         $ hg log --template "{bookmarks % '{bookmark}{ifeq(bookmark, active, '*')} '}\n"

       · Find the previous release candidate tag,  the  distance  and  changes
         since the tag:

         $ hg log -r . --template "{latesttag('re:^.*-rc$') % '{tag}, {changes}, {distance}'}\n"

       · Mark the working copy parent with '@':

         $ hg log --template "{ifcontains(rev, revset('.'), '@')}\n"

       · Show details of parent revisions:

         $ hg log --template "{revset('parents(%d)', rev) % '{desc|firstline}\n'}"

       · Show only commit descriptions that start with "template":

         $ hg log --template "{startswith('template', firstline(desc))}\n"

       · Print the first word of each line of a commit message:

         $ hg log --template "{word(0, desc)}\n"

URL PATHS
       Valid URLs are of the form:

       local/filesystem/path[#revision]
       file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
       http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
       https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
       ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]

       Paths  in  the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial reposito‐
       ries or to bundle files (as created by hg bundle or hg incoming  --bun‐
       dle). See also hg help paths.

       An  optional  identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag, or
       changeset to use from the remote repository. See also hg help revisions
       .

       Some  features,  such  as pushing to http:// and https:// URLs are only
       possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the  remote  Mercurial
       server.

       Note that the security of HTTPS URLs depends on proper configuration of
       web.cacerts.

       Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:

       · SSH requires an accessible shell account on the  destination  machine
         and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with remotecmd.

       · path  is relative to the remote user's home directory by default. Use
         an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:

         ssh://example.com//tmp/repository

       · Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right thing to
         do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:

         Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
           Compression no
         Host *
           Compression yes

         Alternatively specify "ssh -C" as your ssh command in your configura‐
         tion file or with the --ssh command line option.

       These URLs can all be stored  in  your  configuration  file  with  path
       aliases under the [paths] section like so:

       [paths]
       alias1 = URL1
       alias2 = URL2
       ...

       You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for example
       hg pull alias1 will be treated as hg pull URL1).

       Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults when you
       do not provide the URL to a command:

       default:
              When  you  create  a repository with hg clone, the clone command
              saves the location of the source repository as the  new  reposi‐
              tory's 'default' path. This is then used when you omit path from
              push- and pull-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).

       default-push:
              The push command will look for a path named 'default-push',  and
              prefer it over 'default' if both are defined.

EXTENSIONS
       This section contains help for extensions that are distributed together
       with Mercurial. Help for other extensions is available in the help sys‐
       tem.

   absorb
       apply working directory changes to changesets (EXPERIMENTAL)

       The  absorb extension provides a command to use annotate information to
       amend modified chunks into the corresponding non-public changesets.

       [absorb]
       # only check 50 recent non-public changesets at most
       max-stack-size = 50
       # whether to add noise to new commits to avoid obsolescence cycle
       add-noise = 1
       # make `amend --correlated` a shortcut to the main command
       amend-flag = correlated

       [color]
       absorb.description = yellow
       absorb.node = blue bold
       absorb.path = bold

   Commands
   absorb
       incorporate corrections into the stack of draft changesets:

       hg absorb [OPTION] [FILE]...

       absorb analyzes each change in your working directory and  attempts  to
       amend  the  changed  lines into the changesets in your stack that first
       introduced those lines.

       If absorb cannot find an unambiguous changeset to amend for  a  change,
       that  change will be left in the working directory, untouched. They can
       be observed by hg status or hg diff afterwards. In other words,  absorb
       does not write to the working directory.

       Changesets outside the revset ::. and not public() and not merge() will
       not be changed.

       Changesets that  become  empty  after  applying  the  changes  will  be
       deleted.

       By default, absorb will show what it plans to do and prompt for confir‐
       mation.  If you are confident that the changes will be absorbed to  the
       correct place, run hg absorb -a to apply the changes immediately.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if all chunks were ignored and nothing amended.

       Options:

       -a, --apply-changes
              apply changes without prompting for confirmation

       -p, --print-changes
              always print which changesets are modified by which changes

       -i, --interactive
              interactively select which chunks to apply (EXPERIMENTAL)

       -e, --edit-lines
              edit what lines belong to which changesets before commit (EXPER‐
              IMENTAL)

       -n, --dry-run
              do not perform actions, just print output

       --style <STYLE>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   acl
       hooks for controlling repository access

       This hook makes it possible to allow or  deny  write  access  to  given
       branches  and  paths of a repository when receiving incoming changesets
       via pretxnchangegroup and pretxncommit.

       The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the system
       where  the  hook  runs, and not the committer of the original changeset
       (since the latter is merely informative).

       The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like hgsh, pre‐
       venting  authenticating users from doing anything other than pushing or
       pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users  have  interactive  shell
       access,  as  they  can  then disable the hook. Nor is it safe if remote
       users share an account, because then there is  no  way  to  distinguish
       them.

       The order in which access checks are performed is:

       1. Deny  list for branches (section acl.deny.branches)

       2. Allow list for branches (section acl.allow.branches)

       3. Deny  list for paths    (section acl.deny)

       4. Allow list for paths    (section acl.allow)

       The allow and deny sections take key-value pairs.

   Branch-based Access Control
       Use  the  acl.deny.branches  and  acl.allow.branches  sections  to have
       branch-based access control. Keys in these sections can be either:

       · a branch name, or

       · an asterisk, to match any branch;

       The corresponding values can be either:

       · a comma-separated list containing users and groups, or

       · an asterisk, to match anyone;

       You can add the "!" prefix to a user or group name to invert the  sense
       of the match.

   Path-based Access Control
       Use  the acl.deny and acl.allow sections to have path-based access con‐
       trol. Keys in these sections accept a subtree pattern (with a glob syn‐
       tax by default). The corresponding values follow the same syntax as the
       other sections above.

   Bookmark-based Access Control
       Use the acl.deny.bookmarks and  acl.allow.bookmarks  sections  to  have
       bookmark-based access control. Keys in these sections can be either:

       · a bookmark name, or

       · an asterisk, to match any bookmark;

       The corresponding values can be either:

       · a comma-separated list containing users and groups, or

       · an asterisk, to match anyone;

       You  can add the "!" prefix to a user or group name to invert the sense
       of the match.

       Note: for interactions between clients and servers using Mercurial 3.6+
       a  rejection  will  generally  reject the entire push, for interactions
       involving older  clients,  the  commit  transactions  will  already  be
       accepted, and only the bookmark movement will be rejected.

   Groups
       Group  names must be prefixed with an @ symbol. Specifying a group name
       has the same effect as specifying all the users in that group.

       You can define group members in the acl.groups  section.   If  a  group
       name  is  not defined there, and Mercurial is running under a Unix-like
       system, the list of users will be taken from  the  OS.   Otherwise,  an
       exception will be raised.

   Example Configuration
       [hooks]

       # Use this if you want to check access restrictions at commit time
       pretxncommit.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook

       # Use this if you want to check access restrictions for pull, push,
       # bundle and serve.
       pretxnchangegroup.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook

       [acl]
       # Allow or deny access for incoming changes only if their source is
       # listed here, let them pass otherwise. Source is "serve" for all
       # remote access (http or ssh), "push", "pull" or "bundle" when the
       # related commands are run locally.
       # Default: serve
       sources = serve

       [acl.deny.branches]

       # Everyone is denied to the frozen branch:
       frozen-branch = *

       # A bad user is denied on all branches:
       * = bad-user

       [acl.allow.branches]

       # A few users are allowed on branch-a:
       branch-a = user-1, user-2, user-3

       # Only one user is allowed on branch-b:
       branch-b = user-1

       # The super user is allowed on any branch:
       * = super-user

       # Everyone is allowed on branch-for-tests:
       branch-for-tests = *

       [acl.deny]
       # This list is checked first. If a match is found, acl.allow is not
       # checked. All users are granted access if acl.deny is not present.
       # Format for both lists: glob pattern = user, ..., @group, ...

       # To match everyone, use an asterisk for the user:
       # my/glob/pattern = *

       # user6 will not have write access to any file:
       ** = user6

       # Group "hg-denied" will not have write access to any file:
       ** = @hg-denied

       # Nobody will be able to change "DONT-TOUCH-THIS.txt", despite
       # everyone being able to change all other files. See below.
       src/main/resources/DONT-TOUCH-THIS.txt = *

       [acl.allow]
       # if acl.allow is not present, all users are allowed by default
       # empty acl.allow = no users allowed

       # User "doc_writer" has write access to any file under the "docs"
       # folder:
       docs/** = doc_writer

       # User "jack" and group "designers" have write access to any file
       # under the "images" folder:
       images/** = jack, @designers

       # Everyone (except for "user6" and "@hg-denied" - see acl.deny above)
       # will have write access to any file under the "resources" folder
       # (except for 1 file. See acl.deny):
       src/main/resources/** = *

       .hgtags = release_engineer

   Examples using the ! prefix
       Suppose  there's  a  branch that only a given user (or group) should be
       able to push to, and you don't want to restrict  access  to  any  other
       branch that may be created.

       The  "!"  prefix  allows  you  to prevent anyone except a given user or
       group to push changesets in a given branch or path.

       In the examples below, we will: 1) Deny access to branch "ring" to any‐
       one  but  user  "gollum"  2) Deny access to branch "lake" to anyone but
       members of the group "hobbit" 3) Deny access to a file  to  anyone  but
       user "gollum"

       [acl.allow.branches]
       # Empty

       [acl.deny.branches]

       # 1) only 'gollum' can commit to branch 'ring';
       # 'gollum' and anyone else can still commit to any other branch.
       ring = !gollum

       # 2) only members of the group 'hobbit' can commit to branch 'lake';

       /misty/mountains/cave/ring = !gollum

   amend
       provide the amend command (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This  extension  provides  an  amend  command that is similar to commit
       --amend but does not prompt an editor.

   Commands
   amend
       amend the  working  copy  parent  with  all  or  specified  outstanding
       changes:

       hg amend [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Similar  to  hg  commit  --amend,  but reuse the commit message without
       invoking editor, unless --edit was set.

       See hg help commit for more details.

       Options:

       -A, --addremove
              mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -i, --interactive
              use interactive mode

       -n,--note <VALUE>
              store a note on the amend

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -l,--logfile <FILE>
              read commit message from file

       -d,--date <DATE>
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u,--user <USER>
              record the specified user as committer

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   automv
       check for unrecorded moves at commit time (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension checks at commit/amend time  if  any  of  the  committed
       files comes from an unrecorded mv.

       The  threshold at which a file is considered a move can be set with the
       automv.similarity config option. This option takes a percentage between
       0 (disabled) and 100 (files must be identical), the default is 95.

   beautifygraph
       beautify log -G output by using Unicode characters (EXPERIMENTAL)

          A  terminal  with  UTF-8  support  and  monospace  narrow  text  are
          required.

   blackbox
       log repository events to a blackbox for debugging

       Logs event information to .hg/blackbox.log to help debug  and  diagnose
       problems.   The events that get logged can be configured via the black‐
       box.track config key.

       Examples:

       [blackbox]
       track = *
       # dirty is *EXPENSIVE* (slow);
       # each log entry indicates `+` if the repository is dirty, like :hg:`id`.
       dirty = True
       # record the source of log messages
       logsource = True

       [blackbox]
       track = command, commandfinish, commandexception, exthook, pythonhook

       [blackbox]
       track = incoming

       [blackbox]
       # limit the size of a log file
       maxsize = 1.5 MB
       # rotate up to N log files when the current one gets too big
       maxfiles = 3

   Commands
   blackbox
       view the recent repository events:

       hg blackbox [OPTION]...

       view the recent repository events

       Options:

       -l,--limit <VALUE>
              the number of events to show (default: 10)

   bugzilla
       hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker

       This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla  when  changesets
       that  refer  to  bugs by Bugzilla ID are seen. The comment is formatted
       using the Mercurial template mechanism.

       The bug references can optionally include an update for Bugzilla of the
       hours spent working on the bug. Bugs can also be marked fixed.

       Four basic modes of access to Bugzilla are provided:

       1. Access via the Bugzilla REST-API. Requires bugzilla 5.0 or later.

       2. Access  via  the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or
          later.

       3. Check data via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface and submit  bug  change
          via  email  to  Bugzilla  email  interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or
          later.

       4. Writing directly to the Bugzilla database. Only  Bugzilla  installa‐
          tions using MySQL are supported. Requires Python MySQLdb.

       Writing  directly to the database is susceptible to schema changes, and
       relies on a Bugzilla contrib script to send out bug change notification
       emails.  This script runs as the user running Mercurial, must be run on
       the host with the Bugzilla install, and  requires  permission  to  read
       Bugzilla  configuration  details and the necessary MySQL user and pass‐
       word to have full access rights to the  Bugzilla  database.  For  these
       reasons  this access mode is now considered deprecated, and will not be
       updated for new Bugzilla versions going forward. Only  adding  comments
       is supported in this access mode.

       Access  via  XMLRPC needs a Bugzilla username and password to be speci‐
       fied in the configuration. Comments  are  added  under  that  username.
       Since  the configuration must be readable by all Mercurial users, it is
       recommended that the rights of that user are restricted in Bugzilla  to
       the  minimum  necessary  to  add  comments. Marking bugs fixed requires
       Bugzilla 4.0 and later.

       Access via XMLRPC/email uses XMLRPC to query Bugzilla, but sends  email
       to  the Bugzilla email interface to submit comments to bugs.  The From:
       address in the email is set to the email address of the Mercurial user,
       so  the  comment  appears to come from the Mercurial user. In the event
       that the Mercurial user email  is  not  recognized  by  Bugzilla  as  a
       Bugzilla  user, the email associated with the Bugzilla username used to
       log into Bugzilla is used instead as the source of the comment. Marking
       bugs fixed works on all supported Bugzilla versions.

       Access  via  the REST-API needs either a Bugzilla username and password
       or an apikey specified in the configuration. Comments  are  made  under
       the given username or the user associated with the apikey in Bugzilla.

       Configuration items common to all access modes:

       bugzilla.version
              The access type to use. Values recognized are:

              restapi

                     Bugzilla REST-API, Bugzilla 5.0 and later.

              xmlrpc

              2.16

                     MySQL access, Bugzilla 2.16 and up to but  not  including
                     2.18.

       bugzilla.regexp
              Regular expression to match bug IDs for update in changeset com‐
              mit message.  It must contain one "()" named  group  <ids>  con‐
              taining  the  bug  IDs separated by non-digit characters. It may
              also contain a named group <hours> with a floating-point  number
              giving  the  hours  worked  on  the  bug. If no named groups are
              present, the first "()" group is assumed to contain the bug IDs,
              and work time is not updated. The default expression matches Bug
              1234, Bug no. 1234, Bug number 1234, Bugs  1234,5678,  Bug  1234
              and  5678  and  variations  thereof, followed by an hours number
              prefixed by h or hours, e.g. hours 1.5. Matching is case  insen‐
              sitive.

       bugzilla.fixregexp
              Regular expression to match bug IDs for marking fixed in change‐
              set commit message. This must contain a "()" named group  <ids>`
              containing the bug IDs separated by non-digit characters. It may
              also contain a named group ``<hours> with a floating-point  num‐
              ber  giving  the hours worked on the bug. If no named groups are
              present, the first "()" group is assumed to contain the bug IDs,
              and  work  time  is  not updated. The default expression matches
              Fixes 1234, Fixes bug 1234, Fixes bugs 1234,5678, Fixes 1234 and
              5678  and  variations  thereof, followed by an hours number pre‐
              fixed by h or hours, e.g. hours 1.5. Matching is  case  insensi‐
              tive.

       bugzilla.fixstatus
              The status to set a bug to when marking fixed. Default RESOLVED.

       bugzilla.fixresolution
              The  resolution  to  set  a  bug  to when marking fixed. Default
              FIXED.

       bugzilla.style
              The style file to use when formatting comments.

       bugzilla.template
              Template to use when formatting  comments.  Overrides  style  if
              specified.  In  addition  to  the  usual Mercurial keywords, the
              extension specifies:

              {bug}

                     The Bugzilla bug ID.

              {root}

                     The full pathname of the Mercurial repository.

              {webroot}

                     Stripped pathname of the Mercurial repository.

              {hgweb}

                     Base URL for browsing Mercurial repositories.

              Default changeset {node|short} in  repo  {root}  refers  to  bug
              {bug}.\ndetails:\n\t{desc|tabindent}

       bugzilla.strip
              The  number of path separator characters to strip from the front
              of the Mercurial repository path ({root} in templates)  to  pro‐
              duce   {webroot}.   For   example,   a  repository  with  {root}
              /var/local/my-project with a strip of 2 gives a value for  {web‐
              root} of my-project. Default 0.

       web.baseurl
              Base  URL  for  browsing Mercurial repositories. Referenced from
              templates as {hgweb}.

       Configuration items common to XMLRPC+email and MySQL access modes:

       bugzilla.usermap
              Path of file containing Mercurial committer  email  to  Bugzilla
              user  email  mappings. If specified, the file should contain one
              mapping per line:

              committer = Bugzilla user

              See also the [usermap] section.

       The [usermap] section is used to specify mappings of Mercurial  commit‐
       ter  email to Bugzilla user email. See also bugzilla.usermap.  Contains
       entries of the form committer = Bugzilla user.

       XMLRPC and REST-API access mode configuration:

       bugzilla.bzurl
              The  base  URL   for   the   Bugzilla   installation.    Default
              http://localhost/bugzilla.

              bugs.

       bugzilla.password
              The password for Bugzilla login.

       REST-API access mode uses the options listed above as well as:

       bugzilla.apikey
              An apikey generated on the Bugzilla  instance  for  api  access.
              Using  an apikey removes the need to store the user and password
              options.

       XMLRPC+email access mode uses  the  XMLRPC  access  mode  configuration
       items, and also:

       bugzilla.bzemail
              The Bugzilla email address.

       In  addition,  the Mercurial email settings must be configured. See the
       documentation in hgrc(5), sections [email] and [smtp].

       MySQL access mode configuration:

       bugzilla.host
              Hostname of the MySQL  server  holding  the  Bugzilla  database.
              Default localhost.

       bugzilla.db
              Name of the Bugzilla database in MySQL. Default bugs.

       bugzilla.user
              Username to use to access MySQL server. Default bugs.

              Database connection timeout (seconds). Default 5.

       bugzilla.bzuser
              Fallback  Bugzilla user name to record comments with, if change‐
              set committer cannot be found as a Bugzilla user.

       bugzilla.bzdir
              Bugzilla install directory.  Used  by  default  notify.  Default
              /var/www/html/bugzilla.

       bugzilla.notify
              The  command to run to get Bugzilla to send bug change notifica‐
              tion emails. Substitutes from a map with 3 keys, bzdir, id  (bug
              id) and user (committer bugzilla email). Default depends on ver‐
              sion; from 2.18 it is "cd %(bzdir)s && perl -T  contrib/sendbug‐
              mail.pl %(id)s %(user)s".

       Changeset commit comment. Bug 1234.

   censor
       erase file content at a given revision

       The  censor  command instructs Mercurial to erase all content of a file
       at a given revision without updating the changeset  hash.  This  allows
       existing  history  to remain valid while preventing future clones/pulls
       from receiving the erased data.

       Typical uses for censor are due  to  security  or  legal  requirements,
       including:

       * Passwords, private keys, cryptographic material
       * Licensed data/code/libraries for which the license has expired
       * Personally Identifiable Information or other private data

       Censored nodes can interrupt mercurial's typical operation whenever the
       excised data needs to be materialized. Some commands,  like  hg  cat/hg
       revert,  simply  fail when asked to produce censored data. Others, like
       hg verify and hg update, must be capable of tolerating censored data to
       continue  to  function in a meaningful way. Such commands only tolerate
       censored file  revisions  if  they  are  allowed  by  the  "censor.pol‐
       icy=ignore" config option.

   Commands
   censor
       hg censor -r REV [-t TEXT] [FILE]

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              censor file from specified revision

       -t,--tombstone <TEXT>
              replacement tombstone data

   children
       command to display child changesets (DEPRECATED)

       This  extension is deprecated. You should use hg log -r "children(REV)"
       instead.

   Commands
   children
       show the children of the given or working directory revision:

       hg children [-r REV] [FILE]

       Print the children of the working directory's revisions. If a  revision
       is  given  via -r/--rev, the children of that revision will be printed.
       If a file argument is given,  revision  in  which  the  file  was  last
       changed  (after the working directory revision or the argument to --rev
       if given) is printed.

       Please use hg log instead:

       hg children => hg log -r "children(.)"
       hg children -r REV => hg log -r "children(REV)"

       See hg help log and hg help revsets.children.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              show children of the specified revision (default: .)

       --style <STYLE>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   churn
       command to display statistics about repository history

   Commands
   churn
       histogram of changes to the repository:

       hg churn [-d DATE] [-r REV] [--aliases FILE] [FILE]

       This command will  display  a  histogram  representing  the  number  of
       changed  lines  or  revisions, grouped according to the given template.
       The default template will group changes by  author.   The  --dateformat
       option may be used to group the results by date instead.

       Statistics  are  based on the number of changed lines, or alternatively
       the number of matching revisions if the --changesets option  is  speci‐
       fied.

       Examples:

       # display count of changed lines for every committer
       hg churn -T "{author|email}"

       # display daily activity graph
       hg churn -f "%H" -s -c

       # display activity of developers by month
       hg churn -f "%Y-%m" -s -c

       # display count of lines changed in every year
       hg churn -f "%Y" -s

       It  is  possible  to map alternate email addresses to a main address by
       providing a file using the following format:

       <alias email> = <actual email>

   clonebundles
       advertise pre-generated bundles to seed clones

       "clonebundles" is a server-side extension used to advertise  the  exis‐
       tence  of pre-generated, externally hosted bundle files to clients that
       are cloning so that cloning can be faster, more reliable,  and  require
       less  resources  on  the server. "pullbundles" is a related feature for
       sending pre-generated bundle files to clients as part  of  pull  opera‐
       tions.

       Cloning can be a CPU and I/O intensive operation on servers. Tradition‐
       ally, the server, in response to a client's request to  clone,  dynami‐
       cally  generates  a bundle containing the entire repository content and
       sends it to the client.  There is no caching  on  the  server  and  the
       server  will  have  to redundantly generate the same outgoing bundle in
       response to each clone request. For servers with large repositories  or
       with  high  clone  volume,  the  load  from clones can make scaling the
       server challenging and costly.

       This extension provides server operators the ability to offload  poten‐
       tially  expensive clone load to an external service. Pre-generated bun‐
       dles also allow using more  CPU  intensive  compression,  reducing  the
       effective bandwidth requirements.

       Here's how clone bundles work:

       1. A  server  operator  establishes a mechanism for making bundle files
          available on a hosting service where  Mercurial  clients  can  fetch
          them.

       2. A  manifest  file  listing  available  bundle URLs and some optional
          metadata is added to the Mercurial repository on the server.

       3. A client initiates a clone against a clone bundles aware server.

       4. The client sees the server is advertising clone bundles and  fetches
          the manifest listing available bundles.

       5. The  client filters and sorts the available bundles based on what it
          supports and prefers.

       6. The client downloads  and  applies  an  available  bundle  from  the
          server-specified URL.

       7. The client reconnects to the original server and performs the equiv‐
          alent of hg pull to retrieve all repository data not in the  bundle.
          (The  repository could have been updated between when the bundle was
          created and when the client started the clone.) This may use  "pull‐
          bundles".

       Instead  of  the  server  generating  full repository bundles for every
       clone request, it generates full bundles once and they are subsequently
       reused  to  bootstrap new clones. The server may still transfer data at
       clone time.  However, this is only data  that  has  been  added/changed
       since the bundle was created. For large, established repositories, this
       can reduce server load for clones to less than 1% of original.

       Here's how pullbundles work:

       1. A manifest file listing available bundles and describing  the  revi‐
          sions is added to the Mercurial repository on the server.

       2. A  new-enough  client  informs  the  server that it supports partial
          pulls and initiates a pull.

       3. If the server has pull bundles enabled and sees the client advertis‐
          ing partial pulls, it checks for a matching pull bundle in the mani‐
          fest.  A bundle matches if the format is supported  by  the  client,
          the  client  has  the required revisions already and needs something
          from the bundle.

       4. If there is at least one matching bundle, the server sends it to the
          client.

       5. The  client applies the bundle and notices that the server reply was
          incomplete. It initiates another pull.

       To work, this extension requires the following of server operators:

       · Generating bundle files of  repository  content  (typically  periodi‐
         cally, such as once per day).

       · Clone  bundles: A file server that clients have network access to and
         that Python knows how to talk to  through  its  normal  URL  handling
         facility (typically an HTTP/HTTPS server).

       · A  process  for  keeping  the bundles manifest in sync with available
         bundle files.

       Strictly speaking, using a static file hosting server isn't required: a
       server operator could use a dynamic service for retrieving bundle data.
       However, static file hosting  services  are  simple  and  scalable  and
       should be sufficient for most needs.

       Bundle  files can be generated with the hg bundle command. Typically hg
       bundle --all is used to produce a bundle of the entire repository.

       hg  debugcreatestreamclonebundle can  be  used  to  produce  a  special
       streaming  clonebundle. These are bundle files that are extremely effi‐
       cient to produce and consume (read: fast).  However,  they  are  larger
       than  traditional  bundle  formats and require that clients support the
       exact set of repository data store formats in  use  by  the  repository
       that  created  them.   Typically, a newer server can serve data that is
       compatible with older clients.  However, streaming clone bundles  don't
       have  this guarantee. Server operators need to be aware that newer ver‐
       sions of Mercurial may produce  streaming  clone  bundles  incompatible
       with older Mercurial versions.

       A  server operator is responsible for creating a .hg/clonebundles.mani‐
       fest file containing the list of available bundle  files  suitable  for
       seeding  clones.  If  this file does not exist, the repository will not
       advertise the existence of clone bundles when clients connect. For pull
       bundles, .hg/pullbundles.manifest is used.

       The manifest file contains a newline (n) delimited list of entries.

       Each line in this file defines an available bundle. Lines have the for‐
       mat:

          <URL> [<key>=<value>[ <key>=<value>]]

       That is, a  URL  followed  by  an  optional,  space-delimited  list  of
       key=value  pairs  describing additional properties of this bundle. Both
       keys and values are URI encoded.

       For pull bundles, the URL is a path under  the  .hg  directory  of  the
       repository.

       Keys  in  UPPERCASE  are  reserved for use by Mercurial and are defined
       below.  All non-uppercase keys can be used by  site  installations.  An
       example use for custom properties is to use the datacenter attribute to
       define which data center a file is hosted in. Clients could then prefer
       a server in the data center closest to them.

       The following reserved keys are currently defined:

       BUNDLESPEC
              A  "bundle  specification" string that describes the type of the
              bundle.

              These are string values that are accepted by the "--type"  argu‐
              ment of hg bundle.

              The  values  are parsed in strict mode, which means they must be
              of    the    "<compression>-<type>"     form.     See     mercu‐
              rial.exchange.parsebundlespec() for more details.

              hg debugbundle --spec can be used to print the bundle specifica‐
              tion string for a bundle file. The output of this command can be
              used  verbatim  for  the  value  of  BUNDLESPEC  (it  is already
              escaped).

              Clients will automatically filter out  specifications  that  are
              unknown  or  unsupported so they won't attempt to download some‐
              thing that likely won't apply.

              The actual value doesn't impact client behavior  beyond  filter‐
              ing: clients will still sniff the bundle type from the header of
              downloaded files.

              Use of this key is highly recommended, as it allows  clients  to
              easily  skip unsupported bundles. If this key is not defined, an
              old client may attempt to apply a bundle that it is incapable of
              reading.

       REQUIRESNI
              Whether  Server  Name Indication (SNI) is required to connect to
              the URL.  SNI allows servers to use multiple certificates on the
              same  IP.  It  is  somewhat  common  in  CDNs  and other hosting
              providers. Older Python versions do not  support  SNI.  Defining
              this  attribute  enables  clients  with older Python versions to
              filter this entry without experiencing an opaque SSL failure  at
              connection time.

              If this is defined, it is important to advertise a non-SNI fall‐
              back URL or clients running old Python releases may not be  able
              to clone with the clonebundles facility.

              Value should be "true".

       heads  Used  for  pull bundles. This contains the ; separated changeset
              hashes of the heads of the bundle content.

       bases  Used for pull bundles. This contains the ;  separated  changeset
              hashes  of  the roots of the bundle content. This can be skipped
              if the bundle was created without --base.

       Manifests can contain multiple entries. Assuming metadata  is  defined,
       clients  will filter entries from the manifest that they don't support.
       The remaining entries  are  optionally  sorted  by  client  preferences
       (ui.clonebundleprefers  config  option).  The  client  then attempts to
       fetch the bundle at the first URL in the remaining list.

       Errors when downloading a bundle will fail the entire clone  operation:
       clients do not automatically fall back to a traditional clone. The rea‐
       son for this is that if a server is using clone bundles, it is probably
       doing  so  because  the feature is necessary to help it scale. In other
       words, there is an assumption that clone  load  will  be  offloaded  to
       another  service  and  that  the Mercurial server isn't responsible for
       serving this clone load.  If that other service experiences issues  and
       clients  start  mass falling back to the original Mercurial server, the
       added clone load could overwhelm the server due to unexpected load  and
       effectively take it offline. Not having clients automatically fall back
       to cloning from the original server mitigates this scenario.

       Because there is no automatic Mercurial server fallback on  failure  of
       the  bundle  hosting  service,  it is important for server operators to
       view the bundle hosting service as an extension of the Mercurial server
       in  terms  of  availability and service level agreements: if the bundle
       hosting service goes down, so does the ability for  clients  to  clone.
       Note: clients will see a message informing them how to bypass the clone
       bundles facility when a failure occurs. So server operators should pre‐
       pare  for  some  people  to  follow  these  instructions when a failure
       occurs, thus driving more load to the original  Mercurial  server  when
       the bundle hosting service fails.

   closehead
       close arbitrary heads without checking them out first

   Commands
   close-head
       close the given head revisions:

       hg close-head [OPTION]... [REV]...

       This  is  equivalent  to checking out each revision in a clean tree and
       running hg commit --close-branch, except that  it  doesn't  change  the
       working directory.

       The commit message must be specified with -l or -m.

       Options:

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -l,--logfile <FILE>
              read commit message from file

       -d,--date <DATE>
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u,--user <USER>
              record the specified user as committer

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              revision to check

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: close-heads

   commitextras
       adds a new flag extras to commit (ADVANCED)

   convert
       import revisions from foreign VCS repositories into Mercurial

   Commands
   convert
       convert a foreign SCM repository to a Mercurial one.:

       hg convert [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST [REVMAP]]

       Accepted source formats [identifiers]:

       · Mercurial [hg]

       · CVS [cvs]

       · Darcs [darcs]

       · git [git]

       · Subversion [svn]

       · Monotone [mtn]

       · GNU Arch [gnuarch]

       · Bazaar [bzr]

       · Perforce [p4]

       Accepted destination formats [identifiers]:

       · Mercurial [hg]

       · Subversion [svn] (history on branches is not preserved)

       If  no  revision is given, all revisions will be converted.  Otherwise,
       convert will only import up to the named revision (given  in  a  format
       understood by the source).

       If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the base‐
       name of the source with -hg appended.  If  the  destination  repository
       doesn't exist, it will be created.

       By default, all sources except Mercurial will use --branchsort.  Mercu‐
       rial uses --sourcesort to preserve  original  revision  numbers  order.
       Sort modes have the following effects:

       --branchsort
              convert from parent to child revision when possible, which means
              branches are usually converted one after the other. It generates
              more compact repositories.

       --datesort
              sort revisions by date. Converted repositories have good-looking
              changelogs but are often an order of magnitude larger  than  the
              same ones generated by --branchsort.

       --sourcesort
              try to preserve source revisions order, only supported by Mercu‐
              rial sources.

       --closesort
              try to move closed revisions as  close  as  possible  to  parent
              branches, only supported by Mercurial sources.

       If   REVMAP  isn't  given,  it  will  be  put  in  a  default  location
       (<dest>/.hg/shamap by default). The REVMAP is a simple text  file  that
       maps  each  source  commit  ID to the destination ID for that revision,
       like so:

       <source ID> <destination ID>

       If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created. It's updated  on
       each  commit  copied,  so  hg convert can be interrupted and can be run
       repeatedly to copy new commits.

       The authormap is a simple text file that maps each source commit author
       to  a  destination  commit author. It is handy for source SCMs that use
       unix logins to identify authors (e.g.: CVS). One line per  author  map‐
       ping and the line format is:

       source author = destination author

       Empty lines and lines starting with a # are ignored.

       The  filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files and
       directories. Each line can contain one of the following directives:

       include path/to/file-or-dir

       exclude path/to/file-or-dir

       rename path/to/source path/to/destination

       Comment lines start with #. A specified path matches if it  equals  the
       full  relative  name  of  a  file or one of its parent directories. The
       include or exclude directive with the longest matching path applies, so
       line order does not matter.

       The include directive causes a file, or all files under a directory, to
       be included in the destination repository. The default if there are  no
       include  statements is to include everything.  If there are any include
       statements, nothing else is included.   The  exclude  directive  causes
       files or directories to be omitted. The rename directive renames a file
       or directory if it is converted. To rename from a subdirectory into the
       root of the repository, use . as the path to rename to.

       --full  will  make  sure  the  converted changesets contain exactly the
       right files with the right content. It will make a full  conversion  of
       all  files, not just the ones that have changed. Files that already are
       correct will not be changed. This can be used to apply filemap  changes
       when  converting  incrementally.  This  is currently only supported for
       Mercurial and Subversion.

       The splicemap is a file that allows  insertion  of  synthetic  history,
       letting  you  specify  the parents of a revision. This is useful if you
       want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or graft two  discon‐
       nected  series of history together. Each entry contains a key, followed
       by a space, followed by one or two comma-separated values:

       key parent1, parent2

       The key is the revision ID in the source revision control system  whose
       parents  should  be  modified (same format as a key in .hg/shamap). The
       values are the revision IDs (in either the source or destination  revi‐
       sion  control  system)  that should be used as the new parents for that
       node. For example, if you have merged "release-1.0" into "trunk",  then
       you  should specify the revision on "trunk" as the first parent and the
       one on the "release-1.0" branch as the second.

       The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when  it  is
       being  brought  in from whatever external repository. When used in con‐
       junction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination to help
       fix  even  the  most  badly  mismanaged repositories and turn them into
       nicely structured Mercurial repositories. The branchmap contains  lines
       of the form:

       original_branch_name new_branch_name

       where  "original_branch_name"  is  the name of the branch in the source
       repository, and "new_branch_name" is the name of the branch is the des‐
       tination  repository.  No whitespace is allowed in the new branch name.
       This can be used to (for instance) move code  in  one  repository  from
       "default" to a named branch.

   Mercurial Source
       The  Mercurial  source  recognizes the following configuration options,
       which you can set on the command line with --config:

       convert.hg.ignoreerrors
              ignore integrity errors when reading.  Use it to  fix  Mercurial
              repositories  with  missing  revlogs,  by converting from and to
              Mercurial. Default is False.

       convert.hg.saverev
              store original revision ID in changeset (forces  target  IDs  to
              change). It takes a boolean argument and defaults to False.

       convert.hg.startrev
              specify the initial Mercurial revision.  The default is 0.

       convert.hg.revs
              revset specifying the source revisions to convert.

   Bazaar Source
       The following options can be used with --config:

       convert.bzr.saverev
              whether  to  store the original Bazaar commit ID in the metadata
              of the destination commit. The default is True.

   CVS Source
       CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out  copy)  from  CVS  to
       indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct access to
       the repository files is not needed, unless of course the repository  is
       :local:.  The conversion uses the top level directory in the sandbox to
       find the CVS repository, and then uses CVS rlog commands to find  files
       to  convert. This means that unless a filemap is given, all files under
       the starting directory will be converted, and that any directory  reor‐
       ganization in the CVS sandbox is ignored.

       The following options can be used with --config:

       convert.cvsps.cache
              Set  to  False  to  disable  remote log caching, for testing and
              debugging purposes. Default is True.

       convert.cvsps.fuzz
              Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that  is  allowed  between
              commits  with identical user and log message in a single change‐
              set. When very large files were checked in as part of a  change‐
              set then the default may not be long enough.  The default is 60.

       convert.cvsps.logencoding
              Specify  encoding  name  to be used for transcoding CVS log mes‐
              sages. Multiple encoding names can be specified as a  list  (see
              hg  help  config.Syntax), but only the first acceptable encoding
              in the list is used per CVS log  entries.  This  transcoding  is
              executed before cvslog hook below.

       convert.cvsps.mergeto
              Specify  a  regular  expression to which commit log messages are
              matched. If a match occurs, then  the  conversion  process  will
              insert  a  dummy  revision  merging the branch on which this log
              message occurs to the branch indicated in the regex. Default  is
              {{mergetobranch ([-\w]+)}}

       convert.cvsps.mergefrom
              Specify  a  regular  expression to which commit log messages are
              matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will add
              the most recent revision on the branch indicated in the regex as
              the second parent of the changeset. Default is {{mergefrombranch
              ([-\w]+)}}

       convert.localtimezone
              use  local  time  (as determined by the TZ environment variable)
              for changeset date/times. The default is False (use UTC).

       hooks.cvslog
              Specify a Python function to be called at the end  of  gathering
              the CVS log. The function is passed a list with the log entries,
              and can modify the entries in-place, or add or delete them.

       hooks.cvschangesets
              Specify a Python function to be called after the changesets  are
              calculated  from the CVS log. The function is passed a list with
              the changeset entries, and can modify the  changesets  in-place,
              or add or delete them.

       An additional "debugcvsps" Mercurial command allows the builtin change‐
       set merging code to be run without doing a conversion.  Its  parameters
       and  output  are  similar  to that of cvsps 2.1. Please see the command
       help for more details.

   Subversion Source
       Subversion source detects classical  trunk/branches/tags  layouts.   By
       default,  the  supplied  svn://repo/path/  source URL is converted as a
       single branch. If svn://repo/path/trunk exists it replaces the  default
       branch.  If  svn://repo/path/branches  exists,  its  subdirectories are
       listed as possible branches.  If  svn://repo/path/tags  exists,  it  is
       looked for tags referencing converted branches. Default trunk, branches
       and tags values can be overridden with following options. Set  them  to
       paths  relative  to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto
       detection.

       The following options can be set with --config:

       convert.svn.branches
              specify the  directory  containing  branches.   The  default  is
              branches.

       convert.svn.tags
              specify the directory containing tags. The default is tags.

       convert.svn.trunk
              specify the name of the trunk branch. The default is trunk.

       convert.localtimezone
              use  local  time  (as determined by the TZ environment variable)
              for changeset date/times. The default is False (use UTC).

       Source history can  be  retrieved  starting  at  a  specific  revision,
       instead  of  being integrally converted. Only single branch conversions
       are supported.

       convert.svn.startrev
              specify start Subversion revision number.  The default is 0.

   Git Source
       The Git importer converts commits from all reachable branches (refs  in
       refs/heads)  and remotes (refs in refs/remotes) to Mercurial.  Branches
       are converted to  bookmarks  with  the  same  name,  with  the  leading
       'refs/heads'  stripped. Git submodules are converted to Git subrepos in
       Mercurial.

       The following options can be set with --config:

       convert.git.similarity
              specify how similar files modified in a commit  must  be  to  be
              imported  as  renames or copies, as a percentage between 0 (dis‐
              abled) and 100 (files must be identical). For example, 90  means
              that a delete/add pair will be imported as a rename if more than
              90% of the file hasn't changed. The default is 50.

       convert.git.findcopiesharder
              while detecting copies, look at all files in  the  working  copy
              instead  of  just changed ones. This is very expensive for large
              projects, and is only effective when  convert.git.similarity  is
              greater than 0. The default is False.

       convert.git.renamelimit
              perform  rename and copy detection up to this many changed files
              in a commit. Increasing this will make rename and copy detection
              more  accurate  but  will significantly slow down computation on
              large projects. The option is only relevant if convert.git.simi‐
              larity is greater than 0. The default is 400.

       convert.git.committeractions
              list  of  actions  to  take when processing author and committer
              values.

              Git commits have separate author (who wrote the commit) and com‐
              mitter  (who  applied  the  commit) fields. Not all destinations
              support separate author and committer fields  (including  Mercu‐
              rial).  This config option controls what to do with these author
              and committer fields during conversion.

              A value of messagedifferent will append a committer:  ...   line
              to the commit message if the Git committer is different from the
              author. The prefix of that line can be specified using the  syn‐
              tax messagedifferent=<prefix>. e.g. messagedifferent=git-commit‐
              ter:.  When a prefix  is  specified,  a  space  will  always  be
              inserted between the prefix and the value.

              messagealways  behaves  like  messagedifferent  except  it  will
              always result in a committer: ... line  being  appended  to  the
              commit  message. This value is mutually exclusive with messaged‐
              ifferent.

              dropcommitter will remove references to the committer. Only ref‐
              erences  to  the author will remain. Actions that add references
              to the committer will have no effect when this is set.

              replaceauthor will replace the value of the  author  field  with
              the  committer. Other actions that add references to the commit‐
              ter will still take effect when this is set.

              The default is messagedifferent.

       convert.git.extrakeys
              list of extra keys from commit metadata to copy to the  destina‐
              tion. Some Git repositories store extra metadata in commits.  By
              default, this non-default metadata will be lost  during  conver‐
              sion.  Setting this config option can retain that metadata. Some
              built-in keys such as parent and branch are not  allowed  to  be
              copied.

       convert.git.remoteprefix
              remote    refs    are   converted   as   bookmarks   with   con‐
              vert.git.remoteprefix as a prefix followed by a /.  The  default
              is 'remote'.

       convert.git.saverev
              whether  to  store the original Git commit ID in the metadata of
              the destination commit. The default is True.

       convert.git.skipsubmodules
              does not convert root level  .gitmodules  files  or  files  with
              160000 mode indicating a submodule. Default is False.

   Perforce Source
       The  Perforce  (P4)  importer  can be given a p4 depot path or a client
       specification as source. It will convert all files in the source  to  a
       flat  Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches and integrations.
       Note that when a depot path is given you then usually should specify  a
       target directory, because otherwise the target may be named ...-hg.

       The following options can be set with --config:

       convert.p4.encoding
              specify the encoding to use when decoding standard output of the
              Perforce command line tool. The default is default system encod‐
              ing.

       convert.p4.startrev
              specify  initial  Perforce  revision (a Perforce changelist num‐
              ber).

   Mercurial Destination
       The Mercurial destination will recognize Mercurial  subrepositories  in
       the  destination  directory,  and update the .hgsubstate file automati‐
       cally    if    the    destination    subrepositories    contain     the
       <dest>/<sub>/.hg/shamap  file.  Converting a repository with subreposi‐
       tories requires converting a single repository at a time, from the bot‐
       tom up.

       An example showing how to convert a repository with subrepositories:

       # so convert knows the type when it sees a non empty destination
       $ hg init converted

       $ hg convert orig/sub1 converted/sub1
       $ hg convert orig/sub2 converted/sub2
       $ hg convert orig converted

       The following options are supported:

       convert.hg.clonebranches
              dispatch  source  branches  in  separate  clones. The default is
              False.

       convert.hg.tagsbranch
              branch name for tag revisions, defaults to default.

       convert.hg.usebranchnames
              preserve branch names. The default is True.

       convert.hg.sourcename
              records the given string as a 'convert_source'  extra  value  on
              each commit made in the target repository. The default is None.

   All Destinations
       All destination types accept the following options:

       convert.skiptags
              does  not  convert tags from the source repo to the target repo.
              The default is False.

       Options:

       --authors <FILE>
              username mapping filename (DEPRECATED) (use --authormap instead)

       -s,--source-type <TYPE>
              source repository type

       -d,--dest-type <TYPE>
              destination repository type

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              import up to source revision REV

       -A,--authormap <FILE>
              remap usernames using this file

       --filemap <FILE>
              remap file names using contents of file

       --full apply filemap changes by converting all files again

       --splicemap <FILE>
              splice synthesized history into place

       --branchmap <FILE>
              change branch names while converting

       --branchsort
              try to sort changesets by branches

       --datesort
              try to sort changesets by date

       --sourcesort
              preserve source changesets order

       --closesort
              try to reorder closed revisions

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   eol
       automatically manage newlines in repository files

       This extension allows you to manage the type of line endings  (CRLF  or
       LF) that are used in the repository and in the local working directory.
       That way you can get CRLF line endings on Windows and LF  on  Unix/Mac,
       thereby letting everybody use their OS native line endings.

       The  extension reads its configuration from a versioned .hgeol configu‐
       ration file found in the root of the working directory. The .hgeol file
       use the same syntax as all other Mercurial configuration files. It uses
       two sections, [patterns] and [repository].

       The [patterns] section specifies how line endings should  be  converted
       between  the working directory and the repository. The format is speci‐
       fied by a file pattern. The first match is used, so put  more  specific
       patterns first. The available line endings are LF, CRLF, and BIN.

       Files with the declared format of CRLF or LF are always checked out and
       stored in the repository in that format and files declared to be binary
       (BIN) are left unchanged. Additionally, native is an alias for checking
       out in the platform's default line ending: LF on Unix (including Mac OS
       X)  and  CRLF on Windows. Note that BIN (do nothing to line endings) is
       Mercurial's default behavior; it is only needed if you need to override
       a later, more general pattern.

       The optional [repository] section specifies the line endings to use for
       files stored in the repository. It has a single setting, native,  which
       determines the storage line endings for files declared as native in the
       [patterns] section. It can be set to LF or CRLF. The default is LF. For
       example,  this  means that on Windows, files configured as native (CRLF
       by default) will be converted to LF  when  stored  in  the  repository.
       Files declared as LF, CRLF, or BIN in the [patterns] section are always
       stored as-is in the repository.

       Example versioned .hgeol file:

       [patterns]
       **.py = native
       **.vcproj = CRLF
       **.txt = native
       Makefile = LF
       **.jpg = BIN

       [repository]
       native = LF

       Note   The rules will first apply when files are touched in the working
              directory, e.g. by updating to null and back to tip to touch all
              files.

       The extension uses an optional [eol] section read from both the  normal
       Mercurial  configuration  files  and  the  .hgeol file, with the latter
       overriding the former. You can use that section to control the  overall
       behavior. There are three settings:

       · eol.native  (default os.linesep) can be set to LF or CRLF to override
         the default interpretation of native for checkout. This can  be  used
         with hg archive on Unix, say, to generate an archive where files have
         line endings for Windows.

       · eol.only-consistent (default True) can be set to False  to  make  the
         extension  convert  files  with inconsistent EOLs. Inconsistent means
         that there is both CRLF and LF present in the file.  Such  files  are
         normally  not  touched under the assumption that they have mixed EOLs
         on purpose.

       · eol.fix-trailing-newline (default False) can be set to True to ensure
         that  converted  files end with a EOL character (either \n or \r\n as
         per the configured patterns).

       The extension provides cleverencode: and cleverdecode: filters like the
       deprecated  win32text  extension  does. This means that you can disable
       win32text and enable eol and your filters will  still  work.  You  only
       need to these filters until you have prepared a .hgeol file.

       The  win32text.forbid*  hooks  provided by the win32text extension have
       been unified into a single hook named eol.checkheadshook. The hook will
       lookup  the expected line endings from the .hgeol file, which means you
       must migrate to a .hgeol file first before using the  hook.  eol.check‐
       headshook  only  checks  heads,  intermediate invalid revisions will be
       pushed. To forbid them completely, use the eol.checkallhook hook. These
       hooks are best used as pretxnchangegroup hooks.

       See hg help patterns for more information about the glob patterns used.

   extdiff
       command to allow external programs to compare revisions

       The  extdiff Mercurial extension allows you to use external programs to
       compare revisions, or revision with  working  directory.  The  external
       diff  programs  are  called  with a configurable set of options and two
       non-option arguments: paths  to  directories  containing  snapshots  of
       files to compare.

       If  there is more than one file being compared and the "child" revision
       is the working directory, any modifications made in the  external  diff
       program will be copied back to the working directory from the temporary
       directory.

       The extdiff extension also allows you to configure new  diff  commands,
       so you do not need to type hg extdiff -p kdiff3 always.

       [extdiff]
       # add new command that runs GNU diff(1) in 'context diff' mode
       cdiff = gdiff -Nprc5
       ## or the old way:
       #cmd.cdiff = gdiff
       #opts.cdiff = -Nprc5

       # add new command called meld, runs meld (no need to name twice).  If
       # the meld executable is not available, the meld tool in [merge-tools]
       # will be used, if available
       meld =

       # add new command called vimdiff, runs gvimdiff with DirDiff plugin
       # (see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102) Non
       # English user, be sure to put "let g:DirDiffDynamicDiffText = 1" in
       # your .vimrc
       vimdiff = gvim -f "+next" \
                 "+execute 'DirDiff' fnameescape(argv(0)) fnameescape(argv(1))"

       Tool arguments can include variables that are expanded at runtime:

       $parent1, $plabel1 - filename, descriptive label of first parent
       $child,   $clabel  - filename, descriptive label of child revision
       $parent2, $plabel2 - filename, descriptive label of second parent
       $root              - repository root
       $parent is an alias for $parent1.

       The  extdiff extension will look in your [diff-tools] and [merge-tools]
       sections for diff tool arguments, when none are specified in [extdiff].

       [extdiff]
       kdiff3 =

       [diff-tools]
       kdiff3.diffargs=--L1 '$plabel1' --L2 '$clabel' $parent $child

       You can use -I/-X and list of file or directory names  like  normal  hg
       diff command.  The  extdiff  extension  makes  snapshots of only needed
       files, so running the external diff program  will  actually  be  pretty
       fast (at least faster than having to compare the entire tree).

   Commands
   extdiff
       use external program to diff repository (or selected files):

       hg extdiff [OPT]... [FILE]...

       Show  differences  between  revisions for the specified files, using an
       external program. The  default  program  used  is  diff,  with  default
       options "-Npru".

       To select a different program, use the -p/--program option. The program
       will be passed the names of two directories to compare. To  pass  addi‐
       tional  options  to  the program, use -o/--option. These will be passed
       before the names of the directories to compare.

       When two revision arguments are given, then changes are  shown  between
       those  revisions.  If only one revision is specified then that revision
       is compared to the working directory, and, when no revisions are speci‐
       fied, the working directory files are compared to its parent.

       Options:

       -p,--program <CMD>
              comparison program to run

       -o,--option <OPT[+]>
              pass option to comparison program

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              revision

       -c,--change <REV>
              change made by revision

       --patch
              compare patches for two revisions

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   factotum
       http authentication with factotum

       This extension allows the factotum(4) facility on Plan 9 from Bell Labs
       platforms to provide authentication information for HTTP  access.  Con‐
       figuration entries specified in the auth section as well as authentica‐
       tion information provided in the repository URL are fully supported. If
       no prefix is specified, a value of "*" will be assumed.

       By default, keys are specified as:

       proto=pass service=hg prefix=<prefix> user=<username> !password=<password>

       If  the factotum extension is unable to read the required key, one will
       be requested interactively.

       A configuration section is available to customize runtime behavior.  By
       default, these entries are:

       [factotum]
       executable = /bin/auth/factotum
       mountpoint = /mnt/factotum
       service = hg

       The  executable entry defines the full path to the factotum binary. The
       mountpoint entry defines the path to the factotum file service. Lastly,
       the service entry controls the service name used when reading keys.

   fastannotate
       yet another annotate implementation that might be faster (EXPERIMENTAL)

       The fastannotate extension provides a 'fastannotate' command that makes
       use of the linelog data structure as a cache layer and is  expected  to
       be faster than the vanilla 'annotate' if the cache is present.

       In  most  cases,  fastannotate requires a setup that mainbranch is some
       pointer that always moves forward, to be most efficient.

       Using fastannotate together with linkrevcache would speed  up  building
       the annotate cache greatly. Run "debugbuildlinkrevcache" before "debug‐
       buildannotatecache".

       [fastannotate]
       # specify the main branch head. the internal linelog will only contain
       # the linear (ignoring p2) "mainbranch". since linelog cannot move
       # backwards without a rebuild, this should be something that always moves
       # forward, usually it is "master" or "@".
       mainbranch = master

       # fastannotate supports different modes to expose its feature.
       # a list of combination:
       # - fastannotate: expose the feature via the "fastannotate" command which
       #   deals with everything in a most efficient way, and provides extra
       #   features like --deleted etc.
       # - fctx: replace fctx.annotate implementation. note:
       #     a. it is less efficient than the "fastannotate" command
       #     b. it will make it practically impossible to access the old (disk
       #        side-effect free) annotate implementation
       #     c. it implies "hgweb".
       # - hgweb: replace hgweb's annotate implementation. conflict with "fctx".
       # (default: fastannotate)
       modes = fastannotate

       # default format when no format flags are used (default: number)
       defaultformat = changeset, user, date

       # serve the annotate cache via wire protocol (default: False)
       # tip: the .hg/fastannotate directory is portable - can be rsynced
       server = True

       # build annotate cache on demand for every client request (default: True)
       # disabling it could make server response faster, useful when there is a

   Commands
   fetch
       pull, update and merge in one command (DEPRECATED)

   Commands
   fetch
       pull changes from a remote repository, merge new changes if needed.:

       hg fetch [SOURCE]

       This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path or URL
       and adds them to the local repository.

       If  the pulled changes add a new branch head, the head is automatically
       merged, and the result of the merge is committed.  Otherwise, the work‐
       ing directory is updated to include the new changes.

       When  a  merge is needed, the working directory is first updated to the
       newly pulled changes. Local changes are then  merged  into  the  pulled
       changes. To switch the merge order, use --switch-parent.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              a specific revision you would like to pull

       --edit invoke editor on commit messages

       --force-editor
              edit commit message (DEPRECATED)

       --switch-parent
              switch parents when merging

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -l,--logfile <FILE>
              read commit message from file

       -d,--date <DATE>
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u,--user <USER>
              record the specified user as committer

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   fix
       rewrite file content in changesets or working copy (EXPERIMENTAL)

       Provides  a command that runs configured tools on the contents of modi‐
       fied files, writing back any fixes to the  working  copy  or  replacing
       changesets.

       Here  is an example configuration that causes hg fix to apply automatic
       formatting fixes to modified lines in C++ code:

       [fix]
       clang-format:command=clang-format --assume-filename={rootpath}
       clang-format:linerange=--lines={first}:{last}
       clang-format:fileset=set:**.cpp or **.hpp

       The :command suboption forms the first part of the shell  command  that
       will  be used to fix a file. The content of the file is passed on stan‐
       dard input, and the fixed file content is expected on standard  output.
       If  there  is  any  output  on  standard  error,  the  file will not be
       affected. Some values may be substituted into the command:

       {rootpath}  The path of the file being fixed, relative to the repo root
       {basename}  The name of the file being fixed, without the directory path

       If the :linerange suboption is set, the tool will only be run if  there
       are changed lines in a file. The value of this suboption is appended to
       the shell command once for every range of changed lines  in  the  file.
       Some values may be substituted into the command:

       {first}   The 1-based line number of the first line in the modified range
       {last}    The 1-based line number of the last line in the modified range

       The  :fileset  suboption  determines which files will be passed through
       each configured tool. See hg help fileset for possible values. If there
       are  file  arguments  to  hg fix, the intersection of these filesets is
       used.

       There is also a configurable limit for the maximum size  of  file  that
       will be processed by hg fix:

       [fix]
       maxfilesize=2MB

   Commands
   fix
       rewrite file content in changesets or working directory:

       hg fix [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Runs  any  configured  tools  to fix the content of files. Only affects
       files with changes, unless file arguments are  provided.  Only  affects
       changed lines of files, unless the --whole flag is used. Some tools may
       always affect the whole file regardless of --whole.

       If revisions are specified with --rev, those revisions will be checked,
       and  they  may be replaced with new revisions that have fixed file con‐
       tent.  It is desirable to specify all  descendants  of  each  specified
       revision,  so  that  the  fixes  propagate  to  the descendants. If all
       descendants are fixed at the same time, no merging, rebasing, or evolu‐
       tion will be required.

       If --working-dir is used, files with uncommitted changes in the working
       copy will be fixed. If the checked-out  revision  is  also  fixed,  the
       working directory will update to the replacement revision.

       When  determining  what lines of each file to fix at each revision, the
       whole set of revisions being fixed is considered, so that fixes to ear‐
       lier  revisions are not forgotten in later ones. The --base flag can be
       used to override this default behavior, though it is not usually desir‐
       able to do so.

       Options:

       --all  fix all non-public non-obsolete revisions

       --base <REV[+]>
              revisions  to  diff  against (overrides automatic selection, and
              applies to every revision being fixed)

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              revisions to fix

       -w, --working-dir
              fix the working directory

       --whole
              always fix every line of a file

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   fsmonitor
       Faster status operations with the Watchman file monitor (EXPERIMENTAL)

       Integrates the file-watching program Watchman with Mercurial to produce
       faster status results.

       On  a  particular  Linux  system, for a real-world repository with over
       400,000 files hosted on ext4, vanilla hg status takes 1.3  seconds.  On
       the same system, with fsmonitor it takes about 0.3 seconds.

       fsmonitor requires no configuration -- it will tell Watchman about your
       repository  as  necessary.  You'll  need  to  install   Watchman   from
       https://facebook.github.io/watchman/ and make sure it is in your PATH.

       fsmonitor  is  incompatible with the largefiles and eol extensions, and
       will disable itself if any of those are active.

       The following configuration options exist:

       [fsmonitor]
       mode = {off, on, paranoid}

       When mode = off, fsmonitor will disable itself (similar to not  loading
       the  extension  at all). When mode = on, fsmonitor will be enabled (the
       default).  When mode = paranoid, fsmonitor will query both Watchman and
       the filesystem, and ensure that the results are consistent.

       [fsmonitor]
       timeout = (float)

       A  value,  in seconds, that determines how long fsmonitor will wait for
       Watchman to return results. Defaults to 2.0.

       [fsmonitor]
       blacklistusers = (list of userids)

       A list of usernames for which fsmonitor will disable itself altogether.

       [fsmonitor]
       walk_on_invalidate = (boolean)

       Whether or not to walk the whole repo ourselves when our  cached  state
       has  been  invalidated, for example when Watchman has been restarted or
       .hgignore rules have been changed. Walking the repo in  that  case  can
       result in competing for I/O with Watchman. For large repos it is recom‐
       mended to set this value to false. You may wish to set this to true  if
       you  have  a  very fast filesystem that can outpace the IPC overhead of
       getting the result data for the full repo from  Watchman.  Defaults  to
       false.

       [fsmonitor]
       warn_when_unused = (boolean)

       Whether  to  print  a  warning during certain operations when fsmonitor
       would be beneficial to performance but isn't enabled.

       [fsmonitor]
       warn_update_file_count = (integer)

       If warn_when_unused is set and fsmonitor isn't enabled, a warning  will
       be  printed during working directory updates if this many files will be
       created.

   githelp
       try mapping git commands to Mercurial commands

       Tries to map a given git command to a Mercurial command:

          $ hg githelp -- git checkout master hg update master

       If an unknown command or parameter combination is detected, an error is
       produced.

   Commands
   githelp
       suggests the Mercurial equivalent of the given git command:

       hg githelp

       Usage: hg githelp -- <git command>

          aliases: git

   gpg
       commands to sign and verify changesets

   Commands
   sigcheck
       verify all the signatures there may be for a particular revision:

       hg sigcheck REV

       verify all the signatures there may be for a particular revision

   sign
       add a signature for the current or given revision:

       hg sign [OPTION]... [REV]...

       If  no  revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,
       or tip if no revision is checked out.

       The gpg.cmd config setting can be used to specify the command to run. A
       default key can be specified with gpg.key.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Options:

       -l, --local
              make the signature local

       -f, --force
              sign even if the sigfile is modified

   graphlog
       command to view revision graphs from a shell (DEPRECATED)

       The  functionality of this extension has been include in core Mercurial
       since version 2.3. Please use hg log -G ... instead.

       This extension adds a --graph option to the incoming, outgoing and  log
       commands.  When  this  options is given, an ASCII representation of the
       revision graph is also shown.

   Commands
   glog

       hg glog [OPTION]... [FILE]

       Print a revision history alongside a revision graph  drawn  with  ASCII
       characters.

       Nodes printed as an @ character are parents of the working directory.

       This is an alias to hg log -G.

       Options:

       -f, --follow
              follow  changeset  history,  or  file  history across copies and
              renames

   hgk
       browse the repository in a graphical way

       The hgk extension allows browsing the history  of  a  repository  in  a
       graphical  way. It requires Tcl/Tk version 8.4 or later. (Tcl/Tk is not
       distributed with Mercurial.)

       hgk consists of two parts: a Tcl script that does  the  displaying  and
       querying  of  information,  and an extension to Mercurial named hgk.py,
       which provides hooks for hgk to get information. hgk can  be  found  in
       the contrib directory, and the extension is shipped in the hgext repos‐
       itory, and needs to be enabled.

       The hg view command will launch the hgk Tcl script. For this command to
       work, hgk must be in your search path. Alternately, you can specify the
       path to hgk in your configuration file:

       [hgk]
       path = /location/of/hgk

       hgk can make use of  the  extdiff  extension  to  visualize  revisions.
       Assuming you had already configured extdiff vdiff command, just add:

       [hgk]
       vdiff=vdiff

       Revisions  context  menu  will  now  display additional entries to fire
       vdiff on hovered and selected revisions.

   Commands
   view
       start interactive history viewer:

       hg view [-l LIMIT] [REVRANGE]

       start interactive history viewer

       Options:

       -l,--limit <NUM>
              limit number of changes displayed

   highlight
       syntax highlighting for hgweb (requires Pygments)

       It   depends   on   the   Pygments   syntax    highlighting    library:
       http://pygments.org/

       There are the following configuration options:

       [web]
       pygments_style = <style> (default: colorful)
       highlightfiles = <fileset> (default: size('<5M'))
       highlightonlymatchfilename = <bool> (default False)

       highlightonlymatchfilename  will  only  highlight  files  if their type
       could be identified by their filename. When this is  not  enabled  (the
       default),  Pygments  will  try very hard to identify the file type from
       content and any match (even matches with a low confidence  score)  will
       be used.

   histedit
       interactive history editing

       With  this extension installed, Mercurial gains one new command: histe‐
       dit. Usage is as follows, assuming the following history:

       @  3[tip]   7c2fd3b9020c   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add delta
       |
       o  2   030b686bedc4   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add gamma
       |
       o  1   c561b4e977df   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add beta
       |
       o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
            Add alpha

       If you were to run hg histedit c561b4e977df, you would see the  follow‐
       ing file open in your editor:

       pick c561b4e977df Add beta
       pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
       pick 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

       # Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
       #
       # Commits are listed from least to most recent
       #
       # Commands:
       #  p, pick = use commit
       #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
       #  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
       #  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit's description and date
       #  d, drop = remove commit from history
       #  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
       #  b, base = checkout changeset and apply further changesets from there
       #

       In  this  file,  lines beginning with # are ignored. You must specify a
       rule for each revision in your history. For example, if you  had  meant
       to  add  gamma  before  beta,  and then wanted to add delta in the same
       revision as beta, you would reorganize the file to look like this:

       pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
       pick c561b4e977df Add beta
       fold 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

       # Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
       #
       # Commits are listed from least to most recent
       #
       # Commands:
       #  p, pick = use commit
       #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
       #  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
       #  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit's description and date
       #  d, drop = remove commit from history
       #  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
       #  b, base = checkout changeset and apply further changesets from there
       #

       At which point you close the editor and histedit starts  working.  When
       you  specify  a  fold  operation,  histedit will open an editor when it
       folds those revisions together, offering you a chance to clean  up  the
       commit message:

       Add beta
       ***
       Add delta

       Edit the commit message to your liking, then close the editor. The date
       used for the commit will be the later of the two  commits'  dates.  For
       this  example,  let's assume that the commit message was changed to Add
       beta and delta.  After histedit has run and had a chance to remove  any
       old or temporary revisions it needed, the history looks like this:

       @  2[tip]   989b4d060121   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add beta and delta.
       |
       o  1   081603921c3f   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add gamma
       |
       o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
            Add alpha

       Note  that  histedit does not remove any revisions (even its own tempo‐
       rary ones) until after it has completed all the editing operations,  so
       it  will  probably perform several strip operations when it's done. For
       the above example, it had to run strip twice. Strip can be slow depend‐
       ing  on a variety of factors, so you might need to be a little patient.
       You can choose to keep the original revisions  by  passing  the  --keep
       flag.

       The edit operation will drop you back to a command prompt, allowing you
       to edit files freely, or even use hg record to commit some changes as a
       separate  commit.  When  you're done, any remaining uncommitted changes
       will be committed as well. When done, run  hg  histedit  --continue  to
       finish  this step. If there are uncommitted changes, you'll be prompted
       for a new commit message, but the default commit message  will  be  the
       original message for the edit ed revision, and the date of the original
       commit will be preserved.

       The message operation will give you a chance to revise a commit message
       without  changing  the contents. It's a shortcut for doing edit immedi‐
       ately followed by hg histedit --continue`.

       If histedit encounters a conflict when moving a  revision  (while  han‐
       dling  pick  or  fold), it'll stop in a similar manner to edit with the
       difference that it won't prompt you for a commit message when done.  If
       you  decide  at this point that you don't like how much work it will be
       to rearrange history, or that you made a mistake, you can use hg histe‐
       dit  --abort to abandon the new changes you have made and return to the
       state before you attempted to edit your history.

       If we clone the histedit-ed example repository above and add four  more
       changes, such that we have the following history:

       @  6[tip]   038383181893   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   stefan

       If  you  run hg histedit --outgoing on the clone then it is the same as
       running hg histedit 836302820282. If you need plan to push to a reposi‐
       tory  that  Mercurial does not detect to be related to the source repo,
       you can add a --force option.

   Config
       Histedit rule lines are truncated to 80 characters by default. You  can
       customize  this behavior by setting a different length in your configu‐
       ration file:

       [histedit]
       linelen = 120      # truncate rule lines at 120 characters

       hg histedit attempts to automatically choose an appropriate base  revi‐
       sion  to use. To change which base revision is used, define a revset in
       your configuration file:

       [histedit]
       defaultrev = only(.) & draft()

       By default each edited revision needs to be present  in  histedit  com‐
       mands.  To remove revision you need to use drop operation. You can con‐
       figure the drop to be implicit for missing commits by adding:

       [histedit]
       dropmissing = True

       By default, histedit will close the transaction after each action.  For
       performance purposes, you can configure histedit to use a single trans‐
       action across the entire histedit. WARNING: This setting  introduces  a
       significant  risk  of  losing the work you've done in a histedit if the
       histedit aborts unexpectedly:

       [histedit]
       singletransaction = True

   Commands
   histedit
       interactively edit changeset history:

       hg histedit [OPTIONS] ([ANCESTOR] | --outgoing [URL])

       This command lets you edit a linear series of  changesets  (up  to  and
       including the working directory, which should be clean).  You can:

       · pick to [re]order a changeset

       · drop to omit changeset

       · mess to reword the changeset commit message

       · fold  to  combine  it  with  the preceding changeset (using the later
         date)

       · roll like fold, but discarding this commit's description and date

       · edit to edit this changeset (preserving date)

       · base to checkout changeset and apply further changesets from there

       There are a number of ways to select the root changeset:

       · Specify ANCESTOR directly

       · Use --outgoing -- it will be the first linear changeset not  included
         in destination. (See hg help config.paths.default-push)

       · Otherwise,  the value from the "histedit.defaultrev" config option is
         used as a revset to select the base revision  when  ANCESTOR  is  not
         specified.  The  first  revision  returned  by the revset is used. By
         default, this selects the editable history  that  is  unique  to  the
         ancestry of the working directory.

       If  you  use --outgoing, this command will abort if there are ambiguous
       outgoing revisions. For example, if there are  multiple  branches  con‐
       taining outgoing revisions.

       Use  "min(outgoing()  and ::.)" or similar revset specification instead
       of --outgoing to specify edit target revision exactly in such ambiguous
       situation. See hg help revsets for detail about selecting revisions.

       Examples:

          · A  number  of  changes  have  been  made.  Revision 3 is no longer
            needed.

            Start history editing from revision 3:

            hg histedit -r 3

            An editor opens, containing the list of revisions,  with  specific
            actions specified:

            pick 5339bf82f0ca 3 Zworgle the foobar
            pick 8ef592ce7cc4 4 Bedazzle the zerlog
            pick 0a9639fcda9d 5 Morgify the cromulancy

            Additional  information about the possible actions to take appears
            below the list of revisions.

            To remove revision 3 from the history, its action (at  the  begin‐
            ning of the relevant line) is changed to 'drop':

            drop 5339bf82f0ca 3 Zworgle the foobar
            pick 8ef592ce7cc4 4 Bedazzle the zerlog
            pick 0a9639fcda9d 5 Morgify the cromulancy

          · A  number  of changes have been made.  Revision 2 and 4 need to be
            swapped.

            Start history editing from revision 2:

            hg histedit -r 2

            An editor opens, containing the list of revisions,  with  specific
            actions specified:

            pick 252a1af424ad 2 Blorb a morgwazzle
            pick 5339bf82f0ca 3 Zworgle the foobar
            pick 8ef592ce7cc4 4 Bedazzle the zerlog

            To swap revision 2 and 4, its lines are swapped in the editor:

            pick 8ef592ce7cc4 4 Bedazzle the zerlog
            pick 5339bf82f0ca 3 Zworgle the foobar
            pick 252a1af424ad 2 Blorb a morgwazzle

       Returns  0 on success, 1 if user intervention is required (not only for
       intentional "edit" command, but  also  for  resolving  unexpected  con‐
       flicts).

       Options:

       --commands <FILE>
              read history edits from the specified file

              bookmarks are tracked by  remotenames  extension.   bookmarks  =
              True

   journal
       track previous positions of bookmarks (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This  extension  adds  a new command: hg journal, which shows you where
       bookmarks were previously located.

   Commands
   journal
       show the previous position of bookmarks and the working copy:

       hg journal [OPTION]... [BOOKMARKNAME]

       The journal is used to see the previous commits that bookmarks and  the
       working  copy  pointed  to.  By  default the previous locations for the
       working copy.  Passing a bookmark name will show all the previous posi‐
       tions of that bookmark. Use the --all switch to show previous locations
       for all bookmarks and the working copy; each line will then include the
       bookmark name, or '.' for the working copy, as well.

       If name starts with re:, the remainder of the name is treated as a reg‐
       ular expression. To match a name that actually starts with re:, use the
       prefix literal:.

       By  default  hg journal only shows the commit hash and the command that
       was running at that time. -v/--verbose will show the  prior  hash,  the
       user, and the time at which it happened.

       Use -c/--commits to output log information on each commit hash; at this
       point you can use the  usual  --patch,  --git,  --stat  and  --template
       switches to alter the log output for these.

       hg journal -T json can be used to produce machine readable output.

       Options:

       --all  show history for all names

       -c, --commits
              show commit metadata

       -p, --patch
              show patch

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       -l,--limit <NUM>
              limit number of changes displayed

       --stat output diffstat-style summary of changes

       --style <STYLE>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   keyword
       expand keywords in tracked files

       This  extension  expands  RCS/CVS-like or self-customized $Keywords$ in
       tracked text files selected by your configuration.

       Keywords are only expanded in local repositories and not stored in  the
       change  history. The mechanism can be regarded as a convenience for the
       current user or for archive distribution.

       Keywords expand to the changeset data pertaining to the  latest  change
       relative to the working directory parent of each file.

       Configuration  is done in the [keyword], [keywordset] and [keywordmaps]
       sections of hgrc files.

       Example:

       [keyword]
       # expand keywords in every python file except those matching "x*"
       **.py =
       x*    = ignore

       [keywordset]
       # prefer svn- over cvs-like default keywordmaps
       svn = True

       Note   The more specific you are in your filename patterns the less you
              lose speed in huge repositories.

       For [keywordmaps] template mapping and expansion demonstration and con‐
       trol run hg kwdemo. See hg help templates for a list of available  tem‐
       plates and filters.

       Three additional date template filters are provided:

       utcdate

              "2006/09/18 15:13:13"

       svnutcdate

              "2006-09-18 15:13:13Z"

       svnisodate

              "2006-09-18 08:13:13 -700 (Mon, 18 Sep 2006)"

       The  default template mappings (view with hg kwdemo -d) can be replaced
       with customized keywords and templates. Again, run hg kwdemo to control
       the results of your configuration changes.

       Before  changing/disabling active keywords, you must run hg kwshrink to
       avoid storing expanded keywords in the change history.

       To force expansion after enabling it, or a configuration change, run hg
       kwexpand.

       Expansions spanning more than one line and incremental expansions, like
       CVS' $Log$, are not supported. A keyword template map  "Log  =  {desc}"
       expands to the first line of the changeset description.

   Commands
   kwdemo
       print [keywordmaps] configuration and an expansion example:

       hg kwdemo [-d] [-f RCFILE] [TEMPLATEMAP]...

       Show current, custom, or default keyword template maps and their expan‐
       sions.

       Extend the current configuration by specifying maps  as  arguments  and
       using -f/--rcfile to source an external hgrc file.

       Use -d/--default to disable current configuration.

       See hg help templates for information on templates and filters.

       Options:

       -d, --default
              show default keyword template maps

       -f,--rcfile <FILE>
              read maps from rcfile

   kwexpand
       expand keywords in the working directory:

       hg kwexpand [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Run after (re)enabling keyword expansion.

       kwexpand refuses to run if given files contain local changes.

       Options:

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   kwfiles
       show files configured for keyword expansion:

       hg kwfiles [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       List  which files in the working directory are matched by the [keyword]
       configuration patterns.

       Useful to prevent inadvertent keyword expansion and to speed up  execu‐
       tion by including only files that are actual candidates for expansion.

       See hg help keyword on how to construct patterns both for inclusion and
       exclusion of files.

       With -A/--all and -v/--verbose the codes used to  show  the  status  of
       files are:

       K = keyword expansion candidate
       k = keyword expansion candidate (not tracked)
       I = ignored
       i = ignored (not tracked)

       Options:

       -A, --all
              show keyword status flags of all files

       -i, --ignore
              show files excluded from expansion

       -u, --unknown
              only show unknown (not tracked) files

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   kwshrink
       revert expanded keywords in the working directory:

       hg kwshrink [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Must be run before changing/disabling active keywords.

       kwshrink refuses to run if given files contain local changes.

       Options:

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   largefiles
       track large binary files

       Large binary files tend to be not very compressible, not very diffable,
       and not at all mergeable. Such files are  not  handled  efficiently  by
       Mercurial's  storage  format  (revlog),  which  is  based on compressed
       binary deltas; storing large binary files as  regular  Mercurial  files
       wastes bandwidth and disk space and increases Mercurial's memory usage.
       The largefiles extension addresses these problems by adding a  central‐
       ized client-server layer on top of Mercurial: largefiles live in a cen‐
       tral store out on the network somewhere, and you only fetch  the  revi‐
       sions that you need when you need them.

       largefiles  works  by  maintaining  a "standin file" in .hglf/ for each
       largefile. The standins are small (41 bytes: an SHA-1  hash  plus  new‐
       line)  and are tracked by Mercurial. Largefile revisions are identified
       by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, which is written to  the  standin.
       largefiles uses that revision ID to get/put largefile revisions from/to
       the central store. This saves both disk space and bandwidth, since  you
       don't need to retrieve all historical revisions of large files when you
       clone or pull.

       To start a new repository or add  new  large  binary  files,  just  add
       --large to your hg add command. For example:

       $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=randomdata count=2000
       $ hg add --large randomdata
       $ hg commit -m "add randomdata as a largefile"

       When  you  push  a  changeset that adds/modifies largefiles to a remote
       repository, its largefile revisions will be  uploaded  along  with  it.
       Note  that the remote Mercurial must also have the largefiles extension
       enabled for this to work.

       When you pull a changeset that affects largefiles from a remote reposi‐
       tory,  the  largefiles  for the changeset will by default not be pulled
       down. However, when you update  to  such  a  revision,  any  largefiles
       needed  by  that revision are downloaded and cached (if they have never
       been downloaded before). One way to pull  largefiles  when  pulling  is
       thus to use --update, which will update your working copy to the latest
       pulled revision (and thereby downloading any new largefiles).

       If you want to pull largefiles you don't need for update yet, then  you
       can use pull with the --lfrev option or the hg lfpull command.

       If  you  know  you  are pulling from a non-default location and want to
       download all the largefiles that correspond to the  new  changesets  at
       the same time, then you can pull with --lfrev "pulled()".

       If  you just want to ensure that you will have the largefiles needed to
       merge or rebase with new heads that you are pulling, then you can  pull
       with --lfrev "head(pulled())" flag to pre-emptively download any large‐
       files that are new in the heads you are pulling.

       Keep in mind that network access may  now  be  required  to  update  to
       changesets  that  you have not previously updated to. The nature of the
       largefiles extension means that updating is no longer guaranteed to  be
       a local-only operation.

       If you already have large files tracked by Mercurial without the large‐
       files extension, you will need to convert your repository in  order  to
       benefit from largefiles. This is done with the hg lfconvert command:

       $ hg lfconvert --size 10 oldrepo newrepo

       In repositories that already have largefiles in them, any new file over
       10MB will automatically be added as a largefile. To change this thresh‐
       old,  set largefiles.minsize in your Mercurial config file to the mini‐
       mum size in megabytes to track as a  largefile,  or  use  the  --lfsize
       option to the add command (also in megabytes):

       [largefiles]
       minsize = 2

       $ hg add --lfsize 2

       The  largefiles.patterns  config option allows you to specify a list of
       filename patterns (see hg help patterns) that should always be  tracked
       as largefiles:

       [largefiles]
       patterns =
         *.jpg
         re:.*\.(png|bmp)$
         library.zip
         content/audio/*

       Files  that  match  one  of  these patterns will be added as largefiles
       regardless of their size.

       The largefiles.minsize and largefiles.patterns config options  will  be
       ignored for any repositories not already containing a largefile. To add
       the first largefile to a repository, you must explicitly do so with the
       --large flag passed to the hg add command.

   Commands
   lfconvert
       convert a normal repository to a largefiles repository:

       hg lfconvert SOURCE DEST [FILE ...]

       Convert repository SOURCE to a new repository DEST, identical to SOURCE
       except that certain files will be  converted  as  largefiles:  specifi‐
       cally,  any  file  that  matches any PATTERN or whose size is above the
       minimum size threshold is converted as a largefile. The  size  used  to
       determine  whether or not to track a file as a largefile is the size of
       the first version of the file. The minimum size can be specified either
       with --size or in configuration as largefiles.size.

       After  running  this command you will need to make sure that largefiles
       is enabled anywhere you intend to push the new repository.

       Use --to-normal to convert largefiles back to normal files; after this,
       the DEST repository can be used without largefiles at all.

       Options:

       -s,--size <SIZE>
              minimum size (MB) for files to be converted as largefiles

       --to-normal
              convert from a largefiles repo to a normal repo

   lfpull
       pull largefiles for the specified revisions from the specified source:

       hg lfpull -r REV... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]

       Pull  largefiles  that are referenced from local changesets but missing
       locally, pulling from a remote repository to the local cache.

       If SOURCE is omitted, the 'default' path will be  used.   See  hg  help
       urls for more information.

       Some examples:

       · pull largefiles for all branch heads:

         hg lfpull -r "head() and not closed()"

       · pull largefiles on the default branch:

         hg lfpull -r "branch(default)"

       Options:

       -r,--rev <VALUE[+]>
              pull largefiles for these revisions

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   lfs
       lfs - large file support (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This  extension  allows large files to be tracked outside of the normal
       repository storage and stored on a centralized server, similar  to  the
       largefiles  extension.  The git-lfs protocol is used when communicating
       with the server, so existing git infrastructure can be harnessed.  Even
       though  the  files are stored outside of the repository, they are still
       integrity checked in the same manner as normal files.

       The files stored outside of the repository are  downloaded  on  demand,
       which  reduces  the  time  to clone, and possibly the local disk usage.
       This changes fundamental workflows in a DVCS, so careful thought should
       be  given  before  deploying it.  hg convert can be used to convert LFS
       repositories to normal repositories that no longer require this  exten‐
       sion,  and  do  so without changing the commit hashes.  This allows the
       extension to be disabled if the centralized  workflow  becomes  burden‐
       some.   However,  the  pre  and post convert clones will not be able to
       communicate with each other unless the extension is enabled on both.

       To start a new repository, or to add LFS files to an existing one, just
       create  an  .hglfs file as described below in the root directory of the
       repository.  Typically, this file should be put under version  control,
       so that the settings will propagate to other repositories with push and
       pull.  During any commit, Mercurial will consult this file to determine
       if  an added or modified file should be stored externally.  The type of
       storage depends on the characteristics of the file at each  commit.   A
       file  that  is  near a size threshold may switch back and forth between
       LFS and normal storage, as needed.

       Alternately, both normal repositories and largefile controlled  reposi‐
       tories  can  be  converted to LFS by using hg convert and the lfs.track
       config option described below.  The .hglfs file should then be  created
       and  added,  to  control subsequent LFS selection.  The hashes are also
       unchanged in this case.  The LFS and non-LFS repositories can  be  dis‐
       tinguished  because  the  LFS repository will abort any command if this
       extension is disabled.

       Committed LFS files are held locally, until the repository  is  pushed.
       Prior  to  pushing  the  normal repository data, the LFS files that are
       tracked by the outgoing commits are automatically uploaded to the  con‐
       figured  central server.  No LFS files are transferred on hg pull or hg
       clone.  Instead, the files are downloaded on demand as they need to  be
       read,  if  a  cached copy cannot be found locally.  Both committing and
       downloading an LFS file will link the file to a usercache, to speed  up
       future access.  See the usercache config setting described below.

       The extension reads its configuration from a versioned ``.hglfs``
       configuration file found in the root of the working directory. The
       ``.hglfs`` file uses the same syntax as all other Mercurial
       configuration files. It uses a single section, ``[track]``.

       The ``[track]`` section specifies which files are stored as LFS (or
       not). Each line is keyed by a file pattern, with a predicate value.
       The first file pattern match is used, so put more specific patterns
       first.  The available predicates are ``all()``, ``none()``, and
       ``size()``. See "hg help filesets.size" for the latter.

       Example versioned ``.hglfs`` file::

         [track]
         # No Makefile or python file, anywhere, will be LFS
         **Makefile = none()
         **.py = none()

         **.zip = all()
         **.exe = size(">1MB")

         # Catchall for everything not matched above
         ** = size(">10MB")

       Configs:

       [lfs]
       # Remote endpoint. Multiple protocols are supported:
       # - http(s)://user:pass@example.com/path
       #   git-lfs endpoint
       # - file:///tmp/path
       #   local filesystem, usually for testing
       # if unset, lfs will assume the remote repository also handles blob storage
       # for http(s) URLs.  Otherwise, lfs will prompt to set this when it must
       # use this value.
       # (default: unset)
       url = https://example.com/repo.git/info/lfs

       # Which files to track in LFS.  Path tests are "**.extname" for file
       # extensions, and "path:under/some/directory" for path prefix.  Both
       # are relative to the repository root.
       # File size can be tested with the "size()" fileset, and tests can be
       # joined with fileset operators.  (See "hg help filesets.operators".)
       #
       # Some examples:
       # - all()                       # everything
       # - none()                      # nothing
       # - size(">20MB")               # larger than 20MB
       # - !**.txt                     # anything not a *.txt file
       # - **.zip | **.tar.gz | **.7z  # some types of compressed files
       # - path:bin                    # files under "bin" in the project root
       # - (**.php & size(">2MB")) | (**.js & size(">5MB")) | **.tar.gz
       #     | (path:bin & !path:/bin/README) | size(">1GB")
       # (default: none())
       #
       # This is ignored if there is a tracked '.hglfs' file, and this setting
       # will eventually be deprecated and removed.
       track = size(">10M")

       # how many times to retry before giving up on transferring an object
       retry = 5

       # the local directory to store lfs files for sharing across local clones.
       # If not set, the cache is located in an OS specific cache location.
       usercache = /path/to/global/cache

   Commands
   logtoprocess
       send ui.log() data to a subprocess (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This  extension  lets  you  specify a shell command per ui.log() event,
       sending all remaining arguments to as  environment  variables  to  that
       command.

       Each  positional  argument to the method results in a MSG[N] key in the
       environment, starting at 1 (so MSG1, MSG2, etc.). Each keyword argument
       is  set  as a OPT_UPPERCASE_KEY variable (so the key is uppercased, and
       prefixed with OPT_). The original event name is  passed  in  the  EVENT
       environment  variable,  and  the  process  ID  of mercurial is given in
       HGPID.

       So given a call ui.log('foo', 'bar', 'baz', spam='eggs'), a script con‐
       figured  for  the  `foo  event can expect an environment with MSG1=bar,
       MSG2=baz, and OPT_SPAM=eggs.

       Scripts are configured in the [logtoprocess] section, each key an event
       name.  For example:

       [logtoprocess]
       commandexception = echo "$MSG2$MSG3" > /var/log/mercurial_exceptions.log

       would  log the warning message and traceback of any failed command dis‐
       patch.

       Scripts are run asynchronously as detached daemon processes;  mercurial
       will not ensure that they exit cleanly.

   mq
       manage a stack of patches

       This  extension  lets  you  work with a stack of patches in a Mercurial
       repository. It manages two stacks of patches - all known  patches,  and
       applied patches (subset of known patches).

       Known  patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches direc‐
       tory. Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.

       Common tasks (use hg help COMMAND for more details):

       create new patch                          qnew
       import existing patch                     qimport

       print patch series                        qseries
       print applied patches                     qapplied

       add known patch to applied stack          qpush
       remove patch from applied stack           qpop
       refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh

       By default, mq will automatically use  git  patches  when  required  to
       avoid  losing  file  mode  changes, copy records, binary files or empty
       files creations or deletions. This behavior can be configured with:

       [mq]
       git = auto/keep/yes/no

       If set to 'keep', mq will obey the [diff] section  configuration  while
       preserving existing git patches upon qrefresh. If set to 'yes' or 'no',
       mq will override the [diff] section and always generate git or  regular
       patches, possibly losing data in the second case.

       It  may  be  desirable for mq changesets to be kept in the secret phase
       (see hg help phases), which can be enabled with the following setting:

       [mq]
       secret = True

       You will by default be managing a patch queue named "patches". You  can
       create other, independent patch queues with the hg qqueue command.

       If  the  working  directory contains uncommitted files, qpush, qpop and
       qgoto abort immediately. If -f/--force is used, the  changes  are  dis‐
       carded. Setting:

       [mq]
       keepchanges = True

       make  them behave as if --keep-changes were passed, and non-conflicting
       local changes will be tolerated and preserved. If incompatible  options
       such as -f/--force or --exact are passed, this setting is ignored.

       This  extension used to provide a strip command. This command now lives
       in the strip extension.

   Commands
   qapplied
       print the patches already applied:

       hg qapplied [-1] [-s] [PATCH]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -1, --last
              show only the preceding applied patch

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qclone
       clone main and patch repository at same time:

       hg qclone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

       If source is local, destination will have no patches applied. If source
       is remote, this command can not check if patches are applied in source,
       so cannot guarantee that patches are not applied in destination. If you
       clone remote repository, be sure before that it has no patches applied.

       Source  patch repository is looked for in <src>/.hg/patches by default.
       Use -p <url> to change.

       The patch directory must be a nested Mercurial repository, as would  be
       created by hg init --mq.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       --pull use pull protocol to copy metadata

       -U, --noupdate
              do not update the new working directories

       --uncompressed
              use uncompressed transfer (fast over LAN)

       -p,--patches <REPO>
              location of source patch repository

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

   qcommit
       commit changes in the queue repository (DEPRECATED):

       hg qcommit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       This command is deprecated; use hg commit --mq instead.

       Options:

       -A, --addremove
              mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing

       --close-branch

              record the specified user as committer

       -S, --subrepos
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: qci

   qdelete
       remove patches from queue:

       hg qdelete [-k] [PATCH]...

       The  patches  must  not be applied, and at least one patch is required.
       Exact patch identifiers must be given. With -k/--keep, the patch  files
       are preserved in the patch directory.

       To stop managing a patch and move it into permanent history, use the hg
       qfinish command.

       Options:

       -k, --keep
              keep patch file

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              stop managing a revision (DEPRECATED)

          aliases: qremove qrm

   qdiff
       diff of the current patch and subsequent modifications:

       hg qdiff [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Shows a diff which includes the current patch as well  as  any  changes
       which  have  been  made in the working directory since the last refresh
       (thus showing what the current patch would become after a qrefresh).

       Use hg diff if you only want to see the changes  made  since  the  last
       qrefresh, or hg export qtip if you want to see changes made by the cur‐
       rent patch without including changes made since the qrefresh.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       --binary
              generate binary diffs in git mode (default)

       --nodates
              omit dates from diff headers

       --noprefix
              omit a/ and b/ prefixes from filenames

       -p, --show-function
              show which function each change is in

       --reverse

       -Z, --ignore-space-at-eol
              ignore changes in whitespace at EOL

       -U,--unified <NUM>
              number of lines of context to show

       --stat output diffstat-style summary of changes

       --root <DIR>
              produce diffs relative to subdirectory

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   qfinish
       move applied patches into repository history:

       hg qfinish [-a] [REV]...

       Finishes the specified revisions (corresponding to applied patches)  by
       moving them out of mq control into regular repository history.

       Accepts  a  revision  range or the -a/--applied option. If --applied is
       specified, all applied mq revisions are removed from mq control. Other‐
       wise,  the  given revisions must be at the base of the stack of applied
       patches.

       This can be especially useful if your changes have been applied  to  an
       upstream  repository,  or  if  you  are  about  to push your changes to
       upstream.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -a, --applied
              finish all applied changesets

   qfold
       fold the named patches into the current patch:

       hg qfold [-e] [-k] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] PATCH...

       Patches must not yet  be  applied.  Each  patch  will  be  successively
       applied  to  the  current  patch in the order given. If all the patches
       apply successfully, the current patch will be refreshed  with  the  new
       cumulative  patch,  and  the  folded  patches  will  be  deleted.  With
       -k/--keep, the folded patch files will not be removed afterwards.

       The header for each folded patch will be concatenated with the  current
       patch header, separated by a line of * * *.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -k, --keep
              keep folded patch files

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -l,--logfile <FILE>
              read commit message from file

   qgoto
       push or pop patches until named patch is at top of stack:

       hg qgoto [OPTION]... PATCH

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       --keep-changes
              tolerate non-conflicting local changes

       -f, --force
              overwrite any local changes

       --no-backup
              do not save backup copies of files

   qguard
       set or print guards for a patch:

       hg qguard [-l] [-n] [PATCH] [-- [+GUARD]... [-GUARD]...]

       Guards control whether a patch can be pushed. A patch with no guards is
       always pushed. A patch with a positive guard ("+foo") is pushed only if
       the  hg qselect command has activated it. A patch with a negative guard
       ("-foo") is never pushed if the hg qselect command has activated it.

       With no arguments, print the currently active guards.  With  arguments,
       set guards for the named patch.

       Note   Specifying negative guards now requires '--'.

       To set guards on another patch:

       hg qguard other.patch -- +2.6.17 -stable

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -l, --list
              list all patches and guards

       -n, --none
              drop all guards

   qheader
       print the header of the topmost or specified patch:

       hg qheader [PATCH]

       Returns 0 on success.

   qimport
       import a patch or existing changeset:

       hg qimport [-e] [-n NAME] [-f] [-g] [-P] [-r REV]... [FILE]...

       The  patch is inserted into the series after the last applied patch. If
       no patches have been applied, qimport prepends the patch to the series.

       The patch will have the same name as its source file unless you give it
       a new one with -n/--name.

       You  can register an existing patch inside the patch directory with the
       -e/--existing flag.

       With -f/--force, an existing patch of the same name will  be  overwrit‐
       ten.

       An  existing  changeset  may  be  placed under mq control with -r/--rev
       (e.g. qimport --rev . -n patch will place the current revision under mq
       control).  With  -g/--git, patches imported with --rev will use the git
       diff format. See the diffs help topic for information on  why  this  is
       important   for   preserving  rename/copy  information  and  permission
       changes. Use hg qfinish to remove changesets from mq control.

       To import a patch from standard input, pass - as the patch file.   When
       importing from standard input, a patch name must be specified using the
       --name flag.

       To import an existing patch while renaming it:

       hg qimport -e existing-patch -n new-name

       Returns 0 if import succeeded.

       Options:

       -e, --existing
              import file in patch directory

       -n,--name <NAME>
              name of patch file

       -f, --force
              overwrite existing files

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              place existing revisions under mq control

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       -P, --push
              qpush after importing

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   qinit
       init a new queue repository (DEPRECATED):

       hg qinit [-c]

       The queue repository is unversioned by default. If -c/--create-repo  is
       specified,  qinit  will create a separate nested repository for patches
       (qinit -c may also be run later to convert an unversioned patch reposi‐
       tory  into  a  versioned one). You can use qcommit to commit changes to
       this queue repository.

       This command is deprecated. Without -c, it's implied by other  relevant
       commands. With -c, use hg init --mq instead.

       Options:

       -c, --create-repo
              create queue repository

   qnew
       create a new patch:

       hg qnew [-e] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] PATCH [FILE]...

       qnew  creates  a  new  patch  on top of the currently-applied patch (if
       any). The patch will be initialized with any outstanding changes in the
       working  directory. You may also use -I/--include, -X/--exclude, and/or
       a list of files after the patch name to add only  changes  to  matching
       files to the new patch, leaving the rest as uncommitted modifications.

       -u/--user  and  -d/--date can be used to set the (given) user and date,
       respectively. -U/--currentuser and -D/--currentdate set user to current
       user and date to current date.

       -e/--edit, -m/--message or -l/--logfile set the patch header as well as
       the commit message. If none is specified, the header is empty  and  the
       commit message is '[mq]: PATCH'.

       Use the -g/--git option to keep the patch in the git extended diff for‐
       mat. Read the diffs help topic for more  information  on  why  this  is
       important  for  preserving  permission changes and copy/rename informa‐
       tion.

       Returns 0 on successful creation of a new patch.

       Options:

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -f, --force
              import uncommitted changes (DEPRECATED)

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       -U, --currentuser
              add "From: <current user>" to patch

       -u,--user <USER>
              add "From: <USER>" to patch

       -D, --currentdate
              add "Date: <current date>" to patch

       -d,--date <DATE>
              add "Date: <DATE>" to patch

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -l,--logfile <FILE>
              read commit message from file

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   qnext
       print the name of the next pushable patch:

       hg qnext [-s]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qpop
       pop the current patch off the stack:

       hg qpop [-a] [-f] [PATCH | INDEX]

       Without argument, pops off the top of the patch stack. If given a patch
       name,  keeps popping off patches until the named patch is at the top of
       the stack.

       By  default,  abort  if  the  working  directory  contains  uncommitted
       changes. With --keep-changes, abort only if the uncommitted files over‐
       lap with patched files. With -f/--force,  backup  and  discard  changes
       made to such files.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       -a, --all
              pop all patches

       -n,--name <NAME>
              queue name to pop (DEPRECATED)

       --keep-changes
              tolerate non-conflicting local changes

       -f, --force
              forget any local changes to patched files

       --no-backup
              do not save backup copies of files

   qprev
       print the name of the preceding applied patch:

       hg qprev [-s]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qpush
       push the next patch onto the stack:

       hg qpush [-f] [-l] [-a] [--move] [PATCH | INDEX]

       By  default,  abort  if  the  working  directory  contains  uncommitted
       changes. With --keep-changes, abort only if the uncommitted files over‐
       lap  with  patched files. With -f/--force, backup and patch over uncom‐
       mitted changes.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       --keep-changes
              tolerate non-conflicting local changes

       -f, --force
              apply on top of local changes

       -e, --exact
              apply the target patch to its recorded parent

       -l, --list
              list patch name in commit text

       -a, --all
              apply all patches

       -m, --merge
              merge from another queue (DEPRECATED)

       -n,--name <NAME>
              merge queue name (DEPRECATED)

       --move reorder patch series and apply only the patch

       --no-backup
              do not save backup copies of files

   qqueue
       manage multiple patch queues:

       hg qqueue [OPTION] [QUEUE]

       Supports switching between different patch queues, as well as  creating
       new patch queues and deleting existing ones.

       Omitting  a queue name or specifying -l/--list will show you the regis‐
       tered queues - by default the "normal" patches queue is registered. The
       currently  active  queue  will  be  marked  with "(active)". Specifying
       --active will print only the name of the active queue.

       To create a new queue, use -c/--create. The queue is automatically made
       active,  except  in  the  case where there are applied patches from the
       currently active queue in the repository. Then the queue will  only  be
       created and switching will fail.

       To  delete  an existing queue, use --delete. You cannot delete the cur‐
       rently active queue.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -l, --list
              list all available queues

       --active
              print name of active queue

       -c, --create
              create new queue

       --rename
              rename active queue

       --delete
              delete reference to queue

       --purge
              delete queue, and remove patch dir

   qrefresh
       update the current patch:

       hg qrefresh [-I] [-X] [-e] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] [-s] [FILE]...

       If any file patterns are provided, the  refreshed  patch  will  contain
       only the modifications that match those patterns; the remaining modifi‐
       cations will remain in the working directory.

       If -s/--short is specified, files currently included in the patch  will
       be refreshed just like matched files and remain in the patch.

       If  -e/--edit is specified, Mercurial will start your configured editor
       for you to enter a message. In case qrefresh fails,  you  will  find  a
       backup of your message in .hg/last-message.txt.

       hg  add/remove/copy/rename  work as usual, though you might want to use
       git-style patches (-g/--git  or  [diff]  git=1)  to  track  copies  and
       renames.  See the diffs help topic for more information on the git diff
       format.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -g, --git
              use git extended diff format

       -s, --short
              refresh only files already in the patch and specified files

       -U, --currentuser
              add/update author field in patch with current user

       -u,--user <USER>
              add/update author field in patch with given user

       -D, --currentdate
              add/update date field in patch with current date

       -d,--date <DATE>
              add/update date field in patch with given date

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -l,--logfile <FILE>
              read commit message from file

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   qrename
       rename a patch:

       hg qrename PATCH1 [PATCH2]

       With one argument, renames the current patch to PATCH1.  With two argu‐
       ments, renames PATCH1 to PATCH2.

       Returns 0 on success.

          aliases: qmv

   qrestore
       restore the queue state saved by a revision (DEPRECATED):

       hg qrestore [-d] [-u] REV

       This command is deprecated, use hg rebase instead.

       Options:

       -d, --delete
              delete save entry

       -u, --update
              update queue working directory

   qsave
       save current queue state (DEPRECATED):

       hg qsave [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] [-c] [-n NAME] [-e] [-f]

       This command is deprecated, use hg rebase instead.

       Options:

       -c, --copy
              copy patch directory

       -n,--name <NAME>
              copy directory name

       -e, --empty
              clear queue status file

       -f, --force
              force copy

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as commit message

       -l,--logfile <FILE>
              read commit message from file

   qselect
       set or print guarded patches to push:

       hg qselect [OPTION]... [GUARD]...

       Use  the  hg  qguard command  to set or print guards on patch, then use
       qselect to tell mq which guards to use. A patch will be  pushed  if  it
       has  no  guards  or  any  positive  guards match the currently selected
       guard, but will not be pushed if any negative guards match the  current
       guard. For example:

       qguard foo.patch -- -stable    (negative guard)
       qguard bar.patch    +stable    (positive guard)
       qselect stable

       This  activates  the "stable" guard. mq will skip foo.patch (because it
       has a negative match) but push bar.patch (because  it  has  a  positive
       match).

       With  no arguments, prints the currently active guards.  With one argu‐
       ment, sets the active guard.

       Use -n/--none to deactivate guards (no other arguments  needed).   When
       no  guards  are  active,  patches  with positive guards are skipped and
       patches with negative guards are pushed.

       qselect can change the guards on  applied  patches.  It  does  not  pop
       guarded  patches  by default. Use --pop to pop back to the last applied
       patch that is not guarded. Use --reapply (which implies --pop) to  push
       back to the current patch afterwards, but skip guarded patches.

       Use  -s/--series  to  print a list of all guards in the series file (no
       other arguments needed). Use -v for more information.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -n, --none
              disable all guards

       -s, --series
              list all guards in series file

       --pop  pop to before first guarded applied patch

       --reapply
              pop, then reapply patches

   qseries
       print the entire series file:

       hg qseries [-ms]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -m, --missing
              print patches not in series

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qtop
       print the name of the current patch:

       hg qtop [-s]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   qunapplied
       print the patches not yet applied:

       hg qunapplied [-1] [-s] [PATCH]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       -1, --first
              show only the first patch

       -s, --summary
              print first line of patch header

   narrow
       create clones which fetch history data for subset of files  (EXPERIMEN‐
       TAL)

   Commands
   tracked
       show or change the current narrowspec:

       hg tracked [OPTIONS]... [REMOTE]

       With  no  argument, shows the current narrowspec entries, one per line.
       Each line will be prefixed with 'I' or 'X'  for  included  or  excluded
       patterns, respectively.

       The narrowspec is comprised of expressions to match remote files and/or
       directories that should be pulled into your client.  The narrowspec has
       include   and   exclude  expressions,  with  excludes  always  trumping
       includes: that is, if a file matches an exclude expression, it will  be
       excluded  even  if  it  also  matches an include expression.  Excluding
       files that were never included has no effect.

       Each included or excluded entry is in the format described by 'hg  help
       patterns'.

       The  options  allow  you to add or remove included and excluded expres‐
       sions.

       If --clear is specified, then all previous includes  and  excludes  are
       DROPPED  and  replaced  by  the  new ones specified to --addinclude and
       --addexclude.  If --clear is specified without any further options, the
       narrowspec will be empty and will not match any files.

       Options:

       --addinclude <VALUE[+]>
              new paths to include

       --removeinclude <VALUE[+]>
              old paths to no longer include

       --addexclude <VALUE[+]>
              new paths to exclude

       --import-rules <VALUE>
              import narrowspecs from a file

       --removeexclude <VALUE[+]>
              old paths to no longer exclude

       --clear
              whether to replace the existing narrowspec

       --force-delete-local-changes
              forces deletion of local changes when narrowing

       -e,--ssh <CMD>
              specify ssh command to use

       --remotecmd <CMD>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       --insecure
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   notify
       hooks for sending email push notifications

       This  extension  implements  hooks  to  send  email  notifications when
       changesets are sent from or received by the local repository.

       First, enable the extension as explained in  hg  help  extensions,  and
       register  the  hook you want to run. incoming and changegroup hooks are
       run when changesets are received, while outgoing hooks are for  change‐
       sets sent to another repository:

       [hooks]
       # one email for each incoming changeset
       incoming.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
       # one email for all incoming changesets
       changegroup.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

       # one email for all outgoing changesets
       outgoing.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

       This  registers  the hooks. To enable notification, subscribers must be
       assigned to repositories. The [usersubs] section maps multiple  reposi‐
       tories  to  a  given  recipient.  The  [reposubs] section maps multiple
       recipients to a single repository:

       [usersubs]
       # key is subscriber email, value is a comma-separated list of repo patterns
       user@host = pattern

       [reposubs]
       # key is repo pattern, value is a comma-separated list of subscriber emails
       pattern = user@host

       A pattern is a glob matching the absolute path to a repository, option‐
       ally  combined  with  a  revset  expression.  A  revset  expression, if
       present, is separated from the glob by a hash. Example:

       [reposubs]
       */widgets#branch(release) = qa-team@example.com

       This sends to qa-team@example.com whenever a changeset on  the  release
       branch triggers a notification in any repository ending in widgets.

       In  order  to  place  them under direct user management, [usersubs] and
       [reposubs] sections may be placed in a separate hgrc file and  incorpo‐
       rated by reference:

       [notify]
       config = /path/to/subscriptionsfile

       Notifications  will  not  be sent until the notify.test value is set to
       False; see below.

       Notifications content can be tweaked with the  following  configuration
       entries:

       notify.test
              If  True,  print  messages  to  stdout  instead of sending them.
              Default: True.

       notify.sources
              Space-separated list of change sources. Notifications are  acti‐
              vated  only  when  a changeset's source is in this list. Sources
              may be:

              serve

                     changesets received via http or ssh

              pull

                     changesets received via hg pull

              unbundle

                     changesets received via hg unbundle

              push

                     changesets sent or received via hg push

              bundle

                     changesets sent via hg unbundle

              Default: serve.

       notify.strip
              Number of leading slashes to strip from url paths.  By  default,
              notifications  reference  repositories with their absolute path.
              notify.strip lets you turn them into relative paths.  For  exam‐
              ple,   notify.strip=3  will  change  /long/path/repository  into
              repository. Default: 0.

       notify.domain
              Default email domain for sender or recipients with  no  explicit
              domain.

       notify.style
              Style file to use when formatting emails.

       notify.template
              Template to use when formatting emails.

       notify.incoming
              Template  to  use  when  run  as  an  incoming  hook, overriding
              notify.template.

       notify.outgoing
              Template to  use  when  run  as  an  outgoing  hook,  overriding
              notify.template.

       notify.changegroup
              Template  to  use when running as a changegroup hook, overriding
              notify.template.

       notify.maxdiff
              Maximum number of diff lines to include in  notification  email.
              Set  to  0  to  disable  the  diff,  or -1 to include all of it.
              Default: 300.

       notify.maxdiffstat
              Maximum number of diffstat  lines  to  include  in  notification
              email. Set to -1 to include all of it. Default: -1.

       notify.maxsubject
              Maximum  number  of characters in email's subject line. Default:
              67.

       notify.diffstat
              Set to True to include a diffstat before diff content.  Default:
              True.

       notify.showfunc
              If  set,  override  diff.showfunc for the diff content. Default:
              None.

       notify.merge
              If True, send notifications for merge changesets. Default: True.

       notify.mbox
              If set, append mails to  this  mbox  file  instead  of  sending.
              Default: None.

       notify.fromauthor
              If  set,  use  the committer of the first changeset in a change‐
              group for the "From" field of the notification mail. If not set,
              take the user from the pushing repo.  Default: False.

       If  set, the following entries will also be used to customize the noti‐
       fications:

       email.from
              Email From address to use if none can be found in the  generated
              email content.

       web.baseurl
              Root repository URL to combine with repository paths when making
              references. See also notify.strip.

   pager
       browse command output with an external pager (DEPRECATED)

       Forcibly enable paging for individual  commands  that  don't  typically
       request pagination with the attend-<command> option. This setting takes
       precedence over ignore options and defaults:

       [pager]
       attend-cat = false

   patchbomb
       command to send changesets as (a series of) patch emails

       The series is started off with a "[PATCH 0 of N]"  introduction,  which
       describes the series as a whole.

       Each  patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using the
       first line of the changeset description as the subject text.  The  mes‐
       sage contains two or three body parts:

       · The changeset description.

       · [Optional] The result of running diffstat on the patch.

       · The patch itself, as generated by hg export.

       Each  message  refers  to the first in the series using the In-Reply-To
       and References headers, so they will show up as a sequence in  threaded
       mail and news readers, and in mail archives.

       To configure other defaults, add a section like this to your configura‐
       tion file:

       [email]
       from = My Name <my@email>
       to = recipient1, recipient2, ...
       cc = cc1, cc2, ...
       bcc = bcc1, bcc2, ...
       reply-to = address1, address2, ...

       Use [patchbomb] as configuration section name if you need  to  override
       global [email] address settings.

       Then you can use the hg email command to mail a series of changesets as
       a patchbomb.

       You can also either configure the method option in the email section to
       be  a sendmail compatible mailer or fill out the [smtp] section so that
       the patchbomb extension can automatically send patchbombs directly from
       the  commandline.  See  the  [email] and [smtp] sections in hgrc(5) for
       details.

       By default, hg email will prompt for a To or CC header if  you  do  not
       supply  one  via  configuration  or the command line.  You can override
       this to never prompt by configuring an empty value:

       [email]
       cc =

       You can control the default inclusion of an introduction  message  with
       the  patchbomb.intro  configuration option. The configuration is always
       overwritten by command line flags like --intro and --desc:

       [patchbomb]
       intro=auto   # include introduction message if more than 1 patch (default)
       intro=never  # never include an introduction message
       intro=always # always include an introduction message

       You can specify a template for flags to be added in  subject  prefixes.
       Flags specified by --flag option are exported as {flags} keyword:

       [patchbomb]
       flagtemplate = "{separate(' ',
                                 ifeq(branch, 'default', '', branch|upper),
                                 flags)}"

       You  can set patchbomb to always ask for confirmation by setting patch‐
       bomb.confirm to true.

   Commands
   email
       send changesets by email:

       hg email [OPTION]... [DEST]...

       By default, diffs are sent in the format generated by  hg  export,  one
       per  message.  The  series starts with a "[PATCH 0 of N]" introduction,
       which describes the series as a whole.

       Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using  the
       first  line of the changeset description as the subject text.  The mes‐
       sage contains two or three parts. First, the changeset description.

       With the -d/--diffstat option, if the diffstat  program  is  installed,
       the result of running diffstat on the patch is inserted.

       Finally, the patch itself, as generated by hg export.

       With the -d/--diffstat or --confirm options, you will be presented with
       a final summary of all messages and asked for confirmation  before  the
       messages are sent.

       By  default  the  patch  is included as text in the email body for easy
       reviewing. Using the -a/--attach option will instead create an  attach‐
       ment  for the patch. With -i/--inline an inline attachment will be cre‐
       ated. You can include a patch both as text in the email body and  as  a
       regular  or  an  inline  attachment  by  combining  the  -a/--attach or
       -i/--inline with the --body option.

       With -B/--bookmark changesets  reachable  by  the  given  bookmark  are
       selected.

       With  -o/--outgoing,  emails will be generated for patches not found in
       the destination repository (or only those which are  ancestors  of  the
       specified revisions if any are provided)

       With -b/--bundle, changesets are selected as for --outgoing, but a sin‐
       gle email containing a binary Mercurial bundle as an attachment will be
       sent.  Use the patchbomb.bundletype config option to control the bundle
       type as with hg bundle --type.

       With -m/--mbox, instead of previewing each patchbomb message in a pager
       or  sending  the  messages directly, it will create a UNIX mailbox file
       with the patch emails. This mailbox file can be previewed with any mail
       user agent which supports UNIX mbox files.

       With  -n/--test,  all  steps  will run, but mail will not be sent.  You
       will be prompted for an email  recipient  address,  a  subject  and  an
       introductory  message  describing  the patches of your patchbomb.  Then
       when all is done, patchbomb messages are displayed.

       In case email sending fails, you will find  a  backup  of  your  series
       introductory message in .hg/last-email.txt.

       The default behavior of this command can be customized through configu‐
       ration. (See hg help patchbomb for details)

       Examples:

       hg email -r 3000          # send patch 3000 only
       hg email -r 3000 -r 3001  # send patches 3000 and 3001
       hg email -r 3000:3005     # send patches 3000 through 3005
       hg email 3000             # send patch 3000 (deprecated)

       hg email -o               # send all patches not in default
       hg email -o DEST          # send all patches not in DEST
       hg email -o -r 3000       # send all ancestors of 3000 not in default
       hg email -o -r 3000 DEST  # send all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

       hg email -B feature       # send all ancestors of feature bookmark

       hg email -b               # send bundle of all patches not in default
       hg email -b DEST          # send bundle of all patches not in DEST
       hg email -b -r 3000       # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in default
       hg email -b -r 3000 DEST  # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

       hg email -o -m mbox &&    # generate an mbox file...
         mutt -R -f mbox         # ... and view it with mutt
       hg email -o -m mbox &&    # generate an mbox file ...
         formail -s sendmail \   # ... and use formail to send from the mbox
           -bm -t < mbox         # ... using sendmail

       Before using this command, you will need to enable email in your  hgrc.
       See the [email] section in hgrc(5) for details.

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   phabricator
       simple Phabricator integration (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension provides a phabsend  command  which  sends  a  stack  of
       changesets  to Phabricator, and a phabread command which prints a stack
       of revisions in a format suitable for hg import, and a phabupdate  com‐
       mand to update statuses in batch.

       By  default,  Phabricator  requires  Test Plan which might prevent some
       changeset from being sent. The requirement could be disabled by  chang‐
       ing differential.require-test-plan-field config server side.

       Config:

       [phabricator]
       # Phabricator URL
       url = https://phab.example.com/

       # Repo callsign. If a repo has a URL https://$HOST/diffusion/FOO, then its
       # callsign is "FOO".
       callsign = FOO

       # curl command to use. If not set (default), use builtin HTTP library to
       # communicate. If set, use the specified curl command. This could be useful
       # if you need to specify advanced options that is not easily supported by
       # the internal library.
       curlcmd = curl --connect-timeout 2 --retry 3 --silent

       [auth]
       example.schemes = https
       example.prefix = phab.example.com

       # API token. Get it from https://$HOST/conduit/login/
       example.phabtoken = cli-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

   Commands
   phabread
       print patches from Phabricator suitable for importing:

       hg phabread DREVSPEC [OPTIONS]

       DREVSPEC  could be a Differential Revision identity, like D123, or just
       the number 123. It could also have common operators like +, -, &, (,  )
       for complex queries. Prefix : could be used to select a stack.

       abandoned,  accepted,  closed, needsreview, needsrevision could be used
       to filter patches by status. For performance reason, they  only  repre‐
       sent a subset of non-status selections and cannot be used alone.

       For example, :D6+8-(2+D4) selects a stack up to D6, plus D8 and exclude
       D2 and D4. :D9 & needsreview selects  "Needs  Review"  revisions  in  a
       stack up to D9.

       If  --stack  is  given,  follow  dependencies  information and read all
       patches.  It is equivalent to the : operator.

       Options:

       --stack
              read dependencies

       --test-vcr <VALUE>
              Path to a vcr file. If nonexistent, will record a new vcr  tran‐
              script,  otherwise  will mock all http requests using the speci‐
              fied vcr file. (ADVANCED)

   phabsend
       upload changesets to Phabricator:

       hg phabsend REV [OPTIONS]

       If there are multiple revisions specified, they will be send as a stack
       with  a  linear  dependencies relationship using the order specified by
       the revset.

       For the first time uploading changesets, local tags will be created  to
       maintain  the  association.  After  the first time, phabsend will check
       obsstore and tags information so it can figure out whether to update an
       existing Differential Revision, or create a new one.

       If --amend is set, update commit messages so they have the Differential
       Revision URL, remove related tags. This is  similar  to  what  arcanist
       will  do,  and is more desired in author-push workflows. Otherwise, use
       local tags to record the Differential Revision association.

       The --confirm option lets you confirm changesets before  sending  them.
       You  can  also  add  following  to  your  configuration file to make it
       default behaviour:

       [phabsend]
       confirm = true

       phabsend will check  obsstore  and  the  above  association  to  decide
       whether  to  update  an existing Differential Revision, or create a new
       one.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              revisions to send

       --amend
              update commit messages (default: True)

       --reviewer <VALUE[+]>
              specify reviewers

       --confirm
              ask for confirmation before sending

       --test-vcr <VALUE>
              Path to a vcr file. If nonexistent, will record a new vcr  tran‐
              script,  otherwise  will mock all http requests using the speci‐
              fied vcr file. (ADVANCED)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   phabupdate
       update Differential Revision in batch:

       hg phabupdate DREVSPEC [OPTIONS]

       DREVSPEC selects revisions. See hg help phabread for its usage.

       Options:

       --accept
              accept revisions

       --reject
              reject revisions

       --abandon
              abandon revisions

       --reclaim
              reclaim revisions

       -m,--comment <VALUE>
              comment on the last revision

       --test-vcr <VALUE>
              Path to a vcr file. If nonexistent, will record a new vcr  tran‐
              script,  otherwise  will mock all http requests using the speci‐
              fied vcr file. (ADVANCED)

   purge
       command to delete untracked files from the working directory

   Commands
   purge
       removes files not tracked by Mercurial:

       hg purge [OPTION]... [DIR]...

       Delete files not known to Mercurial. This is useful to test  local  and
       uncommitted changes in an otherwise-clean source tree.

       This means that purge will delete the following by default:

       · Unknown files: files marked with "?" by hg status

       · Empty  directories: in fact Mercurial ignores directories unless they
         contain files under source control management

       But it will leave untouched:

       · Modified and unmodified tracked files

       · Ignored files (unless --all is specified)

       · New files added to the repository (with hg add)

       The --files and --dirs options can be used to direct  purge  to  delete
       only files, only directories, or both. If neither option is given, both
       will be deleted.

       If directories are given on the  command  line,  only  files  in  these
       directories are considered.

       Be  careful with purge, as you could irreversibly delete some files you
       forgot to add to the repository. If you only want to print the list  of
       files that this program would delete, use the --print option.

       Options:

       -a, --abort-on-err
              abort if an error occurs

       --all  purge ignored files too

       --dirs purge empty directories

       --files
              purge files

       -p, --print
              print filenames instead of deleting them

       -0, --print0
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs (implies -p/--print)

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: clean

   rebase
       command to move sets of revisions to a different ancestor

       This  extension  lets  you  rebase  changesets in an existing Mercurial
       repository.

       For more information: https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RebaseExtension

   Commands
   rebase
       move changeset (and descendants) to a different branch:

       hg rebase [-s REV | -b REV] [-d REV] [OPTION]

       Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of  his‐
       tory  (the  source)  onto another (the destination). This can be useful
       for linearizing local changes relative to a master development tree.

       Published commits cannot be rebased (see hg help phases).  To copy com‐
       mits, see hg help graft.

       If  you  don't specify a destination changeset (-d/--dest), rebase will
       use the same logic as hg merge to pick a destination.  if  the  current
       branch  contains  exactly one other head, the other head is merged with
       by default.  Otherwise, an explicit revision with which to  merge  with
       must  be provided.  (destination changeset is not modified by rebasing,
       but new changesets are added as its descendants.)

       Here are the ways to select changesets:

          1. Explicitly select them using --rev.

          2. Use --source to select a root changeset and include  all  of  its
             descendants.

          3. Use  --base to select a changeset; rebase will find ancestors and
             their descendants which are not also ancestors  of  the  destina‐
             tion.

          4. If  you  do  not  specify any of --rev, source, or --base, rebase
             will use --base . as above.

       If --source or --rev is used, special names SRC and ALLSRC can be  used
       in --dest. Destination would be calculated per source revision with SRC
       substituted by that single source revision and  ALLSRC  substituted  by
       all source revisions.

       Rebase will destroy original changesets unless you use --keep.  It will
       also move your bookmarks (even if you do).

       Some changesets may be dropped if they do not contribute changes  (e.g.
       merges from the destination branch).

       Unlike  merge, rebase will do nothing if you are at the branch tip of a
       named branch with two heads. You will need to explicitly specify source
       and/or destination.

       If you need to use a tool to automate merge/conflict decisions, you can
       specify one with --tool, see hg help merge-tools.   As  a  caveat:  the
       tool  will  not be used to mediate when a file was deleted, there is no
       hook presently available for this.

       If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a conflict,  it  can  be
       continued  with --continue/-c, aborted with --abort/-a, or stopped with
       --stop.

       Examples:

       · move "local changes" (current commit back to branching point) to  the
         current branch tip after a pull:

         hg rebase

       · move a single changeset to the stable branch:

         hg rebase -r 5f493448 -d stable

       · splice a commit and all its descendants onto another part of history:

         hg rebase --source c0c3 --dest 4cf9

       · rebase  everything  on a branch marked by a bookmark onto the default
         branch:

         hg rebase --base myfeature --dest default

       · collapse a sequence of changes into a single commit:

         hg rebase --collapse -r 1520:1525 -d .

       · move a named branch while preserving its name:

         hg rebase -r "branch(featureX)" -d 1.3 --keepbranches

       · stabilize orphaned changesets so history looks linear:

         hg rebase -r 'orphan()-obsolete()' -d 'first(max((successors(max(roots(ALLSRC) & ::SRC)^)-obsolete())::) + max(::((roots(ALLSRC) & ::SRC)^)-obsolete()))'

       Configuration Options:

       You can make rebase require a destination if you set the following con‐
       fig option:

       [commands]
       rebase.requiredest = True

       By  default,  rebase  will close the transaction after each commit. For
       performance purposes, you can configure rebase to use a single transac‐
       tion  across the entire rebase. WARNING: This setting introduces a sig‐
       nificant risk of losing the work you've done in a rebase if the  rebase
       aborts unexpectedly:

       [rebase]
       singletransaction = True

       By default, rebase writes to the working copy, but you can configure it
       to run in-memory for for better performance, and to allow it to run  if
       the working copy is dirty:

       [rebase]
       experimental.inmemory = True

       Return Values:

       Returns  0  on  success, 1 if nothing to rebase or there are unresolved
       conflicts.

   record
       commands  to  interactively  select changes for commit/qrefresh (DEPRE‐
       CATED)

       The feature provided by this extension has been moved into core  Mercu‐
       rial as hg commit --interactive.

   Commands
   qrecord
       interactively record a new patch:

       hg qrecord [OPTION]... PATCH [FILE]...

       See hg help qnew & hg help record for more information and usage.

   record
       interactively select changes to commit:

       hg record [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       If  a  list of files is omitted, all changes reported by hg status will
       be candidates for recording.

       See hg help dates for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       If using the text interface (see hg help config), you will be  prompted
       for whether to record changes to each modified file, and for files with
       multiple changes, for each change to use. For each query, the following
       responses are possible:

       y - record this change
       n - skip this change
       e - edit this change manually

       s - skip remaining changes to this file
       f - record remaining changes to this file

       d - done, skip remaining changes and files
       a - record all changes to all remaining files
       q - quit, recording no changes

       ? - display help

       This command is not available when committing a merge.

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   releasenotes
       generate release notes from commit messages (EXPERIMENTAL)

       It  is  common to maintain files detailing changes in a project between
       releases. Maintaining these files can be difficult and time  consuming.
       The  hg  releasenotes command  provided  by  this  extension  makes the
       process simpler by automating it.

   Commands
   releasenotes
       parse release notes from commit messages into an output file:

       hg releasenotes [-r REV] [-c] FILE

       Given an output file and set of revisions, this command will parse com‐
       mit messages for release notes then add them to the output file.

       Release notes are defined in commit messages as ReStructuredText direc‐
       tives. These have the form:

       .. directive:: title

          content

       Each directive maps to an output section in a generated  release  notes
       file,  which  itself is ReStructuredText. For example, the .. feature::
       directive would map to a New Features section.

       Release note directives can  be  either  short-form  or  long-form.  In
       short-  form,  title  is  omitted and the release note is rendered as a
       bullet list. In long form, a sub-section with the title title is  added
       to the section.

       The  FILE  argument  controls the output file to write gathered release
       notes to. The format of the file is:

       Section 1
       =========

       ...

       Section 2
       =========

       ...

       Only sections with defined release notes are emitted.

       If a section only has short-form notes, it will consist of bullet list:

       Section
       =======

       * Release note 1
       * Release note 2

       If a section has long-form notes, sub-sections will be emitted:

       Section
       =======

       Note 1 Title
       ------------

       Description of the first long-form note.

       Note 2 Title
       ------------

       Description of the second long-form note.

       If the FILE argument points to an existing  file,  that  file  will  be
       parsed  for  release notes having the format that would be generated by
       this command. The notes from the  processed  commit  messages  will  be
       merged into this parsed set.

       During release notes merging:

       · Duplicate items are automatically ignored

       · Items  that are different are automatically ignored if the similarity
         is greater than a threshold.

       This means that the release notes file  can  be  updated  independently
       from this command and changes should not be lost when running this com‐
       mand on that file. A particular use case for this is to tweak the word‐
       ing  of  a  release  note  after it has been added to the release notes
       file.

       The -c/--check option checks the commit  message  for  invalid  admoni‐
       tions.

       The  -l/--list option, presents the user with a list of existing avail‐
       able admonitions along with their title. This also includes the  custom
       admonitions (if any).

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revisions to process for release notes

       -c, --check
              checks for validity of admonitions (if any)

       -l, --list
              list the available admonitions with their title

   relink
       recreates hardlinks between repository clones

   Commands
   relink
       recreate hardlinks between two repositories:

       hg relink [ORIGIN]

       When  repositories  are  cloned  locally,  their  data  files  will  be
       hardlinked so that they only use the space of a single repository.

       Unfortunately, subsequent  pulls  into  either  repository  will  break
       hardlinks  for  any  files  touched by the new changesets, even if both
       repositories end up pulling the same changes.

       Similarly, passing --rev to "hg clone" will fail to use any  hardlinks,
       falling back to a complete copy of the source repository.

       This  command lets you recreate those hardlinks and reclaim that wasted
       space.

       This repository will be relinked to share space with ORIGIN, which must
       be   on   the  same  local  disk.  If  ORIGIN  is  omitted,  looks  for
       "default-relink", then "default", in [paths].

       Do not attempt any read operations on this repository while the command
       is running. (Both repositories will be locked against writes.)

   remotenames
          showing remotebookmarks and remotebranches in UI (EXPERIMENTAL)

       By  default both remotebookmarks and remotebranches are turned on. Con‐
       fig knob to control the individually are as follows.

       Config options to tweak the default behaviour:

       remotenames.bookmarks
              Boolean value to enable or disable  showing  of  remotebookmarks
              (default: True)

       remotenames.branches
              Boolean  value  to  enable  or disable showing of remotebranches
              (default: True)

       remotenames.hoistedpeer
              Name of the peer whose remotebookmarks should  be  hoisted  into
              the top-level namespace (default: 'default')

   schemes
       extend schemes with shortcuts to repository swarms

       This  extension  allows you to specify shortcuts for parent URLs with a
       lot of repositories to act like a scheme, for example:

       [schemes]
       py = http://code.python.org/hg/

       After that you can use it like:

       hg clone py://trunk/

       Additionally there is support for some more complex schemas, for  exam‐
       ple used by Google Code:

       [schemes]
       gcode = http://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/

       The  syntax  is  taken from Mercurial templates, and you have unlimited
       number of variables, starting with {1} and continuing with {2}, {3} and
       so  on.  This variables will receive parts of URL supplied, split by /.
       Anything not specified as {part} will be just appended to an URL.

       For convenience, the extension adds these schemes by default:

       [schemes]
       py = http://hg.python.org/
       bb = https://bitbucket.org/
       bb+ssh = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/
       gcode = https://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
       kiln = https://{1}.kilnhg.com/Repo/

       You can override a predefined scheme by defining a new scheme with  the
       same name.

   Commands
   share
       share a common history between several working directories

   Automatic Pooled Storage for Clones
       When  this extension is active, hg clone can be configured to automati‐
       cally share/pool storage across multiple clones. This mode  effectively
       converts  hg  clone to  hg clone + hg share.  The benefit of using this
       mode is the automatic management of store paths and intelligent pooling
       of related repositories.

       The following share. config options influence this feature:

       share.pool

              Filesystem  path  where  shared  repository data will be stored.
              When defined, hg clone will automatically use shared  repository
              storage instead of creating a store inside each clone.

       share.poolnaming

              How directory names in share.pool are constructed.

              "identity" means the name is derived from the first changeset in
              the repository. In this mode, different remotes share storage if
              their  root/initial  changeset  is  identical. In this mode, the
              local shared repository  is  an  aggregate  of  all  encountered
              remote repositories.

              "remote"  means the name is derived from the source repository's
              path or URL. In this mode, storage is only shared if the path or
              URL  requested  in  the  hg  clone command  matches exactly to a
              repository that was cloned before.

              The default naming mode is "identity".

   Commands
   share
       create a new shared repository:

       hg share [-U] [-B] SOURCE [DEST]

       Initialize a new repository and working directory that shares its  his‐
       tory (and optionally bookmarks) with another repository.

       Note   using  rollback  or  extensions that destroy/modify history (mq,
              rebase, etc.)  can  cause  considerable  confusion  with  shared
              clones.  In particular, if two shared clones are both updated to
              the same changeset, and one of them destroys that changeset with
              rollback, the other clone will suddenly stop working: all opera‐
              tions will fail with "abort: working directory has unknown  par‐
              ent". The only known workaround is to use debugsetparents on the
              broken clone to reset it to a changeset that still exists.

       Options:

       -U, --noupdate
              do not create a working directory

       -B, --bookmarks
              also share bookmarks

       --relative
              point to source using a relative path (EXPERIMENTAL)

   unshare
       convert a shared repository to a normal one:

       hg unshare

       Copy the store data to the repo and remove the sharedpath data.

   shelve
       save and restore changes to the working directory

       The "hg shelve" command saves changes made to the working directory and
       reverts  those  changes,  resetting  the  working  directory to a clean
       state.

       Later on, the "hg unshelve" command restores the changes saved  by  "hg
       shelve".  Changes  can  be  restored even after updating to a different
       parent, in which case Mercurial's merge machinery will resolve any con‐
       flicts if necessary.

       You  can  have more than one shelved change outstanding at a time; each
       shelved change has a distinct name. For details, see the help  for  "hg
       shelve".

   Commands
   shelve
       save and set aside changes from the working directory:

       hg shelve [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Shelving  takes  files that "hg status" reports as not clean, saves the
       modifications to a bundle (a shelved change), and reverts the files  so
       that their state in the working directory becomes clean.

       To restore these changes to the working directory, using "hg unshelve";
       this will work even if you switch to a different commit.

       When no files are specified, "hg shelve" saves all not-clean files.  If
       specific  files  or  directories are named, only changes to those files
       are shelved.

       In bare shelve (when  no  files  are  specified,  without  interactive,
       include  and  exclude  option),  shelving  remembers information if the
       working directory was on newly created branch, in other  words  working
       directory was on different branch than its first parent. In this situa‐
       tion unshelving restores branch information to the working directory.

       Each shelved change has a name that makes it easier to find later.  The
       name  of  a  shelved change defaults to being based on the active book‐
       mark, or if there is no active bookmark, the current named branch.   To
       specify a different name, use --name.

       To  see  a list of existing shelved changes, use the --list option. For
       each shelved change, this will print its name,  age,  and  description;
       use --patch or --stat for more details.

       To delete specific shelved changes, use --delete. To delete all shelved
       changes, use --cleanup.

       Options:

       -A, --addremove
              mark new/missing files as added/removed before shelving

       -u, --unknown
              store unknown files in the shelve

       --cleanup
              delete all shelved changes

       --date <DATE>
              shelve with the specified commit date

       -d, --delete
              delete the named shelved change(s)

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       -l, --list
              list current shelves

       -m,--message <TEXT>
              use text as shelve message

       -n,--name <NAME>
              use the given name for the shelved commit

       -p, --patch
              output patches for changes (provide the  names  of  the  shelved
              changes as positional arguments)

       -i, --interactive
              interactive mode, only works while creating a shelve

       --stat output  diffstat-style  summary of changes (provide the names of
              the shelved changes as positional arguments)

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   unshelve
       restore a shelved change to the working directory:

       hg unshelve [[-n] SHELVED]

       This command accepts an optional name of a shelved change  to  restore.
       If none is given, the most recent shelved change is used.

       If  a  shelved change is applied successfully, the bundle that contains
       the shelved changes is moved to a backup location (.hg/shelve-backup).

       Since you can restore a shelved change on top of an  arbitrary  commit,
       it  is  possible that unshelving will result in a conflict between your
       changes and the commits you are unshelving onto. If  this  occurs,  you
       must resolve the conflict, then use --continue to complete the unshelve
       operation. (The bundle will not be moved until  you  successfully  com‐
       plete the unshelve.)

       (Alternatively,  you can use --abort to abandon an unshelve that causes
       a conflict. This reverts the unshelved changes, and leaves  the  bundle
       in place.)

       If  bare  shelved  change(when no files are specified, without interac‐
       tive, include and exclude option) was done on newly created  branch  it
       would restore branch information to the working directory.

       After a successful unshelve, the shelved changes are stored in a backup
       directory. Only the N most recent backups are kept. N  defaults  to  10
       but can be overridden using the shelve.maxbackups configuration option.

       Timestamp  in  seconds  is  used  to decide order of backups. More than
       maxbackups backups are kept, if same timestamp prevents  from  deciding
       exact order of them, for safety.

       Options:

       -a, --abort
              abort an incomplete unshelve operation

       -c, --continue
              continue an incomplete unshelve operation

       -k, --keep
              keep shelve after unshelving

       -n,--name <NAME>
              restore shelved change with given name

       -t,--tool <VALUE>
              specify merge tool

       --date <DATE>
              set date for temporary commits (DEPRECATED)

   show
       unified command to show various repository information (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This  extension  provides the hg show command, which provides a central
       command for displaying commonly-accessed repository data and  views  of
       that data.

       The following config options can influence operation.

   commands
       show.aliasprefix

              List  of  strings  that  will register aliases for views. e.g. s
              will effectively set config options alias.s<view> = show  <view>
              for all views. i.e. hg swork would execute hg show work.

              Aliases that would conflict with existing registrations will not
              be performed.

   Commands
   show
       show various repository information:

       hg show VIEW

       A requested view of repository data is displayed.

       If no view is requested, the list of available views is shown  and  the
       command aborts.

       Note   There  are  no backwards compatibility guarantees for the output
              of this command. Output  may  change  in  any  future  Mercurial
              release.

              Consumers  wanting  stable  command output should specify a tem‐
              plate via -T/--template.

       List of available views:

       bookmarks   bookmarks and their associated changeset

       stack       current line of work

       work        changesets that aren't finished

       Options:

       -T,--template <TEMPLATE>
              display with template

   sparse
       allow sparse checkouts of the working directory (EXPERIMENTAL)

       (This extension is not yet protected by backwards compatibility guaran‐
       tees.  Any  aspect  may  break  in future releases until this notice is
       removed.)

       This extension allows the working directory to only consist of a subset
       of files for the revision. This allows specific files or directories to
       be explicitly included or excluded.  Many  repository  operations  have
       performance  proportional  to the number of files in the working direc‐
       tory. So only realizing a subset of files in the working directory  can
       improve performance.

   Sparse Config Files
       The  set  of  files that are part of a sparse checkout are defined by a
       sparse config file. The file  defines  3  things:  includes  (files  to
       include  in  the  sparse checkout), excludes (files to exclude from the
       sparse checkout), and profiles (links to other config files).

       The file format is newline delimited. Empty lines and  lines  beginning
       with # are ignored.

       Lines  beginning  with %include `` denote another sparse config file to
       include. e.g. ``%include tests.sparse. The filename is relative to  the
       repository root.

       The  special  lines  [include]  and  [exclude]  denote  the section for
       includes and excludes that follow, respectively. It is illegal to  have
       [include] after [exclude].

       Non-special lines resemble file patterns to be added to either includes
       or excludes. The syntax of these lines is documented by  hg  help  pat‐
       terns.   Patterns are interpreted as glob: by default and match against
       the root of the repository.

       Exclusion patterns take precedence over inclusion patterns. So even  if
       a file is explicitly included, an [exclude] entry can remove it.

       For  example,  say you have a repository with 3 directories, frontend/,
       backend/, and tools/. frontend/ and backend/  correspond  to  different
       projects  and  it  is  uncommon  for someone working on one to need the
       files for the other. But tools/  contains  files  shared  between  both
       projects. Your sparse config files may resemble:

       # frontend.sparse
       frontend/**
       tools/**

       # backend.sparse
       backend/**
       tools/**

       Say the backend grows in size. Or there's a directory with thousands of
       files you wish to exclude. You can modify the profile to  exclude  cer‐
       tain files:

       [include]
       backend/**
       tools/**

       [exclude]
       tools/tests/**

   Commands
   split
       command to split a changeset into smaller ones (EXPERIMENTAL)

   Commands
   split
       split a changeset into smaller ones:

       hg split [--no-rebase] [[-r] REV]

       Repeatedly  prompt  changes and commit message for new changesets until
       there is nothing left in the original changeset.

       If --rev was not given, split the working directory parent.

       By default, rebase connected non-obsoleted  descendants  onto  the  new
       changeset. Use --no-rebase to avoid the rebase.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV>
              revision to split

       --rebase
              rebase descendants after split (default: True)

       -d,--date <DATE>
              record the specified date as commit date

       -u,--user <USER>
              record the specified user as committer

   sqlitestore
       store repository data in SQLite (EXPERIMENTAL)

       The  sqlitestore  extension  enables  the storage of repository data in
       SQLite.

       This extension is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. There are NO BACKWARDS  COMPATI‐
       BILITY  GUARANTEES.  This  means  that  repositories  created with this
       extension may only be usable with the  exact  version  of  this  exten‐
       sion/Mercurial that was used. The extension attempts to enforce this in
       order to prevent repository corruption.

       In addition, several features are not yet supported or have known bugs:

       · Only some data is stored in SQLite. Changeset,  manifest,  and  other
         repository data is not yet stored in SQLite.

       · Transactions  are  not robust. If the process is aborted at the right
         time during transaction close/rollback, the repository could be in an
         inconsistent  state.  This  problem will diminish once all repository
         data is tracked by SQLite.

       · Bundle repositories do not work (the ability to use e.g.  hg -R <bun‐
         dle-file>  log to automatically overlay a bundle on top of the exist‐
         ing repository).

       · Various other features don't work.

       This extension should work for basic  clone/pull,  update,  and  commit
       workflows.   Some  history rewriting operations may fail due to lack of
       support for bundle repositories.

       To use, activate the extension  and  set  the  storage.new-repo-backend
       config  option  to  sqlite to enable new repositories to use SQLite for
       storage.

   strip
       strip changesets and their descendants from history

       This extension allows you to strip changesets and all their descendants
       from the repository. See the command help for details.

   Commands
   strip
       strip changesets and all their descendants from the repository:

       hg strip [-k] [-f] [-B bookmark] [-r] REV...

       The  strip  command  removes  the  specified  changesets  and all their
       descendants. If the working  directory  has  uncommitted  changes,  the
       operation is aborted unless the --force flag is supplied, in which case
       changes will be discarded.

       If a parent of the working directory  is  stripped,  then  the  working
       directory  will  automatically  be updated to the most recent available
       ancestor of the stripped parent after the operation completes.

       Any stripped changesets are stored in .hg/strip-backup as a bundle (see
       hg  help  bundle and hg help unbundle). They can be restored by running
       hg unbundle .hg/strip-backup/BUNDLE, where BUNDLE is  the  bundle  file
       created by the strip. Note that the local revision numbers will in gen‐
       eral be different after the restore.

       Use the --no-backup option to discard the backup bundle once the opera‐
       tion completes.

       Strip  is  not a history-rewriting operation and can be used on change‐
       sets in the public phase. But if  the  stripped  changesets  have  been
       pushed to a remote repository you will likely pull them again.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       -r,--rev <REV[+]>
              strip  specified revision (optional, can specify revisions with‐
              out this option)

       -f, --force
              force removal of changesets,  discard  uncommitted  changes  (no
              backup)

       --no-backup
              do not save backup bundle

       --nobackup
              do not save backup bundle (DEPRECATED)

       -n     ignored  (DEPRECATED)

       -k, --keep
              do not modify working directory during strip

       -B,--bookmark <BOOKMARK[+]>
              remove revs only reachable from given bookmark

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   transplant
       command to transplant changesets from another branch

       This extension allows you to transplant changes to another parent revi‐
       sion, possibly in another repository.  The  transplant  is  done  using
       'diff' patches.

       Transplanted  patches  are recorded in .hg/transplant/transplants, as a
       map from a changeset hash to its hash in the source repository.

   Commands
   transplant
       transplant changesets from another branch:

       hg transplant [-s REPO] [-b BRANCH [-a]] [-p REV] [-m REV] [REV]...

       Selected changesets will be applied  on  top  of  the  current  working
       directory  with  the  log of the original changeset. The changesets are
       copied and will thus appear twice in the history with different identi‐
       ties.

       Consider  using  the  graft  command  if  everything is inside the same
       repository - it will use merges and will usually give a better  result.
       Use the rebase extension if the changesets are unpublished and you want
       to move them instead of copying them.

       If --log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended of the
       form:

       (transplanted from CHANGESETHASH)

       You  can  rewrite  the changelog message with the --filter option.  Its
       argument will be invoked with the current changelog message as  $1  and
       the patch as $2.

       --source/-s  specifies  another repository to use for selecting change‐
       sets, just as if it temporarily had been  pulled.   If  --branch/-b  is
       specified,  these  revisions  will be used as heads when deciding which
       changesets to transplant, just as if  only  these  revisions  had  been
       pulled.   If  --all/-a  is specified, all the revisions up to the heads
       specified with --branch will be transplanted.

       Example:

       · transplant all changes up to REV on top of your current revision:

         hg transplant --branch REV --all

       You can optionally  mark  selected  transplanted  changesets  as  merge
       changesets.  You  will not be prompted to transplant any ancestors of a
       merged transplant, and you  can  merge  descendants  of  them  normally
       instead of transplanting them.

       Merge  changesets may be transplanted directly by specifying the proper
       parent changeset by calling hg transplant --parent.

       If no merges or revisions are provided,  hg  transplant will  start  an
       interactive changeset browser.

       If  a  changeset  application  fails, you can fix the merge by hand and
       then resume where you left off by calling hg transplant --continue/-c.

       Options:

       -s,--source <REPO>
              transplant changesets from REPO

       -b,--branch <REV[+]>
              use this source changeset as head

       -a, --all
              pull all changesets up to the --branch revisions

       -p,--prune <REV[+]>
              skip over REV

       -m,--merge <REV[+]>
              merge at REV

       --parent <REV>
              parent to choose when transplanting merge

       -e, --edit
              invoke editor on commit messages

       --log  append transplant info to log message

       -c, --continue
              continue last transplant session after fixing conflicts

       --filter <CMD>
              filter changesets through command

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   uncommit
       uncommit part or all of a local changeset (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This command undoes  the  effect  of  a  local  commit,  returning  the
       affected  files to their uncommitted state. This means that files modi‐
       fied, added or removed in the changeset will be left unchanged, and  so
       will remain modified, added and removed in the working directory.

   Commands
   unamend
       undo the most recent amend operation on a current changeset:

       hg unamend

       This  command  will  roll  back to the previous version of a changeset,
       leaving working directory in state in which it was  before  running  hg
       amend  (e.g. files modified as part of an amend will be marked as modi‐
       fied hg status)

   uncommit
       uncommit part or all of a local changeset:

       hg uncommit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       This command undoes  the  effect  of  a  local  commit,  returning  the
       affected  files to their uncommitted state. This means that files modi‐
       fied or deleted in the changeset will be left unchanged,  and  so  will
       remain modified in the working directory.

       If  no files are specified, the commit will be pruned, unless --keep is
       given.

       Options:

       --keep allow an empty commit after uncommiting

       -I,--include <PATTERN[+]>
              include names matching the given patterns

       -X,--exclude <PATTERN[+]>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   win32mbcs
       allow the use of MBCS paths with problematic encodings

       Some MBCS encodings are not good for some path operations (i.e.  split‐
       ting  path, case conversion, etc.) with its encoded bytes. We call such
       a encoding (i.e. shift_jis and big5) as "problematic  encoding".   This
       extension can be used to fix the issue with those encodings by wrapping
       some functions to convert to Unicode string before path operation.

       This extension is useful for:

       · Japanese Windows users using shift_jis encoding.

       · Chinese Windows users using big5 encoding.

       · All users who use a repository with one of problematic  encodings  on
         case-insensitive file system.

       This extension is not needed for:

       · Any user who use only ASCII chars in path.

       · Any user who do not use any of problematic encodings.

       Note that there are some limitations on using this extension:

       · You should use single encoding in one repository.

       · If the repository path ends with 0x5c, .hg/hgrc cannot be read.

       · win32mbcs is not compatible with fixutf8 extension.

       By default, win32mbcs uses encoding.encoding decided by Mercurial.  You
       can specify the encoding by config option:

       [win32mbcs]
       encoding = sjis

       It is useful for the users who want to commit with UTF-8 log message.

   win32text
       perform automatic newline conversion (DEPRECATED)

          Deprecation: The win32text extension requires each user to configure
          the extension again and again for each clone since the configuration
          is not copied when cloning.

          We have therefore made the eol as an alternative.  The  eol  uses  a
          version  controlled  file  for its configuration and each clone will
          therefore use the right settings from the start.

       To perform automatic newline conversion, use:

       [extensions]
       win32text =
       [encode]
       ** = cleverencode:
       # or ** = macencode:

       [decode]
       ** = cleverdecode:
       # or ** = macdecode:

       If not doing conversion, to make sure you  do  not  commit  CRLF/CR  by
       accident:

       [hooks]
       pretxncommit.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
       # or pretxncommit.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr

       To  do  the same check on a server to prevent CRLF/CR from being pushed
       or pulled:

       [hooks]
       pretxnchangegroup.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
       # or pretxnchangegroup.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr

   zeroconf
       discover and advertise repositories on the local network

       Zeroconf-enabled repositories will be announced in  a  network  without
       the  need  to  configure  a server or a service. They can be discovered
       without knowing their actual IP address.

       To allow other people to discover your repository using run hg serve in
       your repository:

       $ cd test
       $ hg serve

       You can discover Zeroconf-enabled repositories by running hg paths:

       $ hg paths
       zc-test = http://example.com:8000/test

FILES
       /etc/mercurial/hgrc, $HOME/.hgrc, .hg/hgrc

              This   file  contains  defaults  and  configuration.  Values  in
              .hg/hgrc override those in $HOME/.hgrc, and these override  set‐
              tings made in the global /etc/mercurial/hgrc configuration.  See
              hgrc(5) for details of the contents and format of these files.

       .hgignore

              This file contains  regular  expressions  (one  per  line)  that
              describe  file  names that should be ignored by hg. For details,
              see hgignore(5).

       .hgsub

              This file defines the  locations  of  all  subrepositories,  and
              tells  where the subrepository checkouts came from. For details,
              see hg help subrepos.

       .hgsubstate

              This file  is  where  Mercurial  stores  all  nested  repository
              states. NB: This file should not be edited manually.

       .hgtags

              This file contains changeset hash values and text tag names (one
              of each separated by spaces) that correspond to tagged  versions
              of  the  repository  contents. The file content is encoded using
              UTF-8.

       .hg/last-message.txt

              This file is used by hg commit to store a backup of  the  commit
              message in case the commit fails.

       .hg/localtags

              This  file can be used to define local tags which are not shared
              among repositories. The file format is the same as for  .hgtags,
              but it is encoded using the local system encoding.

       Some  commands  (e.g.  revert) produce backup files ending in .orig, if
       the .orig file already exists and is not tracked by Mercurial, it  will
       be overwritten.

BUGS
       Probably  lots,  please  post  them  to the mailing list (see Resources
       below) when you find them.
