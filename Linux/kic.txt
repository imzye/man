NAME
       kic - an editor for integrated circuits and photolithography masks

SYNOPSIS
       kic [-t <tech>] [-d <display>] [<kicfile>]

       <tech> Information  about  layer  names  and  general  preferences  are  taken  from  the file stored in the library with the name kic_tech.<tech> , e.g with the option -tabc , the technology file
              kic_tech.abc is used. Technology files are searched in the current directory or the one defined with the environment variable KIC_LIB_DIR.

       <display>
              is the X11 display name to be used. If not given, $DISPLAY will be used.

       <kicfile>
              is the file that should be edited.

DESCRIPTION
       kic is an interactive graphical editor for drawing patterns used to generate photomasks for lithography (production of integrated circuits etc).  Note from the README file accompanying the distri‐
       bution:

       KIC is distributed by Whiteley Research Inc., www.wrcad.com.

       Disclaimer:  Steve Whiteley and Whiteley Research Inc. don't guarantee or imply that this software is suitable for any purpose.  This is free public domain software, use at your own risk.

       More help is to be found in the built-in help or in the stand-alone help reader kichelp (which accesses the same file).

ENVIRONMENT
       KIC_LIB_DIR
              directory where technology files, logo font, and help texts are stored (default depends on the installation, probably /usr/lib/kic)

FILES
       $KIC_LIB_DIR/kic_help.txt
              help file for kichelp and builtin help (formatted ASCII, can be modified)

       $KIC_LIB_DIR/kic_tech.*
              technology files

       $KIC_LIB_DIR/logofont.kic
              font for LOGO (text writing) command

BUGS
       Too large files (flat of several dozens of MB) may hang the program.

       If a layer is not defined in the current technology file, the program just complains and shows nothing. The user has to add the layer manually (either with the ATTri command or in  the  technology
       file itself).

       Layer names with less than 4 characters may not be recognized in imported files, if the layer definition line does not end with ';' (semicolon).

       Coordinates with resolutions below 1/10 of the unit (1um normally) cannot be generated with KIC but are displayed correctly. Coordinate entry (CTRL-E) is a replacement for pointing, therefore also
       subject to grid snapping (i.e, truncation).
