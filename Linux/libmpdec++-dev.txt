NAME
       libmpdec++ - 4.0.1

SYNOPSIS
       C++ library for correctly rounded arbitrary precision decimal floating-point
       arithmetic.

DESCRIPTION
       The libmpdec++ library is part of mpdecimal and fully implements the General
       Decimal Arithmetic Specification, see:

          https://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html

       As described in the scope section of the specification, the library conforms
       - with minor restrictions - to the IEEE 754-2008 Standard for Floating-Point
       Arithmetic if the context is initialized with the appropriate parameters.

       Depending on the distribution, complete HTML documentation is available in the
       mpdecimal-doc package or at:
