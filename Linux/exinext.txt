NAME
       exinext - Finding individual retry times

SYNOPSIS
       exinext address|message-id

DESCRIPTION
       A  utility  called  exinext  (mostly a Perl script) provides the ability to fish specific information out of the retry database.  Given a mail domain (or a complete address), it looks up the hosts for
       that domain, and outputs any retry information for the hosts or for the domain.  At present, the retry information is obtained by running exim_dumpdb (see below) and processing the output.  For  exam‐
       ple:

         exinext piglet@milne.fict.example
         kanga.milne.fict.example:192.168.8.1 error 146: Connection refused
           first failed: 21-Feb-1996 14:57:34
           last tried:   21-Feb-1996 14:57:34
           next try at:  21-Feb-1996 15:02:34
         roo.milne.fict.example:192.168.8.3 error 146: Connection refused
           first failed: 20-Jan-1996 13:12:08
           last tried:   21-Feb-1996 11:42:03
           next try at:  21-Feb-1996 19:42:03
           past final cutoff time

       You  can also give exinext a local part, without a domain, and it will give any retry information for that local part in your default domain.  A message id can be used to obtain retry information per‐
       taining to a specific message.  This exists only when an attempt to deliver a message to a remote host suffers a message-specific error (see section 42.2).  exinext is not particularly efficient,  but
       then it isn't expected to be run very often.

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
