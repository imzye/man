NAME
       rt-dump-metadata - dump configuration metadata from an RT database

SYNOPSIS
           rt-dump-metdata [--all]

DESCRIPTION
       "rt-dump-metadata" is a tool that dumps configuration metadata from the Request Tracker database into XML format, suitable for feeding into "rt-setup-database". To dump and load a full RT database,
       you should generally use the native database tools instead, as well as performing any necessary steps from UPGRADING.

       This is NOT a tool for backing up an RT database.  See also "initialdata" in docs for more straightforward means of importing data.

OPTIONS
       "--all" or "-a"
           When run with "--all", the dump will include all configuration metadata; otherwise, the metadata dump will only include 'local' configuration changes, i.e. those done manually in the web
           interface.

       "--limit-to-privileged" or "-l"
           Causes the dumper to only dump privileged users.

       "--skip-disabled" or "-s"
           Ignores disabled rows in the database.
