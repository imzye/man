NAME
       virt-p2v-make-kiwi - Build the virt-p2v kiwi configuration

SYNOPSIS
        virt-p2v-make-kiwi [--inject-ssh-identity path] [-o kiwi-folder]

DESCRIPTION
       virt-p2v(1) converts a physical machine to run virtualized on KVM, managed by libvirt, OpenStack, oVirt, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation (RHEV), or one of the other targets supported by virt-v2v(1).

       Kiwi is a tool used mainly by SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE to build live CDs, make appliances and so on. It is driven by a few files including an xml description of the machine.

       virt-p2v-make-kiwi builds a folder containing all the pieces needed for kiwi to build a bootable P2V live CD ISO, USB key, or PXE image.  This tool only builds the kiwi configuration, but this manual
       page describes some of the ways you can use the kiwi configuration.

       The root user on the disk image uses "p2v" as its initial password.

BUILDING THE KIWI CONFIGURATION
       Using virt-p2v-make-kiwi is very simple:

        virt-p2v-make-kiwi

       will build a kiwi configuration based on the current machine’s distribution.

       To control the name of the output folder, use the -o parameter.

BUILDING A LIVE CD / ISO
       Once you have the kiwi configuration folder, you can use kiwi(1) to make a live CD:

        sudo kiwi --build p2v.kiwi -d build --type iso

       Before running this, you may have to tweak the "config.xml" file to change the locale and keyboard mapping to the one you need.

       If running on a SUSE Linux Entreprise Server, add the path to your packages repositories using the "--ignore-repos" and "--add-repo" kiwi parameters.

       The generated ISO image will be placed in the "build" folder.

BUILDING A BOOTABLE USB KEY
       Use the dd(1) program to write the ISO created above to a USB key:

        sudo dd if=path/to/p2v.iso of=/dev/sdX

BUILDING A PXE BOOT IMAGE
       To create a PXE boot image, run kiwi in such a way:

        sudo kiwi --build $PWD/p2v.kiwi -d build --add-profile netboot --type pxe

       For more details on how to use the generated image, report to the kiwi documentation on PXE images: https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/#chap.pxe

ADDING AN SSH IDENTITY
       You can inject an SSH identity (private key) file to the kiwi config and hence into the ISO using the --inject-ssh-identity option.  Note that you cannot inject a key once the ISO has been built.

       First create a key pair.  It must have an empty passphrase:

        ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f id_rsa

       This creates a private key ("id_rsa") and a public key ("id_rsa.pub") pair.  The public key should be appended to the "authorized_keys" file on the virt-v2v conversion server (usually to
       "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys").

       The private key should be added to the kiwi config and then discarded:

        virt-p2v-make-kiwi [...] --inject-ssh-identity id_rsa
        rm id_rsa

       The ISO can then be built from the kickstart in the usual way (see above), and it will contain the embedded SSH identity (/var/tmp/id_rsa).

       When booting virt-p2v, specify the URL of the injected file like this:

        │         User name: [root_____________________________] │
        │                                                        │
        │          Password: [    <leave this field blank>     ] │
        │                                                        │
        │  SSH Identity URL: [file:///var/tmp/id_rsa___________] │

       or if using the kernel command line, add:

        p2v.identity=file:///var/tmp/id_rsa

       For more information, see "SSH IDENTITIES" in virt-p2v(1).

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display help.

       --inject-ssh-identity id_rsa
           Add an SSH identity (private key) file into the kickstart.  See "ADDING AN SSH IDENTITY" above.

       -o OUTPUT
       --output OUTPUT
           Write kiwi configuration to the "OUTPUT" folder.  If not specified, the default is p2v.kiwi in the current directory.

       -V
       --version
           Display version number and exit.

FILES
       $libdir/virt-p2v/virt-p2v.xz
           The virt-p2v(1) binary which is copied into the kiwi configuration.

           The location of the binary can be changed by setting the "VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR" environment variable.

       $datadir/virt-p2v/issue
       $datadir/virt-p2v/launch-virt-p2v.in
       $datadir/virt-p2v/kiwi
       $datadir/virt-p2v/p2v.service
           Various data files that are used to make the kiwi appliance.

           The location of these files can be changed by setting the "VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR" environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       "VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR"
           The directory where virt-p2v-make-kiwi looks for data files and the virt-p2v binary (see "FILES" above).  If not set, a compiled-in location is used.
