NAME
       keepass - password manager

SYNOPSIS
       keepass

DESCRIPTION
       KeePass  is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you
       to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put  all  your  pass‐
       words  in  one  database,  which is locked with one master key or a key
       file. So you only have to remember one single master password to unlock
       the whole database. The databases are encrypted using AES-256.

OPTIONS
