NAME
       git-obliterate - rewrite past commits to remove some files

SYNOPSIS
       git obliterate <files...> [-- <rev-list options...>]

DESCRIPTION
       Completely  remove  some files from the repository, including past com‐
       mits and tags. WARNING! This command will rewrite the  history  similar
       to  git rebase(though it affects more). The rewritten history will have
       different object names for all the objects and will not  converge  with
       the  original branch. So avoid using it on commits that you shared. And
       it will mess up stash, so don´t have stash when you run git obliterate.

OPTIONS
       You can  pass  rev-list  options  to  indicate  the  range  of  commits
       affected. Those options need to be separated with ´--´ before them. Run
       git help rev-list to see the acceptable options.

Examples
       Remove .secret from the repository:

           $ git obliterate .secret

       Remove .secret from commits between origin and feature:

           $ git obliterate .secret -- feature ^origin

       Remove .secret from commit abcdefg to commit 1234567

           $ git obliterate .secret -- abcdefg..1234567
