NAME
       el — program to make a tuned shell-command for Oneliner

SYNOPSIS
       el [-acdfhioxV]  [--command cmd]  [--args n]  [--format fmt]  [--execute]  [--inpipe buf]  [--outpipe buf]  [--serial]  [--help]  [--version]  [--debug]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the el command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU       Info format; see below.

       el is a program that You can make a tuned shell-command for Oneliner with.  This command can send S-exp to Emacs, and this can make Emacs evaluate it, too.  In other words, you can execute Emacs's
       function from shell-commands.  And you can make Emacs work in closer cooperation with your favorite shell-commands.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the Info files.

       -i buf           --inpipe buf
                 Gets input from pipe-buffer. You can specify a number of pipe-buffer, too.

       -o buf           --outpipe buf
                 Puts output to pipe-buffer. You can specify a number of pipe-buffer, too.

       -s           --serial
                 Makes el to serialize multiple lines to one line.
