NAME
       tilemaker - Generates vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data

SYNOPSIS
       tilemaker --input input.osm.pbf --output output.mbtiles

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tilemaker command.

       tilemaker  generates  vector tiles from OpenStreetMap planet and diff files without any complex stack or need for a database. It uses the schema of OpenMapTiles by default, but custom vector tiles
       can be produced by modifying the JSON config (layer config and general options) and Lua processing script (mapping OSM tags to vector tile layers/attributes).

       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below:

       --input
              Source path and file from OpenStreetMap (.osm.pbf).

       --output
              Target path for vector tiles. Specify .mbtiles/.sqlite to create an mbtiles archive, or a directory to create individual .mvt files.

       --config
              Path to layer and global config file (.json). config.json assumed if not specified.

       --process
              Path to Lua processing script for processing tags. process.lua assumed if not specified.

       --store
              Path to the directory to use as a temporary store during processing.  If specified, tilemaker uses on-disk storage instead of holding everything in RAM. Fast storage (e.g. SSD) is  strongly
              recommended.

       --compact
              Reduce overall memory usage by assuming nodes are numbered sequentially (requires .osm.pbf to be pre-processed with osmium renumber).

       --merge
              Merge with existing .mbtiles/.sqlite file.

       --bbox Bounding box to use if the input file does not set one in the header (as minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat).

       --skip-integrity
              Don't enforce checks on all nodes being present in ways.

       --verbose
              Outputs any issues encountered during tile creation.

       --threads
              Number of threads (automatically detected if 0).

       --help Show help message for tilemaker.

BUGS
       No known bugs.
