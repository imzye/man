SYNOPSIS
       grc [options] command [args]

DESCRIPTION
       grc will execute command command with optional parameters [args] piping its stdout or stderr into grcat, with appropriate configuration file.

       Configuration file for grc is determined by /etc/grc.conf file.

       Format of /etc/grc.conf: each entry consists of 2 lines, between entries there can be any number of empty lines or lines beginning with # (comments)

       First line is regular expression, second line the name of configuration file for grcat.

       Configuration file after the first regular expression matching command [args] will be passed to grcat as its configuration file

OPTIONS
       --help Show summary of options.

       --version
              Display version.

       -e --stderr
              Redirect error output. Unless -s is selected as well, this cancels redirection of standard output via grcat

       -s --stdout
              Redirect standard output. Used to redirect standard output together with --stderr option.

       --colour=x
              x is one of on off auto

              --colour=on will colourise (default)

              --colour=off will just execute command without colourising.
