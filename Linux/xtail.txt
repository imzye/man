XTAIL(1)                                                                                  General Commands Manual                                                                                  XTAIL(1)

NAME
       xtail - Watch the growth of files.

SYNTAX
       xtail entry ...

DESCRIPTION
       Xtail monitors one or more files, and displays all data written to a file since command invocation.  It is very useful for monitoring multiple logfiles simultaneously.

       If  an  entry  given  on  the command line is a directory, all files in that directory will be monitored, including those created after the xtail invocation.  If an entry given on the command line
       doesn't exist, xtail will watch for it and monitor it once created.  When switching files in the display, a banner showing the pathname of the file is printed.

       An interrupt character (usually CTRL/C or DEL) will display a list of the most recently modified files being watched.  Send a quit signal (usually CTRL/backslash) to stop xtail.

SEE ALSO
       tail(1)

NOTES
       Xtail may be easily confused.  For example, if you ask it to monitor a file multiple times, it probably will.  If you misspell a filename, xtail will treat it as a nonexistent  entry  and  happily
       wait for its creation.

       My favorite use is "xtail /usr/spool/uucp/.Log/*".
