NAME
       gss_context_time - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gss.h>

       OM_uint32 gss_context_time(OM_uint32 * minor_status, const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle, OM_uint32 * time_rec);

ARGUMENTS
       OM_uint32 * minor_status
                   (Integer, modify) Implementation specific status
                     code.

       const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle
                   (gss_ctx_id_t, read) Identifies the context to be
                     interrogated.

       OM_uint32 * time_rec
                   (Integer, modify) Number of seconds that the context
                     will remain valid.  If the context has already expired, zero will
                     be returned.

DESCRIPTION
       Determines the number of seconds for which the specified context will remain valid.

RETURN VALUE
       `GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Successful completion.

       `GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED`: The context has already expired.

       `GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT`: The context_handle parameter did not identify a valid context
