NAME
       idmapd.conf - configuration file for libnfsidmap

SYNOPSIS
       Configuration file for libnfsidmap.  Used by idmapd and svcgssd to map NFSv4 name to and from ids.

DESCRIPTION
       The idmapd.conf configuration file consists of several sections, initiated by strings of the form [General] and [Mapping].  Each section may contain lines of
       the form
         variable = value
       The recognized sections and their recognized variables are as follows:

   [General] section variables
       Verbosity
              Verbosity level of debugging (Default: 0)

       Domain The local NFSv4 domain name.  An NFSv4 domain is a namespace with a unique username<->UID and groupname<->GID mapping.  (Default: Host's  fully-quali‐
              fied DNS domain name)

       Local-Realms
              A  comma-separated  list  of  Kerberos  realm names that may be considered equivalent to the local realm name.  For example, users juser@ORDER.EDU and
              juser@MAIL.ORDER.EDU may be considered to be the same user in the specified Domain.  (Default: the host's default realm name)
              Note: If a value is specified here, the default local realm must be included as well.

   [Mapping] section variables
       Nobody-User
              Local user name to be used when a mapping cannot be completed.

       Nobody-Group
              Local group name to be used when a mapping cannot be completed.

   [Translation] section variables
       Method A comma-separated, ordered list of mapping methods (plug-ins) to use when mapping between NFSv4 names and local IDs.  Each specified method  is  tried
              in  order  until  a  mapping  is  found,  or  there  are no more methods to try.  The methods included in the default distribution include "nsswitch",
              "umich_ldap", and "static".  (Default: nsswitch)

       GSS-Methods
              An optional comma-separated, ordered list of mapping methods (plug-ins) to use when mapping between GSS Authenticated names and local IDs.   (Default:
              the same list as specified for Method)

   [Static] section variables
       The "static" translation method uses a static list of GSS-Authenticated names to local user names.  Entries in the list are of the form:
        principal@REALM = localusername

   [UMICH_SCHEMA] section variables
       If the "umich_ldap" translation method is specified, the following variables within the [UMICH_SCHEMA] section are used.

       LDAP_server
              LDAP server name or address (Required if using UMICH_LDAP)

       LDAP_base
              Absolute LDAP search base.  (Required if using UMICH_LDAP)

       LDAP_people_base
              Absolute LDAP search base for people accounts.  (Default: The LDAP_base value)

       LDAP_group_base
              Absolute LDAP search base for group accounts.  (Default: The LDAP_base value)

       LDAP_canonicalize_name
              Whether or not to perform name canonicalization on the name given as LDAP_server (Default: "true")

       LDAP_use_ssl
              Set to "true" to enable SSL communication with the LDAP server.  (Default: "false")

       LDAP_ca_cert
              Location of a trusted CA certificate used when SSL is enabled (Required if LDAP_use_ssl is true)

       NFSv4_person_objectclass
              The object class name for people accounts in your local LDAP schema (Default: NFSv4RemotePerson)

       NFSv4_name_attr
              Your local schema's attribute name to be used for NFSv4 user names (Default: NFSv4Name)

       NFSv4_uid_attr
              Your local schema's attribute name to be used for uidNumber (Default: uidNumber)

       GSS_principal_attr
              Your local schema's attribute name for GSSAPI Principal names (Default: GSSAuthName)

       NFSv4_acctname_attr
              Your local schema's attribute name to be used for account names (Default: uid)

       NFSv4_group_objectclass
              The object class name for group accounts in your local LDAP schema (Default: NFSv4RemoteGroup)

       NFSv4_gid_attr
              Your local schema's attribute name to be used for gidNumber (Default: gidNumber)

       NFSv4_group_attr
              Your local schema's attribute name to be used for NFSv4 group names (Default: NFSv4Name)

       LDAP_use_memberof_for_groups
              Some  LDAP  servers  do  a  better job with indexing where searching through all the groups searching for the user in the memberuid list.  Others like
              SunOne directory that search can takes minutes if there are thousands of groups. So setting LDAP_use_memberof_for_groups to true in the  configuration
              file will use the memberof lists of the account and search through only those groups to obtain gids.  (Default: false)

       NFSv4_member_attr
              If LDAP_use_memberof_for_groups is true, this is the attribute to be searched for.  (Default: memberUid)

       NFSv4_grouplist_filter
              An optional search filter for determining group membership.  (No Default)

       LDAP_timeout_seconds
              Number of seconds before timing out an LDAP request (Default: 4)

EXAMPLES
       An example /etc/idmapd.conf file:

       [General]

       Verbosity = 0
       Domain = domain.org
       Local-Realms = DOMAIN.ORG,MY.DOMAIN.ORG,YOUR.DOMAIN.ORG

       [Mapping]

       Nobody-User = nfsnobody
       Nobody-Group = nfsnobody

       [Translation]

       Method = umich_ldap,nsswitch
       GSS-Methods = umich_ldap,static

       [Static]

       johndoe@OTHER.DOMAIN.ORG = johnny

       [UMICH_SCHEMA]

       LDAP_server = ldap.domain.org
       LDAP_base = dc=org,dc=domain
