NAME
       glaurung - free UCI chess engine, to calculate chess moves

SYNOPSIS
       glaurung

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the glaurung command.

       glaurung is an UCI chess engine, to calculate chess moves

       Opening book

       This  version  of  Glaurung  has experimental support for PolyGlot opening books.  For information about how to create such books, consult the PolyGlot documentation.  Currently, Glaurung requires
       that the book file is named book.bin and is placed in Glaurungs working directory.

       More than one CPU

       Beginning with version 2-epsilon/3, Glaurung has support for up to four CPUs.  Because the program currently cannot automatically detect the number of CPUs on your computer, it uses only a  single
       search  thread  by default.  If your computer has two or more CPUs (this includes dual-core CPUs like the Intel Core Duo or the AMD Athlon 64 X2), you should set the "Threads" UCI parameter to the
       number of CPUs to obtain optimal performance.

OPTIONS
       This program does NOT follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes.

SEE ALSO
       Communication with UCI commands is documented by "The UCI Communication Protocol" in /usr/share/doc/glaurung/engine-interface.txt.
