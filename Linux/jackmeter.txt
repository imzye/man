NAME
       jack_meter - Console based Digital Peak Meter for JACK

SYNOPSYS
       jack_meter [ -f freqency ] [ -r ref-level ] [ -w width ] [-n ] [ <port>, ... ]
       jack_meter -h

DESCRIPTION
       jack_meter is a basic console based DPM (Digital Peak Meter).  I wrote it for quickly checking remote signal levels, without having to run X11 to use a pretty graphical meter such as meterbridge.

       The port parameter is optional - when missing then you have to connect up the meter to an input port manually.  If more than one port is specified then the inputs are mixed.

OPTIONS
       -f  freqency
              How many times per second to refresh the meter. Default is 8.

       -r  ref-level
              The reference signal level for 0dB on the meter.

       -w  width
              The width of the meter (number of characters). The default is 79, one less than the typical terminal width.  -n
              Outputs meter level as a number in decibels instead of a bar graph display.
