NAME
       tilde - an intuitive text editor for the console/terminal

SYNOPSIS
       tilde [OPTIONS] [FILE[:LINE[:COLUMN]]]...

DESCRIPTION
       Tilde  is  a text editor for the console/terminal, which tries to be as intuitive as possible for users who are accustomed to GUI environments such as Gnome, KDE and Windows. For example, the
       short-cut to copy the current selection is Control-C, and to paste the previously copied text the short-cut Control-V can be used. As another example, the File menu can be accessed by  press‐
       ing Meta-F.

OPTIONS
       Tilde accepts the following options:

       -b, --black-white
              Force  Tilde  to use black & white mode. Only attributes such as reverse video, underline and bold text will be used to create the interface. This option overrides the setting from the
              configuration file.

       -c, --color
              Request Tilde to use color mode. This option overrides the setting from the configuration file. If the terminal does not support color, or does not provide sufficient colors, this  op‐
              tion will be ignored.

       -C config, --config=config
              Use configuration file config instead of the default configuration file, which is typically ~/.config/tilde/config.

       -e encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Open any files named on the command line using character encoding encoding, instead of the default UTF-8 encoding.

       -h, --help
              Display a short help message.

       -I, --select-input-method
              Ask the user to select the input handling method immediately after start-up, as if the user had not previously selected one for the current terminal type.

       -J, --no-parse-file-position
              Do  not  attempt  parse the line and column from the file names passed on the command line. Without this option, if the file name ends in a colon followed by a number, or two such num‐
              bers, they will be interpreted as the position in the file to jump to. With this option, those colons and numbers will be interpreted as part of the file name.

       -P, --no-primary-selection
              Disable the use of the primary selection mechanism (a.k.a. "middle-button paste") for the external clipboard. This can be useful for using Tilde over  SSH  connections  in  combination
              with a Clipboard Manager which can result in slow-downs when selecting text.

       -T terminal, --terminal=terminal
              Set the terminal type to terminal, overriding the TERM environment variable.

       -V, --version
              Print version and copyright information.

       -x, --no-ext-clipboard
              Tells Tilde not to attempt to connect to the X11 clipboard.

       To stop Tilde from interpreting file names that start with a dash as options, one can specify a double dash (--) after which Tilde will interpret any following arguments as files to read.
