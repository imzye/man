nbdkit-cdi-plugin(1)                                                                                 NBDKIT                                                                                nbdkit-cdi-plugin(1)

NAME
       nbdkit-cdi-plugin - export a layer from a container image

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit cdi [name=]NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST] [layer=N]

DESCRIPTION
       "nbdkit-cdi-plugin" (Containerized Data Importer plugin) is a plugin for nbdkit(1) which downloads a container image using podman-pull(1) and makes a single layer available over NBD.  The plugin is
       essentially a convenient wrapper around podman(1) and jq(1) and requires both tools to be installed.

EXAMPLES
       Given a Containerized Data Importer (CDI) registry image containing a VM disk, you can export the whole layer using:

        $ nbdkit cdi docker://kubevirt/fedora-cloud-container-disk-demo

       The layer exported over NBD is a tar file:

        $ nbdcopy nbd://localhost - | file -
        -: POSIX tar archive

       To export only the VM disk image in this layer, combine this plugin with nbdkit-tar-filter(1).  In this example when you run file(1) on the tar entry within the layer it shows that it is a QCOW2 file:

        $ nbdkit cdi docker://kubevirt/fedora-cloud-container-disk-demo \
                --filter=tar tar-entry=./disk/downloaded \
                --run 'nbdcopy "$uri" - | file -'
        -: QEMU QCOW2 Image (v2), 4294967296 bytes

PARAMETERS
       [name=]NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]
           The name or URI of the container image.  This is passed to podman-pull(1).

           "name=" is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.  See "Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).

       layer=N
           Export the N'th layer (instead of layer 0).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       "TMPDIR"
           A temporary copy of the layer is created in "TMPDIR".  If this environment variable is not set then /var/tmp is used instead.

FILES
       $plugindir/nbdkit-cdi-plugin.so
           The plugin.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $plugindir.

VERSION
       "nbdkit-cdi-plugin" first appeared in nbdkit 1.22.
