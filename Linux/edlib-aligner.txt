NAME
       edlib-aligner - edlib sequence alignment tool using edit distance

SYNOPSIS
       edlib-aligner [options...] <queries.fasta> <target.fasta>

OPTIONS
       -s     If specified, there will be no score or alignment output (silent mode).

       -m HW|NW|SHW
              Alignment mode that will be used. [default: NW]

       -n N   Score  will  be calculated only for N best sequences (best = with smallest score). If N = 0 then all sequences will be calculated. Specifying small N can make total calculation much faster.
              [default: 0]

       -k K   Sequences with score > K will be discarded. Smaller k, faster calculation. If -1, no sequences will be discarded. [default: -1]

       -p     If specified, alignment path will be found and printed. This may significantly slow down the calculation.

       -l     If specified, start locations will be found and printed. Each start location corresponds to one end location. This may somewhat slow down the calculation, but is still faster  then  finding
              alignment path and does not consume any extra memory.

       -f NICE|CIG_STD|CIG_EXT
              Format  that  will  be  used to print alignment path, can be used only with -p. NICE will give visually attractive format, CIG_STD will  give standard cigar format and CIG_EXT will give ex‐
              tended cigar format. [default: NICE]
