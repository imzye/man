NAME
       cptclip - extract a sub-table from a GMT colour palette table (cpt).

SYNOPSIS
       cptclip -R min/max [-h] [-o file] [-s] [-v] [-V] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The cptclip utility extracts a sub-table from a cpt format file. The
       arguments to the mandatory -R option, min/max, are interpreted as the
       (z) limits of the output unless the -s switch is specified, in which
       case they are the segment numbers.

       The program will read from stdin if a file is not specified as the
       final argument, and write to stdout if the -o option is not specified.

       Note that much of the functionality of this program is included in
       recent versions of the GMT program makecpt(1).

OPTIONS
       --backtrace-file path
           Specify a file to which to write a formatted backtrace. The file
           will only be created if there is a backtrace created, typically
           when an error occurs.

       --backtrace-format format
           Specify the format of the backtrace written to the files specified
           by --backtrace-file, one of plain, xml or json.

       -h, --help
           Brief help.

       -o, --output file
           Write the output to file, rather than stdout.

       -R, --range min/max
           The (z) range of the output, or the segments if the -s switch is
           also given.

       -s, --segments
           The min and max arguments of the -R switch are interpreted as the
           segment numbers (starting at one).

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose operation.

       -V, --version
           Version information.

EXAMPLES
       Extract the table with z-range from 2.5 to 5:

           cptclip -v -o new.cpt -R 2.5/5 old.cpt

       Extract the table with the first 5 segments:

           cptclip -v -s -o new.cpt -R 1/5 old.cpt
