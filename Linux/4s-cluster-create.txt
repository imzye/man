NAME
     4s-cluster-create — Create a KB on the cluster.

SYNOPSIS
     4s-cluster-create kb-name

FILES
     This command depends on the config file /etc/4s-cluster, see 4s-cluster(5).

EXAMPLES
     $ 4s-cluster-create demo

     Create the "demo" knowledgebase

     Knowledgebases can be deleted with the 4s-cluster-destroy(1) command.

CAVEATS
     If the kb has already been created then it will be erased and recreated.  Because of this extreme care needs to be taken then using this command.
