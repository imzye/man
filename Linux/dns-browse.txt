NAME
       dns_browse — GUI front-end to dns_tree

SYNOPSIS
       dns_browse [-w]  [-t TYPE] DNS_domain

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the dns_browse command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       dns_browse is a program that works as a GUI front-end to dns_tree.  It allows point-and-click DNS browsing and makes it easy to expand/compress hierarchies in one or more DNS zones.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -t TYPE   Show only records of TYPE. This argument can be repeated to indicate multiple types. Use the "all" type to print all the known types.

       -h        Show summary of options.

       -w        Match only web hosts. Only those hosts which have 'www' in their        name will be shown.
