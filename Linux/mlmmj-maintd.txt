NAME
       mlmmj-maintd - maintenance for mlmmj maintained lists

SYNOPSIS
       mlmmj-maintd [-F] [-d | -L] /path/to/dir

       -d: Full path to directory with lists

       -L: Full path to list directory

       -F: Don't fork, performing one maintenance run only.

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  program doing the maintenance for an mlmmj based mailing
       list. It will unsubscribe people who have bounced for long enough, send
       out  bounce  probes,  resend mails that couldn't be delivered to relay‐
       host, clean out stale requests for e.g. subscription, resend list mails
       and clean up leftover files etc.

       If  a  directory containing several lists exists, the -d can be used to
       specify this, making mlmmj-maintd perform a maintenance  run  in  every
       listdir below the specified one.

       Only either -d or -L can be specified at the same time.

       It  will  run  as a daemon, unless the -F switch is specified, in which
       case it just runs once.  The -F  option should be used when  one  wants
       to  avoid  running  another  daemon,  and  use  e.g. cron to control it
       instead. In case cron is used, mlmmj-maintd should be run every 2 hours
       or so. An example crontab entry:

       0 */2 * * * /usr/bin/mlmmj-maintd -F -L /path/to/list
