NAME
       Honey - genomic structural variation discovery

SYNOPSIS
       Honey {subcommand}[options]

DESCRIPTION
       PBHoney  is an implementation of two variant-identification approaches designed to exploit the high mappability of long reads (i.e., greater than 10,000 bp). PBHoney considers both intra-read
       discordance and soft-clipped tails of long reads to identify structural variants.
