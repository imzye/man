NAME
       ckb-next-daemon - Corsair RGB driver daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ckb-next-daemon [--gid=<gid>] [--hwload=<always|try|never>] [--nonotify] [--nobind] [--nonroot]

DESCRIPTION
       See https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/blob/master/DAEMON.md for full instructions.

OPTIONS
       --gid=<gid>
              Restrict access to /dev/input/ckb* nodes to users in group <gid>.

       --hwload=<always|try|never>
              --hwload=always will force loading of stored hardware profiles on compatible devices. May result in long startup times.
              --hwload=try will try to load the profiles, but give up if not immediately successful (default).
              --hwload=never will ignore hardware profiles completely.

       --nonotify
              Disables key monitoring/notifications. Note that this makes reactive lighting impossible.

       --nobind
              Disables all key rebinding, macros, and notifications. Implies --nonotify.

       --nonroot
              Allows running ckb-next-daemon as a non root user. This will almost certainly not work. Use only if you know what you're doing.

                                                                                                                                                                                         CKB-NEXT-DAEMON(8)
