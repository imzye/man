NAME
       slurmstepd - The job step manager for Slurm.

SYNOPSIS
       slurmstepd

DESCRIPTION
       slurmstepd  is a job step manager for Slurm.  It is spawned by the slurmd daemon when a job step is launched and terminates when the job step does.  It is responsible for managing input and output
       (stdin, stdout and stderr) for the job step along with its accounting and signal processing.  slurmstepd should not be initiated by users or system administrators.
