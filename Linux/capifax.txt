NAME
       capifax - a FAX send application for CAPI

SYNOPSIS
       capifax [ -v ] [ -c calling_party_num ] [ -i station_ID ] [-h headline] dest_num filename

DESCRIPTION
       capifax is an application to send faxes via CAPI; you need a CAPI capable ISDN card with the appropriate drivers.

       The final arguments must be the phone number of the receiving fax machine and the file to send. This file must be an SSF-File as generated by "gs -sDevice=cfax".

       This stuff is based heavily on AVM's CAPI-adk for linux.
