NAME
       devscripts - scripts to ease the lives of Debian developers

DESCRIPTION
       The  devscripts  package  provides a collection of scripts which may be of use to Debian developers and others wishing to build Debian packages.  For a summary of the available scripts, please see
       the file /usr/share/doc/devscripts/README.gz, and for full details, please see the individual manpages.  They are contributed by multiple developers; for details of the  authors,  please  see  the
       code or manpages.

       Also, the directory /usr/share/doc/devscripts/examples contains an example exim script for sorting mail arriving to Debian mailing lists.

ENVIRONMENT
       Several scripts of the devscripts suite use the following environment variables. Check the man pages of individual scripts for more details on how the variables are used.

       DEBEMAIL
           Email of the person acting on a given Debian package via devscripts.

       DEBFULLNAME
           Full name (first + family) of the person acting on a given Debian package via devscripts.

SCRIPTS
       Here is the complete list of available devscripts. See their man pages for additional documentation.

       annotate-output(1)
              run a command and prepend time and stream (O for stdout, E for stderr) for every line of output.

       archpath(1)
              Prints arch (tla/Bazaar 1.x) package names. Also supports calculating the package names for other branches. [tla]

       bts(1) A  command-line  tool  for  accessing  the  Debian Bug Tracking System, both to send mails to control@bts.debian.org and to access the web pages and SOAP interface of the BTS. [www-browser,
              libauthen-sasl-perl, libsoap-lite-perl, liburi-perl, libwww-perl, bsd-mailx | mailx]

       build-rdeps(1)
              Searches for all packages that build-depend on a given package. [dctrl-tools, dose-extra, libdpkg-perl]

       chdist(1)
              tool to easily play with several distributions. [dctrl-tools]

       checkbashisms(1)
              check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common bash-specific constructs.

       cowpoke(1)
              upload a Debian source package to a cowbuilder host and build it, optionally also signing and uploading the result to an incoming queue. [ssh-client]

       dcmd(1)
              run a given command replacing the name of a .changes or .dsc file with each of the files referenced therein. *

       dd-list(1)
              given a list of packages, pretty-print it ordered by maintainer. *

       debbisect(1)
              bisect snapshot.debian.org to find which change in the archive introduced a certain problem. [debvm, mmdebstrap, python3-debian]

       debc(1)
              List contents of current package.  Do this after a successful "debuild" to see if the package looks all right.

       debchange (abbreviation dch)(1)
              Modifies debian/changelog and manages version numbers for you.  It will either increment the version number or add an entry for the current version, depending upon the options given to  it.
              [libdistro-info-perl, libsoap-lite-perl]*

       debcheckout(1)
              checkout the development repository of a Debian package. *

       debclean(1)
              Clean  a  Debian  source  tree.  Debclean will clean all Debian source trees below the current directory, and if requested, also remove all files that were generated from these source trees
              (that is .deb, .dsc and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though, so that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary. *

       debcommit(1)
              Commits changes to cvs, darcs, svn, svk, tla, bzr, git, or hg, using new entries in debian/changelog as the commit message. Also supports tagging Debian package releases.  [cvs  |  darcs  |
              subversion | svk | tla | bzr | git-core | mercurial, libtimedate-perl]

       debdiff(1)
              A  program  which  examines  two .deb files or two .changes files and reports on any difference found in their file lists.  Useful for ensuring that no files were inadvertently lost between
              versions.  Can also examine two .dsc files and report on the changes between source versions. For a deeper comparison one can use the diffoscope package. [wdiff, patchutils]*

       debdiff-apply(1)
              Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as those generated by debdiff, to a target Debian source package. Any changes to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to  avoid
              the  conflicts  that  changelog  diffs  typically  produce  when  applied  naively.  May  be used to check that old patches still apply to newer versions of those packages. [python3-debian,
              python3-unidiff, quilt]

       debftbfs(1)
              list source packages which have FTBFS bugs filed against them and print them with the bug number and title. [postgresql-client, python3-debian, python3-debianbts]

       debi(1)
              Installs the current package by using dpkg.  It assumes that the current package has just been built (for example by debuild), and the .deb lives in the parent directory,  and  will  effec‐
              tively run dpkg -i on the .deb. The ability to install the package with a very short command is very useful when troubleshooting packages.

       debootsnap(1)
              Combines  debootstrap and snapshot.debian.org to create a chroot containing exactly the requested selection of packages. This can be used to re-create a chroot from the past, for example to
              reproduce a bug. The tool is also used by debrebuild to build a package in a chroot with build dependencies in the same version as recorded in the buildinfo file. [apt-utils, equivs, mmdeb‐
              strap, python3-debian, python3-pycurl, python3-requests]

       debrelease(1)
              A wrapper around dupload or dput which figures out which version to upload, and then calls dupload or dput to actually perform the upload. [dupload | dput, ssh-client]

       debrebuild(1)
              Given a buildinfo file, builds the referenced source package in an environment documented in the provided buildinfo file. The build can be performed by sbuild or other builders in a  chroot
              environment  created  by debootsnap. The generated artifacts will be verified against the hashes from the buildinfo file. [sbuild | mmdebstrap, python3-pycurl, libdpkg-perl, libstring-shel‐
              lquote-perl]

       debrepro(1)
              A script that tests reproducibility of Debian packages. It will build a given source directory twice, with a set of variation between the first and second  build,  and  compare  the  binary
              packages  produced.  If diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries. If disorderfs is installed, it is used during the build to inject non-determinism in filesystem
              listing operations. [faketime, diffoscope, disorderfs]

       debrsign(1)
              This transfers a .changes/.dsc pair to a remote machine for signing, and runs debsign on the remote machine over an SSH connection. [gnupg, debian-keyring, ssh-client]

       debsign(1)
              Use GNU Privacy Guard to sign the changes (and possibly dsc) files created by running dpkg-buildpackage with no-sign options.  Useful if you are building a package on a remote  machine  and
              wish to sign it on a local one.  This script is capable of automatically downloading the .changes and .dsc files from a remote machine. [gnupg, debian-keyring, ssh-client]*

       debsnap(1)
              grab packages from https://snapshot.debian.org [libwww-perl, libjson-perl]

       debuild(1)
              A  wrapper  for  building  a package (i.e., dpkg-buildpackage) to avoid problems with insufficient permissions and wrong paths etc. Debuild will set up the proper environment for building a
              package. Debuild will also run lintian to check that the package does not have any major policy violations. [lintian, gnupg]*

       deb-check-file-conflicts(1)
              Check (using apt-file) if a Debian package installs files in the exact same path as any other package, and if there are Breaks/Replaces (or Conflicts) defined in debian/control to avoid the
              package installation failing on file conflicts.

       deb-janitor(1)
              command-line client for interacting with the Debian Janitor.

       deb-reversion(1)
              increases a binary package version number and repacks the package, useful for porters and the like.
