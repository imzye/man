NAME
       xtron - a simple version of the old classic TRON

SYNOPSIS
       xtron

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       xtron  is  a simple implementation of the classic game TRON. The plot is easy: avoid hitting anything, including walls, your own tail and your opponent.  You can play in one- or two-player mode or
       watch the demo.

       The game starts in demo mode. To start playing, click on one of the human buttons or both. Click on the button with "tron" on it to reset the scores, and click on the bed to pause.

       The standard controls are:

       Player 1:  Player 2:
       w - up     8 - up
       s - down   2 - down
       a - left   4 - left
       d - right  6 - right

       Player 2 can also use the arrow keys. Edit /etc/X11/app-defaults/Xtron to change the keys.

       You can reset the score of a player by clicking on the player's score button.

       You can also change the "look-ahead" of the AI opponent by changing xtron.lookAHEAD in the /etc/X11/app-defaults/Xtron file.
