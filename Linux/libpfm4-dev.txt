NAME
       libpfm_intel_ivbep_unc_ubo - support for Intel Ivy Bridge-EP U-Box uncore PMU

SYNOPSIS
       #include <perfmon/pfmlib.h>

       PMU name: ivbep_unc_ubo
       PMU desc: Intel Ivy Bridge-EP U-Box uncore PMU

DESCRIPTION
       The library supports the Intel Ivy Bridge system configuration unit (U-Box) uncore PMU.  This PMU model only exists on Ivy Bridge model 62.

MODIFIERS
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Ivy Bridge U-Box uncore PMU:

       e      Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a state transition from no occurrence of the event to at least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with a threshold modifier
              (t) with a value greater or equal to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       t      Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the counter counts the number of HA cycles in which the number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to the threshold.  This
              is an integer modifier with values in the range [0:15].
