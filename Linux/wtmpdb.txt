NAME
       wtmpdb - display login, logout and reboot information

SYNOPSIS

       wtmpdb COMMAND [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       wtmpdb displays the content of the wtmp login and boot times database and provides sub-commands for system scripts to create boot and shutdown entries and otherwise manipulate the wtmp database.

       This command is year 2038-safe and uses sqlite3 to store the information.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

       last [option...] [username...] [tty...]
           wtmpdb last goes through the /var/log/wtmp.db database (or the database designated by the -f option) and displays a list of of all users logged in and logged out. The output can be restricted
           to different patterns via various options. If one or more usernames and/or ttys are given wtmpdb last will only show the entries matching those arguments.

           The login and logout times of the special user reboot are the boot and shutdown times of the system.

           -a, --hostlast
               Display hostnames in the last column.

           -d, --dns
               Translate IP addresses into a hostname.

           -f, --file FILE
               Use FILE as wtmpdb database.

           -F, --fulltimes
               Display full times and dates.

           -i, --ip
               Translate hostnames to IP addresses.

           -n, --limit N, -N
               Display only the first N entries.

           -p, --present TIME
               Display who was present at TIME.

               Don't display any hostname or IP address.

           -S, --service
               Display PAM service used to login.

           -s, --since TIME
               Print only records more recent than TIME.

               times and dates, and iso will display times in ISO-8601 format.

           TIME must be in the format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS", "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS", "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM", "YYYY-MM-DD", "HH:MM:SS", "HH:MM", "now", "today", "yesterday" or "tomorrow" (time will be set to
