NAME
       pfstmo_mai11 - Tone-mapping for backward-compatible compression

SYNOPSIS
       pfstmo_mai11 [--verbose][--quiet] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a tone-mapping operator that is optimized to give the best performance for images or video that are encoded using a backward-compatible compression, such as HDR-JPEG, or HDR-MPEG. The images
       produced by this operator do not need to be visually pleasing. The details on the operator can be found in:

              Mai, Z., Mansour, H., Mantiuk, R., Nasiopoulos, P., Ward, R., & Heidrich, W.

              Optimizing a tone curve for backward-compatible high dynamic range image and video compression.

       If you find this TMO useful in your research project, please cite the paper above.

       The result of this TMO does not require gamma correction.

OPTIONS
       --verbose, -v
              Print additional information during program execution.

       --quiet, -q
