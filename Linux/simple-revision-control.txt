NAME
       src - simple revision control

SYNOPSIS
       src [command] [revision-spec] ['file'...]

DESCRIPTION
       SRC (or src) is simple revision control, a version-control system for single-file projects by solo developers and authors. It modernizes the venerable RCS, hence the anagrammatic acronym. The
       design is tuned for use cases like all those little scripts in your ~/bin directory, or a directory full of single-file HOWTOs.

       SRC revision histories are single, human-readable files beneath a hidden .src subdirectory in the directory where they live. There may be multiple histories under one directory; SRC treats them as
       separate projects, and history files can be moved elsewhere at any time.

       SRC gives you simple, consecutive integer revision numbers. It supports tags and branching. It records commit timestamps, but does not show committer information, because the committer is always
       you. The command set is intended to look familiar if you have ever used Subversion, Mercurial, or Git.

       SRC is lightweight and fast. It uses two small self-contained executables, with no libraries and no complications.

       SRC interprets the EDITOR variable in the usual way, using it to spawn an editor instance when you perform a commit or amend. If EDITOR is not set it has a fallback list of editors it looks for,
       beginning with various ways to invoke Emacs and vi.

       SRC is fully supported in Emacs VC mode.

COMMAND SUMMARY
       A "revision" is a 1-origin integer, or a tag name designating an integer revision, or a branch name designating the tip revision of its branch. Revision numbers always increase in commit-date
       order.

       A revision range is a single revision, or a pair of revisions "M-N" (all revisions numerically from M to N) or "M..N" (all revisions that are branch ancestors of N and branch successors of M).

       If SRC complains that your revision spec looks like a nonexistent filename, you can prefix it with "@" (this is always allowed). "@" by itself means the current (checked-out) revision.

       A filename can be a path. In that case SRC will behave as though it were running in the lowest-level directory on the path and called with the path basename.

       Unless otherwise noted under individual commands, the default revision is the tip revision on the current branch and the default range is all revisions on the current branch.

       The token "--" tells the command-line interpreter that subcommands, switches, and revision-specs are done - everything after it is a filename, even if it looks like a subcommand or revision
       number.

       src help ['command']
           Displays help for commands.

       src commit [-|-m 'string'|-f 'file'|-e|-b branch] ['file'...]
           Enters a commit for specified files. Separately to each one. A history is created for the file if it does not already exist. With '-', take comment text from stdin; with '-m' use the following
           string as the comment; with '-f' take from a file. With '-e', edit even after '-', '-f' or '-m'. "ci" is a synonym for "commit". With '-b', set the named branch to check in to (it must exist);
           that branch becomes the default for commits.

       src amend [-|-m 'string'|-f 'file'|-e] ['revision'] ['file'...]
           Amends the stored comment for a specified revision, defaulting to the latest revision on the current branch. Flags are as for commit. "am" is a synonym for "amend".

       src checkout ['revision'] ['file'...]
           Refresh the working copy of the file(s) from their history files. "co" is a synonym for "checkout".

       src cat ['revision'] ['file'...]
           Send the specified revision of the files to standard output.

       src status [-a] ['file'...]
           "A" = added, "=" = unmodified, "M" = modified, "!" = missing, "?" = not tracked, "I" = ignored, "L" = locked (recover with "src checkout"). The "A" and "L" statuses should only occur if you
           have used RCS directly on a file. Normally "?" and "I" files are not listed; this changes if you either give the '-a' switch or specify which files to look at. "st" is a synonym for "status".

       src tag [list|-l|create|-c|delete|del|-d] ['name'] ['revision'] ['file'...]
           List tags, create tags, or delete tags. Create/delete takes a revision, defaulting to the current branch tip. List defaults to all revisions.

       src branch [list|-l|create|-c|delete|del|-d] ['name'] ['file'...]
           List, create, or delete branches. When listing, the active branch is first in the list. The default branch is "trunk". Create/delete takes a singleton revision, defaulting to the current
           branch tip; on create, the branch becomes default for future commits. List defaults to all revisions, including 0 (the trunk root phantom revision).

       src rename ['tag'|'branch'] ['oldname'] ['newname']  ['file'...]
           Rename a tag or branch. Refuses to step on an existing symbol or rename a nonexistent one. "rn" is a synonym for "rename".

       src list [(-<n>|-l <n>)] [-f 'fmt'] ['revision-range'] ['file'...]
           Sends summary information about the specified commits to standard output. The summary line tagged with "*" is the state that the file would return to on checkout without a revision-spec. See
           'help list' for information about custom formats. Use '-<n>' or '-l <n>', where <n> is a number, to limit the listing length. Default range is the current branch, reversed. "li" is a synonym
           for "list".

       src log [-v] [(-<n>|-l <n>)] [(-p|-u|-c) [-b|-w]] ['revision-range'] ['file'...]
           Sends log information about the specified commits to standard output. Use '-<n>' or '-l <n>', where <n> is a number, to limit the listing length. Default range is the current branch, reversed.
           The '--patch', '-p' or '-u' option additionally sends a unified-format diff listing to standard output for each revision against its immediate ancestor revision; '-c' emits a context diff
           instead. When generating a diff, '-b' ignores changes in whitespace, and '-w' ignores all whitespace. Histories imported via 'fast-import' (when not using its '-p' option) have RFC-822-style
           headers inserted into the log comment to preserve metadata not otherwise representable in SRC, such as distinct author and committer identifications and dates. These headers are normally
           suppressed by 'log', however, '-v' shows a summarized view of important headers; '-v -v' shows all headers as-is.

       src diff [(-u|-c) [-b|-w]] ['revision-range'] ['file'...]
           Sends a diff listing to standard output. With no revision spec, diffs the working copy against the last version checked in. With one revno, diffs the working copy against that stored revision;
           with a range, diff between the beginning and end of the range. The actual difference generation is done with diff(1). The default diff format is '-u' (unified), but if you specify a '-c'
           option after the verb a context diff will be emitted. '-b' ignores changes in the amount of whitespace, and '-w' ignores all whitespace. "di" is a synonym for "diff".

       src ls
           List all registered files.

       src visualize
           Emit a DOT visualization of repository structures. To use this, install the graphviz package and pipe the output to something like "dot -Tpng | display -". "vis" is a synonym for "visualize".

       src move 'old' 'new'
           Rename a workfile and its history. Refuses to step on existing workfiles or histories. "mv" is a synonym for "move".

       src copy 'old' 'new'
           Copy a file and its master. Refuses to step on existing files or masters. "cp" is a synonym for "copy".

       src fast-export ['revision-range'] ['file'...]
           Export one or more projects as a Git fast-import stream. For a history originally imported from elsewhere, author and committer identification is gleaned from the RFC-822-style headers
           inserted into the commit comment by 'fast-import' (if its '-p' option was not used). Otherwise, this information is copied from your Git configuration.

       src fast-import [-p] ['files'...]
           Parse a git-fast-import stream from standard input. The modifications for each individual file become separate SRC histories. Mark, committer and author data, and mark cross-references to
           parent commits, are preserved in RFC-822-style headers on log comments unless the '-p' (plain) option is given, in which case this metadata is discarded. Give arguments to restrict the files
           imported.

       src release ['file'...]
           Release locks on files. This is never necessary in a normal workflow, which will be repeated edit-commit cycles, but it may be handy if you have to interoperate with other tools that expect
           RCS masters to be in their normal (unlocked) state.

       src srcify
           Move a directory from being RCS- or SCCS-managed to being SRC-managed. That is: if the current directory contains an RCS directory, rename it to .src (but leave any SCCS directory in place).
           Then check out all masters for editing that are not already checked out.

       src version
           Report the versions of SRC, the underlying Python, and the RCS or SCCS back end.

       The omission of "src remove" is a deliberate speed bump.

       If no files are specified, all eligible files are operated on in sequence.

NOISE CONTROL
       Silence is golden. When you have selected only one file to operate on, and the command is not a report generator ('status', 'cat', 'log', 'list', 'fast-export', the listing modes of 'tag' and
       'branch', 'ls') you will see a reply only if the operation failed.

       Other commands ('commit', 'checkout', tag creation and deletion) give you a success message per file when operating on multiple files, so you will not be in doubt about which operation succeeded.
       This behavior can be suppressed with the '-q' option, placed 'before' the subcommand word.

       If your directory contains a file named ".srcignore", each line that is neither blank nor begins with a "#" is interpreted as an ignore pattern. It is expanded with glob(3), and files in the
       expansion are omitted from 'src status' - unless the file is named as an argument, of the status command, in which case its status is "I". Thus, for example, a line reading "*.html" will cause all
       files with an HTML extension to be omitted from the output of "src status", but the output of 'src status *' will list them with status "I".

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       SRC history files are (normally) RCS master files. SRC maintains no permanent state other than these files.

       In order to maintain complete backwards compatibility, one other compromise was made: any commit comment containing a string exactly matching an RCS log delimiter (a long string of "-" characters)
       will be rejected as malformed.

       The RCS back end will be automatically selected when there is an .src or RCS subdirectory. If both these directories exist, SRC will operate on .src and preserve the RCS directory; in this case it
       will be a little extra verbose to leave no doubt about what it is doing.

       You can explicitly select the RCS back end by making the first command keyword on the src command line be 'rcs'. This should only be necessary when your working directory contains two or more of
       the subdirectories .src, RCS, and SCCS.

       If your directory has both a .src and an unrelated RCS directory you can force SRC to work on the RCS directory and ignore .src by giving it the option "-S RCS".

       By default, history files are kept in a hidden subdirectory named .src. But if you have an RCS subdirectory and no .src, SRC will quietly operate on the files in the RCS directory in a completely
       backward-compatible way.

WORKING WITH SCCS
       Using SCCS as a back end is also supported, with some limits due to missing features in SCCS implementations:

       •   All commands relating to tags and branches throw an error in the SCCS back end.

       •   In CSSC SCCS, src cat does not necessarily pipe out binary data correctly. This has been fixed in the SunOS and Schilling versions.

       •   The CSSC SCCS, the exec bit is not propagated between master and workfile. This has been fixed in the SunOS and Schilling versions.

       •   The CSSC and SunOS SCCS backends have a Y2.1K problem that SRC cannot effectively work around and will probably not be fixed. The Schilling version has repaired this. To be on the safe side,
           do not use the SCCS backend after the year 2067.

       The SCCS back end will be automatically selected when there is an SCCS subdirectory and no .src or RCS subdirectory.

       You can explicitly select the SCCS back end by making the first command keyword on the src command line be 'sccs'. This should only be necessary when your working directory contains none or two or
       more of the subdirectories .src, RCS, and SCCS.

       Working with SCCS requires an SCCS subdirectory; SRC will quietly create one, if required, then operate on the files in the SCCS directory in a completely backward-compatible way.

       Fast-import to SCCS is not supported.

       The SCCS mode is not recommended unless you have a specific need to work with legacy SCCS repositories. Up-converting them to something less Paleolithic (e.g. with sccs2rcs(1) or reposurgeon(1))
       would be a better idea; in truth, the SCCS support exists mainly because it’s hilarious (for obscure hacker values of 'hilarious').

DEBUGGING OPTIONS
       These will be of interest mainly to developers. They must go before the subcommand.

       A '-d' (debug) option before the main command word turns on debugging messages. Just one "-d" gives you complete visibility about what commands the back end is running and what (if any) diagnostic
       output they ship. It can be repeated for higher debugging levels that expose more of src’s internal computation.

       A '-L' option sets a log file to which debug output should be written  Without this option it is written to standard error.

       A '-S' (sandbox) option can be used to set the repository directory to something other than its default of .src. Use "-S RCS" to make src operate on an RCS directory even if there is already a
       .src directory.

       A '-T' option sets up an artificial clock that ticks once on each revision and fixes the user information to be used in 'fast-export'; It also attributes all commits to "J. Random Hacker". It is
       for regression testing.

REQUIREMENTS
       SRC is written in Python and requires 2.7 or later; it will run under Python 3.x for x > 2.

       If you wish to use the RCS support (recommended), the RCS tools at version 5.7 or later must be installed and accessible in your $PATH.

       If you wish to use the SCCS support, some implementation of SCCS must be accessible. GNU’s CSSC (Compatibly Stupid Source Control) will work; so will the SunOS and Schilling forks of AT&T SCCS.

       The rcs-fast-import(1) tool at version 1.3 or later is required to support the 'src fast-import' command.

       SRC will die gracefully with a useful error message when it fails due to a missing back end.

LIMITATIONS
       SRC will unconditionally bail out if a directory named RCS-save exists. This is because in order to be able to use .src when an unrelated RCS subdirectory is also present, SRC has to play a game
       of three-directory monte. Before doing its work it moves RCS to RCS-save, then moves .src to RCS; after doing its work it moves RCS to .src and RCS-save to RCS. If there is a pre-existing RCS-save
       this maneuver can’t be done. If you trip over such a pre-exiting RCS-save, this probably means SRC previously underwent a hard crash and you will have to reshuffle these directories by hand. No
       bug that can produce such a crash has yet been reported.

       The directory shuffle also means that running more than one SRC edit session on the same directory at the same time may produce mysterious failures. Don’t do this - it is way outside the tool’s
       intended performance envelope.

       Branch deletions change the revision numbers of revisions downstream of the branch join.

       In src fast-export dumps of repositories with tags, branch labels may not exactly match what git fast-export would emit.

       In both RCS and SCCS revision numbers normally looked like "1.n" for n starting at 1 and monotonically increasing. It was possible to check in a change with a higher release number (for example,
       "2.1"), though this was seldom done. If you use SRC to view or edit an ancient master that used this feature, commands using ranges and named branches will not always work as expected.
