NAME
       ipmidetect - list detected and/or undetected IPMI interfaces in a cluster

SYNOPSIS
       ipmidetect [OPTION...] [NODES...]

DESCRIPTION
       ipmidetect lists which IPMI nodes have been detected or undetected in a cluster.  This information is provided by the libipmidetect(3) library and ipmidetectd(8) daemon.

       ipmidetect  will  output the status of each IPMI node configured with ipmidetectd(8) unless they are specified on the command line. If the first node listed is "-", nodes will be read in from standard
       input. The nodes can be listed in hostrange format, comma separated lists, or space separated lists. See the section below on HOSTRANGED SUPPORT for instructions on how to list hosts in range  format.
       The hostnames listed must be the shortened names of hostnames.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help and exit

       -v, --version
              Print version and exit

       -o STRING, --hostname=STRING
              server hostname (default=localhost)

       -p INT, --port=INT
              server port (default=8649)

       -d, --detected
              List only detected nodes

       -u, --undetected
              List only undetected nodes

       -q, --hostrange
              List nodes in hostrange format (default)

       -c, --comma
              List nodes in comma separated list

       -n, --newline
              List nodes in newline separated list

       -s, --space
              List nodes in space separated list

HOSTRANGED SUPPORT
       Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma separated lists of hosts or a range of hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc. The later form should not
       be confused with regular expression character classes (also denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.

       This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could  be  specified
       as such, or by the range foo[1,9].

       Some examples of range usage follow:
           foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
           foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
           foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3

       As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([ and ]) for pattern matching. Depending on your shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The  exit  value  of  ipmidetect  depends on the options performed on the command line. If the default output is used, the exit value will be 0 if the command succeeds without error. If the --detected
       option is used and no undetected nodes have been discovered, the exit value will be 0. If undetected nodes are found, the exit value will be 1. If the --undetected option is used and no detected nodes
       have been discovered, the exit value will be 0. If detected nodes are found, the exit value will be 1. On errors, the exit value will be 2.
