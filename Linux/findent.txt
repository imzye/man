WFINDENT(1)                                                                                    User Commands                                                                                    WFINDENT(1)

NAME
       wfindent - Indents, converts and relabels Fortran program sources

SYNOPSIS
       wfindent [OPTION]... [-] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Wfindent is a wrapper for findent(1), calling findent for each of the files. The files are overwritten by the modified version. A sanity check is made before overwriting an input file.  Files that
       are not regular and readable and writable are silently skipped.

NOTE
       The end of the options is reached when a flag containing a '.'  (e.g. 'prog.f90') is found, or when the flag '-' is found.

       See 'man 1 findent' or 'findent -h' for the options. Only options that create a (probably modified) version of the input are effective.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable FINDENT influences the working of wfindent.  If set, wfindent will use this as the location of findent.

EXAMPLE:
       wfindent -i4 *.f90
