NAME
       compute-tools - Manage systemd-nspawn containers

DESCRIPTION
       "[A Linux container] is an operating-system-level virtualization environment for running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single Linux
       control host."
            — Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC)

       compute-tools provides the system integration for managing containers using systemd-nspawn.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
       •   This version of compute-tools currently do not work with systemd-networkd and depend on ifupdown.

       •   Using overlay, the upper directory can not be an NFS mount due to limitations in Linux' overlay filesystem, see
           https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt

USAGE
       Create a new container:
           sudo container create -n NAME

       Start a container:
           sudo container start -n NAME

       Stop a container:
           sudo container stop -n NAME

       Remove a container:
           sudo container remove -n NAME

       List container on the system:
           sudo container list

       Show container version:
           container version

       See container(1) for a list of all container commands.
