NAME
       spinner - Sends small packets over a idle link

SYNOPSIS
       spinner [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Spinner  is an anti-idle program that displays a little "spinning" ASCII character in the top left corner of your terminal.  spinner is useful for keeping telnet and ssh links from dropping due to
       inactivity. Many firewalls, and some ISPs drop connections when they are perceived as idle. By having spinner running the server is constantly sending a tiny amount of data over the link, preserv‐
       ing the connection.
