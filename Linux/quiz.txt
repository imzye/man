QUIZ(6)                        BSD Games Manual                        QUIZ(6)

NAME
     quiz — random knowledge tests

SYNOPSIS
     quiz [-t] [-i file] [question answer]

DESCRIPTION
     The quiz utility tests your knowledge of random facts.  It has a database
     of subjects from which you can choose.  With no arguments, quiz displays
     the list of available subjects.

     The options are as follows:

     -t      Use tutorial mode, in which questions are repeated later if you
             didn't get them right the first time, and new questions are pre‐
             sented less frequently to help you learn the older ones.

     -i      Specify an alternative index file.

     Subjects are divided into categories.  You can pick any two categories
     from the same subject.  quiz will ask questions from the first category
     and it expects answers from the second category.  For example, the com‐
     mand “quiz victim killer” asks questions which are the names of victims,
     and expects you to answer with the cause of their untimely demise,
     whereas the command “quiz killer victim” works the other way around.

     If you get the answer wrong, quiz lets you try again.  To see the right
     answer, enter a blank line.

   Index and Data File Syntax
     The index and data files have a similar syntax.  Lines in them consist of
     several categories separated by colons.  The categories are regular ex‐
     pressions formed using the following meta-characters:

           pat|pat  alternative patterns
           {pat}    optional pattern
           [pat]    delimiters, as in pat[pat|pat]pat

     In an index file, each line represents a subject.  The first category in
     each subject is the pathname of the data file for the subject.  The re‐
     maining categories are regular expressions for the titles of each cate‐
     gory in the subject.

     In data files, each line represents a question/answer set.  Each category
     is the information for the question/answer for that category.

     The backslash character (``\'') is used to quote syntactically signifi‐
     cant characters, or at the end of a line to signify that a continuation
     line follows.

     If either a question or its answer is empty, quiz will refrain from ask‐
     ing it.

FILES
     /usr/share/bsd-games//quiz  The default index and data files.

BUGS
     quiz is pretty cynical about certain subjects.
