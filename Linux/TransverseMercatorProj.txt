NAME
       TransverseMercatorProj -- perform transverse Mercator projection

SYNOPSIS
       TransverseMercatorProj [ -s | -t ] [ -l lon0 ] [ -k k0 ] [ -r ] [ -e a
       f ] [ -w ] [ -p prec ] [ --comment-delimiter commentdelim ] [ --version
       | -h | --help ] [ --input-file infile | --input-string instring ] [
       --line-separator linesep ] [ --output-file outfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Perform the transverse Mercator projections.  Convert geodetic
       coordinates to transverse Mercator coordinates.  The central meridian
       is given by lon0.  The longitude of origin is the equator.  The scale
       on the central meridian is k0.  By default an implementation of the
       exact transverse Mercator projection is used.

       Geodetic coordinates are provided on standard input as a set of lines
       containing (blank separated) latitude and longitude (decimal degrees or
       degrees, minutes, seconds); for detils on the allowed formats for
       latitude and longitude, see the "GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES" section of
       GeoConvert(1).  For each set of geodetic coordinates, the corresponding
       projected easting, x, and northing, y, (meters) are printed on standard
       output together with the meridian convergence gamma (degrees) and scale
       k.  The meridian convergence is the bearing of grid north (the y axis)
       measured clockwise from true north.

OPTIONS
       -s  use the sixth-order Krueger series approximation to the transverse
           Mercator projection instead of the exact projection.

       -t  use the exact algorithm with the "EXTENDED DOMAIN"; this is the
           default.

       -l lon0
           specify the longitude of origin lon0 (degrees, default 0).

       -k k0
           specify the scale k0 on the central meridian (default 0.9996).

       -r  perform the reverse projection.  x and y are given on standard
           input and each line of standard output gives latitude, longitude,
           gamma, and k.

       -e a f
           specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, a and the
           flattening, f.  Setting f = 0 results in a sphere.  Specify f < 0
           for a prolate ellipsoid.  A simple fraction, e.g., 1/297, is
           allowed for f.  By default, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used, a =
           6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563.  If the exact algorithm is used, f
           must be positive.

       -w  on input and output, longitude precedes latitude (except that on
           input this can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, N, S, E,
           W).

       -p prec
           set the output precision to prec (default 6).  prec is the number
           of digits after the decimal point for lengths (in meters).  For
           latitudes and longitudes (in degrees), the number of digits after
           the decimal point is prec + 5.  For the convergence (in degrees)
           and scale, the number of digits after the decimal point is prec +
           6.

       --comment-delimiter commentdelim
           set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g., "#" or "//").  If
           set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if
           found, the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior
           to processing and subsequently appended to the output line
           (separated by a space).

       --version
           print version and exit.

       -h  print usage and exit.

       --help
           print full documentation and exit.

       --input-file infile
           read input from the file infile instead of from standard input; a
           file name of "-" stands for standard input.

       --input-string instring
           read input from the string instring instead of from standard input.
           All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a
           semicolon) in instring are converted to newlines before the reading
           begins.

       --line-separator linesep
           set the line separator character to linesep.  By default this is a
           semicolon.

       --output-file outfile
           write output to the file outfile instead of to standard output; a
           file name of "-" stands for standard output.

EXTENDED DOMAIN
       The exact transverse Mercator projection has a branch point on the
       equator at longitudes (relative to lon0) of +/- (1 - e) 90 = 82.636...,
       where e is the eccentricity of the ellipsoid.  The standard convention
       for handling this branch point is to map positive (negative) latitudes
       into positive (negative) northings y; i.e., a branch cut is placed on
       the equator.  With the extended domain, the northern sheet of the
       projection is extended into the south hemisphere by pushing the branch
       cut south from the branch points.  See the reference below for details.

EXAMPLES
          echo 0 90 | TransverseMercatorProj
          => 25953592.84 9997964.94 90 18.40
          echo 260e5 100e5 | TransverseMercatorProj -r
          => -0.02 90.00 90.01 18.48

ERRORS
       An illegal line of input will print an error message to standard output
       beginning with "ERROR:" and causes TransverseMercatorProj to return an
       exit code of 1.  However, an error does not cause
       TransverseMercatorProj to terminate; following lines will be converted.

HISTORY
       TransverseMercatorProj was added to GeographicLib,
       <https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io>, in 2009-01.  Prior to version
       1.9 it was called TransverseMercatorTest (and its interface was
       slightly different).
