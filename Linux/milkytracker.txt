NAME
       milkytracker, milkycli - music creation tool inspired by Fast Tracker 2

SYNOPSIS
       milkytracker [options] [input]
       milkycli [options] [input]

DESCRIPTION
       milkytracker  is a multi-platform music application for creating .MOD and .XM module files. It attempts to recreate the module replay and user experience of the popular DOS program FastTracker II,
       with special playback modes available for improved Amiga ProTracker 2/3 compatibility.

       The program can be used both interactively through its graphical interface or in headless mode for converting module files to wave files.

       milkycli is a minimal version of milkytracker for that only allows conversion options and implies the the -headless option.
