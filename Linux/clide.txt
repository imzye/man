NAME
       clide - color and style highlighting program for text

SYNOPSIS
       clide [options] [file1] [file2] [...fileN]

       | clide [options] (STDIN through pipe)

       clide [options] (STDIN. Use Ctrl-D to finish input)

DESCRIPTION
       clide is a program that allows you to colorize and add various display
       altering attributes to text based on search patterns and expressions.
       Currently the focus is on creating ANSI color and style escape codes
       for use in terminal displays.

OPTIONS
         -h, --help - Show some terse help for the program

         -e, --expression <expression>,<attributes>
             Examples:
                -e /searchpattern/,fg=red,bold
                -e HTMLTAG,fg=blue,bg=yellow

         -d, --definitionfile <file>

         -f, --expressionfile <file>

         --highlight, --hl <word1>[,word2,word3,...] - Quickly highlight
            the words given in the comma seperated list of words.

         --highlightattributes, --ha <attribute1>[,attribute2,attribute3,...]
                 The default attributes used by the highlight option.
                 This option uses the same comma seperate values taht
                 can be defined in an normal expression.

         --listcolors - Show a list of foreground and background colors
                        that can be used.

         --liststyles - Show a list of styles that can be used (not all
                        of which may work on your display)

         --listdefinitions - Show a list of predefined search expressions

         --reverseprecedence, -r - Reverse the precedence order in which
                        expressions are run through.

         --wf, --warmfuzzy "<message>" -
                       Send the developer a short message to let him know that you like this program.

EXAMPLES
   FILE ARGUMENTS
       One way to utilize clide is to process the contents of a file or
       multiple files. This is done simply by passing the files as arguments
       after the other options you wish to specify for matching expressions:

        clide -e HTMLTAG,fg=yellow index.html

   PIPELINES
       Another way to use clide is by passing the output of one program into
       it.  You are sending the standard output (STDOUT) of one program to the
       standard input (STDIN) of clide.  Like this command that sends the
       output of ls through clide, which colors lines that are directory
       entries:

        ls -l | clide -e /^d.*/,fg=blue,bold

   SHELL ESCAPING
       If you are creating more complex search patterns, you are probably
       going to need to put quotes around the whole argument that is passed to
       a -e option.  This is because your shell will interpret certain
       characters like (, ), $, &, [, ], etc.  For example, this command uses
       an expression that will change the percentage display of a filesystem
       to red if it is 94% or more:

        df -h | clide -e "/(100|9[4-9])%/,fg=red,bold"

       But because ( ) is used in most shells as a subshell sequence, you have
       to put quotes around the whole expression so that its not processed by
       your shell.

EXPRESSIONS
       Expressions can be specified on the command line using one or more -e
       options.  You can also use the -f option one or more times to specify
       premade expression files.

   QUICK HIGHLIGHTING
       If you're in a hurry and don't want to come up with an expression for
       matching words or characters that you'd like to highlight, you can use
       the --highlight option along with a comma seperated list of values you
       want to match. Like this:

         clide --highlight car,truck,boat insurance-readme.txt

       By default clide will highlight these words in yellow.  you can
       override this with the --highlightattributes option, specifying what
       you want in the same way you would pass attribute arguments in a -e
       argument.

       You can use the --highlight option in combination with -e of -f
       options, but the expressions will be applied after the expressions
       specified with -e or -f.

   PERL REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       clide works by passing the expression that you specify into a PERL
       matching operator. This means that you can pass almost any valid PERL
       regular expression to clide and it should work as expected.

       The only limitation is in what flags you can pass to the search.
       Currently, you can only pass a 'i' (case insensitive) and/or a 'g'
       (global search) flag to the search expression. The multiline flag 'm'
       is not supported.

       For more information about perl regular expressions, see the pcre(1)
       man page.

   REGULAR EXPRESSION SEARCH
       The basic way to tell clide what text you want to affect is to use the
       regular expression search operator.  This is passed to the -e option
       along with a command seperated list of attributes to set.

        clide -e /failed/i,fg=yellow,bg=red,bold

       The above expression searches for the word failed (using the i option
       after the second / means make the search case insensitive). It will
       change the word failed to have a foreground color of bold yellow
       (bright) and a background color of red.

   PREDEFINED SEARCH PATTERNS
       A list of helpful predefined search patterns is included with clide to
       make pattern matching easier for the user. A list of the patterns is
       available by running clide with the --listdefinitions option.  You can
       also put your own definitions in files and use the -f option to include
       them.

       Using a predefined search expression is simply a matter of using its
       name for the first part of the -e argument, like this:

        clide -e HOSTNAME,bold logfile.txt

       WARNING: Predefined search patterns MUST use all uppercase names.  In
       the future clide may have other expression functions that start with
       lower case letters and there needs to be a way to differentiate between
       a pattern definition and an operation.

FILE FORMATS
       NOTE: The author would like to encourage you to put your expression and
       definition files in a directory called .clide in your home directory.
       Future versions of clide may make it easier to use these files if you
       have them located in such a named directory.

   EXPRESSION FILE
       The expression file is pretty simple, you put each expression one per
       line in exactly the same way that you would pass it to the -e option.
       expression definitions can be used as the expressions themselves are
       parsed after all the predefined expressions are read in.  You can
       include these files using the -f option.

       So an expression file called microblogging might look like this:

        HTMLTAG,fg=red,bg=black
        URL,fg=yellow,bold,underline
        TWITTERGROUP,fg=blue,bold
        # Highlight some of my MB account names
        /@(mkrenz|climagic|suso)/,fg=yellow,bg=blue,bold
        TWITTERMENTION,fg=cyan
        IDENTICAGROUP,fg=blue,bold

       Then you'd use it like this:

        twidge lsrecent | clide -f ~/.clide/microblogging

       Comments can be made using a # character at the beginning of the line.

   DEFINITION FILE
       The definition file has a bit more of a format to it. Each line has two
       columns seperated by whitespace. The first column is the name of the
       definition in all uppercase letters. The second column is the search
       expression starting with a forward slash and terminated by a forward
       slash and one or more pcre flags (i or g)

        # These are IPs I'm watching out for.
        INTERESTINGIPS /\b(3\.14\.159\.26|206\.97\.64\.[29]|10\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3})\b/g
        # Words I care about.
        LOGINWORDS /(error|failed|failure|success|successful)/gi

       Then just include the file using -d for each file you want to include.

       Note that you don't need to escape or backslash as much in the searches
       when you put them in a file as compared with when you specify the
       pattern on the command line. Keep this in mind if you copy and paste
       your expressions into a file.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Because one expression matching will actually alter the line in order
       to add the escape sequences, matching expressions that are run later
       may not match what the user expects them to match because the string
       has changed.  This is going to be fixed in a future release.

       Currently clide can only work on 7-bit ASCII text. If it encounters a
       line with upper 8-bit (binary) characters, it will simply print the
       line with out doing any processing on it. If you're really curious as
       to why, you can read the comments in the code or ask the author. A
       future version of clide may not have this limitation.

       Most terminal emulators and the console itself have some limitations as
       to what they can display.  Most of them don't support blinking text,
       only some support dark mode, etc. This is not a limitation of clide, it
       is your terminal software.

       clide doesn't support multiline matching at this time.

WARMFUZZY
       If you like clide, you should let the author know by sending a short
       message using the --warmfuzzy option, like this:

        clide --warmfuzzy "I like clide"

       This option makes an HTTP request to a website that will in turn let
       the author know what you thought.

       I included this option because I think that open source projects need
       an easier way for users to give the developers a little reward for
       their efforts.
