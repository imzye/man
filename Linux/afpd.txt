AFPD(8)                             3.1.12                             AFPD(8)

NAME
       afpd - Apple Filing Protocol daemon

SYNOPSIS
       afpd [-d] [-F configfile]

       afpd -v | -V | -h

DESCRIPTION
       afpd provides an Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) interface to the Unix file
       system. It is normally started at boot time by netatalk(8).

       @pkgconfdir@/afp.conf is the configuration file used by afpd to
       determine the behavior and configuration of a file server.

OPTIONS
       -d
           Specifies that the daemon should not fork.

       -v
           Print version information and exit.

       -V
           Print verbose information and exit.

       -h
           Print help and exit.

       -F configfile
           Specifies the configuration file to use. (Defaults to
           @pkgconfdir@/afp.conf.)

SIGNALS
       To shut down a user's afpd process it is recommended that SIGKILL (-9)
       NOT be used, except as a last resort, as this may leave the CNID
       database in an inconsistent state. The safe way to terminate an afpd is
       to send it a SIGTERM (-15) signal and wait for it to die on its own.

       SIGTERM and SIGUSR1 signals that are sent to the main afpd process are
       propagated to the children, so all will be affected.

       SIGTERM
           Clean exit. Propagates from master to childs.

       SIGQUIT
           Send this to the master afpd, it will exit leaving all children
           running! Can be used to implement AFP service without downtime.

       SIGHUP
           Sending a SIGHUP to afpd will cause it to reload its configuration
           files.

       SIGINT
           Sending a SIGINT to a child afpd enables max_debug logging for this
           process. The log is sent to the file /tmp/afpd.PID.XXXXXX. Sending
           another SIGINT will revert to the original log settings.

       SIGUSR1
           The afpd process will send the message "The server is going down
           for maintenance." to the client and shut itself down in 5 minutes.
           New connections are not allowed. If this is sent to a child afpd,
           the other children are not affected. However, the main process will
           still exit, disabling all new connections.

       SIGUSR2
           The afpd process will look in the message directory configured at
           build time for a file named message.pid. For each one found, a the
           contents will be sent as a message to the associated AFP client.
           The file is removed after the message is sent. This should only be
           sent to a child afpd.
