NAME
       ynew — yakuake tab launcher.

SYNOPSIS
       ynew COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       ynew launches a new tab in yakuake, setting a name for it.
       For example, we can ssh into a server called "alfio" and have the session into a yakuake tab named "alfio". Or we can have "top" running in a tab named "top".
       When calling ynew with a command name that doesn't exist yet, an editor is opened to write the script. For example "exec ssh alfio".
       The successive times a new yakuake tab is created and the command is executed into that tab.
