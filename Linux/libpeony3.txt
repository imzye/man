Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::DollarAB(3pm)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation                  Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::DollarAB(3pm)

NAME
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Community::DollarAB - Don't use $a or $b as variable names outside sort

DESCRIPTION
       The special variables $a and $b are reserved for "sort()" and similar functions which assign to them to iterate over pairs of values. These are global
       variables, and declaring them as lexical variables with "my" to use them outside this context can break usage of these functions. Use different names for
       your variables.

         my $a = 1;                  # not ok
         my $abc = 1;                # ok
         sort { $a <=> $b } (3,2,1); # ok

AFFILIATION
       This policy is part of Perl::Critic::Community.

CONFIGURATION
       This policy can be configured to allow $a and $b in additional functions, by putting an entry in a ".perlcriticrc" file like this:

         [Community::DollarAB]
         extra_pair_functions = pairfoo pairbar
