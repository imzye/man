NAME
       e_ltb_runner - manual page for e_ltb_runner 2.6-DEBUG Floral Guranse

SYNOPSIS
       e_ltb_runner [options] [Batchfile] [PATH_TO_EPROVER]

DESCRIPTION
       e_ltb_runner 2.6-DEBUG "Floral Guranse"

       Read a CASC LTB batch specification file and process it.

OPTIONS
       -h

       --help

              Print a short description of program usage and options.

       -V

       --version

              Print the version number of the prover. Please include this with all bug reports (if any).

       -v

       --verbose[=<arg>]

              Verbose  comments  on the progress of the program. This differs from the output level (below) in that technical information is printed to stderr, while the output level determines which logical
              manipulations of the clauses are printed to stdout. The short form or the long form without the optional argument is equivalent to --verbose=1.

       -o <arg>

       --output-file=<arg>

              Redirect output into the named file.

       -d <arg>

       --output-dir=<arg>

              Directory for individual problem output files. Default is the current working directory.

       --variants27

              Handle different variants for each problem base name as required for CASC-27. This is very specific hack.

       --variants28

              Handle different variants for each problem base name as required for CASC-28. This is very specific hack. Note that this requires eprover-ho for the third variant.

       -i

       --interactive

              For each batch file, enter interactive mode after processing batch the batch problems. Interactive mode allows the processing of additional jobs with respect to the loaded axioms set. Jobs  are
              entered via stdin and print to stdout.

       -s

       --silent

              Equivalent to --output-level=0.

       -l <arg>

       --output-level=<arg>

              Select  an  output  level, greater values imply more verbose output. Level 0 produces nearly no output, level 1 will output each clause as it is processed, level 2 will output generating infer‐
              ences, level 3 will give a full protocol including rewrite steps and level 4 will include some internal clause renamings. Levels >= 2 also imply PCL2 or TSTP formats  (which  can  be  post-pro‐
              cessed with suitable tools).

       -w <arg>

       --wtc-limit=<arg>

              Set the global wall-clock limit for each batch (if any).

REPORTING BUGS
       Report bugs to <schulz@eprover.org>. Please include the following, if possible:

       * The version of the package as reported by eprover --version.

       * The operating system and version.

       * The exact command line that leads to the unexpected behaviour.

       * A description of what you expected and what actually happend.

       * If possible all input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
