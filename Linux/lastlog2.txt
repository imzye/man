NAME
       lastlog2 - displays date of last login for all users or a specific one

SYNOPSIS
       lastlog2 [options]

DESCRIPTION
       lastlog2 displays the content of the last login database. The login-name, last-login-time, tty and remote-host will be printed. The default (no flags) causes all last login entries to be printed,
       sorted by the order as written the first time into the database.

       Compared to lastlog this command is Y2038 safe and uses sqlite3 to store the information and not a sparse file.
