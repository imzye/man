NAME
       perlconsole - light program that lets you evaluate Perl code interactively.

COPYRIGHT

DESCRIPTION
       Perl Console is a small program that implements a Read-eval-print loop: it lets you evaluate Perl code interactively.

       It uses Readline to grab input, and provides completion with all the namespaces loaded during your session. It allows you to load a module in your session and test a function exported by it.

COMMANDS
       It's possible to interact with the console with internal commands. The following commands are supported in this version:

       :help display the interactive help screen
       :quit quit the console
       :set set a preference (see PREFERENCES).

RCFILE
       PerlConsole will look for a rcfile located in your home directory called: ~/.perlconsolerc

       Every line in that file will be evaluated as if they were issued in the console.  You can then load there your favorite modules, or even define your preferences.

       Example of a valid ~/.perlconsolerc

           :set output = dumper
           use Date::Calc;

PREFERENCES
       Preferences can be set with the :set command. The following preferences are supported in this version:

       output changes the output of evaluated code

       For details about commands, ype :help <command> within the console.
