NAME
       acl2 - A Computational Logic

SYNOPSIS
       acl2

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the acl2 command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has
       documentation in the GNU  Info  format  as  well  as  in  html  format.   These  are  included  in  the  acl2-doc  package.   The  documentation  can  also  be  found  at  the  project's  website,
       http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2, both in html form and in postscript.
