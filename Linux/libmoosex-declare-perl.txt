NAME
       MooseX::Declare::Syntax::EmptyBlockIfMissing - Handle missing blocks after keywords

VERSION
       version 0.43

DESCRIPTION
       The MooseX::Declare::Syntax::NamespaceHandling role will require that the consumer handles the case of non-existent blocks. This role will inject an empty block with only the generated code parts
       in it.

METHODS
   handle_missing_block
         Object->handle_missing_block (Object $context, Str $body, %args)

       This will inject the generated code surrounded by "{ ... }" into the code where the keyword was called.
