NAME
       drbd - The start and stop script for DRBD

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/init.d/drbd [resource] {{start} | {stop} | {status} | {reload} | {restart} | {force-reload}}

INTRODUCTION
       The /etc/init.d/drbd script is used to start and stop drbd on a system V style init system.

       In order to use /etc/init.d/drbd you must define a resource, a host, and any other configuration options in the drbd configuration file. See /etc/drbd.conf for details. If resource is omitted, then
       all of the resources listed in the config file are configured.

       This script might ask you “Do you want to abort waiting for other server and make this one primary?”

       Only answer this question with “yes” if you are sure that it is impossible to repair the other node.

VERSION
       This document was revised for version 8.4.11 of the DRBD distribution.
