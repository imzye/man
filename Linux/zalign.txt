NAME
       zalign - parallel local alignment of biological sequences

SYNOPSIS
       zalign [-s scores] [-S split] [-H hblk] [-V vblk] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       zAlign  is  a  local  sequence  aligner,  especially intended for use with large biological DNA sequences, with more than 1Mbp (Millions of base pairs). It uses the Smith-Waterman exact algorithm with
       affine gap cost function to perform this task.

   General options:
       -h     display this help and exit

       -s <scores>
              specify a comma-separated list of scores to be used while calculating aligment matrices throughout the program. The list must be in the format "-sMATCH,MISMATCH,GAP_OPEN,GAP_EXTENSION" (without
              quotes), and is parsed in this PRECISE order; no spaces are allowed between values. If there are any unspecified parameters, these are set to default values and a warning message is issued; ex‐
              ceeding parameters are discarded

   Stage 2 options:
       -S <split>
              (mpialign only) number of parts in which to split the alignment matrix; after this step a cyclic block model is applied, subdividing each part equally between all available nodes

       -H <hblk>
              (mpialign only) number of horizontal subdivisions made by each node to its alignment submatrix; since this value defines block width, a good choice should allow two full matrix lines to fit the
              processor's cache pages, improving algorithm performance

       -V <vblk>
              (mpialign  only)  number  of vertical subdivisions made by each node to its alignment submatrix; this value directly affects the amount of internode communication and is used ONLY if 'split' is
              set to 1, otherwise it is set to the number of available nodes
