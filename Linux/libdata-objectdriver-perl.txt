NAME
       Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::Cache::Memcached - object driver for caching objects with memcached

SYNOPSIS
           package MyObject;
           use base qw( Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject );

           __PACKAGE__->install_properties({
               ...
               driver => Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::Cache::Memcached->new(
                   cache    => Cache::Memcached->new({ servers => \@MEMCACHED_SERVERS }),
                   fallback => Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::DBI->new( @$DBI_INFO ),
               ),
               ...
           });

DESCRIPTION
       Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::Cache::Memcached provides automatic caching of retrieved objects in your memcached servers, when used in conjunction with your actual object driver.

USAGE
       •   Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::Cache::Memcached->new( %params )

           Required members of %params are:

           •   "cache"

               The "Cache::Memcached" instance representing your pool of memcached servers.  See Cache::Memcached.

           •   "fallback"

               The "Data::ObjectDriver" object driver from which to request objects that are not found in your memcached servers.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The  memcached  driver  provides  integration with the "Data::ObjectDriver" debug and profiling systems. As these systems are designed around SQL queries, synthetic queries are logged to represent
       memcached operations. The operations generated by this driver are:

       •   "MEMCACHED_ADD ?"

           Put an item in the cache that was not there. The arguments are the cache key for the object and the flattened representation of the object to cache.

       •   "MEMCACHED_SET ?"

           Put an item in the cache with new member data. The arguments are the cache key for the object and the flattened representation of the object to cache.

       •   "MEMCACHED_DELETE ?"

           Remove an object from the cache. The argument is the cache key for the object to invalidate.

       •   "MEMCACHED_GET ?"

           Retrieve an object. The argument is the cache key for the requested object.

       •   "MEMCACHED_GET_MULTI ?"

           Retrieve a set of objects. The arguments are the cache keys for the requested objects.
