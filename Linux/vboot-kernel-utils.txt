NAME
       futility - Unified firmware utility

SYNOPSIS
       futility [options] COMMAND [args...]

DESCRIPTION
       futility is the unified firmware utility, which will eventually replace most of the distinct verified boot tools formerly produced by the vboot_reference package.

       When  symlinked  under  the  name of one of those previous tools, it should fully implement the original behavior. It can also be invoked directly as futility, followed by the original name as the
       first argument.

       Global options:

       --vb1  Use only vboot v1.0 binary formats

       --vb21 Use only vboot v2.1 binary formats

       --debug
              Be noisy about what's going on

       The following commands are built-in:

       create Create a keypair from an RSA .pem file

       dump_fmap
              Display FMAP contents from a firmware image

       dump_kernel_config
              Prints the kernel command line

       gbb_utility
              Manipulate the Google Binary Block (GBB)

       help   Show a bit of help (you're looking at it)

       load_fmap
              Replace the contents of specified FMAP areas

       pcr    Simulate a TPM PCR extension operation

       show   Display the content of various binary components

       sign   Sign / resign various binary components

       vbutil_firmware
              Verified boot firmware utility

       vbutil_kernel
              Creates, signs, and verifies the kernel partition

       vbutil_key
              Wraps RSA keys with vboot headers

       vbutil_keyblock
              Creates, signs, and verifies a keyblock

       verify Verify the signatures of various binary components

       version
              Show the futility source revision and build date

       Use "futility help COMMAND" for more information.
