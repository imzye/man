NAME
       picard - next generation MusicBrainz tagging application (written in pyQT4)

SYNOPSIS
       picard

DESCRIPTION
       picard is the next generation MusicBrainz tagging application.
       This new tagging concept is album oriented, as opposed to track oriented like the others taggers are.

OPTIONS
       picard has no command line options. However if you start Picard from the command line with a list of files as arguments, Picard will start with the listed files in the "to be tagged" pane.
