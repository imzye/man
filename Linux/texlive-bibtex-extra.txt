SYNOPSIS
       bib2gls [option]+ auxfile

DESCRIPTION
       bib2gls is designed to work with the glossaries-extra LaTeX package. (The record package option is required.) The application performs two functions in one: (1) selects entries from .bib files
       according to information found in the auxfile (similar to bibtex); (2) hierarchically sorts entries and collates location lists (similar to makeindex and xindy). The .aux extension may be omitted
       from auxfile.

       The auxfile (and corresponding .log file) should either be in the current directory or in the directory specified by --dir. Bib files can either be relative to the directory the auxfile is in or
       in a location that can be found by kpsewhich.

OPTIONS
       --aux-input-action setting
           Determines what to do when bib2gls encounters "\@input" in the aux file. The setting may be one of:

           follow
               Follow the reference (that is, input the file as usual).

           skip-after-bibglsaux (or skip after bibglsaux)
               Follow the reference for each "\@input" encountered until "\@bibgls@input" is encountered, after which skip all remaining instances of "\@input" (default).

           skip
               Skip all instances of "\@input" (but not "\@bibgls@input" which is always followed).

           The "\@bibgls@input" command will be in the aux file if the package option "bibglsaux" has been used.

       --break-space
           Interpret "~" (tilde) character and "\nobreakspace" as a normal space.

       --cite-as-record
           Treat "\citation" as an ignored record.

       --collapse-same-location-range
           Collapse an explicit range that has a duplicate start and end location into a normal record (default).

       --custom-packages list
           Instruct the TeX parser library to attempt to parse the packages listed in list. This is intended for simple custom packages that don't contain complex code.

       --datatool-sort-markers
           The interpreter will use the datatool-base.sty marker commands to match their localised definitions within "\DTLsortwordlist" (datatool v3.0+).  You will need a sort method that doesn't ignore
           the control characters used by those commands.

       --date-in-header (or -D)
           The header comment at the start of the .glstex file will include the file modification date.

       --debug [n]
           Switch on the debug mode at the given setting n, which should be a non-negative integer. If n is 0 then the debug mode is switched off. If omitted, n is set to 1, which corresponds to
           --debug-mode io. Any positive number will enable all of bib2gls's debugging messages. The amount of TeX Parser Library debugging messages depends on bitwise operation of n.

       --debug-mode setting
           May be used instead of --debug where the level number is difficult to remember. The setting may be a comma-separated list of any of the keywords:

           all Highest level (likely to result in a large transcript file). Equivalent to switching on all settings.

           catcode
               TeX Parser category code changes.

           cs  TeX Parser command definitions.

           decl
               TeX Parser declarations.

           expansion
               TeX Parser expansions (may result in a large transcript file).

           expansion-list
               TeX Parser stack expansions (may result in a large transcript file).

           expansion-once
               TeX Parser one-level expansions.

           expansion-once-list
               TeX Parser one-level list expansions.

           io  TeX Parser I/O operations (open, close and fetch token).

           popped
               TeX Parser stack popping.

           process
               TeX Parser macro process (may result in a large transcript file).

           process-generic-cs
               TeX Parser generic command process.

           process-stack
               TeX Parser stack process (may result in a large transcript file).

           process-stack-list
               TeX Parser detailed stack process (may result in a large transcript file).

           read
               TeX Parser codepoint read from file (likely to result in a large transcript file).

           sty-data
               TeX Parser data (typically relates to internal objects that don't have an analogous TeX macro). This includes data gathered from the aux file.

           For example: "bib2gls --debug-mode io,catcode,sty-data mydoc"

       --default-encoding name
           Set the default character encoding for input and output files.  If omitted, the JVM default encoding is assumed.

       --dir directory (or -d <directory>)
           Files are relative to directory. (This doesn't change the current working directory.)

       --expand-fields
           Don't write "\glsnoexpandfields" to the .glstex file.

       --force-cross-resource-refs or -x
           Force cross-resource referencing mode on.

       --group or -g
           Add group field to entries.

       --help or -h
           Display help message and exit.

       --ignore-packages list (or -k list)
           Don't parse the log file for the packages listed in list. Note that --packages overrides this option, so if the same package is listed in both --ignore-packages and --packages then the
           interpreter will check if it's supported. This option has a cumulative action. Only known packages may be included in list.

       --interpret
           Use the TeX Parser Library to interpret known (La)TeX commands (default).

       --list-known-packages
           Lists all the packages that have are known to the TeX parser library and then exits (with exit code 0). Any of the listed packages may be used in --packages or --ignore-packages.

       --locale lang (or -l lang)
           Use language resource file for lang (which should be an IETF locale tag).

       --log-encoding name
           Set the character encoding for the log files (which may not be the same as the encoding for the document LaTeX files).

       --log-file file (or -t <file>)
           Set the transcript file.

       --merge-nameref-on rule
           Rule for merging locations created with the record=nameref package option (requires glossaries-extra.sty version 1.37+). The rule may be one of: hcounter, href, title or location.

       --merge-wrglossary-records
           Merge an entry's wrglossary records for the same page locations.  (For use with the indexcounter package option.)

       --mfirstuc-math-protection
           Switch on the auto-insertion of an empty group for math-shift ("$").

           If mfirstuc v2.08+, glossaries v4.50+ and glossaries-extra v1.49+ are detected, the default will be --no-mfirstuc-math-protection as there should no longer be any need for this protection.

       --mfirstuc-protection fields|all (or -u fields|all)
           Insert an empty group if fields start with certain problematic commands to protect against case-changing commands like "\Gls".

           The default is to do this for all fields.  To do this for only a subset of fields, set fields to a comma-separated list of fields (e.g. name,short,long).  The keyword all indicates all fields.

           If mfirstuc v2.08+, glossaries v4.50+ and glossaries-extra v1.49+ are detected, the default will be --no-mfirstuc-protection as there should no longer be any need for this protection.

       --nested-link-check list|none
           Check each field listed in list for potentially problematic nested link text. (Default list: name, text, plural, first, firstplural, short, shortplural, long, longplural, symbol).

           If none, disable check.

       --no-break-space
           Interpret "~" (tilde) and "\nobreakspace" as a non-breaking space (default).

       --no-cite-as-record
           Don't check for instances of "\citation" in the .aux file (default).

       --no-collapse-same-location-range
           Don't collapse an explicit range that has a duplicate start and end location into a normal record.

       --no-datatool-sort-markers
           The interpreter will use the normal definition of the datatool-base.sty sort marker commands.

       --no-date-in-header
           The header comment at the start of the .glstex file will not include the file modification date (default).

       --no-debug (or --nodebug)
           Switch off debug mode. (Equivalent to --debug 0)

       --no-expand-fields
           Write "\glsnoexpandfields" to the .glstex file (default).

       --no-force-cross-resource-refs
           Don't force cross-resource referencing mode on (default).

       --no-group
           Don't add group field to entries (default).

       --no-interpret
           Don't try interpreting (La)TeX commands. The TeX Parser Library will still be used to parse the aux and bib files.

       --no-merge-wrglossary-records
           Don't merge an entry's wrglossary records.

       --no-mfirstuc-math-protection
           Switch off the auto-insertion of an empty group for math-shift ("$").

       --no-mfirstuc-protection
           Switch off the auto-insertion of an empty group for all fields.

       --no-nested-link-check
           Don't check for potentially problematic nested link text.  (Equivalent to --nested-link-check none)

       --no-obey-aux-catcode
           Ignore category code changing commands encountered in the aux file.

       --no-provide-glossaries
           Don't write "\provideignoredglossary*" to the .glstex file to provide unknown glossaries except in documented situations (master, secondary and trigger-type resource options).  This setting is
           the default.

       --no-record-count
           Don't add record count field to entries (default).  This option automatically implements --no-record-count-unit.

       --no-record-count-unit
           Don't add unit record count field to entries (default).

       --no-replace-quotes
           Don't replace quote characters (default).

       --no-retain-formats
           Normal location merging rules apply (default).

       --no-support-unicode-script
           Text superscript ("\textsuperscript") or subscripts ("\textsubscript") won't be converted to Unicode superscript/subscript characters.  For example, "\textsuperscript{2}" will be converted to
           "<sup>2</sup>" and the markup will be stripped leaving just the character 2.

       --no-trim-fields
           Don't trim leading and trailing spaces from fields (default).  This option cancels --trim-only-fields and --trim-fields.

       --no-verbose (or --noverbose)
           Switch off verbose mode. (Some messages will still be written to STDOUT.)

       --no-warn-non-bib-fields
           Don't warn if internal non-bib fields are found in the .bib file.  The use of these internal fields can cause unexpected results, so only use this option if you have taken appropriate
           precautions.

       --no-warn-unknown-entry-types
           Don't warn if any unknown entry types are found in the .bib file.

       --obey-aux-catcode
           Obey known category code changing commands encountered in the aux file.

       --packages list (or -p list)
           Instruct the TeX parser library to pretend the packages listed in list have been used by the document. Note that there's only a limited number of packages supported by the TeX parser library.
           This option has a cumulative action so --packages wasysym,pifont is the same as --packages wasysym --packages pifont.

           You can find out the list of supported packages with --list-known-packages.

       --provide-glossaries
           Write "\provideignoredglossary*" to the .glstex file to provide unknown glossaries.

       --quiet (or -q)
           Only display error messages. All other messages are just written to the transcript file.

       --record-count or -c
           Add record count fields to entries.

       --record-count-rule rule or -r rule
           Sets the rule used by --record-count and --record-count-unit.  This option automatically implements --record-count.

           The rule may be: "all" or "a" (count all records), "non-ignored" or "n" (count all non-ignored records), "f/"regex"/" (only count records where the format matches the regular expression
           regex), "c/"regex"/" (only count records where the counter name matches the regular expression regex), or "f/"regex1"/c/"regex2"/"op (only count records where the format matches the regular
           expression regex1 and/or the counter name matches the regular expression regex2). The op part is optional. If present it may be one of: "and" (format AND counter must match), "or" (format OR
           counter must match). If op is omitted, AND is assumed.

       --record-count-unit or -n
           Add unit record count fields to entries.  This option automatically implements --record-count.

       --replace-quotes
           Replace single and double quote characters ("'" and """) with "\bibglsaposchar" and "\bibglsdoublequotechar" in field values and group information written to the .glstex file.

       --retain-formats list
           Indicates which location formats should always be retained even if it causes a partial duplicate. Only exact duplicates will be merged.

       --shortcuts option
           Check for the shortcut commands when searching for dependencies.  Permitted values of option: acronyms (or acro), ac, abbreviations (or abbr), all (or true), none (or false). This overrides
           the setting given in auxfile.

       --map-format key:value[,key:value]* (or -m key:value[,key:value]*)
           Set location format mappings.

       --silent
           Only display error messages. All other messages are just written to the transcript file. (Synonym of --quiet.)

       --support-unicode-script
           Text superscript ("\textsuperscript") or subscripts ("\textsubscript") will use Unicode superscript/subscript characters if available.  For example, "\textsuperscript{2}" will be converted to
           U+00B2 (superscript two).

       --tex-encoding name
           Set the character encoding for the glstex files. This overrides the setting given in auxfile.

       --trim-except-fields list
           Trim leading and trailing spaces from all fields except those listed.  This option is cumulative but is cancelled by --trim-fields and --no-trim-fields. This option may not be used with
           --trim-only-fields.

       --trim-fields
           Trim leading and trailing spaces from all fields.  This option cancels --trim-only-fields and --no-trim-fields.

       --trim-only-fields list
           Trim leading and trailing spaces from only the listed fields.  This option is cumulative but is cancelled by --trim-fields and --no-trim-fields. This option may not be used with
           --trim-except-fields.

       --verbose
           Switch on verbose mode.

       --version or -v
           Display version information and exit.

       --warn-non-bib-fields
           Warn if internal non-bib fields are found in the .bib file.

       --warn-unknown-entry-types
           Warn if any unknown entry types are found in the .bib file.
