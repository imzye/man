NAME
       gplanarity — simple puzzle game involving untangling planar graphs

SYNOPSIS
       gplanarity

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       gplanarity is a simple puzzle game involving untangling planar graphs for fun and prizes. If you tend to get addicted to cute little math puzzles, this one is a doozy.

       It  is  a  super-clone  of  the flash Planarity game written by John Tantalo. The original Planarity ran well in IE and Firefox on other platforms, but was slow and liked to lock up or abort under
       Linux browsers.

       gplanarity implements gameplay identical to the original Planarity but adds some UI and game extras around the basic game such as multiple board  generation  algorithms,  puzzle  boards,  complete
       backing state, group select/drag and so on.

OPTIONS
       This program does not take any command line options.
