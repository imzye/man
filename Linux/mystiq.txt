SYNOPSIS
       mystiq [file1 [file2]] ...

DESCRIPTION
       MystiQ  is  a GUI for FFmpeg [#ffmpeg]_, a command line media converter. FFmpeg can read audio and video files in various formats and convert them into other formats.  For example, you can convert
       video downloaded from the Internet into audio files for your mobile phone.

       MystiQ comes with a set of predefined presets to help you quickly convert media files without having to know the details. These presets defines what arguments should be passed to *ffmpeg* for each
       output format. In case you want to adjust the details (bitrate, audio volume, etc.), MystiQ lets you edit conversion parameters for each individual task.
