NAME
       xc - portable IRAF compile/link utility

SYNOPSIS
       xc [flags] files...

DESCRIPTION
       XC is a machine independent utility for compiling and linking IRAF tasks or files.  The XC utility may also be used to compile and/or link non-IRAF files and tasks. It can be used to generate for‐
       tran  from  xpp or ratfor code, to compile any number of files, and then link them if desired.  XC accepts and maps IRAF virtual filenames, but since it is a standalone bootstrap utility the envi‐
       ronment is not passed, hence logical directories cannot be used.

       It is suggested that everyone stick with the iraf virtual file name extensions.  These are : .x, .r, .f, .c, .s, .o, .a, .e. The meaning of these is:

            .x   SPP code
            .r   Ratfor code
            .f   Fortran code
            .c   C code
            .s   Macro assembler code
            .o   Object module
            .a   Library file
            .e   Executable Image

       XC is available both in the CL and as a standalone task.  Usage is equivalent in either case.

FLAGS
       -c     Tells xc not to link, i.e., not to create an executable.

       -d     Causes debug messages to be printed during execution.

       -F, -f Do not delete the Fortran translation of an SPP source file.

       -h     Causes the executable to be linked as a host program, i.e., without the IRAF main and without searching the IRAF libraries, unless explicitly referenced on the command line.  Used  to  com‐
              pile and link host (e.g., Fortran) programs which may or may not reference the IRAF libraries.

       -H     Link a host program as with "-h", but include the VOS libraries.

       -A     Force architecture specific include files.

       -C     Link a host program which has a C main.  We may need to tweak the command line as a special case here since we normally assume Fortran sources.

       -/flag, -//foo
              Pass flag to host compiler without further interpretation. "-/flag" becomes "-foo", "-//foo" becomes "foo".

       -Ddefine
              Pass a -Ddefine flag on to the host compiler.

       -Idir  Pass a -Idir flag on to the host compiler.  A special case is "-Inolibc" which disables automatic inclusion of the IRAF LIBC includes (hlib$libc).

       -llib, -Ldir
              This  tells the linker which library files or library directories besides the standard ones to include.  These must be either on the current directory, or in an IRAF system library (lib$ or
              hlib$).  The library specification must be immediately after the option as in "-lxtools".  No other option may follow the 'l' option in the same argument as in -lxtoolsO.

       -N     Generates the output temp file in /tmp during the link, then moves it to the output directory in one operation when done.  For cases such as linking in an NFS-mounted directory,  where  all
              the NFS i/o may slow the link down excessively.

       -Nh [filename]
              This tells xpp that the foreign definitions in the file specified should be used in preference to standard include files.

       -o     This flag redirects the output of the compile if used in conjunction with -c option or specifies where the executable or object is to be placed.  If not given the first file name is used to
              obtain the name for the executable or object.

       -O     Optimize object code produced; this is now the default, but this switch is still provided for backwards compatibility.

       -p pkgname
              Load  the  package  environment for the named external package, e.g., "xc -c -p noao file.x".  If the same package is always specified the environment variable or logical name PKGENV may be
              defined at the host level to accomplish the same thing.  The package name must be specified when doing software development in an external or layered package.

       -q     Disable optimization.  Opposite of -O.  Object code will be optimized by default.

       -w     Suppress warnings. Forwarded to the compiler and linker.

       -x     Compile and link for debugging.

       -z, -e, -t, -T, -s
              Ignored. Provided for backward compatibility.

       -V     Print XC version identification.
