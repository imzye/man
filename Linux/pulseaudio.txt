NAME
       default.pa - PulseAudio Sound Server Startup Script

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.config/pulse/default.pa

       /etc/pulse/default.pa

       /etc/pulse/system.pa

DESCRIPTION
       The  PulseAudio  sound  server  interprets  a  configuration  script  on  startup,  which is mainly used to define the set of modules to load. When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and ~/.con‐
       fig/pulse/default.pa exists, that file is used. When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and that file doesn't exist, /etc/pulse/default.pa is used. When PulseAudio  runs  as  a  system  service,
       /etc/pulse/system.pa is used.

       The script should contain directives in the PulseAudio CLI language, as documented in pulse-cli-syntax(5).
