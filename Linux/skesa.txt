NAME
       skesa - strategic Kmer extension for scrupulous assemblies

DESCRIPTION
       SKESA  is a DeBruijn graph-based de-novo assembler designed for assembling reads of microbial genomes sequenced using Illumina.  Comparison with SPAdes and MegaHit shows that SKESA produces assem‐
       blies that have high sequence quality and contiguity, handles low-level contamination in reads, is fast, and produces an identical assembly for the same input when assembled  multiple  times  with
       the same or different compute resources. SKESA has been used for assembling over 272,000 read sets in the Sequence Read Archive at NCBI and for real-time pathogen detection.
