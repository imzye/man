NAME
       autoupdate2.13 - updates an old configure.in file to version 2

SYNOPSIS
       autoconf2.13 [ --help | -h ] [ --macrodir=dir | -m dir ] [ --version ]

DESCRIPTION
       The autoupdate2.13 program updates a configure.in file that calls Autoconf macros by their old names to use the current macro names.  In version 2 of Autoconf, most of the macros were renamed to use a
       more uniform and descriptive naming scheme.  Although the old names still work , you can make your configure.in files more readable and make it easier to use the current Autoconf documentation if  you
       update  them  to  use the new macro names.  If given no arguments, autoupdate2.13 updates configure.in, backing up the original version with the suffix ~ (or the value of the environment variable SIM‐
       PLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX, if that is set).  If you give autoupdate2.13 an argument, it reads that file instead of configure.in and writes the updated file to the standard output.

       autoconf2.13 accepts the following options:

       --help

       -h     Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       --macrodir=DIR

       -m DIR Look for the installed macro files in directory DIR.  You can also set the AC_MACRODIR environment variable to a directory; this option overrides the environment variable.

       --version
              Print the version number of Autoconf and exit.
