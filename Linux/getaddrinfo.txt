NAME
       "getaddrinfo" - command-line tool to "getaddrinfo(3)" resolver

SYNOPSIS
       getaddrinfo [options...] host service

DESCRIPTION
       This tool provides a convenient command-line wrapper around the
       getaddrinfo(3) resolver function. It will perform a single lookup and
       print the returned results in a human-readable form. This is mainly
       useful when debugging address resolution problems, because it allows
       inspection of the getaddrinfo(3) behaviour itself, outside of any real
       program that is trying to use it.

OPTIONS
       --host, -H HOST
               Hostname to resolve. If not supplied, will use the first
               positional argument

       --service, -S SERVICE
               Service name or port number to resolve. If not supplied, will
               use the second positional argument.

       -4      Restrict to just "AF_INET" (IPv4) results

       -6      Restrict to just "AF_INET6" (IPv6) results

       --stream
               Restrict to just "SOCK_STREAM" results

       --dgram Restrict to just "SOCK_DGRAM" results

       --proto PROTO
               Restrict to just results of the given IP protocol

       --passive
               Set the "AI_PASSIVE" hint; results will used to bind() and
               listen() rather than connect()

       --canonical
               Retrive the canonical name for the requested host

       --help  Display a help summary and exit

OUTPUT FORMAT
       Each line of output will be given in a form that indicates the four
       result fields of "ai_family", "ai_socktype", "ai_protocol" and
       "ai_addr". The first three are printed in the form of a socket(2) call,
       either symbolically or numerically, and the latter is printed as a
       plain string following it. For example

        socket(AF_INET , SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) + '127.0.0.1:80'
