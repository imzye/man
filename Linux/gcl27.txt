NAME
       gcl27 - GCL Common Lisp interpreter/compiler

SYNOPSIS
       gcl27 [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  gcl27  is an implementation of a subset of the Common Lisp Ansi standard.  It is written in C and in Common Lisp, and is highly portable.   It includes those features in the original
       definition of Common Lisp, (Guy Steele version 1.), as well as some features from the proposed new standard.

       The best documentation is available in texinfo/info form, with there being three groups of information.  gcl27-si for basic common lisp descriptions, and features unique to gcl27 The gcl27-tk info
       refers to the connection with tk window system, allowing all the power of the tcl/tk interaction system to be used from lisp.  The third info file gcl27 details the Ansi standard for common  lisp,
       to  which  this subset tries to adhere.   It is highly recommended to write programs, which will be in the intersection of gcl27 and ansi common lisp.  Unfortunately the Ansi standard is huge, and
       will require a substantial effort, and increase in the size of gcl27, to include all of it.

       When gcl27 is invoked from the shell, the variable si::*command-args* is set to the list of command line arguments.  Various options are understood:

       -eval command
              Call read and then eval on the command passed in.

       --     Stop processing arguments, setting si::*command-args* to a list containing the arguments after the --.

       -load pathname
              Load the file whose pathname is specified after -load.

       -f [pathname]
              Open the file following -f for input (or use *standard-input* if not supplied), skip the first line, and then read and eval the rest of the forms in the file.   Replaces  si::*command-args*
              by the the list starting after -f switch.  This can be used as with the shells to write small shell programs:

       #!/usr/local/bin/gcl27.exe -f
       (format t "hello world ~a~%" (nth 1 si::*command-args*))

       The value si::*command-args* will have the appropriate value.  Thus if the above 2 line file is made executable and called foo then

       tutorial% foo billy
       hello world billy

       NOTE:   On many systems (eg SunOs) the first line of an executable script file such as: #!/usr/local/bin/gcl27.exe -f only reads the first 32 characters!   So if your pathname where the executable
       together with the '-f' amount to more than 32 characters the file will not be recognized.   Also the executable must be the actual large binary file, [or a link to it],  and  not  just  a  /bin/sh
       script.   In latter case the /bin/sh interpreter would get invoked on the file.

       Alternately one could invoke the file foo without making it executable:

       tutorial% gcl27 -f foo "from bill"
       hello world from bill

       -batch Do  not  enter  the command print loop.  Useful if the other command line arguments do something.  Do not print the License and acknowledgement information.  Note if your program does print
              any License information, it must print the GCL header information also.

       -dir   Directory where the executable binary that is running is located.  Needed by save and friends.  This gets set as si::*system-directory*

       -libdir
              -libdir /d/wfs/gcl27-2.0/

              would mean that the files like gcl27-tk/tk.o would be found by concatting the path to the libdir path, ie in /d/wfs/gcl27-2.0/gcl27-tk/tk.o

       -compile
              Invoke the compiler on the filename following -compile Other flags affect compilation.

       -o-file
              If nil follows -o-file then do not produce an .o file.

       -c-file
              If -c-file is specified, leave the intermediate .c file there.

       -h-file
              If -h-file is specified, leave the intermediate .h file there.

       -data-file
              If -data-file is specified, leave the intermediate .data file there.

       -system-p
              If -system-p is specified then invoke compile-file with the :system-p t keyword argument, meaning that the C init function will bear a name based on the name of the file, so that it may  be
              invoked by name by C code.

              This GNU package should not be confused with the proprietary program distributed by FRANZ, Inc.  Nor should it be confused with any public domain or proprietary lisp system.

              For anything other than program development, use of the lisp compiler is strongly recommended in preference to use of the interpreter, due to much higher speed.

AUTHORS
       The GCL system contains C and Lisp source files to build a Common Lisp system.  CGL is derived from Kyoto Common LISP (kcl), which was written in 1984 by T. Yuasa and M. Hagiya (working under Pro‐
       fessor R. Nakajima at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Kyoto University).  The AKCL system work was begun in 1987 by William Schelter at the University of Texas, Austin,  and con‐
       tinued through 1994.  In 1994 AKCL was released as GCL (GNU Common Lisp) under the GNU public library license.
