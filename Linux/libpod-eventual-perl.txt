NAME
       Pod::Eventual::Simple - just get an array of the stuff Pod::Eventual finds

VERSION
       version 0.094003

SYNOPSIS
         use Pod::Eventual::Simple;

         my $output = Pod::Eventual::Simple->read_file('awesome.pod');

       This subclass just returns an array reference when you use the reading methods.  The arrayref contains all the Pod events and non-Pod content.  Non-Pod content is given as hashrefs like this:

         {
           type       => 'nonpod',
           content    => "This is just some text\n",
           start_line => 162,
         }

       For just the POD events, grep for "type" not equals "nonpod"

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
