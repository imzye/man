NAME
       toga2 - toga2 is a UCI-only chess engine.

SYNOPSIS
       toga2

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the toga2 program.

       toga2 is an UCI-only chess engine.

       toga2  and  other  UCI  engines  can  be  used with XBoard or WinBoard (or other xboard-compatible interfaces) with the help of PolyGlot (UCI-to-xboard adapter). Another well known frontend is KDE
       knights, which has a UCI capable interface.

OPTIONS
       These program does NOT follow the usual GNU command line syntax, but can be fed with options with a personal config file which can be read by the polyglot helper software. The author himself  says
       "You are advised to skip this section unless you are completely crazy about computer chess." For a complete description of these UCI commands, see the readme files.
