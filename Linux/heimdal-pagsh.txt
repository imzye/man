PAGSH(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 PAGSH(1)

NAME
     pagsh — creates a new credential cache sandbox

SYNOPSIS
     pagsh [-c command-string] [-h | --help] [--version] [--cache-type=string]
           command [args...]

DESCRIPTION
     Supported options:

     -c command-string Executes command(s) contained in command-string.

     --cache-type=string

     -h, --help

     --version

     pagsh creates a new credential cache sandbox for the user to live in.  If
     AFS is installed on the computer, the user is put in a newly created
     Process Authentication Group (PAG).

     For Kerberos 5, the credential cache type that is used is the same as the
     credential cache type that was used at the time of pagsh invocation.  The
     credential cache type can be controlled by the option --cache-type.

EXAMPLES
     Create a new sandbox where new credentials can be used, while the old
     credentials can be used by other processes.
