NAME
       rolllog - DNSSEC-Tools utility to write messages to the DNSSEC rollover
       log file

SYNOPSIS
         rolllog -loglevel <level> <log_message>

DESCRIPTION
       The rolllog program writes log messages to the DNSSEC rollover log
       file.  rolllog does not actually write the messages itself; rather, it
       sends them to the rollerd rollover daemon to write the messages.
       rollerd keeps track of a logging level, and only messages of that level
       or higher are written to the log file.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized:

       -loglevel level
           Logging level of this message.  The valid levels are defined in
           rollmgr.pm(3).   This option is required.

       -help
           Display a usage message.

       -Version
           Displays the version information for rolllog and the DNSSEC-Tools
           package.
