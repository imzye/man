NAME
       isisd - an IS-IS routing engine for use with Quagga routing software.

SYNOPSIS
       isisd [ -dhv ] [ -f config-file ] [ -i pid-file ] [ -P port-number ] [ -A vty-address ] [ -u user ] [ -g group ]

DESCRIPTION
       isisd is a routing component that works with the Quagga routing engine.

OPTIONS
       Options available for the isisd command:

       -d, --daemon
              Runs in daemon mode, forking and exiting from tty.

       -f, --config-file config-file
              Specifies the config file to use for startup. If not specified this option will likely default to /usr/local/etc/isisd.conf.

       -g, --group group
              Specify the group to run as. Default is quagga.

       -h, --help
              A brief message.

       -i, --pid_file pid-file
              When isisd starts its process identifier is written to pid-file.  The init system uses the recorded PID to stop or restart isisd.  The likely default is /var/run/isisd.pid.

       -P, --vty_port port-number
              Specify the port that the isisd VTY will listen on. This defaults to 2608, as specified in /etc/services.

       -A, --vty_addr vty-address
              Specify the address that the isisd VTY will listen on. Default is all interfaces.

       -u, --user user
              Specify the user to run as. Default is quagga.

       -v, --version
              Print the version and exit.

FILES
       /usr/local/sbin/isisd
              The default location of the isisd binary.

       /usr/local/etc/isisd.conf
              The default location of the isisd config file.

       $(PWD)/isisd.log
              If the isisd process is config'd to output logs to a file, then you will find this file in the directory where you started isisd.

WARNING
       This man page is intended to be a quick reference for command line options. The definitive document is the Info file Quagga.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The isisd process may log to standard output, to a VTY, to a log file, or through syslog to the system logs. isisd supports many debugging options, see the Info file, or the source for details.
