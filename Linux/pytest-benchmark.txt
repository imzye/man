NAME
       pytest-benchmark - Tool for inspecting data from pytest benchmark fixture

DESCRIPTION
       pytest-benchmark [-h [COMMAND]] [--storage URI] [--netrc [NETRC]] [--verbose] {help, list or compare}

   commands:
       help

              Display help and exit.

       list

              List saved runs.

       compare

              Compare saved runs.

              The compare command takes almost all the --benchmark options from the pytest benchmark fixture, minus the prefix.  A complete list can be found in the documentation.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show help message and exit

       --verbose
              increase verbosity

       --netrc

       --storage

EXAMPLES
       pytest-benchmark compare ‘Linux-CPython-3.5-64bit/*‘

              Loads all benchmarks ran with that interpreter. Note the special quoting that disables your shell’s glob expansion.

       pytest-benchmark compare 0001

              Loads first run from all the interpreters.

       pytest-benchmark compare /foo/bar/0001_abc.json /lorem/ipsum/0001_sir_dolor.json

              Loads runs from exactly those files.
