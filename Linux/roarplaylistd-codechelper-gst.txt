NAME
       rpld-codec-helper - Codec helper script for RoarAudio PlayList Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       rpld-codec-helper

DESCRIPTION
       The RoarAudio PlayList Daemon is a daemon which manages playlists and can play files or streams from those lists using a RoarAudio Sound Server.

       This  program  is used internally by rpld to support codecs which are not supported by the sound server. Those formats are normally non-free ones. If you use
       recommended formats like Ogg Vorbis this seldom will be used.

       This program should never be called directly (by user).

       Functionality of this is not part of rpld to keep sources clean and to avoid depends on code with doubtful legal status.

OPTIONS
       This program does not have any options.

SEE ALSO
       rpld(1), RoarAudio(7).

HISTORY
