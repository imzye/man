              Logging settings for xrdp-chansrv(8)

       [SessionVariables]
              Environment variables for the session

       All  parameters and values (except for file names and paths) are case insensitive, and are described in detail below. If any parameter is specified more than once, the last entry will be used. Op‐
       tions specified outside their proper section will be ignored.

GLOBALS
       Following parameters can be used in the [Globals] section.

       ListenAddress=ip address
              xrdp-sesman listening address. If not specified, defaults to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces).

       ListenPort=port number
              xrdp-sesman listening port. If not specified, defaults to 3350.

       EnableUserWindowManager=[true|false]
              If set to 1, true or yes, this option enables user specific startup script. That is, xrdp-sesman will execute the script specified by UserWindowManager if it exists.

       UserWindowManager=filename
              Path of the startup script relative to the user's home directory. If present and enabled by EnableUserWindowManager, that script is executed instead of DefaultWindowManager.

       DefaultWindowManager=filename
              Full path or relative path of the default startup script used by xrdp-sesman to start a session.  If the path is not a full path, it will be resolved as relative path to /etc/xrdp.  If  not
              specified, defaults to /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh.

       ReconnectScript=filename
              Full  path or relative path if the script which executed when users reconnects to the existing session. If the path is not a full path, it will be resolved as relative path to /etc/xrdp. If
              not specified, defaults to /etc/xrdp/reconnectwm.sh.

LOGGING
       Following parameters can be used in the [Logging] and [ChansrvLogging] sections.

       LogFile=filename
              Log file path. It can be either absolute or relative. If not specified, defaults to ./sesman.log It is ignored in the [ChansrvLogging] section since the channel server creates one log  file
              per display and instead uses the following log file naming convention xrdp-chansrv.${DISPLAY}.log

       LogLevel=level
              This option can have one of the following values:

              CORE or 0 - Log only core messages. Those messages are logged regardless of the selected logging level.

              ERROR or 1 - Log only error messages.

              WARNING, WARN or 2 - Logs warnings and error messages.

              INFO or 3 - Log errors, warnings and informational messages.

              DEBUG or 4 - Log everything. If xrdp-sesman is compiled in debug mode, this options will output many more low-level messages.

       EnableSyslog=[true|false]
              If set to 1, true or yes, this option enables logging to syslog.

       SyslogLevel=level
              Logging level for syslog. It can have the same values as LogLevel.  Defaults to DEBUG.

       EnableConsole=[true|false]
              If set to 1, true or yes, this option enables logging to the console (ie. stdout).

       ConsoleLevel=level
              Logging level for the console. It can have the same values as LogLevel.  Defaults to DEBUG.

       EnableProcessId=[true|false]
              If set to 1, true or yes, this option enables logging the process id in all log messages. Defaults to false.

SESSIONS
       Following parameters can be used in the [Sessions] section.

       X11DisplayOffset=number
              The first X display number available for xrdp-sesman. This prevents xrdp-sesman from interfering with real X11 servers. If not specified, defaults to 10.

       MaxSessions=number
              Sets the maximum number of simultaneous sessions. If not set or set to 0, unlimited session are allowed.

       KillDisconnected=[true|false]
              If set to 1, true or yes, every session will be killed within DisconnectedTimeLimit seconds after the user disconnects.  This setting currently only works with xorgxrdp sessions.

       DisconnectedTimeLimit=number
              Sets the time limit for KillDisconnected to a value greater than 60.  Values less than 60 are to be overridden with 60.  This setting currently only works with xorgxrdp sessions.

       IdleTimeLimit=number
              Sets  the  time  limit  (in seconds) before an idle session is disconnected.  Idle means no keyboard inputs and no mouse moves/clicks here.  If set to 0, idle sessions will never be discon‐
              nected by timeout.  This works only with xorgxrdp sessions. Moreover, xorgxrdp must be v0.2.9 or later.

       Policy=[Default|UBD|UBI|UBC|UBDI|UBDC]
              Session allocation policy. Used to decide when to allocate a new session. Set to one of the following values:

              Default - session per <User,BitPerPixel>
              UBD - session per <User,BitPerPixel,DisplaySize>
              UBI - session per <User,BitPerPixel,IPAddr>
              UBC - session per <User,BitPerPixel,Connection>
              UBDI - session per <User,BitPerPixel,DisplaySize,IPAddr>
              UBDC - session per <User,BitPerPixel,DisplaySize,Connection>

              Note that the User and BitPerPixel criteria cannot be turned off. DisplaySize refers to the initial geometry of a connection, as actual display sizes can change dynamically.

SECURITY
       Following parameters can be used in the [Security] section.

       AllowRootLogin=[true|false]
              If set to 1, true or yes, enables root login on the terminal server.

       MaxLoginRetry=number
              The number of login attempts that are allowed on terminal server. If set to 0, unlimited attempts are allowed. If not specified, defaults to 3.

       TerminalServerUsers=group
              Only the users belonging to the specified group are allowed to login on terminal server. If unset or set to an invalid or non-existent group, login for all users is enabled.

       TerminalServerAdmins=group
              This option is currently ignored! Only members of this group can have session management rights.

       RestrictOutboundClipboard=[all|none|text|file|image]
              If set to all, will restrict the clipboard outbound from the server, to prevent data copied inside the xrdp session to be pasted in the client. Default value is none.  In addition, you  can
              control text/file/image transfer restrictions respectively. It also accepts comma separated list such as text,file,image.

              none - No restriction about copying inbound clipboard data.
              all - Restrict to copy inbound clipboard data.
              text - Restrict to copy only inbound text clipboard data.
              file - Restrict to copy only inbound file clipboard data.
              image - Restrict to copy only inbound image clipboard data.

              To keep compatibility, the following aliases are also available.
              true - an alias of all.
              false - an alias of none.
              yes - an alias of all.

       RestrictInboundClipboard=[none|all|text|file|image]
              If  set  to all, will restrict the clipboard inbound from the client, to prevent data copied inside the client to be pasted in the xrdp session. Default value is none.  In addition, you can
              control text/file/image transfer restrictions respectively. It also accepts comma separated list such as text,file,image.

              none - No restriction about copying inbound clipboard data.
              all - Restrict to copy inbound clipboard data.
              text - Restrict to copy only inbound text clipboard data.
              file - Restrict to copy only inbound file clipboard data.
              image - Restrict to copy only inbound image clipboard data.

              To keep compatibility, the following aliases are also available.
              true - an alias of all.
              false - an alias of none.
              yes - an alias of all.

       AlwaysGroupCheck=[true|false]
              If set to 1, true or yes, require group membership even if the group specified in TerminalServerUsers doesn't exist.

       AllowAlternateShell=[true|false]
              If set to 0, false or no, prevent usage of alternate shells by users.

X11 SERVER
       Following parameters can be used in the [X11rdp], [Xvnc] and [Xorg] sections.

       param=string
              Multiple param lines are supported. This first line specifies the path to the X11 server executable. Following lines specify command line arguments passed to the X11 server.

CHANSRV
       Following parameters can be used in the [Chansrv] section.

       FuseMountName=string
              Directory for drive redirection.  Created if it doesn't exist. If not specified, defaults to xrdp_client.  If first character is not a '/', this is relative to $HOME.

              If first character is a '/' this is an absolute path. The following substitutions are made in this string:-
                  %U - Username
                  %u - Numeric UID
                  %% - Percent character

              If this format is used:-

              1) The directory path permissions MUST be configured correctly by the system administrator or the system itself - xrdp-chansrv will not do this for you (although it will  create  the  final
                 directories owned by the user).

              2) The desktop may not automatically display a link for the redirected drive. To fix this, consult the docs for your chosen desktop.

       FileUmask=mode
              Additional umask to apply to files in the FuseMountName directory.  The default value of 077 prevents other users on the system from reading files on your redirected drives. This may not be
              appropriate for all environments, and so you can change this value to allow other users to access your remote files if required.

       EnableFuseMount=[true|false]
              Defaults to true.  Set to false to disable xrdp-chansrv's use of the FUSE system feature, even if it has been built with this feature enabled.

              Setting this value to false will disable the following application features:-

              -  drive redirection

              -  copying-and-pasting of files

       UseNautilus3FlistFormat=[false|true]
              Defaults to false.  Set to true to make file copy-paste compatible with Nautilus from GNOME 3 versions later than 3.29.92. Do not use this for any other reason.

              This setting will be removed in a later version of xrdp, when GNOME 3 is no longer supported.

SESSIONS VARIABLES
       All entries in the [SessionVariables] section are set as environment variables in the user's session.
