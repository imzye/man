NAME
       Module::Install::Substitute - substitute values into files before install

SYNOPSIS
           ... Makefile.PL ...
           substitute(
             {
               LESS => '/usr/bin/less',
               APXS => '/usr/bin/apxs2',
             },
             'bin/my-app'
           );

           ... bin/my-app ...
           ### after: my $less_path = '@LESS@';
           my $less_path = '/usr/bin/less';

DESCRIPTION
       Module::Install::Substitute is an extension for Module::Install system that allows you to substitute values into files before install, for example paths to libs or binary executables.

METHODS
   substitute {SUBSTITUTIONS} [{OPTIONS}] @FILES
       Takes a hash reference with substitutions key value pairs, an optional hash reference with options and a list of files to deal with.

       Options

       Several options are available:

       sufix
          Sufix for source files, for example you can use sufix ".in" and results of processing of Makefile.in would be written into file Makefile. Note that you don't need to specify sufixes in the list
          of files.

       from
          Source base dir. By default it's the current working directory (Cwd). All files in the list are treated as relative to this directory.

       to Destination base dir. By default it's the current working directory (Cwd).

       File format

       In the files the following constructs are replaced:

           ###\s*after:\s?some string with @KEY@
           some string with @KEY@

           some string with value
           ###\s*before:\s?some string with @KEY@

           ###\s*replace:\s?some string with @KEY@

       So string should start with three # characters followed by optional spaces, action keyword and some string where @SOME_KEY@ are substituted.

       This  module can replace lines after or before above constructs based on action keyword to allow you to change files in place without moving them around and to make it possible to run substitution
       multiple times.
