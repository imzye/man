NAME
       trev - opening trace files (part of staden package)

SYNOPSIS
       trev [-{ABI,ALF,EXP,SCF,PLN,Any}] [-edits value] [-editscf] [-xmag value] [-ymag value] [-restrict] [tracefilename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Trace  files can be opened either on the command line or from within Trev. In both cases it is possible to open several traces at once. In this case trev will add Next File, Previous File and Goto
       File buttons to allow quick navigation between traces.  On the command line, this is simply done by specifying several files.  With the "Open" dialogue from within trev multiple files may  be  se‐
       lected by dragging with the left mouse button or using shift+left button and control+left button to extend regions or to toggle loading of individual files.
