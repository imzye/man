NAME
       xmlpretty - XML pretty printer

SYNOPSIS
         xmlpretty [--options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       xmlpretty is the commandline interface to XML::Handler::YAWriter, acting as a tool to add and remove pretty printing to XML files.

       xmlpretty has several methods to add human readablitiy.

       If you want to add readablity without adding so-called ignorable whitespace, use it in the following way :

         $ xmlpretty --AddHiddenNewline \
                     --AddHiddenAttrTab \
                 --CatchEmptyElement \
                 uglyfile.xml > prettyfile.xml

       If you do not want to process the file further, but only want it human readable, add visible whitespace to the file as follows :

         $ xmlpretty --PrettyWhiteNewline \
                     --PrettyWhiteIndent \
                 --CatchEmptyElement \
                 uglyfile.xml > prettyfile.xml

       You may use YAWriter to clean whitespace from XML documents.  This may work in 99% of the cases where you want to get rid of ignorable whitespace caused by the various forms of pretty printing.

         $ xmlpretty --NoWhiteSpace \
                     --NoComments \
                     --AddHiddenNewline \
                 --AddHiddenAttrTab \
                 --CatchEmptyElement \
                 prettyfile.xml > cleanfile.xml

   Options
       Options are given in a gnu like --option idiom.

       AddHiddenNewline boolean
           Add hidden newline before ">"

       AddHiddenAttrTab boolean
           Add hidden tabulation for attributes

       CatchEmptyElement boolean
           Catch empty Elements, apply "/>" compression

       CatchWhiteSpace boolean
           Catch whitespace with comments

       IsSGML boolean
           This option will cause start_document, processing_instruction and doctype_decl to appear as SGML. The SGML is still well-formed of course, if your SAX events are well-formed.

       NoComments boolean
           Supress Comments

       NoDTD boolean
           Supress DTD

       NoPI boolean
           Supress Processing Instructions

       NoProlog boolean
           Supress <?xml ... ?> Prolog

       NoWhiteSpace boolean
           Supress WhiteSpace to clean documents from prior pretty printing.

       PrettyWhiteIndent boolean
           Add visible indent before any eventstring

       PrettyWhiteNewline boolean
           Add visible newlines before any eventstring

       SAX1 boolean (not yet implemented)
           Output only SAX1 compilant eventstrings

   Bugs:
       Automatic recoding between 8bit and 16bit does not yet work correctly !

       I have Perl-5.6 at home and here I can specify "use utf8;" in the right places to make recoding work. But I dislike saying "use 5.00555;" because many systems run 5.00503.
