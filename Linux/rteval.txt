NAME
       rteval - evaluate latency performance of a realtime Linux system

SYNOPSIS
       rteval [ -hvsLSDOZ ] [-d duration ] [-w workdir ] [-l loaddir ] [-X host ]

       The rteval program is used to evaluate the realtime performance of a realtime Linux kernel on a particular hardware system. There is nothing that actually requires a realtime Linux kernel, but the la‐
       tency measurements will usually be pretty bad on a stock Linux kernel.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ('--').
       A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              print a help message

       -d, --duration=DURATION
              Specify the length of the measurement run. DURATION is an integer with an optional suffix indicating the units:

                 s - seconds
                 m - minutes
                 h - hours
                 d - days
              for example to execute a ten minute run of rteval:
                   $ rteval --duration=10m

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the verbosity of output during the test run

       -w WORKDIR, --workdir=WORKDIR
              Tell rteval to change directory to WORKDIR before creating any subdirectories for report files. The default WORKDIR is the directory in which rteval was started.

       -l LOADDIR, --loaddir=LOADDIR
              Tell rteval where to find the source for the loads

       --loads-cpulist=CPULIST
              List of CPUs where loads will run

       --measurement-cpulist=CPULIST
              List of CPUs where measurement applciation will run

       -s, --sysreport
              Have rteval run the sysreport utility after a run to gather information on the running system.

       -D, --debug
              Turn on debugging prints during run

       -X HOST, --xmprpc-submit=HOST
              Have rteval send report data to HOST following the run, using XML-RPC

       -P, --xmlrpc-no-abort
              Do not abort if XML-RPC server do not respond to ping  request

       -Z, --summarize
              Have rteval summarize an existing report. This will not cause loads or meausurement utilities to be run.

       -H, --raw-histogram
              Generate raw histogram data for an already existing XML report

       -f INIFILE, --inifile=INIFILE
              Initialization file for configuring loads and behavior

       -a COMMENT, --annotate=COMMENT
              Add a little annotation which is stored in the report

       -L, --logging
              Log the output of the loads in the report directory

       -O, --onlyload
              Only run the loads (don't run measurement threads)

MODULE OPTIONS
       These are options that affect the execution behavior of the measurement and load modules.

       --cyclictest-priority=PRIORITY
              SCHED_FIFO priority for measurement threads (default: 95)

       --cyclictest-interval=INTERVAL
              Measurement thread interval in microseconds (default: 100)

       --cyclictest-distance=DISTANCE
              Interval increment in microseconds (default: 0)

       --cyclictest-buckets=NBUCKETS
              Number of 1 microsecond histogram buckets (default: 2000)

       --hackbench-jobspercore=N
              Number of jobs per online-core for hackbench load

       --kcompile-jobspercore=N
              Number of jobs per online-core for kernel compile load

FILES
       rteval-YYYYMMDD-S This is a directory created by rteval to hold the summary.xml file as well as other files collected on the system. It is the current Year, Month, and Day, followed by a sequence num‐
       ber for multiple runs on the same day.

       summary.xml This is an XML file that contains information about a test run and the host system upon which rteval was run.  dmesg This is the output of the dmesg(1) program immediately following system
       boot. It is copied from /var/log/dmesg.
