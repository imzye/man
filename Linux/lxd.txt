NAME
       lxd-shutdown - Tell LXD to shutdown all containers and exit

SYNOPSIS
       lxd shutdown [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       Description:
         Tell LXD to shutdown all containers and exit

       This will tell LXD to start a clean shutdown of all containers,
         followed by having itself shutdown and exit.

       This can take quite a while as containers can take a long time to
         shutdown, especially if a non-standard timeout was configured for them.

       -t, --timeout=0      Number of seconds to wait before giving up``

OPTIONS INHERITED FROM PARENT COMMANDS
       -d, --debug[=false]      Show all debug messages

       -h, --help[=false]      Print help

       --logfile=""      Path to the log file``

       --syslog[=false]      Log to syslog

       --trace=[]      Log tracing targets``
