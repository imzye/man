NAME
       bximage - Interactive Disk Image Creation, Conversion, Resize and Redolog Commit Tool for Bochs

SYNOPSIS
       bximage [options] [filename1] [filename2]

DESCRIPTION
       Bximage is an easy to use console based tool for creating, converting and resizing disk images, particularly for  use with Bochs. It also  supports committing  redolog files to their  base images.
       It is  completely  interactive  if no command line  arguments are used.  It can be switched to a non-interactive mode  if all required parameters are given in the command line.

OPTIONS
       When you run bximage without one of the following options, it will  appear  in  interactive  mode and  ask   for  all required parameters to manipulate an image.

       -func=...
              Operation to perform (create, convert, resize, commit, info)

       -fd=...
              Create: floppy image with size code (e.g. 360k, 720k, 1.44M)

       -hd=...
              Create/resize: hard disk image with size in megabytes (M) or gigabytes (G)

       -imgmode=...
              Create/convert: hard disk image mode - see the bochsrc sample for supported options.

       -b     Convert/resize: create a backup of the source image. Commit: create backups of base image and redolog file.

       -q     Quiet   mode  (don't  prompt for user input). Without this option bximage uses the  command  line parameters as defaults for the interactive mode. If this option is given and one of the re‐
              quired parameters is missing, bximage will fall back to interactive mode.

              This example creates a harddisk image in flat mode and sector size 512:

              bximage -q -func=create -hd=100M hd100meg.img

       --help Print  a  summary  of  the command line options for bximage and exit.

       The filename1 parameter specifies the name of the new image (create), the source image (convert/resize) or the base image (commit).

       The filename2 parameter specifies the name of the destination image (convert/resize) or the redolog (journal) file (commit).
