NAME
       twine - Client to do uploads on pypi.

DESCRIPTION
       This command is commonly used to upload python modules on pypi.org or compatible repositories.

NOTES ON PYPI.ORG
       This  command  can  be  used on multiple repositories. However the default is to use pypi.org, and since it is probably the most common use case, this section is dedicated to its otherwise undocu‐
       mented quirks.

       Upload via token
              Username and password uploads are no longer supported on pypi.org.
              To upload authenticating with a token, the command looks like this:
                      twine upload --username __token__ --password `cat .token` dist/

       Scope limited token
              Tokens can be obtained from the website of pypi.org.
              To create a token that is limited to a project that doesn't yet exist, a global token must be created, used to do the first upload of the project, then deleted from  the  website.  At  that
              point it will be possible to generate a token that has the scope of that project.

       Signing
              Signing is not allowed on pypi.org.
              Uploads that are signed are greeted by a warning email. The signature files are dropped. In the future they might cause the upload to fail.
