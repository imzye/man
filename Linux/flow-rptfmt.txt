NAME
       flow-rptfmt - Format the output of flow-report in ASCII or HTML

SYNOPSIS
       flow-rptfmt [ -hHnp ]  [ -a alarm_time ]  [ -f format ]  [ -F fields ]  [ -m max_lines ]  [ -s sort_field ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  flow-rptfmt  utility processes the CSV output of flow-report into formatted ASCII or HTML. Sorting, maximum display lines, field filter, header display, and name substitution are supported during
       post processing. Additionally an alarm can be set for use in CGI scripts to limit the CPU time of formatting.

OPTIONS
       -a alarm_time
              Exit after alarm_time seconds.

       -f ascii|html
              Set output format. Defaults to ASCII.

       -F display_fields
              Limit columns to display_fields

       -h     Help.

       -H     Display header information.

       -m max_lines
              Limit rows to max_lines.

       -n     Enable symbol table lookups.

       -p     Display in percent total form.

       -s sort_field
              Sort on sort_field. Prepend with + for ascending, - for descending sort.

EXAMPLES
       Format the output of daily-ip-protocol.txt in ASCII. Display the ip-protocol and octets fields in percent total format with symbols. Limit output to top 5 sorted by octets.

       cat daily-ip-protocol.txt | flow-rptfmt -fascii -Fip-protocol,octets -p -n -m5

BUGS
       Sorting could be faster. Percent totals could be faster. May not work with flow-report prior to 0.68.
