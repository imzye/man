VERT-BANNER(6)                 BSD Games Manual                 VERT-BANNER(6)

NAME
     vert-banner — print large banner on printer

SYNOPSIS
     vert-banner [-w width] message ...

DESCRIPTION
     vert-banner prints a large, high quality banner on the standard output.
     If the message is omitted, it prompts for and reads one line of its stan‐
     dard input.  If -w is given, the output is scrunched down from a width of
     132 to width, suitable for a narrow terminal.

     The output should be printed on paper of the appropriate width, with no
     breaks between the pages.

BUGS
     Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably <, >, [, ], \, ^, _, {,
     }, |, and ~.  Also, the characters ", ', and & are funny looking (but in
     a useful way.)

     The -w option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.  The
     smaller it gets, the grainier the output.  Sometimes it runs letters to‐
     gether.
