NAME
       unipng2hex - Portable Network Graphics to GNU Unifont .hex file converter

SYNOPSIS
       unipng2hex -i input_file.png [-o output_file.hex] [-w width]

DESCRIPTION
       unipng2hex  reads a PNG file produced by unihex2png before or after editing, and converts it back into a Unifont .hex format file.  The PNG file contains a block of 256 Unicode code points arranged in
       a 16 by 16 grid.  Each code point appears in a 32 by 32 or a 40 by 40 pixel grid.  Characters are either 16, 24 or 32 pixel rows high, depending on the "-r" parameter specified  by  unihex2png.   They
       can be 8, 16, 24, or 32 pixel columns wide (widths of 32 are only supported for 32 pixel row tall characters).

OPTIONS
       -i    Specify the input file.

       -o    Specify the output file.  If omitted, a file in the Unifont .hex format is written to STDOUT.

       -w    Specify the minimum width of the output glyphs.  Valid values are 16, 24,
              and 32.  The default is no minimum width.

       -h    Print a help message of options and exit.

EXAMPLE
       Sample usage:

              unipng2hex -i my_input_file.png -o my_output_file.hex

BUGS
       No known real bugs exist, but the optional pixel rows parameter is not yet supported by all other Unifont utilities.  Use of glyphs taller than the default of 16  pixels  is  considered  experimental.
       Currently unihex2png, unipng2hex, hexdraw, and hex2bdf tentatively support glyphs that are 16, 24, and 32 pixels tall.

       Also, this software does not perform extensive error checking on its input files.  If they're not in the format of the original PNG output from unihex2png, all bets are off.

       If the output file is for a "page" containing space code points and the PNG file squares for those code points are not empty, unipng2hex preserves the graphics as they are drawn.

       unipng2hex is designed to work with black and white pixels; do not use other colors.
