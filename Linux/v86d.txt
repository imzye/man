NAME
       v86d - daemon to run x86 code in an emulated environment

SYNOPSIS
       v86d

DESCRIPTION
       v86d provides a backend for kernel drivers that need to execute x86 BIOS code. The code is executed in a controlled environment and the results are passed back to the kernel via the netlink inter‐
       face.

       v86d should NOT be run by the user, the kernel will call it, when it is needed.
