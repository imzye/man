NAME
       Graph::Writer::DSM - draw graph as a DSM matrix

VERSION
       version 0.008

DESCRIPTION
       Write graph as a quadractic matrix N x N, where N is the number of vertices in the graph. It is useful to visualize graphs with at least 1k vertices.

       See more about DSM: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_structure_matrix>.

SYNOPSIS
           use Graph;
           use Graph::Writer::DSM;
           my $graph = Graph->new();
           my $writer = Graph::Writer::DSM->new(%OPTIONS);
           $writer->write_graph($graph, "output.png");

METHODS
new()
       Like Graph::Writer::GraphViz, this module provide some extra parameters to new() method.

           $writer = Graph::Writer::DSM->new(color => 'red');

       Supported parameters are:

       pointsize
           Default: 0.2.

       color
           Default: 'blue'.

       tics_label
           Default: false.

write_graph()
       Write a specific graph to a named file:

           $writer->write_graph($graph, $file);

       The $file argument can either be a filename, or a filehandle for a previously opened file.
