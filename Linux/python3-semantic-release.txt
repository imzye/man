NAME
       python-semantic-release - python-semantic-release Documentation

       Python Semantic Release (PSR) provides an automated release mechanism determined by SemVer and Commit Message Conventions for your Git projects.

       The purpose of this project is to detect what the next version of the project should be from parsing the latest commit messages. If the commit messages describe changes that would require a major,
       minor  or  patch  version  bump,  PSR will automatically bump the version number accordingly. PSR, however, does not stop there but will help automate the whole release process. It will update the
       project code and distribution artifact, upload the artifact and post changelogs to a remotely hosted Version Control System (VCS).

       The tool is designed to run inside of a CI/CD pipeline service, but it can also be run locally.

       This project was originally inspired by the semantic-release project for JavaScript by Stephan Bönnemann, but the codebases have significantly deviated since then, as PSR  as  driven  towards  the
       goal of providing flexible changelogs and simple initial setup.

INSTALLATION
          python3 -m pip install python-semantic-release
          semantic-release --help

       Python Semantic Release is also available from conda-forge or as a GitHub Action.

       • github-actions: Fix recommended upstream detection script's upstream name parsing (PR#1328, ccc91c0)

   v10.4.0 (2025-09-08)
   ✨ Features
       • config: Add conventional-monorepo as valid commit_parser type (PR#1143, e18f866)

       • parser: Add new conventional-commits standard parser for monorepos, closes #614 (PR#1143, e18f866)

   📖 Documentation
       • Add configuration guide for monorepo use with PSR (PR#1143, e18f866)

       • commit-parsers: Introduce conventional commit monorepo parser options & features (PR#1143, e18f866)

       • configuration: Update commit_parser option with new conventional-monorepo value (PR#1143, e18f866)

   💡 Additional Release Information
       • config:  This  release introduces a new built-in parser type that can be utilized for monorepo projects. The type value is conventional-monorepo and when specified it will apply the conventional
         commit parser to a monorepo environment. This parser has specialized options to help handle monorepo projects as well. For more information, please refer to the Monorepo Docs.

   v10.3.2 (2025-09-06)
   🪲 Bug Fixes
       • cmd-version: Prevent errors when PSR is executed in non-GitHub CI environments, closes #1315 (PR#1322, 4df4be4)

   ⚡ Performance Improvements
       • cmd-version: Re-order operations for faster parsing in version determination (PR#1310, 63e435b)

   📖 Documentation
       • uv-integration: Add --no-changelog to build step to increase job speed (PR#1316, e1aece1)

   💡 Additional Release Information
       • cmd-version: Unfortunately, PSR introduced a bug in 10.3.0 when attempting to provide more CI outputs for GitHub Actions. It required our GitHub client interface to be loaded and even if it  was
         not  using  GitHub CI to be run. This caused errors in Gitea and likely GitLab/Bitbucket environments. This change prevents that from happening but if any users pipelines were intentionally pre‐
         senting the environment variable "GITHUB_OUTPUT" to enable action output to enable passing along internal outputs of PSR then their hack will no longer work after this change.

       • changelog-md: The default Markdown changelog template and release notes template will no longer print out the entire commit message contents, instead, it will only print the commit subject line.
         This comes to meet the high demand of better formatted changelogs and requests for subject line only. Originally, it was a decision to not hide commit subjects that were included in  the  commit
         body  via  the git merge --squash command and PSR did not have another alternative.  At this point, all the built-in parsers have the ability to parse squashed commits and separate them out into
         their own entry on the changelog. Therefore, the default template no longer needs to write out the full commit body. See the commit parser options if you want to  enable/disable  parsing  squash
         commits.

       • changelog-rst:  The  default  ReStructured changelog template will no longer print out the entire commit message contents, instead, it will only print the commit subject line. This comes to meet
         the high demand of better formatted changelogs and requests for subject line only. Originally, it was a decision to not hide commit subjects that were included in the commit  body  via  the  git
         merge  --squash command and PSR did not have another alternative. At this point, all the built-in parsers have the ability to parse squashed commits and separate them out into their own entry on
         the changelog. Therefore, the default template no longer needs to write out the full commit body.  See the commit parser options if you want to enable/disable parsing squash commits.

       • config: This release switches the allow_zero_version default to false. This change is to encourage less 0.x releases as the default but rather allow the experienced developer to choose when  0.x
         is  appropriate. There are way too many projects in the ecosystems that never leave 0.x and that is problematic for the industry tools that help auto-update based on SemVer. We should strive for
         publishing usable tools and maintaining good forethought for when compatibility must break. If your configuration already sets the allow_zero_version value, this change will have  no  effect  on
         your project. If you want to use 0.x versions, from the start then change allow_zero_version to true in your configuration.

       • config: This release switches the changelog.default_templates.mask_initial_release default to true. This change is intended to toggle better recommended outputs of the default changelog. Concep‐
         tually, the very first release is hard to describe--one can only provide new features as nothing exists yet for the end user. No changelog should be written as there is no start point to compare
         the  "changes" to. The recommendation instead is to only list a simple message as Initial Release. This is now the default for PSR when providing the very first release (no pre-existing tags) in
         the changelog and release notes. If your configuration already sets the changelog.default_templates.mask_initial_release value, then this change will have no effect on your project.  If  you  do
         NOT want to mask the first release information, then set changelog.default_templates.mask_initial_release to false in your configuration.

       • config:  This release switches the changelog.mode default to update. In this mode, if a changelog exists, PSR will update the changelog IF AND ONLY IF the configured insertion flag exists in the
         changelog. The Changelog output will remain unchanged if no insertion flag exists.  The insertion flag may be configured with the changelog.insertion_flag setting. When  upgrading  to  v10,  you
         must add the insertion flag manually or you can just delete the changelog file and run PSR's changelog generation and it will rebuild the changelog (similar to init mode) but it will add the in‐
         sertion flag. If your configuration already sets the changelog.mode value, then this change will have no effect on your project. If you would rather the changelog be generated from scratch every
         release, than set the changelog.mode value to init in your configuration.

       • github-action:  The  root_options  action  input parameter has been removed because it created a command injection vulnerability for arbitrary code to execute within the container context of the
         GitHub action if a command injection code was provided as part of the root_options parameter string. To eliminate the vulnerability, each relevant option that can be provided to semantic-release
         has been individually added as its own parameter and will be processed individually to prevent command injection. Please review our Github Actions Configuration page to review the  newly  avail‐
         able configuration options that replace the root_options parameter.

       • parser-conventional:  Any  breaking  change  footer messages that the conventional commit parser detects will now be removed from the commit.descriptions[] list but maintained in and only in the
         commit.breaking_descriptions[] list. Previously, the descriptions included all text from the commit message but that was redundant as the default changelog now handles breaking change footers in
         its own section.

       • parser-conventional, parser-emoji, parser-scipy: Any issue resolution footers that the parser detects will now be removed from the commit.descriptions[] list. Previously,  the  descriptions  in‐
         cluded  all  text  from the commit message but now that the parser pulls out the issue numbers the numbers will be included in the commit.linked_issues tuple for user extraction in any changelog
         generation.

       • parser-conventional, parser-emoji, parser-scipy: Any release notice footer messages that the commit parser detects will now be removed from the commit.descriptions[] list but maintained  in  and
         only  in  the  commit.notices[] list. Previously, the descriptions included all text from the commit message but that was redundant as the default changelog now handles release notice footers in
         its own section.

       • parser-conventional, parser-emoji, parser-scipy: Generally, a pull request or merge request number reference is included in the subject line at the end within parentheses on  some  common  VCS's
         like  GitHub. PSR now looks for this reference and extracts it into the commit.linked_merge_request and the commit.linked_pull_request attributes of a commit object. Since this is now pulled out
         individually, it is cleaner to remove this from the first line of the commit.descriptions list (ie. the subject line) so that changelog macros do not have to replace the text  but  instead  only
         append a PR/MR link to the end of the line. The reference does maintain the PR/MR prefix indicator (# or !).

       • parser-conventional,  parser-emoji, parser-scipy: The configuration setting commit_parser_options.ignore_merge_commits is now set to true by default. The feature to ignore squash commits was in‐
         troduced in v9.18.0 and was originally set to false to prevent unexpected results on a non-breaking update. The ignore merge commits feature prevents additional unnecessary processing on a  com‐
         mit  message  that  likely will not match a commit message syntax. Most merge commits are syntactically pre-defined by Git or Remote Version Control System (ex. GitHub, etc.) and do not follow a
         commit convention (nor should they). The larger issue with merge commits is that they ultimately are a full copy of all the changes that were previously created and committed. The  merge  commit
         itself  ensures that the previous commit tree is maintained in history, therefore the commit message always exists. If merge commits are parsed, it generally creates duplicate messages that will
         end up in your changelog, which is less than desired in most cases. If you have previously used the changelog.exclude_commit_patterns functionality to ignore merge commit messages then you  will
         want  this setting set to true to improve parsing speed. You can also now remove the merge commit exclude pattern from the list as well to improve parsing speed. If this functionality is not de‐
         sired, you will need to update your configuration to change the new setting to false.

       • parser-conventional, parser-emoji, parser-scipy: The configuration setting commit_parser_options.parse_squash_commits is now set to true by default. The feature to parse squash commits  was  in‐
         troduced  in v9.17.0 and was originally set to false to prevent unexpected results on a non-breaking update. The parse squash commits feature attempts to find additional commits of the same com‐
         mit type within the body of a single commit message. When squash commits are found, Python Semantic Release will separate out each commit into its own artificial commit object and parse them in‐
         dividually. This potentially can change the resulting version bump if a larger bump was detected within the squashed components. It also allows for the changelog and release notes to  separately
         order and display each commit as originally written. If this is not desired, you will need to update your configuration to change the new setting to false.

   ♻️ Refactoring
       • Drop support for Python 3.7 (PR#828, ad086f5)

   💥 BREAKING CHANGES
       • Removed Python 3.7 specific control flows and made more modern implementations the default control flow without a bypass or workaround. Will break on Python 3.7 now. If you require  Python  3.7,
         you should lock your major version at v8. Since we only have enough manpower to maintain the latest major release, unfortunately there will not be any more updates to v8.

       • We  decided to remove support for Python 3.7 because it has been officially deprecated by the Python Foundation over a year ago and our codebase is starting to have limitations and custom imple‐
         mentations just to maintain support for 3.7.

   Concepts
       This section covers the core concepts of Python Semantic Release and how it works. Understanding these concepts will help you effectively use Python Semantic Release in your projects.

   Getting Started
       If you haven't done so already, install Python Semantic Release locally following the installation instructions.

       If you are using a CI/CD service, you may not have to add Python Semantic Release to your project's dependencies permanently, but for the duration of this guide for the  initial  setup,  you  will
       need to have it installed locally.

   Configuring PSR
       Python Semantic Release ships with a reasonable default configuration but some aspects MUST be customized to your project. To view the default configuration, run the following command:

          semantic-release generate-config

       The output of the above command is the default configuration in TOML format without any modifications.  If this is fine for your project, then you do not need to configure anything else.

       PSR accepts overrides to the default configuration keys individually. If you don't define the key-value pair in your configuration file, the default value will be used.

       By default, Python Semantic Release will look for configuration overrides in pyproject.toml under the TOML table [tool.semantic_release]. You may specify a different file using the -c/--config op‐
       tion, for example:

          # In TOML format with top level table [semantic_release]
          semantic-release -c releaserc.toml

          # In JSON format with top level object key {"semantic_release": {}}
          semantic-release -c releaserc.json

       The easiest way to get started is to output the default configuration to a file, delete keys you do not need to override, and then edit the remaining keys to suit your project.

       To set up in pyproject.toml, run the following command:

          # In file redirect in bash
          semantic-release generate-config --pyproject >> pyproject.toml

          # Open your editor to edit the configuration
          vim pyproject.toml

   Configuring the Version Stamp Feature
       One of the best features of Python Semantic Release is the ability to automatically stamp the new version number into your project files, so you don't have to manually update the version upon each
       release. The version that is stamped is automatically determined by Python Semantic Release from your commit messages which compliments automated versioning seamlessly.

       The most crucial version stamp is the one in your project metadata, which is used by the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other package managers to identify the version of your package.

       For Python projects, this is typically the version field in your pyproject.toml file. First, set up your project metadata with the base version value. If you are starting with a brand new project,
       set project.version = "0.0.0".  If you are working on an existing project, set it to the last version number you released. Do not include any v prefix.

       IMPORTANT:
          The version number must be a valid SemVer version, which means it should follow the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0). Python Semantic Release does NOT support Canonical version values de‐
          fined in the PEP 440 specification at this time. See Issue #455 for more details. Note that you can still define a SemVer version in the project.version field, and when your build is generated,
          the build tool will automatically generate a PEP 440 compliant version as long as you do NOT use a non-pep440 compliant pre-release token.

       Your project metadata might look like this in pyproject.toml:

          [project]
          name = "my-package"
          version = "0.0.0"  # Set this to the last released version or "0.0.0" for new projects
          description = "A sample Python package"

       To  configure  PSR  to automatically update this version number, you need to specify the file and value to update in your configuration. Since pyproject.toml uses TOML format, you will add the re‐
       placement specification to the tool.semantic_release.version_toml list. Update the following configuration in your pyproject.toml file to include the version variable location:

          [tool.semantic_release]
          version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:project.version"]

          # Alternatively, if you are using poetry's 'version' key, then you would use:
          version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:tool.poetry.version"]

       If you have other TOML files where you want to stamp the version, you can add them to the version_toml list as well. In the above example, there is an implicit assumption that you  only  want  the
       version as the raw number format. If you want to specify the full tag value (e.g. v-prefixed version), then include :tf for "tag format" at the end of the version variable specification.

       For  non-TOML  formatted  files  (such as JSON or YAML files), you can use the version_variables configuration key instead. This feature uses an advanced Regular Expression to find and replace the
       version variable in the specified files.

       For Python files, its much more effective to use importlib instead which will allow you to dynamically import the version from your package metadata and not require your project to commit the ver‐
       sion number bump to the repository. For example, in your package's base __init__.py

          # my_package/__init__.py
          from importlib.metadata import version as get_version

          __version__ = get_version(__package__)
          # Note: __package__ must match your 'project.name' as defined in pyproject.toml

   Using PSR to Build your Project
       PSR provides a convenient way to build your project artifacts as part of the versioning process now that you have stamped the version into your project files. To enable  this,  you  will  need  to
       specify the build command in your configuration. This command will be executed after the next version has been determined, and stamped into your files but before a release tag has been created.

       To set up the build command, add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

          [tool.semantic_release]
          build_command = "python -m build --sdist --wheel ."

       SEE ALSO:

          • build_command - Configuration specification for the build command.

          • build_command_env - Configuration specification for the build command environment variables.

   Choosing a Commit Message Parser
       PSR uses commit messages to determine the type of version bump that should be applied to your project. PSR supports multiple commit message parsing styles, allowing you to choose the one that best
       fits your project's needs. Choose one of the supported commit parsers defined in Commit Parsing, or provide your own and configure it in your pyproject.toml file.

       Each commit parser has its own default configuration options so if you want to customize the parser behavior, you will need to specify the parser options you want to override.

          [tool.semantic_release]
          commit_parser = "conventional"

          [tool.semantic_release.commit_parser_options]
          minor_tags = ["feat"]
          patch_tags = ["fix", "perf"]
          parse_squash_commits = true
          ignore_merge_commits = true

   Choosing your Changelog
       Prior  to  creating  a release, PSR will generate a changelog from the commit messages of your project. The changelog is extremely customizable from the format to the content of each section.  PSR
       ships with a default changelog template that will be used if you do not provide custom templates. The default should be sufficient for most projects and has its own set of configuration options.

       For basic customization, you can choose either an traditional Markdown formatted changelog (default) or if you want to integrate with a Sphinx Documentation project, you can use the  reStructured‐
       Text (RST) format. You can also choose the file name and location of where to write the default changelog.

       To set your changelog location and changelog format, add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog.default_templates]
          changelog_file = "docs/source/CHANGELOG.rst"
          output_format = "rst" # or "md" for Markdown format

       Secondly,  the more important aspect of configuring your changelog is to define Commit Exclusion Patterns or patterns that will be used to filter out commits from the changelog. PSR does NOT (yet)
       come with a built-in set of exclusion patterns, so you will need to define them yourself. These commit patterns should be in line with your project's commit parser configuration.

       To set commit exclusion patterns for a conventional commits parsers, add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog]
          # Recommended patterns for conventional commits parser that is scope aware
          exclude_commit_patterns = [
              '''chore(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''ci(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''refactor(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''style(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''test(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''build\((?!deps\): .+)''',
              '''Initial [Cc]ommit.*''',
          ]

          • changelog.mode - Choose the changelog mode ('update' or 'init')

          • Migrating an Existing Changelog

   Defining your Release Branches
       PSR provides a powerful feature to manage release types across multiple branches which can allow you to configure your project to have different release branches for different  purposes,  such  as
       pre-release branches, beta branches, and your stable releases.

       NOTE:
          Most projects that do NOT publish pre-releases will be fine with PSR's built-in default.

       To define an alpha pre-release branch when you are working on a fix or new feature, you can add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

          [tool.semantic_release.branches.alpha]
          # Matches branches with the prefixes 'feat/', 'fix/', or 'perf/'.
          match = "^(feat|fix|perf)/.+"
          prerelease = true
          prerelease_token = "alpha"

       Any  time  you execute semantic-release version on a branch with the prefix feat/, fix/, or perf/, PSR will determine if a version bump is needed and if so, the resulting version will be a pre-re‐
       lease version with the alpha token. For example,
                                                                         ┌───────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────┐
                                                                         │ Branch    │ Version Bump │ Current Version │ Next Version  │
                                                                         ├───────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────┤
                                                                         │ main      │ Patch        │ 1.0.0           │ 1.0.1         │
                                                                         ├───────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────┤
                                                                         │ fix/bug-1 │ Patch        │ 1.0.0           │ 1.0.1-alpha.1 │
                                                                         └───────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────┘

   Configuring VCS Releases
       You can set up Python Semantic Release to create Releases in your remote version control system, so you can publish assets and release notes for your project.

       In order to do so, you will need to place an authentication token in the appropriate environment variable so that Python Semantic Release can authenticate with the remote VCS to push tags,  create
       releases, or upload files.

   GitHub (GH_TOKEN)
       For  local  publishing  to  GitHub,  you  should  use a personal access token and store it in your environment variables. Specify the name of the environment variable in your configuration setting
       remote.token.  The default is GH_TOKEN.

       To generate a token go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click on "Generate new token".

       For Personal Access Token (classic), you will need the repo scope to write (ie. push) to the repository.

       For fine-grained Personal Access Tokens, you will need the contents permission.

   GitLab (GITLAB_TOKEN)
       A personal access token from GitLab. This is used for authenticating when pushing tags, publishing releases etc. This token should be stored in the GITLAB_TOKEN environment variable.

   Gitea (GITEA_TOKEN)
       A personal access token from Gitea. This token should be stored in the GITEA_TOKEN environment variable.

   Bitbucket (BITBUCKET_TOKEN)
       Bitbucket does not support uploading releases but can still benefit from automated tags and changelogs. The user has three options to push changes to the repository:

       1. Use SSH keys.

       2. Use an App Secret, store the secret in the BITBUCKET_TOKEN environment variable and the username in BITBUCKET_USER.

       3. Use an Access Token for the repository and store it in the BITBUCKET_TOKEN environment variable.

   Testing your Configuration
       It's time to test your configuration!

          # 1. Run the command in no-operation mode to see what would happen
          semantic-release -v --noop version

          # 2. If the output looks reasonable, try to run the command without any history changes
          #    '-vv' will give you verbose debug output, which is useful for troubleshooting
          #    commit parsing issues.
          semantic-release -vv version --no-commit --no-tag

          # 3. Evaluate your repository to see the changes that were made but not committed
          #    - Check the version number in your pyproject.toml
          #    - Check the distribution files from the build command
          #    - Check the changelog file for the new release notes

          # 4. If everything looks good, make sure to commit/save your configuration changes
          git add pyproject.toml
          git commit -m "chore(config): configure Python Semantic Release"

          # 5. Now, try to run the release command with your history changes but without pushing
          semantic-release -v version --no-push --no-vcs-release

          # 6. Check the result on your local repository
          git status
          git log --graph --decorate --all

          # 7a. If you are happy with the release history and resulting commit & tag,
          #     reverse your changes before trying the full release command.
          git tag -d v0.0.1  # replace with the actual version you released
          git reset --hard HEAD~1

          # 7b. [Optional] Once you have configured a remote VCS token, try
          #     running the full release command to update the remote repository.
          semantic-release version --push --vcs-release
          #    This is optional as you may not want a personal access token set up or make
          #    make the release permanent yet.

       PSR is meant to help you release at speed! See our CI/CD Configuration guides under the Automated Releases section.

   Commit Parsing
       One of the core components of Python Semantic Release (PSR) is the commit parser. The commit parser is responsible for parsing a Project's Git Repository commit history to extract  insights  about
       project changes and make decisions based on this insight.

       The  primary  decision that PSR makes based on the commit history is whether or not to release a new version of the project, and if so, what version number to release.  This decision is made based
       on the commit message descriptions of the change impact introduced by the commit. The change impact describes the impact to the end consumers of the project. Depending on the type of  change,  the
       version number will be incremented according to the Semantic Versioning specification (semver).  It is the commit parser's job to extract the change impact from the commit message to determine the
       severity of the changes and then subsequently determine the semver level that the version should be bumped to for the next release.

       The  commit  parser  is  also  responsible for interpreting other aspects of the commit message which can be used to generate a helpful and detailed changelog. This includes extracting the type of
       change, the scope of the change, any breaking change descriptions, any linked pull/merge request numbers, and any linked issue numbers.

       PSR provides several built-in commit parsers to handle a variety of different commit message styles. If the built-in parsers do not meet your needs, you can write your own custom parser to  handle
       your specific commit message style.

       WARNING:
          PSR's  built-in  commit  parsers  are designed to be flexible enough to provide a convenient way to generate the most effective changelogs we can, which means some features are added beyond the
          scope of the original commit message style guidelines.

          Other tools may not follow the same conventions as PSR's guideline extensions, so if you plan to use any similar programs in tandem with PSR, you should be aware of the differences  in  feature
          support and fall back to the official format guidelines if necessary.

                                                                                                       ----

   Built-in Commit Parsers
       The following parsers are built in to Python Semantic Release:

       • ConventionalCommitParser

       • ConventionalCommitMonorepoParser (available in v10.4.0+)

       • AngularCommitParser (deprecated in v9.19.0)

       • EmojiCommitParser

       • ScipyCommitParser

       • TagCommitParser (deprecated in v9.12.0)

                                                                                                       ----

   Conventional Commits Parser
       Introduced in v9.19.0

       A parser that is designed to parse commits formatted according to the Conventional Commits Specification.  The parser is implemented with the following logic in relation to PSR's core features:

       • Version  Bump Determination: This parser extracts the commit type from the subject line of the commit (the first line of a commit message). This type is matched against the configuration mapping
         to determine the level bump for the specific commit. If the commit type is not found in the configuration mapping, the commit is considered a non-parsable commit and will return it as a ParseEr‐
         ror object and ultimately a commit of type "unknown". The configuration mapping contains lists of commit types that correspond to the level bump for each commit type. Some commit types are still
         valid do not trigger a level bump, such as "chore" or "docs". You can also configure the default level bump commit_parser_options.default_level_bump if desired.  To trigger a major release,  the
         commit message body must contain a paragraph that begins with BREAKING CHANGE:. This will override the level bump determined by the commit type.

       • Changelog  Generation:  PSR will group commits in the changelog by the commit type used in the commit message. The commit type shorthand is converted to a more human-friendly section heading and
         then used as the version section title of the changelog and release notes. Under the section title, the parsed commit descriptions are listed out in full. If  the  commit  includes  an  optional
         scope,  then  the scope is prefixed on to the first line of the commit description. If a commit has any breaking change prefixed paragraphs in the commit message body, those paragraphs are sepa‐
         rated out into a "Breaking Changes" section in the changelog (Breaking Changes section is available from the default changelog in v9.15.0). Each breaking change paragraph is listed in a bulleted
         list format across the entire version. A single commit is allowed to have more than one breaking change prefixed paragraph (as opposed to the Conventional Commits Specification). Commits with an
         optional scope and a breaking change will have the scope prefixed on to the breaking change paragraph. Parsing errors will return a ParseError object and ultimately a commit of  type  "unknown".
         Unknown  commits are consolidated into an "Unknown" section in the changelog by the default template. To remove unwanted commits from the changelog that normally are placed in the "unknown" sec‐
         tion, consider the use of the configuration option changelog.exclude_commit_patterns to ignore those commit styles.

       • Pull/Merge Request Identifier Detection: This parser implements PSR's Common Linked Merge Request Detection to identify and extract pull/merge request numbers. The parser will  return  a  string
         value if a pull/merge request number is found in the commit message. If no pull/merge request number is found, the parser will return an empty string.

       • Linked  Issue  Identifier  Detection:  This  parser  implements PSR's Common Issue Identifier Detection to identify and extract issue numbers.  The parser will return a tuple of issue numbers as
         strings if any are found in the commit message. If no issue numbers are found, the parser will return an empty tuple.

       • Squash Commit Evaluation: This parser implements PSR's Common Squash Commit Evaluation to identify and extract each commit message as a separate commit message within a single  squashed  commit.
         You can toggle this feature on/off via the commit_parser_options setting.

       • Release Notice Footer Detection: This parser implements PSR's Common Release Notice Footer Detection, which is a custom extension to traditional Conventional Commits Specification to use the NO‐
         TICE keyword as a git footer to document additional release information that is not considered a breaking change.

       Limitations:

       • Commits with the revert type are not currently supported. Track the implementation of this feature in the issue #402.

       If no commit parser options are provided via the configuration, the parser will use PSR's built-in defaults.

                                                                                                       ----

   Conventional Commits Monorepo Parser
       Introduced in v10.4.0

       IMPORTANT:
          In order for this parser to be effective, please review the section titled Releasing Packages from a Monorepo for details on file structure, configurations, and release actions.

       This  parser  is an extension of the Conventional Commits Parser, designed specifically for monorepo environments. A monorepo environment is defined as a single source control repository that con‐
       tains multiple packages, each of which can be released independently and may have different version numbers.

       This parser introduces two new configuration options that determine which packages are affected by a commit. These options control  whether  a  commit  is  considered  for  version  determination,
       changelog generation, and other release actions for the relevant packages. The 2 new configuration options are path_filters and scope_prefix.

       Features:

       • Package  Specific Commit Filtering: For monorepo support, this parser uses 2 filtering rules to determine if a commit should be considered for a specific package. The first rule is based on file
         paths that are changed in the commit and the second rule is based on the optional scope prefix defined in the commit message. If either rule matches, then the commit is  considered  relevant  to
         that  package  and  will  be used in version determination, changelog generation, etc, for that package. If neither rule matches, then the commit is ignored for that package. File path filtering
         rules are applied first and are the primary way to determine package relevance. The path_filters option allows for specifying a list of file path patterns and will also support negated  patterns
         to ignore specific paths that otherwise would be selected from the file glob pattern.  Negated patterns are defined by prefixing the pattern with an exclamation point (!). File path filtering is
         quite  effective  by  itself  but  to handle the edge cases, the parser has the scope_prefix configuration option to allow the developer to specifically define when the commit is relevant to the
         package. In monorepo setups, there are often shared files between packages (generally at the root project level) that are modified occasionally but not always relevant to the package  being  re‐
         leased.  Since you do not want to define this path in the package configuration as it may not be relevant to the release, then this parser will look for a match with the scope prefix.  The scope
         prefix is a regular expression that is used to match the text inside the scope field of a Conventional Commit. The scope prefix is optional and is used only  if  file  path  filtering  does  not
         match. Commits that have matching files in the commit will be considered relevant to the package regardless if a scope prefix exists or if it matches.

       • Version  Bump  Determination:  Once package-specific commit filtering is applied, the relevant commits are passed to the Conventional Commits Parser for evaluation and then used for version bump
         determination. See Conventional Commits Parser for details.

       • Changelog Generation: Once package-specific commit filtering is applied, the relevant commits are passed to the Conventional Commits Parser for evaluation and then used for changelog generation.
         See Conventional Commits Parser for details.

       • Pull/Merge Request Identifier Detection: Once package-specific commit filtering is applied, the relevant commits are passed to the Conventional Commits Parser for pull/merge  request  identifier
         detection. See Common Linked Merge Request Detection for details.

       • Linked  Issue  Identifier  Detection: Once package-specific commit filtering is applied, the relevant commits are passed to the Conventional Commits Parser for linked issue identifier detection.
         See Common Issue Identifier Detection for details.

       • Squash Commit Evaluation: Squashed commits are separated out into individual commits with the same set of changed files BEFORE the package-specific commit filtering is applied.  Each pseudo-com‐
         mit is then subjected to the same filtering rules as regular commits. See Common Squash Commit Evaluation for details.

       • Release Notice Footer Detection: Once package-specific commit filtering is applied, the relevant commits are passed to the Conventional Commits Parser for release notice  footer  detection.  See
         Common Release Notice Footer Detection for details.

       Limitations:

       • revert commit type is NOT supported, see Conventional Commits Parser's limitations for details.

       If no commit parser options are provided via the configuration, the parser will use PSR's built-in defaults.

   Angular Commit Parser
       WARNING:
          This parser was deprecated in v9.19.0. It will be removed in a future release.  This parser is being replaced by the Conventional Commits Parser.

       A parser that is designed to parse commits formatted according to the Angular Commit Style Guidelines.  The parser is implemented with the following logic in relation to how PSR's core features:

       • Version  Bump Determination: This parser extracts the commit type from the subject line of the commit (the first line of a commit message). This type is matched against the configuration mapping
         to determine the level bump for the specific commit. If the commit type is not found in the configuration mapping, the commit is considered a non-parsable commit and will return it as a ParseEr‐
         ror object and ultimately a commit of type "unknown". The configuration mapping contains lists of commit types that correspond to the level bump for each commit type. Some commit types are still
         valid do not trigger a level bump, such as "chore" or "docs". You can also configure the default level bump commit_parser_options.default_level_bump if desired.  To trigger a major release,  the
         commit message body must contain a paragraph that begins with BREAKING CHANGE:. This will override the level bump determined by the commit type.

       • Changelog  Generation:  PSR will group commits in the changelog by the commit type used in the commit message. The commit type shorthand is converted to a more human-friendly section heading and
         then used as the version section title of the changelog and release notes. Under the section title, the parsed commit descriptions are listed out in full. If  the  commit  includes  an  optional
         scope,  then  the scope is prefixed on to the first line of the commit description. If a commit has any breaking change prefixed paragraphs in the commit message body, those paragraphs are sepa‐
         rated out into a "Breaking Changes" section in the changelog (Breaking Changes section is available from the default changelog in v9.15.0). Each breaking change paragraph is listed in a bulleted
         list format across the entire version. A single commit is allowed to have more than one breaking change prefixed paragraph (as opposed to the Angular Commit Style Guidelines).  Commits  with  an
         optional  scope  and a breaking change will have the scope prefixed on to the breaking change paragraph. Parsing errors will return a ParseError object and ultimately a commit of type "unknown".
         Unknown commits are consolidated into an "Unknown" section in the changelog by the default template. To remove unwanted commits from the changelog that normally are placed in the "unknown"  sec‐
         tion, consider the use of the configuration option changelog.exclude_commit_patterns to ignore those commit styles.

       • Pull/Merge  Request  Identifier  Detection: This parser implements PSR's Common Linked Merge Request Detection to identify and extract pull/merge request numbers. The parser will return a string
         value if a pull/merge request number is found in the commit message. If no pull/merge request number is found, the parser will return an empty string. Feature available in v9.13.0+.

       • Linked Issue Identifier Detection: This parser implements PSR's Common Issue Identifier Detection to identify and extract issue numbers.  The parser will return  a  tuple  of  issue  numbers  as
         strings if any are found in the commit message. If no issue numbers are found, the parser will return an empty tuple. Feature available in v9.15.0+.

       • Squash  Commit  Evaluation: This parser implements PSR's Common Squash Commit Evaluation to identify and extract each commit message as a separate commit message within a single squashed commit.
         You can toggle this feature on/off via the commit_parser_options setting. Feature available in v9.17.0+.

       • Release Notice Footer Detection: This parser implements PSR's Common Release Notice Footer Detection, which is a custom extension to traditional Angular Commit Style Guidelines to use the NOTICE
         keyword as a git footer to document additional release information that is not considered a breaking change.  Feature available in v9.18.0+.

       Limitations:

       • Commits with the revert type are not currently supported. Track the implementation of this feature in the issue #402.

       If no commit parser options are provided via the configuration, the parser will use PSR's built-in defaults.

   Emoji Commit Parser
       A parser that is designed to parse commits formatted to the Gitmoji Specification with a few additional features that the specification does not cover but provide  similar  functionality  expected
       from  a Semantic Release tool.  As the Gitmoji Specification describes, the emojis can be specified in either the unicode format or the shortcode text format. See the Gitmoji Specification for the
       pros and cons for which format to use, but regardless, the configuration options must match the format used in the commit messages. The parser is implemented with the following logic  in  relation
       to how PSR's core features:

       • Version  Bump  Determination: This parser only looks for emojis in the subject line of the commit (the first line of a commit message). If more than one emoji is found, the emoji configured with
         the highest priority is selected for the change impact for the specific commit. The emoji with the highest priority is the one configured in the major configuration option, followed by  the  mi‐
         nor,  and  patch  in descending priority order. If no emoji is found in the subject line, the commit is classified as other and will default to the level bump defined by the configuration option
         commit_parser_options.default_level_bump.

       • Changelog Generation: PSR will group commits in the changelog by the emoji type used in the commit message. The emoji is used as the version section title and the commit descriptions are  listed
         under  that  section.  No emojis are removed from the commit message so each will be listed in the changelog and release notes. When more than one emoji is found in the subject line of a commit,
         the emoji with the highest priority is the one that will influence the grouping of the commit in the changelog. Commits containing no emojis or non-configured emojis  are  consolidated  into  an
         "Other"   section.   To   remove   unwanted   commits   from   the   changelog  that  would  normally  be  added  into  the  "other"  section,  consider  the  use  of  the  configuration  option
         changelog.exclude_commit_patterns to ignore those commit styles.

       • Pull/Merge Request Identifier Detection: This parser implements PSR's Common Linked Merge Request Detection to identify and extract pull/merge request numbers. The parser will  return  a  string
         value if a pull/merge request number is found in the commit message. If no pull/merge request number is found, the parser will return an empty string. Feature available in v9.13.0+.

       • Linked  Issue Identifier Detection: [Disabled by default] This parser implements PSR's Common Issue Identifier Detection to identify and extract issue numbers.  The parser will return a tuple of
         issue numbers as strings if any are found in the commit message. If no issue numbers are found, the parser will return an empty tuple. This feature is disabled by default since it is not a  part
         of the Gitmoji Specification but can be enabled by setting the configuration option commit_parser_options.parse_linked_issues to true. Feature available in v9.15.0+.

       • Squash  Commit  Evaluation: This parser implements PSR's Common Squash Commit Evaluation to identify and extract each commit message as a separate commit message within a single squashed commit.
         You can toggle this feature on/off via the commit_parser_options setting. Feature available in v9.17.0+.

   Scipy Commit Parser
       A  parser that is designed to parse commits formatted according to the Scipy Commit Style Guidelines. This is essentially a variation of the Angular Commit Style Guidelines with all different com‐

   Common Linked Merge Request Detection
       Introduced in v9.13.0

       All  of  the  PSR  built-in parsers implement common pull/merge request identifier detection logic to extract pull/merge request numbers from the commit message regardless of the VCS platform. The
       parsers evaluate the subject line for a parenthesis-enclosed number at the end of the line. PSR's parsers will return a string value if a pull/merge request number is found in the commit  message.
       If no pull/merge request number is found, the parsers will return an empty string.

       Examples:

       All of the following will extract a MR number of "x123", where 'x' is the character prefix

       1. BitBucket: Merged in feat/my-awesome-feature  (pull request #123)

       2. GitHub: feat: add new feature  (#123)

       3. GitLab: fix: resolve an issue (!123)

                                                                                                       ----

   Common Issue Identifier Detection
       Introduced in v9.15.0

       All  of  the  PSR built-in parsers implement common issue identifier detection logic, which is similar to many VCS platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. The parsers will look for common
       issue closure text prefixes in the Git Trailer format in the commit message to identify and extract issue numbers. The detection logic is not strict to any specific issue tracker as we try to pro‐
       vide a flexible approach to identifying issue numbers but in order to be flexible, it is required to the use the Git Trailer format with a colon (:) as the token separator.

       PSR attempts to support all variants of issue closure text prefixes, but not all will work for your VCS. PSR supports the  following  case-insensitive  prefixes  and  their  conjugations  (plural,
       present, & past tense):

       • close (closes, closing, closed)

       • fix (fixes, fixing, fixed)

       • resolve (resolves, resolving, resolved)

       • implement (implements, implementing, implemented)

       PSR also allows for a more flexible approach to identifying more than one issue number without the need of extra git trailers (although PSR does support multiple git trailers). PSR support various
       list formats which can be used to identify more than one issue in a list. This format will not necessarily work on your VCS. PSR currently support the following list formats:

       • comma-separated (ex. Closes: #123, #456, #789)

       • space-separated (ex. resolve: #123 #456 #789)

       • semicolon-separated (ex. Fixes: #123; #456; #789)

       • slash-separated (ex. close: #123/#456/#789)

       • ampersand-separated (ex. Implement: #123 & #789)

       • and-separated (ex. Resolve: #123 and #456 and #789)

       • mixed (ex. Closed: #123, #456, and #789 or Fixes: #123, #456 & #789)

       All the examples above use the most common issue number prefix (#) but PSR is flexible to support other prefixes used by VCS platforms or issue trackers such as JIRA (ex. ABC-###).

       The  parsers  will  return a tuple of issue numbers as strings if any are found in the commit message. Strings are returned to ensure that the any issue number prefix characters are preserved (ex.
       #123 or ABC-123). If no issue numbers are found, the parsers will return an empty tuple.

   Common Release Notice Footer Detection
       Introduced in v9.18.0*

       All of the PSR built-in parsers implement common release notice footer detection logic to identify and extract a NOTICE git trailer that documents any additional release information the  developer
       wants  to provide to the software consumer. The idea extends from the concept of the BREAKING CHANGE: git trailer to document any breaking change descriptions but the NOTICE trailer is intended to
       document any information that is below the threshold of a breaking change while still important for the software consumer to be aware of. Common uses would be to provide  deprecation  warnings  or
       more  detailed change usage information for that release. Parsers will collapse single newlines after the NOTICE trailer into a single line paragraph. Commits may have more than one NOTICE trailer
       in a single commit message. Each ParsedCommit will have a release_notices attribute that is a tuple of string paragraphs to identify each release notice.

       In the default changelog and release notes template, these release notices will be formatted into their own section called Additional Release Information. Each will include any  commit  scope  de‐
       fined and each release notice in alphabetical order.

                                                                                                       ----

   Common Squash Commit Evaluation
       Introduced in v9.17.0

       All  of  the PSR built-in parsers implement common squash commit evaluation logic to identify and extract individual commit messages from a single squashed commit. The parsers will look for common
       squash commit delimiters and multiple matches of the commit message format to identify each individual commit message that was squashed. The parsers will return a list containing each commit  mes‐
       sage  as  a  separate commit object. Squashed commits will be evaluated individually for both the level bump and changelog generation. If no squash commits are found, a list with the single commit
       object will be returned.

       Currently, PSR has been tested against GitHub, BitBucket, and official git squash merge commit messages. GitLab does not have a default template for squash commit messages but  can  be  customized
       per project or server. If you are using GitLab, you will need to ensure that the squash commit message format is similar to the example below.

       Example:

       The following example will extract three separate commit messages from a single GitHub formatted squash commit message of conventional commit style:

          feat(config): add new config option (#123)

          * refactor(config): change the implementation of config loading

          * docs(configuration): defined new config option for the project

       When  parsed  with  the default conventional-commit parser with squash commits toggled on, the version bump will be determined by the highest level bump of the three commits (in this case, a minor
       bump because of the feature commit) and the release notes would look similar to the following:

          ## Features

          - **config**: add new config option (#123)

          ## Documentation

          - **configuration**: defined new config option for the project (#123)

          ## Refactoring

          - **config**: change the implementation of config loading (#123)

       Merge request numbers and commit hash values will be the same across all extracted commits. Additionally, any exclude_commit_patterns will be applied individually to each extracted  commit  so  if
       you are have an exclusion match for ignoring refactor commits, the second commit in the example above would be excluded from the changelog.

       IMPORTANT:
          When squash commit evaluation is enabled, if you squashed a higher level bump commit into the body of a lower level bump commit, the higher level bump commit will be evaluated as the level bump
          for the entire squashed commit. This includes breaking change descriptions.

                                                                                                       ----

   Customization
       Each  of  the built-in parsers can be customized by providing overrides in the commit_parser_options setting of the configuration file. This can be used to toggle parsing features on and off or to
       add, modify, or remove the commit types that are used to determine the level bump for a commit. Review the API documentation for the specific parser's options class to see what changes to the  de‐
       fault behavior can be made.

                                                                                                       ----

   Custom Parsers
       Custom parsers can be written to handle commit message styles that are not covered by the built-in parsers or by option customization of the built-in parsers.

       Python  Semantic Release provides several building blocks to help you write your parser.  To maintain compatibility with how Python Semantic Release will invoke your parser, you should use the ap‐
       propriate object as described below, or create your own object as a subclass of the original which maintains the same interface. Type parameters are defined where appropriate to assist with static
       type-checking.

       The commit_parser option, if set to a string which does not match one of Python Semantic Release's built-in commit parsers, will be used to attempt to dynamically import  a  custom  commit  parser
       class.

       In order to use your custom parser, you must provide how to import the module and class via the configuration option. There are two ways to provide the import string:

       1. File  Path  &  Class:  The  format  is "path/to/module_file.py:ClassName". This is the easiest way to provide a custom parser. This method allows you to store your custom parser directly in the
          repository with no additional installation steps. PSR will locate the file, load the module, and instantiate the class. Relative paths are recommended and it should be provided relative to  the
          current working directory. This import variant is available in v9.16.0 and later.

       2. Module Path & Class: The format is "package.module_name:ClassName". This method allows you to store your custom parser in a package that is installed in the same environment as PSR. This method
          is  useful if you want to share your custom parser across multiple repositories. To share it across multiple repositories generally you will need to publish the parser as its own separate pack‐
          age and then pip install it into the current virtual environment. You can also keep it in the same repository as your project as long as it is in the current directory of the  virtual  environ‐
          ment  and  is locatable by the Python import system. You may need to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable if you have a more complex directory structure.  This import variant is available in
          v8.0.0 and later.

          To test that your custom parser is importable, you can run the following command in the directory where PSR will be executed:

             python -c "from package.module_name import ClassName"

          NOTE:
             Remember this is basic python import rules so the package name is optional and generally packages are defined by a directory with __init__.py files.

   Tokens
       The tokens built into Python Semantic Release's commit parsing mechanism are inspired by both the error-handling mechanism in Rust's error handling and its implementation in  black.  It  is  docu‐
       mented  that catching exceptions in Python is slower than the equivalent guard implemented using if/else checking when exceptions are actually caught, so although try/except blocks are cheap if no
       exception is raised, commit parsers should always return an object such as ParseError instead of raising an error immediately. This is to avoid catching a potentially large number of  parsing  er‐
       rors being caught as the commit history of a repository is being parsed. Python Semantic Release does not raise an exception if a commit cannot be parsed.

       Python  Semantic  Release  uses ParsedCommit as the return type of a successful parse operation, and ParseError as the return type from an unsuccessful parse of a commit. You should review the API
       documentation linked to understand the fields available on each of these objects.

       It is important to note, the ParseError implements an additional method, raise_error. This method raises a CommitParseError with the message contained in the error field, as a convenience.

       In Python Semantic Release, the type semantic_release.commit_parser.token.ParseResult is defined as ParseResultType[ParsedCommit, ParseError], as a convenient shorthand.

       ParseResultType is a generic type, which is the Union of its two type parameters. One of the types in this union should be the type returned on a successful parse of the commit,  while  the  other
       should be the type returned on an unsuccessful parse of the commit.

       A custom parser result type, therefore, could be implemented as follows:

       • MyParsedCommit subclasses ParsedCommit

       • MyParseError subclasses ParseError

       • MyParseResult = ParseResultType[MyParsedCommit, MyParseError]

       Internally,  Python  Semantic Release uses isinstance() to determine if the result of parsing a commit was a success or not, so you should check that your custom result and error types return True
       from isinstance(<object>, ParsedCommit) and isinstance(<object>, ParseError) respectively.

       While it's not advisable to remove any of the fields that are available in the built-in token types, currently only the bump field of the successful result type is used to determine how  the  ver‐
       sion should be incremented as part of this release. However, it's perfectly possible to add additional fields to your tokens which can be populated by your parser; these fields will then be avail‐
       able on each commit in your changelog template, so you can make additional information available.

   Parser Options
       When  writing your own parser, you should accompany the parser with an "options" class which accepts the appropriate keyword arguments. This class' __init__ method should store the values that are
       needed for parsing appropriately. Python Semantic Release will pass any configuration options from the configuration file's commit_parser_options, into your custom parser options class. To  ensure
       that the configuration options are passed correctly, the options class should inherit from the ParserOptions class.

       The "options" class is used to validate the options which are configured in the repository, and to provide default values for these options where appropriate.

   Commit Parsers
       The  commit  parsers that are built into Python Semantic Release implement an instance method called parse, which takes a single parameter commit of type git.objects.commit.Commit, and returns the
       type ParseResultType.

       To be compatible with Python Semantic Release, a commit parser must subclass CommitParser.  A subclass must implement the following:

       • A class-level attribute parser_options, which must be set to ParserOptions or a subclass of this.

       • An __init__ method which takes a single parameter, options, that should be of the same type as the class' parser_options attribute.

       • A method, parse, which takes a single parameter commit that is of type git.objects.commit.Commit, and returns ParseResult, or a subclass of this.

       By default, the constructor for CommitParser will set the options parameter on the options attribute of the parser, so there is no need to override this in order to access self.options during  the
       parse  method.  However, if you have any parsing logic that needs to be done only once, it may be a good idea to perform this logic during parser instantiation rather than inside the parse method.
       The parse method will be called once per commit in the repository's history during parsing, so the effect of slow parsing logic within the parse method will be magnified significantly for projects
       with sizeable Git histories.

       Commit Parsers have two type parameters, "TokenType" and "OptionsType". The first is the type which is returned by the parse method, and the second is the type of  the  "options"  class  for  this
       parser.

       Therefore, a custom commit parser could be implemented via:

          class MyParserOptions(semantic_release.ParserOptions):
              def __init__(self, message_prefix: str) -> None:
                  self.prefix = message_prefix * 2

          class MyCommitParser(
              semantic_release.CommitParser[semantic_release.ParseResult, MyParserOptions]
          ):
              def parse(self, commit: git.objects.commit.Commit) -> semantic_release.ParseResult:
                  ...

   Version Change Reports
       When  using  the  cmd-version and cmd-changelog commands, Python Semantic Release (PSR) will generate a changelog and release notes for your project automatically in the default configuration. The
       changelog is rendered using the Jinja template engine, and in the default configuration, PSR will use a built-in template file to  render  the  changelog  at  the  file  location  defined  by  the
       changelog_file setting.

       Through  the  use  of  the  templating engine & the template_dir configuration setting, you can customize the appearance of your changelog and release notes content. You may also generate a set of
       files using your custom template directory and the templates will be rendered relative to the root of your repository.

       Because PSR uses a third-party library, Jinja, as its template engine, we do not include all the syntax within our documentation but rather you should refer to the Template Designer  Documentation
       for guidance on how to customize the appearance of your release files. If you would like to customize the template environment itself, then certain options are available to you via changelog envi‐
       ronment configuration.

       If you do not want to use the changelog generation features, you can disable changelog generation entirely during the cmd-version command by providing the --no-changelog command-line option.

   Using the Default Changelog
       If you don't provide any custom templates in the changelog.template_dir, the default changelog templates will be used to render the changelog.

       PSR provides two default changelog output formats:

       1. Markdown (.md), default

       2. reStructuredText (.rst), available since v9.11.0

       Both formats are kept in sync with one another to display the equivalent information in the respective format. The default changelog template is located in the data/templates/ directory within the
       PSR  package.  The  templates  are  written in modular style (ie. multiple files) and during the render process are ultimately combined together to render the final changelog output. The rendering
       start point is the CHANGELOG.{FORMAT_EXT}.j2 underneath the respective format directory.

       PSR provides a few configuration options to customize the default changelog output and can be found under the changelog.default_templates section as well as some common configuration options under
       the changelog section.

       To toggle the output format, you only need to set the changelog.default_templates.changelog_file file name to include the desired file extension (.md or .rst). If you would like a different exten‐
       sion for the resulting changelog file, but would like to still have control over the template format, you can set the changelog.default_templates.output_format configuration setting to the desired
       format.

       A common and highly-recommended configuration option is the changelog.exclude_commit_patterns setting which allows the user to define  regular  expressions  that  will  exclude  commits  from  the
       changelog output. This is useful to filter out change messages that are not relevant to your external consumers (ex. ci and test in the conventional commit standard) and only include the important
       changes that impact the consumer of your software.

       Another important configuration option is the changelog.mode setting which determines the behavior of the changelog generation. There are 2 modes that available that described in detail below.

       1. Initialization Mode when mode = "init".

       2. Update Mode when mode = "update".

   Initialization Mode
       When  using the initialization mode, the changelog file will be created from scratch using the entire git history and overwrite any existing changelog file. This is the default behavior introduced
       in v8.0.0. This is useful when you are trying to convert over to Python Semantic Release for the first time or when you want to automatically update the entire format of your changelog file.

       WARNING:
          If you have an existing changelog in the location you have configured with the changelog.changelog_file setting, PSR will overwrite the contents of this file on each release.

          Please make sure to refer to Migrating an Existing Changelog.

   Update Mode
       NOTE:
          Introduced in v9.10.0.

       When using the update mode, only the change information from the last release will be prepended into the existing changelog file (defined by the changelog.changelog_file). This mimics the behavior
       that was used in versions prior to v8.0.0 before the conversion to a templating engine but now uses the Jinja to accomplish the update. This mode is best suited for managing changes over the life‐
       time of your project when you may have a need to make manual changes or adjustments to the changelog and its not easily recreated with a template.

       How It Works

       In order to insert the new release information into an existing changelog file, your changelog file must have an insertion flag to indicate where the new release information  should  be  inserted.
       The  default  template  will read in your existing changelog file, split the content based on the insertion flag, and then recombine the content (including the insertion flag) with the new release
       information added after the insertion flag.

       The insertion flag is customizable through the changelog.insertion_flag setting. Generally, your insertion flag should be unique text to your changelog file to avoid any unexpected  behavior.  See
       the examples below.

       In the case where the insertion flag is NOT found in the existing changelog file, the changelog file will be re-written without any changes.

       If there is no existing changelog file found, then the changelog file will be initialized from scratch as if the mode was set to init, except the changelog.insertion_flag will be included into the
       newly created changelog file.

       TIP:
          We  have  accomplished changelog updating through the use of the Jinja templating and additional context filters and context variables. This is notable because in the case that you want to cus‐
          tomize your changelog template, you now can use the same logic to enable changelog updates of your custom template!

       Example

       Given your existing changelog looks like the following with a changelog.insertion_flag set to <!-- version list -->, when you run the cmd-version command, the new release information will  be  in‐
       serted after the insertion flag.

       Before

          # CHANGELOG

          <!-- version list -->

   Configuration Examples
       1. Goal: Configure an updating reStructuredText changelog with a custom insertion flag within pyproject.toml.

             [tool.semantic_release.changelog]
             mode = "update"
             insertion_flag = "..\n    All versions below are listed in reverse chronological order"

             [tool.semantic_release.changelog.default_templates]
             changelog_file = "CHANGELOG.rst"
             output_format = "rst"  # optional because of the file extension

       2. Goal: Configure an updating Markdown changelog with custom file name and default insertion flag within a separate config file releaserc.json.

             {
               "semantic_release": {
                 "changelog": {
                   "mode": "update",
                   "default_templates": {
                     "changelog_file": "docs/HISTORY",
                     "output_format": "md"
                   }
                 }
               }
             }

       3. Goal: Configure an initializing reStructuredText changelog with filtered conventional commits patterns and merge commits within a custom config file releaserc.toml.

             [semantic_release.changelog]
             mode = "init"
             default_templates = { changelog_file = "docs/CHANGELOG.rst" }
             exclude_commit_patterns = [
               '''chore(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
               '''ci(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
               '''refactor(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
               '''style(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
               '''test(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
               '''build\((?!deps\): .+)''',
               '''Merged? .*''',
             ]

       If  identified  or supported by the parser, the default changelog templates will include a separate section of breaking changes and additional release information. Refer to the commit parsing sec‐
       tion to see how to write commit messages that will be properly parsed and displayed in these sections.

   Using the Default Release Notes
       PSR has the capability to generate release notes as part of the publishing of a new version similar to the changelog. The release notes are generated using a Jinja template and posted to the  your
       remote version control server (VCS) such as GitHub, GitLab, etc during the cmd-version command. PSR provides a default built-in template out-of-the-box for generating release notes.

       The difference between the changelog and release notes is that the release notes only contain the changes for the current release. Due to the modularity of the PSR templates, the format is similar
       to an individual version of the default changelog but may include other version specific information.

       At this time, the default template for version release notes is only available in Markdown format for all VCS types.

       If  you want to review what the default release notes look like you can use the following command to print the release notes to the console (remove any configuration for defining a custom template
       directory):

          # Create a current tag
          git tag v1.0.0
          semantic-release --noop changelog --post-to-release-tag v1.0.0

       The default template provided by PSR will respect the mask_initial_release setting and will also add a comparison link to the previous release if one exists without customization.

       As of v9.18.0, the default release notes will also include a statement to declare which license the project was released under. PSR determines which license  to  declare  based  on  the  value  of
       project.license-expression in the pyproject.toml file as defined in the PEP 639 specification.

       SEE ALSO:

          • To personalize your release notes, see the Custom Release Notes section.

   Custom Changelogs
       If  you  would  like  to  customize  the  appearance  of  your  changelog,  you  can  create your own custom templates and configure PSR to render your templates instead during the cmd-version and
       cmd-changelog commands.

       To use a custom template, you need to create a directory within your repository and set the template_dir setting to the name of this directory. The default name is "templates".

       Templates are identified by giving a .j2 extension to the template file. Any such templates have the .j2 extension removed from the target file. Therefore, to render an output  file  foo.csv,  you
       should create a template called foo.csv.j2 within your template directory.

       If  you  have additional files that you would like to render alongside your changelog, you can place these files within the template directory. A file within your template directory which does not
       end in .j2 will not be treated as a template; it will be copied to its target location without being rendered by the template engine.

       TIP:
          Hidden files within the template directory (i.e. filenames that begin with a period ".") are excluded from the rendering process. Hidden folders within the template directory are also excluded,
          along with all files and folders contained within them. This is useful for defining macros or other template components that should not be rendered individually.

       TIP:
          When initially starting out at customizing your own changelog templates, you should reference the default template embedded within PSR. The template  directory  is  located  at  data/templates/
          within the PSR package. Within our templates directory we separate out each type of commit parser (e.g. conventional) and the content format type (e.g. markdown). You can copy this directory to
          your repository's templates directory and then customize the templates to your liking.

   Directory Structure
       When the templates are rendered, files within the templates directory tree are output to the location within your repository that has the same relative path to the root of your project as the rel‐
       ative path of the template within the templates directory.

       Example

       An example project has the following structure:

          example-project/
          ├── src/
          │   └── example_project/
          │       └── __init__.py
          └── ch-templates/
              ├── CHANGELOG.md.j2
              ├── .components/
              │   └── authors.md.j2
              ├── .macros.j2
              ├── src/
              │   └── example_project/
              │       └── data/
              │           └── data.json.j2
              └── static/
                  └── config.cfg

       And a custom templates folder configured via the following snippet in pyproject.toml:

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog]
          template_dir = "ch-templates"

       After running a release with Python Semantic Release, the directory structure of the project will now look like this (excluding the template directory):

          example-project/
          ├── CHANGELOG.md
          ├── src/
          │   └── example_project/
          │       ├── data/
          │       │   └── data.json
          │       └── __init__.py
          └── static/
              └── config.cfg

       Importantly, note the following:

       • There is no top-level .macros file created, because hidden files are excluded from the rendering process.

       • There is no top-level .components directory created, because hidden folders and all files and folders contained within it are excluded from the rendering process.

       • The .components/authors.md.j2 file is not rendered directly, however, it is used as a component to the CHANGELOG.md.j2 via an include statement in the changelog template.

       • To render data files into the src/ folder, the path to which the template should be rendered has to be created within the ch-templates directory.

       • The ch-templates/static folder is created at the top-level of the project, and the file ch-templates/static/config.cfg is copied, not rendered to the new top-level static folder.

       You  may  wish  to  leverage this behavior to modularize your changelog template, to define macros in a separate file, or to reference static data which you would like to avoid duplicating between
       your template environment and the remainder of your project.

   Changelog Template Context
       During the rendering of a directory tree, Python Semantic Release provides information about the history of the project available within the templating environment in order for it to  be  used  to
       generate the changelog and other desired documents.

       Important  project information is provided to the templating environment through the global variable context or ctx for short. Within the template environment, the context object has the following
       attributes:

       • changelog_insertion_flag (str): the insertion flag used to determine where the new release information  should  be  inserted  into  the  changelog  file.  This  value  is  passed  directly  from
         changelog.insertion_flag.

         Introduced in v9.10.0.

         Example Usage:

            {%  set changelog_parts = prev_changelog_contents.split(
                    ctx.changelog_insertion_flag, maxsplit=1
                )
            %}

       • changelog_mode (Literal["init", "update"]): the mode of the changelog generation currently being used. This can be used to determine different rendering logic. This value is passed directly from
         the changelog.mode configuration setting.

         Introduced in v9.10.0.

         Example Usage:

            {%    if ctx.changelog_mode == "init"
            %}{%    include ".changelog_init.md.j2"
            %}{#
            #}{%  elif ctx.changelog_mode == "update"
            %}{%    include ".changelog_update.md.j2"
            %}{#
            #}{%  endif
            %}

       • history (ReleaseHistory): the ReleaseHistory instance for the project (See the Release History section for more information).

         Example Usage:

            {%    set unreleased_commits = ctx.history.unreleased | dictsort
            %}{%  for release in context.history.released.values()
            %}{%    include ".versioned_changes.md.j2"
            #}{%  endfor
            %}

       • hvcs_type (str): the name of the VCS server type currently configured. This can be used to determine which filters are available or different rendering logic.

         Introduced in v9.6.0.

         Example Usage:

            {%    if ctx.hvcs_type == "github"
            %}{{   "29" | pull_request_url
            }}{#
            #}{%  elif ctx.hvcs_type == "gitlab"
            %}{{    "29" | merge_request_url
            }}{#
            #}{%  endif
            %}

       • mask_initial_release   (bool):   a   boolean   value   indicating   whether   the   initial  release  should  be  masked  with  a  generic  message.  This  value  is  passed  directly  from  the
         changelog.default_templates.mask_initial_release configuration setting.

         Introduced in v9.14.0.

         Example Usage:

            #}{%  if releases | length == 1 and ctx.mask_initial_release
            %}{#    # On a first release, generate a generic message
            #}{%    include ".components/first_release.md.j2"
            %}{%  else
            %}{#    # Not the first release
            #}{%    include ".components/versioned_changes.md.j2"
            %}{%  endif
            %}

       • repo_name (str): the name of the current repository parsed from the Git url.

         Example Usage:

            {{ ctx.repo_name }}

            example_repo

       • repo_owner (str): the owner of the current repository parsed from the Git url.

         Example Usage:

            {{ ctx.repo_owner }}

            example_org

       • prev_changelog_file (str): the path to the previous changelog file that should be updated with the new release information. This value is passed directly from changelog.changelog_file.

         Introduced in v9.10.0.

         Example Usage:

            {% set prev_changelog_contents = prev_changelog_file | read_file | safe %}

   Release History
       A ReleaseHistory object has two attributes: released and unreleased.

       The unreleased attribute is of type Dict[str, List[ParseResult]]. Each commit in the current branch's commit history since the last release on this branch is grouped by the type attribute  of  the
       ParsedCommit returned by the commit parser, or if the parser returned a ParseError then the result is grouped under the "unknown" key.

       For this reason, every element of ReleaseHistory.unreleased["unknown"] is a ParseError, and every element of every other value in ReleaseHistory.unreleased is of type ParsedCommit.

       Typically,  commit types will be "feature", "fix", "breaking", though the specific types are determined by the parser. For example, the EmojiCommitParser uses a textual representation of the emoji
       corresponding to the most significant change introduced in a commit (e.g. ":boom:") as the different commit types. As a template author, you are free to customize how these are  presented  in  the
       rendered template.

       NOTE:
          If  you  are  using  a  custom commit parser following the guide at Custom Parsers, your custom implementations of ParseResult, ParseError and ParsedCommit will be used in place of the built-in
          types.

       The released attribute is of type Dict[Version, Release]. The keys of this dictionary correspond to each version released within this branch's history, and are of type Version.  You  can  use  the
       as_tag() method to render these as the Git tag that they correspond to inside your template.

       A Release object has an elements attribute, which has the same structure as the unreleased attribute of a ReleaseHistory; that is, elements is of type Dict[str, List[ParseResult]], where every el‐
       ement of elements["unknown"] is a ParseError, and elements of every other value correspond to the type attribute of the ParsedCommit returned by the commit parser.

       The  commits  represented within each ReleaseHistory.released[version].elements grouping are the commits which were made between version and the release corresponding to the previous version. That
       is, given two releases Version(1, 0, 0) and Version(1, 1, 0), ReleaseHistory.released[Version(1, 0, 0)].elements contains only commits made after the release of Version(1, 0, 0) up to and  includ‐
       ing the release of Version(1, 1, 0).

       To maintain a consistent order of subsections in the changelog headed by the commit type, it's recommended to use Jinja's dictsort filter.

       Each Release object also has the following attributes:

       • tagger: git.Actor: The tagger who tagged the release.

       • committer: git.Actor: The committer who made the release commit.

       • tagged_date: datetime: The date and time at which the release was tagged.

          • Built-in Commit Parsers

          • Commit Parser Tokens

          • git.Actor

          • datetime.strftime Format Codes

   Changelog Template Filters
       In  addition  to the context variables, PSR seeds the template environment with a set of custom functions (commonly called filters in Jinja terminology) for use within the template. Filter's first
       argument is always piped (|) to the function while any additional arguments are passed in parentheses like normal function calls.

       The filters provided vary based on the VCS configured and available features:

       • autofit_text_width (Callable[[textStr, maxWidthInt, indent_sizeInt], textStr]): given a text string, fit the text to the maximum width provided. This filter is useful when you want to wrap  text
         to a specific width. The filter will attempt to break the text at word boundaries and will indent the text by the amount specified in the indent_size parameter.

         Introduced in v9.12.0.

         Example Usage:

            {{ "This is a long string that needs to be wrapped to a specific width" | autofit_text_width(40, 4) }}

         Markdown Output:

            This is a long string that needs to be
                wrapped to a specific width

       • convert_md_to_rst  (Callable[[MdStr],  RstStr]):  given a markdown string, convert it to reStructuredText format. This filter is useful when building a reStructuredText changelog but your commit
         messages are in markdown format. It is utilized by the default RST changelog template. It is limited in its ability to convert all markdown to reStructuredText, but it handles most common  cases
         (bold, italics, inline-raw, etc.) within commit messages.

         Introduced in v9.11.0.

         Example Usage:

            {{  "\n* %s (`%s`_)\n" | format(
                  commit.message.rstrip() | convert_md_to_rst,
                  commit.short_hash,
                )
            }}

       • create_pypi_url(package_name:  str,  version: str = ""): given a package name and an optional version, return a URL to the PyPI page for the package. If a version is provided, the URL will point
         to the specific version page. If no version is provided, the URL will point to the package page.

         Introduced in v9.18.0.

         Example Usage:

            {{ "example-package" | create_pypi_url }}
            {{ "example-package" | create_pypi_url("1.0.0") }}

         Markdown Output:

            https://pypi.org/project/example-package

         numbers  from  lowest to highest. This filter is useful when you want to sort issue numbers or other strings that have a numeric component in them but cannot be cast to a number directly to sort
         them. If you want to sort the strings in reverse order, you can pass a boolean value of True as the second argument.

         Introduced in v9.16.0.

         Example Usage:

            {{ ["#222", "#1023", "#444"] | sort_numerically }}

   Example
       The following template is a simple example of how to render a changelog using the PSR template context to create a changelog in Markdown format.

       Configuration: pyproject.toml

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog]
          template_dir = "templates"

       Template: templates/CHANGELOG.md.j2

          # CHANGELOG

          {%    for version, release in ctx.history.released.items()
          %}{{
                  "## %s (%s)" | format(version.as_tag(), release.tagged_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))

          }}{%    for type_, commits in release["elements"] if type_ != "unknown" | dictsort
          %}{{
                    "### %s" | format(type_ | title)

          }}{%      for commit in commits
          %}{{
                      "* %s ([`%s`](%s))" | format(
                        commit.descriptions[0] | capitalize,
                        commit.hexsha[:7],
                        commit.hexsha | commit_hash_url,
                      )

          }}{%      endfor
          %}{%    endfor
          %}{%  endfor
          %}

       Result: CHANGELOG.md

          # CHANGELOG

          ## v1.1.0 (2022-01-01)

          ### Feature

          * Added a new feature ([`a1b2c3d`](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/a1b2c3d))

          ## v1.0.0 (2021-12-31)

          ### Fix

          * Resolved divide by zero error ([`e4f5g6h`](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/e4f5g6h))

       It is important to note that the template utilizes the context variable to extract the project history as well as the commit_hash_url filter to generate a URL to the remote VCS  for  each  commit.
       Both of these are injected into the template environment by PSR.

   Custom Release Notes
       If  you  would like to customize the appearance of your release notes, you can add a hidden file named .release_notes.md.j2 at the root of your changelog.template_dir. This file will automatically
       be detected and used to render the release notes during the cmd-version and cmd-changelog commands.

       A similar template rendering mechanism is used to render the release notes as is used for the changelog. There are minor differences in the context available to the release notes template but  the
       template directory structure and modularity is maintained.

       TIP:
          When  initially starting out at customizing your own release notes template, you should reference the default template embedded within PSR. The release notes template can be found in the direc‐
          tory data/templates/<parser>/md within the PSR package.

   Release Notes Context
       All of the changelog's template context is exposed to the Jinja template when rendering the release notes.

       Additionally, the following two globals are available to the template:

       • release (Release): contains metadata about the content of the release, as parsed from commit logs

         Introduced in v8.0.0.

       • version (Version): contains metadata about the software version to be released and its git tag

         Introduced in v8.0.0.

   Example
       Below is an example template that can be used to render release notes (it's similar to GitHub's automatically generated release notes):

       Configuration: pyproject.toml

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog]
          template_dir = "templates"

       Template: templates/.release_notes.md.j2

          ## What's Changed
          {%    for type_, commits in release["elements"] | dictsort
          %}{%-   if type_ != "unknown"

          ## What's Changed

          ### Feature

          * Added a new feature by John Doe in [`a1b2c3d`](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/a1b2c3d)

   Migrating an Existing Changelog
       v9.10.0 or greater

       Migrating an existing changelog is simple with Python Semantic Release! To preserve your existing changelog, follow these steps:

       1. Set the changelog.mode to "update" in your configuration file. This will ensure that only the new release information is added to your existing changelog file.

       2. Set the changelog.insertion_flag to a unique string. You may use the default value or set it to a unique string that is not present in your existing changelog file. This flag is used to  deter‐
          mine where the new release information should be inserted into your existing changelog.

       3. Add the insertion flag to your changelog file. This must match the value you set in step 2. The insertion flag should be placed in the location above where you would like the new release infor‐
          mation to be inserted.

       NOTE:
          If  you are trying to convert an existing changelog to a new format, you will need to do most of the conversion manually (or rebuild via init and modify) and make sure to include your insertion
          flag into the format of the new changelog.

       Prior to v9.10.0

       If you have an existing changelog that you would like to preserve, you will need to add the contents of the changelog file to your changelog template - either directly or via Jinja's include tag.

       If you would like only the history from your next release onwards to be rendered into the changelog in addition to the existing changelog, you can add an if statement based upon  the  versions  in
       the keys of context.released.

   Upgrading Templates
       As PSR evolves, new features and improvements are added to the templating engine. If you have created your own custom templates, you may need to update them to take advantage of some new features.
       Below are some instructions on how to upgrade your templates to gain the benefits of the new features.

   Incrementally Updating Changelog Template
       NOTE:
          This section is only relevant if you are upgrading from a version of PSR greater than v8.0.0 and prior to v9.10.0 and have created your own custom templates.

       If you have previously created your own custom templates and would like to gain the benefits of the new updating changelog feature, you will need to make a few changes to your existing templates.

       The  following steps are a few suggestions to help upgrade your templates but primarily you should review the embedded default templates in the PSR package for a full example. You can find the de‐
       fault templates at data/templates/ directory.

       1. Add a conditional to check the changelog_mode.  This  will  allow  you  to  determine  if  you  should  render  the  entire  changelog  or  just  the  new  release  information.  See  data/tem‐
          plates/*/md/CHANGELOG.md.j2 for reference.

       2. Use  the  new  read_file  filter  to  read  in the existing changelog file ctx.prev_changelog_file. This will allow you to include the existing changelog content in your new changelog file. See
          data/templates/*/md/.components/changelog_update.md.j2 for reference.

       3. Split the changelog content based on the insertion flag. This will allow you to insert the new release  information  after  the  insertion  flag  (ctx.changelog_insertion_flag).  See  data/tem‐
          plates/*/md/.components/changelog_update.md.j2 for reference.

       4. Print  the  leading  content  before  the  insertion  flag.  This  ensures  you maintain any content that should be included before the new release information.  See data/templates/*/md/.compo‐
          nents/changelog_update.md.j2 for reference.

       5. Print your insertion flag. This is imperative to ensure that the resulting changelog can be updated in the future. See data/templates/*/md/.components/changelog_update.md.j2 for reference.

       6. Print the new release information. Be sure to consider both unreleased and released commits during this step because of the cmd-changelog command that can be run  at  any  time.  See  data/tem‐
          plates/*/md/.components/changelog_update.md.j2 for reference.

       7. Print  the  trailing  content  after  the  insertion  flag.  This  ensures  you  maintain any content that should be included after the new release information.  See data/templates/*/md/.compo‐
          nents/changelog_update.md.j2 for reference.

       TIP:
          Modularity of your templates is key to handling both modes of changelog generation. Reference the default templates for examples on how we handle both  modes  and  defensively  handle  numerous
          breaking scenarios.

       TIP:
          If you are having trouble upgrading your templates, please post a question on the PSR GitHub

   Multibranch Releases
       Python Semantic Release supports releases from multiple branches within your Git repository. You can elect to have a branch or set of branches create releases or prereleases. There are no restric‐
       tions enforced on how you set up your releases, but be aware that if you create new releases from multiple branches, or prereleases from multiple independent branches using the same prerelease to‐
       ken, there is a chance that Python Semantic Release will calculate the next version to be the same on more than one branch (leading to an error that a Git tag already exists).

       NOTE:
          A "prerelease token" is the string used to suffix onto the 3-digit form of a full semantic version. For example, in the version 1.2.3-beta.1, the prerelease token is "beta"

          Typical  strings  used  for pre-release tokens include "alpha", "beta", "dev" and "rc".  These tend to indicate a level of maturity of the software associated with the version, but the specific
          meaning of each string is up to the project to decide.

          Generally, it's good practice to maintain a single branch from which full releases are made, and one branch at a time for each type of prerelease (alpha, beta, rc, etc).

       If you absolutely require tagging and (pre-)releases to take place from multiple branches where there's a risk that tags could conflict between branches, you can use the  --build-metadata  command
       line  argument to attach additional information (such as the branch name) to the tag in order to uniquely distinguish it from any other tags that might be calculated against other branches. Such a
       situation may occur in the following scenario:

                           O ----------- O      <---- feature-1
                          /          "feat: abc"
                         /
             O -------- O --------------- O    <---- main
          v1.0.0     v1.1.0
                          \
                           O ----------- O    <---- feature-2
                                     "feat: 123"

       Suppose that Python Semantic Release has been configured to use the same prerelease token "alpha" for all feature-* branches, and the default tag format  "v{version}".  In  this  case,  running  a
       pre-release from branch feature-1 will recognize that since the last release, 1.1.0, a feature has been introduced and therefore the next tag to be applied to feature-1 will be v1.2.0-alpha.1.

       However,  suppose  we then try to run a release against feature-2. This will also recognize that a feature has been introduced against the last released version of v1.1.0 and therefore will try to
       create the tag v1.2.0-alpha.1, leading to an error as this tag was already created against feature-1.

       To get around this issue, you can pass the branch name as part of the build metadata:

          semantic-release version --build-metadata $(git branch --show-current)

       This would lead to the tag v1.2.0-alpha.1+feature-1 and v1.2.0-alpha.1+feature-2 being applied to branches feature-1 and feature-2, respectively. Note that "build metadata MUST be ignored" per the
       semver specification when comparing two versions, so these two prereleases would be considered equivalent semantic versions, but when merged to the  branch  configured  to  produce  full  releases
       (main), if released separately the changes from each branch would be released in two versions that would be considered different according to the semver specification.

       NOTE:
          If  you  have  tags in your Git repository that are not valid semantic versions (which have then been formatted into your tag_format), these tags will be ignored for the purposes of calculating
          the next version.

   Configuring Multibranch Releases
       Within your configuration file, you can create one or more groups of branches ("release groups") that produce a certain type of release. Options are configured at the group level, and the group to
       use is chosen based on the current branch name against which Python Semantic Release is running.

       Each release group is configured as a nested mapping under the tool.semantic_release.branches key in pyproject.toml, or the equivalent structure in other formats. the mapping requires a single key
       that is used as a name for the release group, which can help to identify it in log messages but has no effect on the behavior of the release. For example, Python Semantic Release has only one  re‐
       lease group by default with the name main.

       Inside each release group, the following key-value pairs can be set:
                                                              ┌──────────────────┬──────────┬─────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┐

       WARNING:
          If two release groups have overlapping "match" patterns, i.e. a the name of a branch could theoretically match both patterns, then the release group which is defined first in your configuration
          file is used.

          Because of this, it's recommended that you place release groups with more specific match patterns higher up in your configuration file than those with patterns that would match a broader  range
          of branch names.

       For  example,  suppose a project currently on version 1.22.4 is working on a new major version. The project wants to create a branch called 2.x.x against which they will develop the new major ver‐
       sion, and they would like to create "release candidate" ("rc") prereleases from this branch.  There are also a number of new features to integrate,  and  the  project  has  agreed  that  all  such
       branches  should  be named according to the convention next-{developer initials}-{issue number}, leading to branches named similarly to next-bc-prj-123. The project would like to release with tags
       that include some way to identify the branch and date on which the release was made from the tag.

       This project would be able to leverage the following configuration to achieve the above requirements from their release configuration:

          [tool.semantic_release.branches.main]
          match = "(main|master)"
          prerelease = false

          [tool.semantic_release.branches."2.x.x"]
          match = "2.x.x"
          prerelease = true
          prerelease_token = "rc"

          [tool.semantic_release.branches."2.x.x New Features"]
          match = "next-\\w+-prj-\\d+"
          prerelease = true
          prerelease_token = "alpha"

       In a CI pipeline, the following command would allow attaching the date and branch name to the versions that are produced (note this example uses the UNIX date command):

          semantic-release version \
             --build-metadata "$(git branch --show-current).$(date +%Y%m%d)"

       This would lead to versions such as 1.1.1+main.20221127 or 2.0.0-rc.4+2.x.x.20221201.

       NOTE:
          Remember that is always possible to override the release rules configured by using the cmd-version-option-force-level and cmd-version-option-as-prerelease flags.

   Strict Mode
       Strict Mode is enabled by use of the strict parameter to the main command for Python Semantic Release. Strict Mode alters the behavior of Python Semantic Release when certain  conditions  are  en‐
       countered  that  prevent Python Semantic Release from performing an action. Typically, this will result in a warning becoming an error, or a different exit code (0 vs non-zero) being produced when
       Python Semantic Release exits early.

       For example:

          #!/usr/bin/bash

          set -euo pipefail

          git checkout $NOT_A_RELEASE_BRANCH

          pip install \
             black \
             isort \
             twine \
             pytest \
             python-semantic-release

          isort .  # sort imports
          black .  # format the code
          pytest   # test the code
          semantic-release --strict version  # ERROR - not a release branch
          twine upload dist/*  # publish the code

       Using Strict Mode with the --strict flag ensures this simple pipeline will fail while running semantic-release, as the non-zero exit code will cause it to stop when combined with the -e option.

       Without Strict Mode, the semantic-release command will exit with code 0, causing the above pipeline to continue.

       The specific effects of enabling Strict Mode are detailed below.

   Non-Release Branches
       When running in Strict Mode, invoking Python Semantic Release on a non-Release branch will cause an error with a non-zero exit code. This means that you can prevent an automated script  from  run‐
       ning further against branches you do not want to release from, for example in multibranch CI pipelines.

       Running  without  Strict  Mode  will allow subsequent steps in the pipeline to also execute, but be aware that certain actions that Python Semantic Release may perform for you will likely not have
       been carried out, such as writing to files or creating a git commit in your repository.

       SEE ALSO:

          • Multibranch Releases

   Version Already Released/No Release To Be Made
       When Strict Mode is not enabled and Python Semantic Release identifies that no release needs to be made, it will exit with code 0. You can cause Python Semantic Release to raise an error if no re‐
       lease needs to be made by enabling Strict Mode.

   Configuration
       Python Semantic Release is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your project's needs. It supports various runtime environments and can be integrated with different CI/CD services.

       1. Check out our set of configuration guides to help walk you through the set up of common project customizations.

       2. Dive in deep and explore the full set of possible customization options.

       3. Go Automatic and Configure your CI/CD services to use Python Semantic Release.

   Configuration Guides
       This section provides detailed guides on how to configure PSR for various use cases and integrations. It is recommended to complete the Getting Started Guide first before diving  into  these  more
       specific configurations.

   Releasing Packages from a Monorepo
       A  monorepo (mono-repository) is a software development strategy where code for multiple projects is stored in a single source control system. This approach streamlines and consolidates configura‐
       tion, but introduces complexities when using automated tools like Python Semantic Release (PSR).

       Previously, PSR offered limited compatibility with monorepos. As of v10.4.0, PSR introduces the Conventional Commits Monorepo Parser, designed specifically  for  monorepo  environments.  To  fully
       leverage this new parser, you must configure your monorepo as described below.

   Configuring PSR
   Example: Simple
       Directory  Structure: PSR does not yet support a single, workspace-level configuration definition. This means each package in the monorepo requires its own PSR configuration file. A compatible and
       common monorepo file structure looks like:

       This is the most basic monorepo structure, where each package is self-contained with its own configuration files, documentation, and CHANGELOG files. To release  a  package,  change  your  current
       working directory to the package directory and execute PSR's cmd-version. PSR will automatically read the package's pyproject.toml, looking for the [tool.semantic_release] section to determine the
       package's versioning and release configuration, then search up the file tree to find the Git repository.

       Because  there  is  no workspace-level configuration, you must duplicate any common PSR configuration in each package's configuration file. Customize each configuration for each package to specify
       how PSR should distinguish between commits.

       With the example file structure above, here is an example configuration file for each package:

          # FILE: pkg1/pyproject.toml
          [project]
          name = "pkg1"
          version = "1.0.0"

          [tool.semantic_release]
          commit_parser = "conventional-monorepo"
          commit_message = """\
          chore(release): pkg1@{version}`

          Automatically generated by python-semantic-release
          """
          tag_format = "pkg1-v{version}"
          version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:project.version"]

          [tool.semantic_release.commit_parser_options]
          path_filters = ["."]
          scope_prefix = "pkg1-"

          # FILE: pkg2/pyproject.toml
          [project]
          name = "pkg2"
          version = "1.0.0"

          [tool.semantic_release]
          commit_parser = "conventional-monorepo"
          commit_message = """\
          chore(release): pkg2@{version}`

          Automatically generated by python-semantic-release
          """
          tag_format = "pkg2-v{version}"
          version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:project.version"]

          [tool.semantic_release.commit_parser_options]
          path_filters = ["."]
          scope_prefix = "pkg2-"

       These are the minimum configuration options required for each package. Note the use of tag_format to distinguish tags  between  packages.  The  commit  parser  options  are  specific  to  the  new
       Conventional  Commits Monorepo Parser and play a significant role in identifying which commits are relevant to each package. Since you are expected to change directories to each package before re‐
       leasing, file paths in each configuration file should be relative to the package directory.

       Each package also defines a slightly different commit_message to reflect the package name in each message. This helps clarify which release number is being updated in the commit history.

   Release Steps
       Given the following Git history of a monorepo using a GitHub Flow branching strategy (without CI/CD): [image]

       To manually release both packages, run:

          cd packages/pkg1
          semantic-release version
          # 1.0.1 (tag: pkg1-v1.0.1)

          cd ../pkg2
          semantic-release version
          # 1.1.0 (tag: pkg2-v1.1.0)

       After releasing both packages, the resulting Git history will look like: [image]

   Considerations
       1. Custom Changelogs: Managing changelogs can be tricky depending on where you want to write the changelog files. In this simple example, the changelog is located within  each  package  directory,
          and the changelog template does not have any package-specific formatting or naming convention. You can use one shared template directory at the root of the project and configure each package to
          point to the shared template directory.

          # FILE: pkg1/pyproject.toml
          [tool.semantic_release]
          template_dir = "../../config/release-templates"

          # FILE: pkg2/pyproject.toml
          [tool.semantic_release]
          template_dir = "../../config/release-templates"

       2. Package  Prereleases:  Creating  pre-releases  is possible, but it is recommended to use package-prefixed branch names to avoid collisions between packages. For example, to enable alpha pre-re‐
          leases for new features in both packages, use the following configuration:

          # FILE: pkg1/pyproject.toml
          [tool.semantic_release.branches.alpha-release]
          match = "^pkg1/feat/.+"                       # <-- note pkg1 prefix
          prerelease = true
          prerelease_token = "alpha"

          # FILE: pkg2/pyproject.toml
          [tool.semantic_release.branches.alpha-release]
          match = "^pkg2/feat/.+"                       # <-- note pkg2 prefix
          prerelease = true
          prerelease_token = "alpha"

                                                                                                       ----

   Example: Advanced
       If you want to consolidate documentation into a single top-level directory, the setup becomes more complex. In this example, there is a common documentation folder at the top level, and each pack‐
       age has its own subfolder within the documentation folder.

       Due to naming conventions, PSR cannot automatically accomplish this with its default changelog templates. For this scenario, you must copy the internal PSR templates into a custom directory  (even
       if you do not modify them) and add custom scripting to prepare for each release.

       The directory structure looks like:

              └── release-pkg2.sh

       Each  package  should  point to the docs/templates/ directory to use a common release notes template. PSR ignores hidden files and directories when searching for template files to create, allowing
       you to hide shared templates in the directory for use in your release setup script.

       Here is our configuration file for package 1 (package 2 is similarly defined):

          # FILE: pkg1/pyproject.toml
          [project]
          name = "pkg1"
          version = "1.0.0"

          [tool.semantic_release]
          commit_parser = "conventional-monorepo"
          commit_message = """\
          chore(release): Release `pkg1@{version}`

          Automatically generated by python-semantic-release
          """
          tag_format = "pkg1-v{version}"
          version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:project.version"]

          [tool.semantic_release.commit_parser_options]
          path_filters = [
              ".",
              "../../../docs/source/pkg1/**",
          ]
          scope_prefix = "pkg1-"

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog]
          template_dir = "../../../docs/templates"
          mode = "update"
          exclude_commit_patterns = [
              '''^chore(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''^ci(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''^refactor(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''^style(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''^test(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''^Initial [Cc]ommit''',
          ]

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog.default_templates]
          # To enable update mode: this value must set here because the default is not the
          # same as the default in the other package & must be the final destination filename
          # for the changelog relative to this file
          changelog_file = "../../../docs/source/pkg1/changelog.md"

       Note: In this configuration, we added path filters for additional documentation files related to the package so that the changelog will include documentation changes as well.

       Next, define a release script to set up the common changelog templates in the correct directory format so PSR will create the desired files at the proper locations. Following the Custom Changelogs
       reference, you must define the folder structure from the root of the project within the templates directory so PSR will properly lay down the files across the repository. The script cleans up  any
       previous templates, dynamically creates the necessary directories, and copies over the shared templates into a package-named directory. Now you are prepared to run PSR for a release of pkg1.

          #!/bin/bash
          # FILE: scripts/release-pkg1.sh

          set -euo pipefail

          PROJECT_ROOT="$(dirname "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")")"
          VIRTUAL_ENV="$PROJECT_ROOT/.venv"

          PACKAGE_NAME="pkg1"

          cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" || exit 1

          # Setup documentation template
          pushd "docs/templates" >/dev/null || exit 1

          rm -rf docs/
          mkdir -p "docs/source/"
          cp -r .base_changelog_template/ "docs/source/$PACKAGE_NAME"

          popd >/dev/null || exit 1

          # Release the package
          pushd "packages/$PACKAGE_NAME" >/dev/null || exit 1

          printf '%s\n' "Releasing $PACKAGE_NAME..."
          "$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/semantic-release" -v version --no-push

          popd >/dev/null || exit 1

       That's it! This example demonstrates how to set up a monorepo with shared changelog templates and a consolidated documentation folder for multiple packages.

   Ultraviolet (uv) Integration
       uv  is  an extremely fast Python package and project manager that provides a modern alternative to pip and venv. It provides a lot of features that solve the common problems of Python package man‐
       agement but it also introduces a few quirks that need to be taken into account when using Python Semantic Release.

       IMPORTANT:
          Prerequisite: Make sure you have run through the Getting Started Guide before proceeding with this guide.

   Updating the uv.lock
       One of the best features of uv is that it automatically generates a lock file (uv.lock) that contains the exact versions of all the dependencies used in your project. The lock  file  is  generated
       when you run the uv install command, and it is used to ensure that CI workflows are repeatable and development environments are consistent.

       When creating a new release using Python Semantic Release, PSR will update the version in the project's definition file (e.g., pyproject.toml) to indicate the new version.  Unfortunately, this ac‐
       tion  will  cause  uv to fail on the next execution because the lock file will be out of sync with the project's definition file. There are two ways to resolve this issue depending on your prefer‐
       ence:

       1. Add a step to your build command: Modify your semantic_release.build_command to include the command to update the lock file and stage it for commit.  This is commonly used with the  GitHub  Ac‐
          tion and other CI/CD tools when you are building the artifact at the time of release.

             [tool.semantic_release]
             build_command = """
                 uv lock --upgrade-package "$PACKAGE_NAME"
                 git add uv.lock
                 uv build
             """

          The  intent of the lock upgrade-package call is ONLY to update the version of your project within the lock file after PSR has updated the version in your project's definition file (e.g., pypro‐
          ject.toml). When you are running PSR, you have already tested the project as is and you don't want to actually update the dependencies if a new one just became available.

          For ease of use, PSR provides the $PACKAGE_NAME environment variable that contains the name of your package from the project's definition file (pyproject.toml:project.name).

          If you are using the PSR GitHub Action, you will need to add an installation command for uv to the build_command because the action runs in a Docker environment does not include uv by  default.
          The  best  way  to  ensure that the correct version of uv is installed is to define the version of uv in an optional dependency list (e.g. build). This will also help with other automated tools
          like Dependabot or Renovate to keep the version of uv up to date.

             [project.optional-dependencies]
             build = ["uv ~= 0.7.12"]

             [tool.semantic_release]
             build_command = """
                 python -m pip install -e '.[build]'
                 uv lock --upgrade-package "$PACKAGE_NAME"
                 git add uv.lock
                 uv build
             """

       2. Stamp the code first & then separately run release: If you prefer to not modify the build command, then you will need to run the uv lock --upgrade-package <your-package-name> command  prior  to
          actually creating the release. Essentially, you will run PSR twice: (1) once to update the version in the project's definition file, and (2) a second time to generate the release.

          The  intent  of  the uv lock --upgrade-package <your-package-name> command is ONLY to update the version of your project within the lock file after PSR has updated the version in your project's
          definition file (e.g., pyproject.toml). When you are running PSR, you have already tested the project as is and you don't want to actually update the dependencies  if  a  new  one  just  became
          available.

             # 1. PSR stamps version into files (nothing else)
             # don't build the changelog (especially in update mode)
             semantic-release -v version --skip-build --no-commit --no-tag --no-changelog

             # 2. run UV lock as pyproject.toml is updated with the next version
             uv lock --upgrade-package <your-package-name>

             # 3. stage the lock file to ensure it is included in the PSR commit
             git add uv.lock

             # 4. run PSR fully to create release
             semantic-release -v version

       Advanced Example

       Of  course,  you can mix and match these 2 approaches as needed. If PSR's pipeline was using uv, we would have a mixture of the 2 approaches because we run the build in a separate job from the re‐
       lease. In our case, PSR would also need to carry the lock file as a workflow artifact along the pipeline for the release job to commit it. This advanced workflow would look like this:

          # File: .tool-versions
          uv 0.7.12

          # File: .python-version
          3.11.11

          # File: pyproject.toml
          [project.optional-dependencies]
          build = ["python-semantic-release ~= 10.0"]
          test = ["pytest ~= 8.0"]

          [tool.semantic_release]
          build_command = """
            uv lock --upgrade-package "$PACKAGE_NAME"
            uv build
          """

   Configuration
       Configuration is read from a file which can be specified using the \\-\\-config option to cmd-main. Python Semantic Release currently supports a configuration in either TOML or  JSON  format,  and
       will attempt to auto-detect and parse either format.

       When  using  a JSON-format configuration file, Python Semantic Release looks for its settings beneath a top-level semantic_release key; when using a TOML-format configuration file, Python Semantic
       Release first checks for its configuration under the table [tool.semantic_release] (in line with the convention for Python tools to require their configuration under the top-level  tool  table  in
       their pyproject.toml file), followed by [semantic_release], which may be more desirable if using a file other than the default pyproject.toml for configuration.

       The  examples  on this page are given in TOML format, however there is no limitation on using JSON instead. In fact, if you would like to convert any example below to its JSON equivalent, the fol‐
       lowing commands will do this for you (in Bash):

          export TEXT="<the TOML to convert>"

          cat <<EOF | python3
          import tomlkit, json
          print(json.dumps(tomlkit.loads('''$TEXT'''), indent=4))
          EOF

   A note on null
       In TOML, there is no such thing as a "null" or "nil" value, and this isn't planned as a language feature according to the relevant GitHub issue.  In Python Semantic Release, options which  default
       to  None  are inferred from the relevant configuration settings not being present at all in your configuration.  Because of this limitation, it's currently not possible to explicitly specify those
       settings as "null" in TOML-format configuration. Technically it is possible in JSON-format configuration, but it's recommended to keep consistency and just omit the relevant settings.

   Environment Variables
       Some settings are best pulled from environment variables rather than being stored in plaintext in your configuration file. Python Semantic Release can be configured  to  look  for  an  environment
       variable  value  to use for a given setting, but this feature is not available for all settings. In order to use an environment variable for a setting, you must indicate in your configuration file
       the name of the environment variable to use.

       The traditional and most common use case for environment variable use is for passing authentication tokens to Python Semantic Release. You do NOT want to hard code  your  authentication  token  in
       your  configuration  file, as this is a security risk. A plaintext token in your configuration file could be exposed to anyone with access to your repository, including long after its deleted if a
       token is in your git history. Instead, define the name of the environment variable which contains your remote.token, such as GH_TOKEN, in your configuration file, and Python Semantic Release  will
       do the rest, as seen below.

          [semantic_release.remote.token]
          env = "GH_TOKEN"

       Given basic TOML syntax compatibility, this is equivalent to:

          [semantic_release.remote]
          token = { env = "GH_TOKEN" }

       The general format for specifying that some configuration should be sourced from an environment variable is:

          [semantic_release.variable]
          env = "ENV_VAR"
          default_env = "FALLBACK_ENV_VAR"
          default = "default value"

       In this structure:

          • env represents the environment variable that Python Semantic Release will search for

          • default_env is a fallback environment variable to read in case the variable specified by env is not set. This is optional - if not specified then no fallback will be used.

          • default  is  a default value to use in case the environment variable specified by env is not set. This is optional - if default is not specified then the environment variable specified by env
            is considered required.

   semantic_release settings
       The following sections outline all the definitions and descriptions of each supported configuration setting. If there are type mis-matches, PSR will throw validation errors upon load.  If  a  set‐
       ting is not provided, than PSR will fill in the value with the default value.

       Python Semantic Release expects a root level key to start the configuration definition. Make sure to use the correct root key depending on the configuration format you are using.

       NOTE:
          If you are using pyproject.toml, this heading should include the tool prefix as specified within PEP 517, resulting in [tool.semantic_release].

       NOTE:
          If you are using a releaserc.toml, use [semantic_release] as the root key

       NOTE:
          If you are using a releaserc.json, semantic_release must be the root key in the top level dictionary.

                                                                                                       ----

   allow_zero_version
       Introduced in v9.2.0

       Type: bool

       This flag controls whether or not Python Semantic Release will use version numbers aligning with the 0.x.x pattern.

       If  set  to  true and starting at 0.0.0, a minor bump would set the next version as 0.1.0 whereas a patch bump would set the next version as 0.0.1. A breaking change (ie. major bump) would set the
       next version as 1.0.0 unless the major_on_zero is set to false.

       If set to false, Python Semantic Release will consider the first possible version to be 1.0.0, regardless of patch, minor, or major change level.  Additionally, when allow_zero_version is  set  to
       false, the major_on_zero setting is ignored.

       Default changed to ``false`` in v10.0.0

       Default: false

                                                                                                       ----

   assets
       Type: list[str]

       One or more paths to additional assets that should committed to the remote repository in addition to any files modified by writing the new version.

       Default: []

                                                                                                       ----

   branches
       This setting is discussed in more detail at Multibranch Releases

       Default:

          [semantic_release.branches.main]
          match = "(main|master)"
          prerelease_token = "rc"
          prerelease = false

                                                                                                       ----

   build_command
       Type: Optional[str]

       Command to use to build the current project during cmd-version.

       Python  Semantic  Release  will execute the build command in the OS default shell with a subset of environment variables. PSR provides the variable NEW_VERSION in the environment with the value of
       the next determined version. The following table summarizes all the environment variables that are passed on to the build_command runtime if they exist in the parent process.

       If you would like to pass additional environment variables to your build command, see build_command_env.

       WARNING:
          Deprecated in v9.11.0. This setting has been moved to changelog.default_templates.changelog_file for a more logical grouping. This setting will be removed in a future major release.

       Type: str

       Specify the name of the changelog file that will be created. This file will be created or overwritten (if it previously exists) with the rendered default template included with Python Semantic Re‐
       lease.

       Depending on the file extension of this setting, the changelog will be rendered in the format designated by the extension. PSR, as of v9.11.0, provides a default changelog template in  both  Mark‐
       down (.md) and reStructuredText (.rst) formats. If the file extension is not recognized, the changelog will be rendered in Markdown format, unless the output_format setting is set.

       If you are using the template_dir setting for providing customized templates, this setting is not used. See template_dir for more information.

       Default: "CHANGELOG.md"

   mask_initial_release
       Introduced in v9.14.0

       Type: bool

       This option toggles the behavior of the changelog and release note templates to mask the release details specifically for the first release. When set to true, the first version release notes  will
       be masked with a generic message as opposed to the usual commit details.  When set to false, the release notes will be generated as normal.

       The  reason  for  this setting is to improve clarity to your audience. It conceptually does NOT make sense to have a list of changes (i.e. a Changelog) for the first release since nothing has been
       published yet, therefore in the eyes of your consumers what change is there to document?

       The message details can be found in the first_release.md.j2 and first_release.rst.j2 templates of the default changelog template directory.

       Default changed to ``true`` in v10.0.0.

       Default: true

   output_format
       Introduced in v9.10.0

       Type: Literal["md", "rst"]

       This setting is used to specify the output format the default changelog template will use when rendering the changelog. PSR supports both Markdown (md) and reStructuredText (rst) formats.

       This setting will take precedence over the file extension of the changelog_file setting. If this setting is omitted, the file extension of the changelog_file setting will be used to determine  the
       output format. If the file extension is not recognized, the output format will default to Markdown.

       Default: "md"

   autoescape
       Type: Union[str, bool]

       If this setting is a string, it should be given in module:attr form; Python Semantic Release will attempt to dynamically import this string, which should represent a path to  a  suitable  callable
       that satisfies the following:
          As of Jinja 2.4 this can also be a callable that is passed the template name and has to return true or false depending on autoescape should be enabled by default.

       The result of this dynamic import is passed directly to the jinja2.Environment constructor.

   exclude_commit_patterns
       Type: list[str]

       Any  patterns specified here will be excluded from the commits which are available to your changelog. This allows, for example, automated commits to be removed if desired.  Python Semantic Release
       also removes its own commits from the Changelog via this mechanism; therefore if you change the automated commit message that Python Semantic Release uses when making commits, you may wish to  add
       the old commit message pattern here.

       The patterns in this list are treated as regular expressions.

       Default: []

                                                                                                       ----

   mode
       Introduced in v9.10.0. Default changed to `update` in v10.0.0.

       Type: Literal["init", "update"]

       This setting is a flag that is ultimately passed into the changelog context environment. It sets the value of context.changelog_mode to a string value of either init or update.

       When used with the provided changelog template, it will determine the behavior of how the changelog is written. When the mode is set to init, the changelog file will be written from scratch, over‐
       writing any existing changelog file. This is the v8 and v9 default behavior.

       When the mode is set to update, the changelog file will look for the insertion_flag value in the changelog file (defined by changelog_file) and insert the new version information at that location.

       If you are using a custom template directory, the context.changelog_mode value will exist in the changelog context but it is up to your implementation to determine if and/or how to use it.

       Default: update

   insertion_flag
       Introduced in v9.10.0

       Type: str

       A string that will be used to identify where the new version should be inserted into the changelog file (as defined by changelog_file) when the changelog mode is set to update.

       If  you  modify  this  value in your config, you will need to manually update any saved changelog file to match the new insertion flag if you use the update mode.  In init mode, the changelog file
       will be overwritten as normal.

       In v9.11.0, the insertion_flag default value became more dynamic with the introduction of an reStructuredText template. The default value will be set depending on the  output_format  setting.  The
       default flag values are:

   template_dir
       Type: str

       When  files  exist within the specified directory, they will be used as templates for the changelog rendering process. Regardless if the directory includes a changelog file, the provided directory
       will be rendered and files placed relative to the root of the project directory.

       No default changelog template or release notes template will be used when this directory exists and the directory is not empty. If the directory is empty, the default changelog  template  will  be
       used.

   commit_message
       Type: str

       Commit message to use when making release commits. The message can use {version} as a format key, in which case the version being released will be formatted into the message.

       If at some point in your project's lifetime you change this, you may wish to consider, adding the old message pattern(s) to exclude_commit_patterns.

              • scipy - ScipyCommitParser

              • tag - TagCommitParser (deprecated in v9.12.0)

       You can set any of the built-in parsers by their keyword but you can also specify your own commit parser in path/to/module_file.py:Class or module:Class form.

       For more information see Commit Parsing.

       Default: "conventional"

   logging_use_named_masks
       Type: bool

       Whether or not to replace secrets identified in logging messages with named masks identifying which secrets were replaced, or use a generic string to mask them.

                                                                                                       ----

   major_on_zero
       Type: bool

       This flag controls whether or not Python Semantic Release will increment the major version upon a breaking change when the version matches 0.y.z. This value is set to true by default, where break‐
       ing changes will increment the 0 major version to 1.0.0 like normally expected.

       If  set to false, major (breaking) releases will increment the minor digit of the version while the major version is 0, instead of the major digit. This allows for continued breaking changes to be
       made while the major version remains 0.

       From the Semantic Versioning Specification:
          Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.

       When you are ready to release a stable version, set major_on_zero to true and run Python Semantic Release again. This will increment the major version to 1.0.0.

       When allow_zero_version is set to false, this setting is ignored.

       Default: true

                                                                                                       ----

   no_git_verify
       Introduced in v9.8.0

       Type: bool

       This flag is passed along to git upon performing a git commit during cmd-version.

       When true, it will bypass any git hooks that are set for the repository when Python Semantic Release makes a version commit.  When false, the commit is performed as normal. This option has no  ef‐
       fect when there are not any git hooks configured nor when the --no-commit option is passed.

       Default: false

                                                                                                       ----

   dist_glob_patterns
       Type: list[str]

       Upload any files matching any of these globs to your VCS release. Each item in this list should be a string containing a Unix-style glob pattern.

       Default: ["dist/*"]

                                                                                                       ----

   upload_to_vcs_release
       Type: bool

       If set to true, upload any artifacts matched by the dist_glob_patterns to the release created in the remote VCS corresponding to the latest tag. Artifacts are only uploaded if release artifact up‐
       loads are supported by the VCS type.

       Default: true

   remote
       The remote configuration is a group of settings that configure PSR's integration with remote version control systems.

   api_domain
       Type: Optional[str | Dict['env', str]]

       The  hosting  domain  for the API of your remote HVCS if different than the domain.  Generally, this will be used to specify a separate subdomain that is used for API calls rather than the primary
       domain (ex. api.github.com).

       Most on-premise HVCS installations will NOT use this setting! Whether or not this value is used depends on the HVCS configured (and your server administration) in the remote.type setting and  used
       in tandem with the remote.domain setting.

       When using a custom remote.domain and a HVCS remote.type that is configured with a separate domain or sub-domain for API requests, this value is used to configure the location of API requests that
       are sent from PSR.

       Most on-premise or self-hosted HVCS environments will use a path prefix to handle inbound API requests, which means this value will ignored.

       PSR  knows  the  expected  api  domains  for  known  cloud services and their associated api domains which means this value is not necessary to explicitly define for services as bitbucket.org, and
       github.com.

       Including the protocol schemes, such as https://, for the API domain is optional.  Secure HTTPS connections are assumed unless the setting of remote.insecure is true.

       Default: None

                                                                                                       ----

   domain
       Type: Optional[str | Dict['env', str]]

       The host domain for your HVCS server. This setting is used to support on-premise installations of HVCS providers with custom domain hosts.

       If you are using the official domain of the associated remote.type, this value is not required. PSR will use the default domain value for the remote.type when not specified.  For example, when re‐
       mote.type="github" is specified the default domain of github.com is used.

       Including the protocol schemes, such as https://, for the domain value is optional.  Secure HTTPS connections are assumed unless the setting of remote.insecure is true.

       This setting also supports reading from an environment variable for ease-of-use in CI pipelines. See Environment Variable for more information. Depending on the remote.type, the  default  environ‐
       ment variable for the default domain's CI pipeline environment will automatically be checked so this value is not required in default environments.  For example, when remote.type="gitlab" is spec‐
       ified, PSR will look to the CI_SERVER_URL environment variable when remote.domain is not specified.

       Default: None

   ignore_token_for_push
       Type: bool

   insecure
       Introduced in v9.4.2

       Type: bool

       Insecure  is  used to allow non-secure HTTP connections to your HVCS server. If set to true, any domain value passed will assume http:// if it is not specified and allow it. When set to false (im‐
       plicitly or explicitly), it will force https:// communications.

       When a custom domain or api_domain is provided as a configuration, this flag governs the protocol scheme used for those connections. If the protocol scheme is not provided in the field value, then
       this insecure option defines whether HTTP or HTTPS is used for the connection. If the protocol scheme is provided in the field value, it must match this setting or it will throw an error.

       The purpose of this flag is to prevent any typos in provided domain and api_domain values that accidentally specify an insecure connection but allow users to toggle the protection scheme off  when
       desired.

       Default: false

                                                                                                       ----

   name
       Type: str

       Name of the remote to push to using git push -u $name <branch_name>

       Default: "origin"

                                                                                                       ----

   token
       Type: Optional[str | Dict['env', str]]

       Environment  Variable from which to source the authentication token for the remote VCS. Common examples include "GH_TOKEN", "GITLAB_TOKEN" or "GITEA_TOKEN", however, you may choose to use a custom
       environment variable if you wish.

       NOTE:
          By default, this is a mandatory environment variable that must be set before using any functionality that requires authentication with your remote VCS. If you are using  this  token  to  enable
          push access to the repository, it must also be set before attempting to push.

          If  your  push access is enabled via SSH keys instead, then you do not need to set this environment variable in order to push the version increment, changelog and modified source code assets to
          the remote using cmd-version. However, you will need to disable release creation using the cmd-version-option-vcs-release option, among other options, in order to use  Python  Semantic  Release
          without configuring the environment variable for your remote VCS authentication token.

       The default value for this setting depends on what you specify as remote.type. Review the table below to see what the default token value will be for each remote type.

   type
       Type: Literal["bitbucket", "gitea", "github", "gitlab"]

       The  type  of the remote VCS. Currently, Python Semantic Release supports "github", "gitlab", "gitea" and "bitbucket". Not all functionality is available with all remote types, but we welcome pull
       requests to help improve this!

       Default: "github"

                                                                                                       ----

   url
       Type: Optional[str | Dict['env', str]]

       An override setting used to specify the remote upstream location of git push.

       Not commonly used! This is used to override the derived upstream location when the desired push location is different than the location the repository was cloned from.

       This setting will override the upstream location url that would normally be derived from the remote.name location of your git repository.

       Default: None

                                                                                                       ----

   tag_format
       Type: str

       Specify the format to be used for the Git tag that will be added to the repo during a release invoked via cmd-version. The format string is a regular expression, which also must include the format
       keys below, otherwise an exception will be thrown.  It may include any of the optional format keys, in which case the contents described will be formatted into the specified location  in  the  Git
       tag that is created.

       For example, "(dev|stg|prod)-v{version}" is a valid tag_format matching tags such as:

       • dev-v1.2.3

       • stg-v0.1.0-rc.1

       • prod-v2.0.0+20230701

       This  format  will  also  be used for parsing tags already present in the repository into semantic versions; therefore if the tag format changes at some point in the repository's history, historic
       versions that no longer match this pattern will not be considered as versions.
                                                                ┌────────────┬───────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

       Tags which do not match this format will not be considered as versions of your project.

       Default: "v{version}"

                                                                                                       ----

   version_toml
       Type: list[str]

       This configuration option is similar to version_variables, but it uses a TOML parser to interpret the data structure before, inserting the version. This allows users to use dot-notation to specify
       the version via the logical structure within the TOML file, which is more accurate than a pattern replace.

       The version_toml option is commonly used to update the version number in the project definition file: pyproject.toml as seen in the example below.

       As of v9.20.0, the version_toml option accepts a colon-separated definition with either 2 or 3 parts. The 2-part definition includes the file path and  the  version  parameter  (in  dot-notation).
       Newly with v9.20.0, it also accepts an optional 3rd part to allow configuration of the format type.

       Available Format Types

       • nf: Number format (ex. 1.2.3)

       • tf: Tag Format (ex. v1.2.3)

       If the format type is not specified, it will default to the number format.

       Example

          [semantic_release]
          version_toml = [
              # "file:variable:[format_type]"
              "pyproject.toml:tool.poetry.version",  # Implied Default: Number format
              "definition.toml:project.version:nf",  # Number format
              "definition.toml:project.release:tf",  # Tag format
          ]

       This configuration will result in the following changes:

          diff a/pyproject.toml b/pyproject.toml

            [tool.poetry]
          - version = "0.1.0"
          + version = "0.2.0"

          diff a/definition.toml b/definition.toml

            [project]
            name = "example"

          - version = "0.1.0"
          + version = "0.1.0"

          - release = "v0.1.0"
          + release = "v0.2.0"

       Default: []

                                                                                                       ----

   version_variables
       Type: list[str]

       The version_variables configuration option is a list of string definitions that defines where the version number should be updated in the repository, when a new version is released.

       As  of  v9.20.0, the version_variables option accepts a colon-separated definition with either 2 or 3 parts. The 2-part definition includes the file path and the variable name. Newly with v9.20.0,
       it also accepts an optional 3rd part to allow configuration of the format type.

       Available Format Types

       • nf: Number format (ex. 1.2.3)

       • tf: Tag Format (ex. v1.2.3)

       If the format type is not specified, it will default to the number format.

       Prior to v9.20.0, PSR only supports entries with the first 2-parts as the tag format type was not available and would only replace numeric version numbers.

       Example

          [semantic_release]
          tag_format = "v{version}"
          version_variables = [
              # "file:variable:format_type"
              "src/semantic_release/__init__.py:__version__",  # Implied Default: Number format
              "docs/conf.py:version:nf",                       # Number format for sphinx docs
              "kustomization.yml:newTag:tf",                   # Tag format
          ]

       First, the __version__ variable in src/semantic_release/__init__.py will be updated with the next version using the SemVer number format.

          diff a/src/semantic_release/__init__.py b/src/semantic_release/__init__.py

          - __version__ = "0.1.0"
          + __version__ = "0.2.0"

       Then, the version variable in docs/conf.py will be updated with the next version with the next version using the SemVer number format because of the explicit nf.

          diff a/docs/conf.py b/docs/conf.py

          - version = "0.1.0"
          + version = "0.2.0"

       Lastly, the newTag variable in kustomization.yml will be updated with the next version with the next version using the configured tag_format because the definition included tf.

          diff a/kustomization.yml b/kustomization.yml

            images:
              - name: repo/image
          -     newTag: v0.1.0
          +     newTag: v0.2.0

       How It works

       Each version variable will be transformed into a Regular Expression that will be used to substitute the version number in the file. The replacement algorithm is ONLY a pattern match  and  replace.
       It will NOT evaluate the code nor will PSR understand any internal object structures (ie. file:object.version will not work).

       The regular expression generated from the version_variables definition will:

       1. Look for the specified variable name in the file. The variable name can be enclosed by single (') or double (") quotation marks but they must match.

       2. The  variable name defined by variable and the version must be separated by an operand symbol (=, :, :=, or @). Whitespace is optional around the symbol. As of v10.0.0, a double-equals (==) op‐
          erator is also supported as a valid operand symbol.

       3. The value of the variable must match a SemVer regular expression and can be enclosed by single (') or double (") quotation marks but they must match. However, the enclosing quotes of the  value
          do not have to match the quotes surrounding the variable name.

       4. If the format type is set to tf then the variable value must have the matching prefix and suffix of the tag_format setting around the SemVer version number.

       Given  the  pattern matching nature of this feature, the Regular Expression is able to support most file formats because of the similarity of variable declaration across programming languages. PSR
       specifically supports Python, YAML, and JSON as these have been the most commonly requested formats. This configuration option will also work regardless of file extension because it  looks  for  a
       matching pattern string.

       NOTE:
          This will also work for TOML but we recommend using version_toml for TOML files as it actually will interpret the TOML file and replace the version number before writing the file back to disk.

       This is a comprehensive list (but not all variations) of examples where the following versions will be matched and replaced by the new version:

          # Common variable declaration formats
          version='1.2.3'
          version = "1.2.3"
          release = "v1.2.3"     # if tag_format is set

          # YAML
          version: 1.2.3

          # JSON
          "version": "1.2.3"

          # NPM & GitHub Actions YAML
          version@1.2.3
          version@v1.2.3        # if tag_format is set

          # Walrus Operator
          version := "1.2.3"

          # Excessive whitespace
          version        =    '1.2.3'

          # Mixed Quotes
          "version" = '1.2.3'

          # Custom Tag Format with tag_format set (monorepos)
          __release__ = "module-v1.2.3"

          # requirements.txt
          my-package == 1.2.3

       IMPORTANT:
          The  Regular Expression expects a version value to exist in the file to be replaced.  It cannot be an empty string or a non-semver compliant string. If this is the very first time you are using
          PSR, we recommend you set the version to 0.0.0.

          This may become more flexible in the future with resolution of issue #941.

       WARNING:
          If the file (ex. JSON) you are replacing has two of the same variable name in it, this pattern match will not be able to differentiate between the two and will replace both. This is  a  limita‐
          tion of the pattern matching and not a bug.

   Automated Releases
       The  key point with using this package is to automate your releases and stop worrying about version numbers. Different approaches to automatic releases and publishing with the help of this package
       can be found below. Using a CI is the recommended approach.

   Guides
   Travis CI
       This guide expects you to have activated the repository on Travis CI.  If this is not the case, please refer to Travis documentation on how to do that.

   1. Add python-semantic-release settings
       See Configuration for details on how to configure Python Semantic Release.  Make sure that at least you have set version_variables before continuing.

   2. Add environment variables
       You will need to set up an environment variable in Travis. An easy way to do that is to go to the settings page for your package and add it there. Make sure that the  secret  toggle  is  set  cor‐
       rectly.

       You need to set the GH_TOKEN environment variable with a personal access token for Github. It will need either repo or public_repo scope depending on whether the repository is private or public.

       More information on how to set environment variables can be found on Travis documentation on environment variables.

   3. Add travis configuration
       The following should be added to your .travis.yml file.

          after_success:
          - git config --global user.name "semantic-release (via TravisCI)"
          - git config --global user.email "semantic-release@travis"
          - pip install python-semantic-release
          - semantic-release version && semantic-release publish

       The  first line tells Travis that we want to run the listed tasks after a successful build.  The two first lines in after_success will configure git so that python-semantic-release will be able to
       commit on Travis. The third installs the latest version of python-semantic-release.  The last will run the publish command, which will publish a new version if the changes  indicate  that  one  is
       due.

   4. Push some changes
       You are now ready to release automatically on Travis CI on every change to your master branch.

       Happy coding!

   GitHub Actions
       There are two official GitHub Actions for Python Semantic Release:

       1.

          python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release@TAG
                 This  is  the  main  action that runs the version CLI command. It is used to (1) determine the next version number, (2) stamp the version number, (3) run the build command, (4) build the
                 changelog, (5) commit the changes, (6) tag the commit, (7) publish the commit & tag and lastly (8) create a GitHub release. For more information review the version command  documentation
                 and see below for the Action configuration options.

       2.

          python-semantic-release/publish-action@TAG
                 This action is used to execute the publish CLI command.  It is used to upload files, such as distribution artifacts and other assets, to a GitHub release.

       Included  in this documentation are some recommended examples below if you want to get started quickly. These examples are not exhaustive and you will need to adjust them for your specific project
       needs especially if you are using a monorepo.

       • GitHub Actions Example Workflows

       • GitHub Actions with Monorepos

       NOTE:
          These GitHub Actions are only simplified wrappers around the python-semantic-release CLI. Ultimately, they download and install the published package from PyPI so if you find that you are  try‐
          ing to do something more advanced or less common, you may need to install and use the CLI directly.

   Python Semantic Release Action
       The official Python Semantic Release GitHub Action is a GitHub Docker Action, which means at the beginning of the job it will build a Docker image that contains the Python Semantic Release package
       and  its  dependencies.  It will then run the job step inside the Docker Container. This is done to ensure that the environment is consistent across all GitHub Runners regardless of platform. With
       this choice, comes some limitations of non-configurable options like a pre-defined python version, lack of installed build tools, and an inability to utilize caching.

       The primary benefit of using the GitHub Action is that it is easy to set up and use for most projects. We handle a lot of the git configuration under the hood, so you don't have to handle it your‐
       self. There are a plenty of customization options available which are detailed individually below.

       Most importantly your project's configuration file will be used as normal, as your project will be mounted into the container for the action to use.

       SEE ALSO:
          action.yml: the code definition of the action

   Inputs
       GitHub Action inputs are used for select configuration and provide the necessary information to execute the action. The inputs are passed to the action using the with keyword in the workflow file.
       Many inputs will mirror the command line options available in the version command. This section outlines each supported input and its purpose.

                                                                                                       ----

   build
       Type: Literal["true", "false"]

       Override whether the action should execute the build command or not. This option is equivalent to adding the command line switch --skip-build (when false) to the version command. If set  to  true,
       no command line switch is passed and the default behavior of the version is used.

       Required: false

   github_token
       The GitHub Token is essential for access to your GitHub repository to allow the push of commits & tags as well as to create a release. Not only do you need to provide the token as an input but you
       also need to ensure that the token has the correct permissions.

       The token should have the following permissions:

       • id-token: write

       • contents: write

       Required: true

                                                                                                       ----

   no_operation_mode
       If set to true, the github action will pass the --noop parameter to semantic-release. This will cause semantic-release to run in "no operation" mode.

       This is useful for testing the action without making any permanent changes to the repository.

   prerelease_token
       Override any prerelease token in the configuration file with this value, if it is a pre-release. This will override the matching release branch configuration's prerelease_token value. If  you  al‐
       ways want it to be a prerelease then you must also set the prerelease input to true.

       This option is equivalent to running the command:

   Python Semantic Release Publish Action
       The  official Python Semantic Release Publish Action is a GitHub Docker Action, which means at the beginning of the job it will build a Docker image that contains the Python Semantic Release pack‐
       age and its dependencies. It will then run the job step inside the Docker Container. This is done to ensure that the environment is consistent across all GitHub  Runners  regardless  of  platform.
       With this choice, comes some limitations of non-configurable options like a pre-defined python version, lack of additional 3rd party tools, and an inability to utilize caching.

       The  primary benefit of using the GitHub Action is that it is easy to set up and use for most projects. We handle some additional configuration under the hood, so you don't have to handle it your‐
       self. We do however provide a few customization options which are detailed individually below.

       Most importantly your project's configuration file will be used as normal, as your project will be mounted into the container for the action to use.

       If you have issues with the action, please open an issue on the python-semantic-release/publish-action repository.

   Inputs
       GitHub Action inputs are used for select configuration and provide the necessary information to execute the action. The inputs are passed to the action using the with keyword in the workflow file.
       Many inputs will mirror the command line options available in the publish command and others will be specific to adjustment of the action environment. This section outlines  each  supported  input
       and its purpose.

                                                                                                       ----

   tag
       Type: string

       The tag corresponding to the GitHub Release that the artifacts should be published to. This option is equivalent to running the command:

          semantic-release publish --tag <tag>

       Python Semantic Release will automatically determine the latest release if no --tag option is provided.

   Examples
   Common Workflow Example
       The following is a simple common workflow example that uses both the Python Semantic Release Action and the Python Semantic Release Publish Action. This workflow will run on every push to the main
       branch and will create a new release upon a successful version determination. If a version is released, the workflow will then publish the package to PyPI and upload the package to the GitHub  Re‐
       lease Assets as well.

       IMPORTANT:
          The concurrency directive is used on the job to prevent race conditions of more than one release job in the case if there are multiple pushes to main in a short period of time.

          Secondly  the Evaluate | Verify upstream has NOT changed step is used to ensure that the upstream branch has not changed while the workflow was running. This is important because we are commit‐
          ting a version change (commit: true) and there might be a push collision that would cause undesired behavior. Review Issue #1201 for more detailed information.

       WARNING:
          You must set fetch-depth to 0 when using actions/checkout@v4, since Python Semantic Release needs access to the full history to build a changelog and at least the latest tags to  determine  the
          next version.

       WARNING:
          The  GITHUB_TOKEN  secret  is automatically configured by GitHub, with the same permissions role as the user who triggered the workflow run. This causes a problem if your default branch is pro‐
          tected to specific users.

          You can work around this by storing an administrator's Personal Access Token as a separate secret and using that instead of GITHUB_TOKEN. In this case, you will also need to pass the new  token
          to actions/checkout (as the token input) in order to gain push access.

   Version Overrides Example
       In  the  case  where you want to provide multiple command line options to the version command, you provide them through the with directive in the workflow file. In this example, we want to force a
       patch version bump, not produce a changelog, and provide specialized build metadata. As a regular CLI command, this would look like:

          semantic-release version --patch --no-changelog --build-metadata abc123

       The equivalent GitHub Action configuration would be:

          # snippet

          - name: Action | Semantic Version Release
            # Adjust tag with desired version if applicable.
            uses: python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release@v10.4.1
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              force: patch
              changelog: false
              build_metadata: abc123

       SEE ALSO:

          • Publish Action Manual Release Workflow: To maintain the Publish Action at the same version as Python Semantic Release, we use a Manual release workflow which forces the matching bump type  as
            the root project. Check out this workflow to see how you can manually provide input that triggers the desired version bump.

   Actions with Monorepos
       While  python-semantic-release  does NOT have full monorepo support, if you have multiple projects stored within a single repository (or your project is not at the root of the repository), you can
       pass the directory input to the action to change directory before semantic-release execution.

       For multiple packages, you would need to run the action multiple times, to release each project. The following example demonstrates how to release two projects in a monorepo.

       Remember that for each release of each submodule you will then need to handle publishing each package separately as well. This is dependent on the result of your build commands.   In  the  example
       below, we assume a simple build module command to build a sdist and wheel artifacts into the submodule's dist directory.

       The directory input directive is also available for the Python Semantic Release Publish Action.

          jobs:

            release:

              env:
                SUBMODULE_1_DIR: project1

   Cron Job Publishing
       This is for you if for some reason you cannot publish from your CI or you would like releases to drop at a certain interval. Before you start, answer this: Are you sure you do not want a CI to re‐
       lease for you? (high version numbers are not a bad thing).

       The guide below is for setting up scheduled publishing on a server. It requires that the user that runs the cronjob has push access to the repository and upload access to an artifact repository.

       1. Create a virtualenv:

             virtualenv semantic_release -p `which python3`

       2. Install python-semantic-release:

             pip install python-semantic-release

       3. Clone the repositories you want to have scheduled publishing.  3. Put the following in publish:

          VENV=semantic_release/bin

          $VENV/pip install -U pip python-semantic-release > /dev/null

          publish() {
            cd $1
            git stash -u # ensures that there is no untracked files in the directory
            git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master
            $VENV/semantic-release version && $VENV/semantic-release publish
            cd ..
          }

          publish <package1>
          publish <package2>

       4. Add cronjob:

             /bin/bash -c "cd <path> && source semantic_release/bin/activate && ./publish 2>&1 >> releases.log"

   Upgrading PSR
       Upgrading  PSR  is  a  process that may involve several steps, depending on the version you are upgrading from and to. This section provides a guide for upgrading from older versions of PSR to the
       latest version.

       IMPORTANT:
          If you are upgrading across more than one major version, you should incrementally upgrade through each major version and its configuration update guide to ensure a smooth transition.

          For example, if you are upgrading from v7 to v10, you should first upgrade to v8 and then to v9, and then lastly to v10 while following the upgrade guide for each  version.  At  each  step  you
          should confirm execution works as expected before proceeding to the next version.

   Upgrading to v10
       The upgrade to v10 is primarily motivated by a command injection security vulnerability found in the GitHub Actions configuration interpreter (see details below). We also bundled a number of other
       changes, including new default configuration values and most importantly, a return to 1-line commit subjects in the default changelog format.

       For more specific change details for v10, please refer to the v10.0.0 (2025-05-25) section of the CHANGELOG.

   Security Fix: Command Injection Vulnerability (GitHub Actions)
       In  the  previous  versions of the GitHub Actions configuration, we used a single root_options parameter to pass any options you wanted to pass to the semantic-release main command. This parameter
       was interpreted as a string and passed directly to the command line, which made it vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a  malicious  string  as  the
       root_options  input,  and  then it would be executed as part of the command line, potentially allowing them to run arbitrary commands within the GitHub Actions Docker container. The ability to ex‐
       ploit this vulnerability is limited to people whom can modify the GitHub Actions workflow file, which is typically only the repository maintainers unless you  are  pointing  at  an  organizational
       workflow file or another third-party workflow file.

       To  mitigate  this  vulnerability, we have removed the root_options parameter completely and replaced it with individual boolean flag inputs which are then used to select the proper cli parameters
       for the semantic-release command. Additionally, users can protect themselves by limiting the access to secrets in their GitHub Actions workflows and the permissions of the GitHub Actions CI TOKEN.

       This vulnerability existed in both the python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release and python-semantic-release/publish-action actions.

       For the main python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release action, the following inputs are now available (in place of the old root_options parameter):  config_file,  no_operation_mode,  strict,
       and verbosity.
          Example migration

          If you previously had the following in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

              - uses: python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release@v9
                with:
                  root_options: "-vv --strict"

          It would be updated to:

              - uses: python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release@v10
                with:
                  strict: true
                  verbosity: 2

       For the python-semantic-release/publish-action action, the following inputs are now available (in place of the old root_options parameter): config_file, no_operation_mode, and verbosity.
          Example migration

          If you previously had the following in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

              - uses: python-semantic-release/publish-action@v9
                with:
                  root_options: "-v -c /path/to/releaserc.yaml"

          It would be updated to:

              - uses: python-semantic-release/publish-action@v10
                with:
                  config_file: /path/to/releaserc.yaml
                  verbosity: 1

   Changelog Format: 1-Line Commit Subjects
       In  v10,  the default changelog format has been changed to use 1-line commit subjects instead of including the full commit message. This change was made to improve the readability of the changelog
       as many commit messages are long and contain unnecessary details for the changelog.

       IMPORTANT:
          If you use a squash commit merge strategy, it is recommended that you use the default parse_squash_commits commit parser option to ensure that all the squashed commits are  parsed  for  version
          bumping and changelog generation. This is the default behavior in v10 across all supported commit parsers. If you are upgrading, you likely will need to manually set this option in your config‐
          uration file to ensure that the changelog is generated correctly.

          If you do not enable parse_squash_commits, then version will only be determined by the commit subject line and the changelog will only include the commit subject line as well.

   Changelog Format: Mask Initial Release
       In v10, the default behavior for the changelog generation has been changed to mask the initial release in the changelog. This means that the first release will not contain a break down of the dif‐
       ferent types of changes (e.g., features, fixes, etc.), but instead it will just simply state that this is the initial release.

   Changelog Format: Commit Parsing
       We  have  made  some  minor changes to the commit parsing logic in v10 to separate out components of the commit message more clearly. You will find that the ParsedCommit object's descriptions list
       will no longer contain any Breaking Change footers, Release Notice footers, PR/MR references, or Issue Closure footers. These were all previously extracted and placed into their own attributes but
       were still included in the descriptions list. In v10, the descriptions list will only contain the actual commit subject line and any additional commit body text that is not part of the pre-defined
       footers.

       If you were relying on the descriptions list to contain these footers, you will need to update your code and changelog templates to reference the specific attributes you want to use.

       NOTE:
          For the most up-to-date information on the next version deprecations and removals, please refer to the issue #1066.

   Upgrading to v9
       You are in luck! The upgrade to v9 is a simple one.

       The breaking change for this version is the removal of support for Python 3.7, as it has passed End-Of-Life (EOL). This means that if you are using Python 3.7, you will need to upgrade to at least
       Python 3.8 in order to use v9. This will be permanent as all future versions of python-semantic-release will require Python 3.8 or later.

   Upgrading to v8
       Python Semantic Release v8.0.0 introduced a number of breaking changes.  The internals have been changed significantly to better support highly-requested features and to streamline the maintenance
       of the project.

       As a result, certain things have been removed, reimplemented differently, or now exhibit different behavior to earlier versions of Python Semantic Release. This page is a guide to help projects to
       pip install python-semantic-release>=8.0.0 with fewer surprises.

   Python Semantic Release GitHub Action
   GitHub Action no longer publishes artifacts to PyPI or GitHub Releases
       Python Semantic Release no longer uploads distributions to PyPI - see Repurposing of version and publish commands. If you are using Python Semantic Release to publish release notes  and  artifacts
       to GitHub releases, there is a new GitHub Action upload-to-gh-release which will perform this action for you.

       This means the following workflows perform the same actions, and if you are using the former, you will need to modify your workflow to include the steps in the latter.

       This workflow is written to use Python Semantic Release v7.33.5:

          ---
          name: Semantic Release

          on:
            push:
              branches:
                - main

          jobs:
            release:
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              concurrency: release

              steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@v3
                with:
                  fetch-depth: 0

              # This action uses Python Semantic Release v7
              - name: Python Semantic Release
                uses: python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release@v7.33.5
                with:
                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                  repository_username: __token__
                  repository_password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}

       The following workflow achieves the same result using Python Semantic Release v8, the upload-to-gh-release GitHub Action, and the pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish GitHub Action:

          ---
          name: Semantic Release

          on:
            push:
              branches:
                - main

          jobs:
            release:
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              concurrency: release
              permissions:
                id-token: write

              steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@v3
                with:
                  fetch-depth: 0

              # This action uses Python Semantic Release v8
              - name: Python Semantic Release
                id: release
                uses: python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release@v8.7.0
                with:
                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

              - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI
                uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@v1
                # NOTE: DO NOT wrap the conditional in ${{ }} as it will always evaluate to true.
                # See https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1173
                if: steps.release.outputs.released == 'true'

              - name: Publish package distributions to GitHub Releases
                uses: python-semantic-release/upload-to-gh-release@v8.7.0
                if: steps.release.outputs.released == 'true'
                with:
                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

   Removal of pypi_token, repository_username and repository_password inputs
       Since  the  library  no longer supports publishing to PyPI, the pypi_token, repository_username and repository_password inputs of the GitHub action have all been removed. See the above section for
       how to publish to PyPI using the official GitHub Action from the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA).

   Rename additional_options to root_options
       Because the purposes of the cmd-version and cmd-publish commands have changed, the GitHub action now performs both commands in sequence. For this reason, and because  the  usage  of  the  CLI  has
       changed, additional_options has been renamed to root_options to reflect the fact that the options are for the main cmd-main command group.

   Commands
   Repurposing of version and publish commands
       Python  Semantic  Release's primary purpose is to enable automation of correct semantic versioning for software projects. Over the years, this automation has been extended to include other actions
       such as building/publishing the project and its artifacts to artefact repositories, creating releases in remote version control systems, and writing changelogs.

       In Python Semantic Release <8.0.0, the publish command was a one-stop-shop for performing every piece of automation provided. This has been changed - the version command  now  handles  determining
       the  next  version,  applying  the changes to the project metadata according to the configuration, writing a changelog, and committing/pushing changes to the remote Git repository. It also handles
       creating a release in the remote VCS. It does not publish software artifacts to remote repositories such as PyPI; the rationale behind this decision is simply that under the hood, Python  Semantic
       Release used twine to upload artifacts to package indexes such as PyPI, and it's recommended to use twine directly via the command-line. From the twine documentation:
          Twine is a command-line tool for interacting with PyPI securely over HTTPS.

       As a result Python Semantic Release no longer depends on twine internals.

       The publish command now handles publishing software artifacts to releases in the remote version control system.

       To achieve a similar flow of logic such as

          1. Determine the next version

          2. Write this version to the configured metadata locations

          3. Write the changelog

          4. Push the changes to the metadata and changelog to the remote repository

          5. Create a release in the remote version control system

          6. Build a wheel

          7. Publish the wheel to PyPI

          8. Publish the distribution artifacts to the release in the remote VCS

       You should run:

          semantic-release version
          twine upload dist/*  # or whichever path your distributions are placed in
          semantic-release publish

       With steps 1-6 being handled by the cmd-version command, step 7 being left to the developer to handle, and lastly step 8 to be handled by the cmd-publish command.

   Removal of -D/--define command-line option
       It  is  no longer possible to override arbitrary configuration values using the -D/ --define option. You should provide the appropriate values via a configuration file using cmd-main-option-config
       or via the available command-line options.

       This simplifies the command-line option parsing significantly and is less error-prone, which has resulted in previous issues (e.g. #600) with overrides on the command-line.  Some of the configura‐
       tion values expected by Python Semantic Release use complex data types such as lists or nested structures, which would be tedious and error-prone to specify using just command-line options.

   Removal of CI verifications
       Prior to v8, Python Semantic Release would perform some prerequisite verification of environment variables before performing any version changes using the publish command. It's  not  feasible  for
       Python Semantic Release to verify any possible CI environment fully, and these checks were only triggered if certain environment variables were set - they wouldn't fail locally.

       These checks previously raised :py:class:semantic_release.CiVerificationError, and were the only place in which this custom exception was used. Therefore, this exception has also been removed from
       Python Semantic Release in v8.

       If you were relying on this functionality, it's recommended that you add the following shell commands before invoking semantic-release to verify your environment:

       NOTE:
          In  the  following,  $RELEASE_BRANCH  refers to the git branch against which you run your releases using Python Semantic Release. You will need to ensure it is set properly (e.g. via export RE‐
          LEASE_BRANCH=main and/or replace the variable with the branch name you want to verify the CI environment for.

              ]]; then
            exit 1

              ]]; then
            exit 1
          fi

   Removal of Build Status Checking
       Prior to v8, Python Semantic Release contained a configuration option, check_build_status, which would attempt to prevent a release being made if it was possible to identify that  a  corresponding
       build pipeline was failing.  For similar reasons to those motivating the removal of CI Checks, this feature has also been removed.

       If  you  are leveraging this feature in Python Semantic Release v7, the following bash commands will replace the functionality, and you can add these to your pipeline.  You will need to install jq
       and curl to run these commands; they can be easily installed through your system's package manager, for example on Ubuntu:

          sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
          sudo apt install -y curl jq

       On Windows, you can refer to the installation guide for jq, and if curl is not already installed, you can download it from the curl website

   Multibranch releases
       Prior to v8, Python Semantic Release would perform git checkout to switch to your configured release branch and determine if a release would need to be made. In v8 this has been changed - you must
       manually check out the branch which you would like to release against, and if you would like to create releases against this branch you must also ensure that it belongs to a release group.

   changelog command
       A new option, cmd-changelog-option-post-to-release-tag has been added. If you omit this argument on the command line then the changelog rendering process, which is  described  in  more  detail  at
       Custom  Changelogs,  will  be  triggered, but the new changelog will not be posted to any release.  If you use this new command-line option, it should be set to a tag within the remote which has a
       corresponding release.  For example, to update the changelog and post it to the release corresponding to the tag v1.1.4, you should run:

          semantic-release changelog --post-to-release-tag v1.1.4

   Changelog customization
       A number of options relevant to customizing the changelog have been removed. This is because Python Semantic Release now supports authoring a completely custom Jinja template with the contents  of
       your  changelog.  Historically, the number of options added to Python Semantic Release in order to allow this customization has grown significantly; it now uses templates in order to fully open up
       customizing the changelog's appearance.

   Configuration
       The configuration structure has been completely reworked, so you should read Configuration carefully during the process of upgrading to v8+. However, some common pitfalls and potential sources  of
       confusion are summarized here.

   setup.cfg is no longer supported
       Python  Semantic  Release  no longer supports configuration via setup.cfg. This is because the Python ecosystem is centering around pyproject.toml as universal tool and project configuration file,
       and TOML allows expressions via configuration, such as the mechanism for declaring configuration via environment variables, which introduce much greater complexity  to  support  in  the  otherwise
       equivalent ini-format configuration.

       You can use cmd-generate-config to generate new-format configuration that can be added to pyproject.toml, and adjust the default settings according to your needs.

       WARNING:
          If  you  don't  already  have a pyproject.toml configuration file, pip can change its behavior once you add one, as a result of PEP-517. If you find that this breaks your packaging, you can add
          your Python Semantic Release configuration to a separate file such as semantic-release.toml, and use the --config option to reference this alternative configuration file.

          More detail about this issue can be found in this pip issue.

   Commit parser options
       Options such as major_emoji, parser_angular_patch_types or parser_angular_default_level_bump have been removed. Instead, these have been replaced with a single set of recognized commit parser  op‐
       tions,  allowed_tags, major_tags, minor_tags, and patch_tags, though the interpretation of these is up to the specific parsers in use. You can read more detail about using commit parser options in
       commit_parser_options, and if you need to parse multiple commit styles for a single project it's recommended that you create a parser following Custom Parsers that  is  tailored  to  the  specific
       needs of your project.

   version_variable
       This option has been renamed to version_variables as it refers to a list of variables which can be updated.

   version_pattern
       This  option  has been removed. It's recommended to use an alternative tool to perform substitution using arbitrary regular expressions, such as sed.  You can always use Python Semantic Release to
       identify the next version to be created for a project and store this in an environment variable like so:

          export VERSION=$(semantic-release version --print)

   version_toml
       This option will no longer accept a string or comma-separated string of version locations to be updated in TOML files. Instead, you must supply a List[str].  For existing  configurations  using  a
       single location in this option, you can simply wrap the value in []:

          # Python Semantic Release v7 configuration
          [tool.semantic_release]
          version_toml = "pyproject.toml:tool.poetry.version"

          # Python Semantic Release v8 configuration
          [tool.semantic_release]
          version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:tool.poetry.version"]

   tag_format
       This  option  has the same effect as it did in Python Semantic Release prior to v8, but Python Semantic Release will now verify that it has a {version} format key and raise an error if this is not
       the case.

   upload_to_release
       This option has been renamed to upload_to_vcs_release.

   Custom Commit Parsers
       Previously, a custom commit parser had to satisfy the following criteria:

          • It should be import-able from the virtual environment where the semantic-release is run

          • It should be a function which accepts the commit message as its only argument and returns a semantic_release.history.parser_helpers.ParsedCommit if the commit is parsed successfully, or raise
            a semantic_release.UnknownCommitMessageStyleError if parsing is unsuccessful.

       It is still possible to implement custom commit parsers, but the interface for doing so has been modified with stronger support for Python type annotations and broader input provided to the parser
       to enable capturing more information from each commit, such as the commit's date and author, if desired. A full guide to implementing a custom commit parser can be found at Custom Parsers.

   Troubleshooting
       • Check your configuration file for Configuration

       • Check your Git tags match your tag_format; tags using other formats are ignored during calculation of the next version.

   Increasing Verbosity
       If you are having trouble with Python Semantic Release or would like to see additional information about the actions that it is taking, you can use the top-level cmd-main-option-verbosity  option.
       This  can  be supplied multiple times to increase the logging verbosity of the cmd-main command or any of its subcommands during their execution. You can supply this as many times as you like, but
       supplying more than twice has no effect.

       Supply cmd-main-option-verbosity once for INFO output, and twice for DEBUG.

       For example:

          semantic-release -vv version --print

       NOTE:
          The cmd-main-option-verbosity option must be supplied to the top-level semantic-release command, before the name of any sub-command.

       WARNING:
          The volume of logs when using DEBUG verbosity may be significantly increased, compared to INFO or the default WARNING, and as a result executing commands with semantic-release may  be  signifi‐
          cantly slower than when using DEBUG.

       NOTE:
          The provided GitHub action sets the verbosity level to INFO by default.

                     This  method  overrides the default functionality of the SandboxedEnvironment where all 'include' keywords expect to be in the same directory as the calling template, however this is
                     unintuitive when using a complex directory structure.

                     This override simulates the changing of directories when you include the template from a child directory. When the child then includes a template, it will make the path  relative  to
                     the child directory rather than the top level template directory.

              Ensures the least indented line of the msg string is indented by prefix with consistent alignment of the remainder of msg irrespective of the level of indentation in the Python source code

       semantic_release.cli.util.load_raw_config_file(config_file: Path | str) -> dict[Any, Any]
              Load raw configuration as a dict from the filename specified by config_filename, trying the following parsing methods:

              1. try to parse with tomli.load (guessing it's a TOML file)

              2. try to parse with json.load (guessing it's a JSON file)

              3. raise InvalidConfiguration if none of the above parsing methods work

              This function will also raise FileNotFoundError if it is raised while trying to read the specified configuration file

       semantic_release.cli.util.noop_report(msg: str) -> None
              Rich-prints a msg with a standard prefix to report when an action is not being taken due to a "noop" flag

       semantic_release.cli.util.parse_toml(raw_text: str) -> dict[Any, Any]
              Attempts to parse raw configuration for semantic_release using tomlkit.loads, raising InvalidConfiguration if the TOML is invalid or there's no top level "semantic_release" or  "tool.seman‐
              tic_release" keys

       semantic_release.cli.util.rprint(msg: str) -> None

                     These are used to identify a valid commit message. If a commit message does not start with one of these prefixes, it will not be considered a valid commit message.

              classmethod convert_strs_to_paths()
                     Wrap a classmethod, staticmethod, property or unbound function and act as a descriptor that allows us to detect decorated items from the class' attributes.

                     This class' __get__ returns the wrapped item's __get__ result, which makes it transparent for classmethods and staticmethods.

                     Attributes:
                            wrapped: The decorator that has to be wrapped.  decorator_info: The decorator info.  shim: A wrapper function to wrap V1 style function.

              path_filters: Annotated[Tuple[str, ...], Field(validate_default=True)] = ('.',)
                     A set of relative paths to filter commits by. Only commits with file changes that match these file paths or its subdirectories will be considered valid commits.

                     Syntax is similar to .gitignore with file path globs and inverse file match globs via ! prefix. Paths should be relative to the current working directory.

              classmethod resolve_path()
                     Wrap a classmethod, staticmethod, property or unbound function and act as a descriptor that allows us to detect decorated items from the class' attributes.

                     This class' __get__ returns the wrapped item's __get__ result, which makes it transparent for classmethods and staticmethods.

                     Attributes:

              scope_prefix: str = ''
                     A prefix that will be striped from the scope when parsing commit messages.

                     If  set,  it  will cause unscoped commits to be ignored. Use this in tandem with the path_filters option to filter commits by directory and scope. This will be fed into a regular ex‐
                     pression so you must escape any special characters that are meaningful in regular expressions (e.g. ., *, ?, +, etc.) if you want to match them literally.

              classmethod validate_scope_prefix()
                     Wrap a classmethod, staticmethod, property or unbound function and act as a descriptor that allows us to detect decorated items from the class' attributes.

                     This class' __get__ returns the wrapped item's __get__ result, which makes it transparent for classmethods and staticmethods.

                     Attributes:
                            wrapped: The decorator that has to be wrapped.  decorator_info: The decorator info.  shim: A wrapper function to wrap V1 style function.

   semantic_release.commit_parser.scipy module
       Parses commit messages using scipy tags of the form:

          <tag>(<scope>): <subject>

          <body>

       The elements <tag>, <scope> and <body> are optional. If no tag is present, the commit will be added to the changelog section "None" and no version increment will be performed.

       While <scope> is supported here it isn't actually part of the scipy style.  If it is missing, parentheses around it are too. The commit should then be of the form:

          <tag>: <subject>

          <body>

       To communicate a breaking change add "BREAKING CHANGE" into the body at the beginning of a paragraph. Fill this paragraph with information how to migrate from the broken behavior to the new behav‐
       ior. It will be added to the "Breaking" section of the changelog.

              breaking_descriptions: list[str]
                     A list of paragraphs which are deemed to identify and describe breaking changes by the parser.

                     An  example  would be a paragraph which begins with the text BREAKING CHANGE: in the commit message but the parser gennerally strips the prefix and includes the rest of the paragraph
                     in this list.

              bump: LevelBump
                     A LevelBump enum value indicating what type of change this commit introduces.

              commit: Commit
                     The original commit object (a class defined by GitPython) that was parsed

              descriptions: list[str]
                     A list of paragraphs from the commit message.

                     Paragraphs are generally delimited by a double-newline since git commit messages are sometimes manually wordwrapped with a single newline, but this is up to the parser to implement.

              static from_parsed_message_result(commit: Commit, parsed_message_result: ParsedMessageResult) -> ParsedCommit
                     A convience method to create a ParsedCommit object from a ParsedMessageResult object and a Commit object.

              property hexsha: str
                     A hex representation of the hash value of the commit.

                     This is a pass through property for convience to access the hexsha attribute of the commit.

              include_in_changelog: bool
                     A boolean value indicating whether this commit should be included in the changelog.

                     This enables parsers to flag commits which are not user-facing or are otherwise not relevant to the changelog to be filtered out by PSR's internal algorithms.

              is_merge_commit() -> bool

              linked_issues: tuple[str, ...]
                     A tuple of issue numbers as strings, if the commit is contains issue references.

                     If there are no issue references, this should be an empty tuple. Although, we generally refer to them as "issue numbers", it generally should be a string to adhere  to  the  prefixes
                     used by the VCS (ex. # for GitHub, GitLab, etc.) or issue tracker (ex. JIRA uses AAA-###).

              linked_merge_request: str
                     A pull request or merge request definition, if the commit is labeled with a pull/merge request number.

                     This is a string value which includes any special character prefix used by the VCS (e.g. # for GitHub, ! for GitLab).

              property linked_pull_request: str
                     An alias to the linked_merge_request attribute.

              property message: str
                     A string representation of the commit message.

                     This is a pass through property for convience to access the message attribute of the commit object.

                     If the message is of type bytes then it will be decoded to a UTF-8 string.

              release_notices: tuple[str, ...]
                     A tuple of release notices, which are additional information about the changes that affect the user.

                     An  example  would  be  a paragraph which begins with the text NOTICE: in the commit message but the parser generally strips the prefix and includes the rest of the paragraph in this
                     list.

              scope: str
                     The scope, as a string, parsed from the commit.

                     Generally an optional field based on the commit message style which means it very likely can be an empty string.  Commit styles which do not have a meaningful concept of "scope" usu‐
                     ally fill this field with an empty string.

              property short_hash: str
                     A short representation of the hash value (in hex) of the commit.

              type: str
                     The type of the commit as a string, per the commit message style.

                     This is up to the parser to implement; for example, the EmojiCommitParser parser fills this field with the emoji representing the most significant change for the commit.

       class semantic_release.commit_parser.token.ParsedMessageResult(bump: LevelBump, type: str, category: str, scope: str, descriptions: tuple[str, ...], breaking_descriptions: tuple[str, ...] = (),
       release_notices: tuple[str, ...] = (), linked_issues: tuple[str, ...] = (), linked_merge_request: str = '', include_in_changelog: bool = True)
              Bases: NamedTuple

              A read-only named tuple object representing the result from parsing a commit message.

              Essentially this is a data structure which holds the parsed information from a commit message without the actual commit object itself. Very helpful for unit testing.

              Most of the fields will replicate the fields of a ParsedCommit

              Parameters
                     text -- The text string to be divided.

              Returns
                     A list of condensed paragraphs, as strings.

              Interface for subclasses interacting with a remote VCS

              This abstract class is defined to provide common helper functions and a set of basic methods that all remote VCS environments usually support.

              If the remote vcs implementation (via subclass) does not support a functionality then it can just call super()'s method which defaults as a non-supported  log  message  and  empty  results.
              This is more straightforward than checking for NotImplemented around every function call in the core library code.

              Bases: object

              Interface for subclasses that replace a version string in a source file.

              Methods generally have a base implementation are implemented here but likely just provide a not-supported message but return gracefully

              This class cannot be instantiated directly but must be inherited from and implement the designated abstract methods.

              abstractmethod parse() -> set[Version]
                     Return  a set of the versions which can be parsed from the file.  Because a source can match in multiple places, this method returns a set of matches. Generally, there should only be
                     one element in this set (i.e. even if the version is specified in multiple places, it should be the same version in each place), but enforcing that condition is not mandatory or  ex‐
                     pected.

              abstractmethod replace(new_version: Version) -> str
                     Replace the version in the source content with new_version, and return the updated content.

                     Parameters
                            new_version -- The new version number as a Version instance

              abstractmethod update_file_w_version(new_version: Version, noop: bool = False) -> Path | None
                     This method reads the underlying file, replaces each occurrence of the matched pattern, then writes the updated file.

                     Parameters
                            new_version -- The new version number as a Version instance

       class semantic_release.version.declarations.pattern.PatternVersionDeclaration(path: Path | str, search_text: str, stamp_format: VersionStampType)
              Bases: IVersionReplacer

              VersionDeclarationABC implementation representing a version number in a particular file. The version number is identified by a regular expression, which should be provided in search_text.

              property content: str
                     A cached property that stores the content of the configured source file.

              classmethod from_string_definition(replacement_def: str, tag_format: str) -> PatternVersionDeclaration
                     create an instance of self from a string representing one item of the "version_variables" list in the configuration

              parse() -> set[Version]
                     Return the versions matching this pattern.  Because a pattern can match in multiple places, this method returns a set of matches.  Generally, there should only be one element in this
                     set (i.e. even if the version is specified in multiple places, it should be the same version in each place), but it falls on the caller to check for this condition.

   Commit messages
       Since  python-semantic-release  is  released with python-semantic-release we need the commit messages to adhere to the Conventional Commits Specification.  Although scopes are optional, scopes are
       expected where applicable. Changes should be committed separately with the commit type they represent, do not combine them all into one commit.

       If you are unsure how to describe the change correctly just try and ask about it in your pr. If we think it should be something else or there is a pull-request without tags we  will  help  out  in
       adding or changing them.

   Releases
       This package is released by python-semantic-release on each master build, thus if there are changes that should result in a new release it will happen if the build is green.

   Development
       Install this module and the development dependencies

          pip install -e .[dev,mypy,test]

       And if you'd like to build the documentation locally

          pip install -e .[docs]
          sphinx-autobuild --open-browser docs docs/_build/html

   Testing
       To test your modifications locally:

          # Run type-checking, all tests across all supported Python versions
          tox

          # Run all tests for your current installed Python version (with full error output)
          pytest -vv --comprehensive

          # Run unit tests for your current installed Python version
          pytest
          # or
          pytest -vv -m unit

          # Run end-to-end tests for your current installed Python version (with full error output)
          pytest -vv -m e2e [--comprehensive]

       The --comprehensive flag is optional and will run all the variations of tests and it does take significantly longer to run.

   Building
       This project is designed to be versioned and built by itself using the tool.semantic_release configuration in pyproject.toml. The setting tool.semantic_release.build_command defines the command to
       run to build the package.

       The following is a copy of the build_command setting which can be run manually to build the package locally:

          pip install -e .[build]
          python -m build .

                                                                                                       ----

GETTING STARTED
       If you haven't done so already, install Python Semantic Release locally following the installation instructions.

       If  you  are  using  a CI/CD service, you may not have to add Python Semantic Release to your project's dependencies permanently, but for the duration of this guide for the initial setup, you will
       need to have it installed locally.

   Configuring PSR
       Python Semantic Release ships with a reasonable default configuration but some aspects MUST be customized to your project. To view the default configuration, run the following command:

          semantic-release generate-config

       The output of the above command is the default configuration in TOML format without any modifications.  If this is fine for your project, then you do not need to configure anything else.

       PSR accepts overrides to the default configuration keys individually. If you don't define the key-value pair in your configuration file, the default value will be used.

       By default, Python Semantic Release will look for configuration overrides in pyproject.toml under the TOML table [tool.semantic_release]. You may specify a different file using the -c/--config op‐
       tion, for example:

          # In TOML format with top level table [semantic_release]
          semantic-release -c releaserc.toml

          # In JSON format with top level object key {"semantic_release": {}}
          semantic-release -c releaserc.json

       The easiest way to get started is to output the default configuration to a file, delete keys you do not need to override, and then edit the remaining keys to suit your project.

       To set up in pyproject.toml, run the following command:

          # In file redirect in bash
          semantic-release generate-config --pyproject >> pyproject.toml

          # Open your editor to edit the configuration
          vim pyproject.toml

   Configuring the Version Stamp Feature
       One of the best features of Python Semantic Release is the ability to automatically stamp the new version number into your project files, so you don't have to manually update the version upon each
       release. The version that is stamped is automatically determined by Python Semantic Release from your commit messages which compliments automated versioning seamlessly.

       The most crucial version stamp is the one in your project metadata, which is used by the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other package managers to identify the version of your package.

       For Python projects, this is typically the version field in your pyproject.toml file. First, set up your project metadata with the base version value. If you are starting with a brand new project,
       set project.version = "0.0.0".  If you are working on an existing project, set it to the last version number you released. Do not include any v prefix.

       IMPORTANT:
          The version number must be a valid SemVer version, which means it should follow the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0). Python Semantic Release does NOT support Canonical version values de‐
          fined in the PEP 440 specification at this time. See Issue #455 for more details. Note that you can still define a SemVer version in the project.version field, and when your build is generated,
          the build tool will automatically generate a PEP 440 compliant version as long as you do NOT use a non-pep440 compliant pre-release token.

       Your project metadata might look like this in pyproject.toml:

          [project]
          name = "my-package"
          version = "0.0.0"  # Set this to the last released version or "0.0.0" for new projects
          description = "A sample Python package"

       To configure PSR to automatically update this version number, you need to specify the file and value to update in your configuration. Since pyproject.toml uses TOML format, you will  add  the  re‐
       placement specification to the tool.semantic_release.version_toml list. Update the following configuration in your pyproject.toml file to include the version variable location:

          [tool.semantic_release]
          version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:project.version"]

          # Alternatively, if you are using poetry's 'version' key, then you would use:
          version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:tool.poetry.version"]

       If  you  have  other TOML files where you want to stamp the version, you can add them to the version_toml list as well. In the above example, there is an implicit assumption that you only want the
       version as the raw number format. If you want to specify the full tag value (e.g. v-prefixed version), then include :tf for "tag format" at the end of the version variable specification.

       For non-TOML formatted files (such as JSON or YAML files), you can use the version_variables configuration key instead. This feature uses an advanced Regular Expression to  find  and  replace  the
       version variable in the specified files.

       For Python files, its much more effective to use importlib instead which will allow you to dynamically import the version from your package metadata and not require your project to commit the ver‐
       sion number bump to the repository. For example, in your package's base __init__.py

          # my_package/__init__.py
          from importlib.metadata import version as get_version

          __version__ = get_version(__package__)
          # Note: __package__ must match your 'project.name' as defined in pyproject.toml

   Using PSR to Build your Project
       PSR  provides  a  convenient  way  to build your project artifacts as part of the versioning process now that you have stamped the version into your project files. To enable this, you will need to
       specify the build command in your configuration. This command will be executed after the next version has been determined, and stamped into your files but before a release tag has been created.

       To set up the build command, add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

          [tool.semantic_release]
          build_command = "python -m build --sdist --wheel ."

       SEE ALSO:

          • build_command - Configuration specification for the build command.

          • build_command_env - Configuration specification for the build command environment variables.

   Choosing a Commit Message Parser
       PSR uses commit messages to determine the type of version bump that should be applied to your project. PSR supports multiple commit message parsing styles, allowing you to choose the one that best
       fits your project's needs. Choose one of the supported commit parsers defined in Commit Parsing, or provide your own and configure it in your pyproject.toml file.

       Each commit parser has its own default configuration options so if you want to customize the parser behavior, you will need to specify the parser options you want to override.

          [tool.semantic_release]
          commit_parser = "conventional"

          [tool.semantic_release.commit_parser_options]
          minor_tags = ["feat"]
          patch_tags = ["fix", "perf"]
          parse_squash_commits = true
          ignore_merge_commits = true

   Choosing your Changelog
       Prior to creating a release, PSR will generate a changelog from the commit messages of your project. The changelog is extremely customizable from the format to the content of  each  section.   PSR
       ships with a default changelog template that will be used if you do not provide custom templates. The default should be sufficient for most projects and has its own set of configuration options.

       For  basic customization, you can choose either an traditional Markdown formatted changelog (default) or if you want to integrate with a Sphinx Documentation project, you can use the reStructured‐
       Text (RST) format. You can also choose the file name and location of where to write the default changelog.

       To set your changelog location and changelog format, add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog.default_templates]
          changelog_file = "docs/source/CHANGELOG.rst"
          output_format = "rst" # or "md" for Markdown format

       Secondly, the more important aspect of configuring your changelog is to define Commit Exclusion Patterns or patterns that will be used to filter out commits from the changelog. PSR does NOT  (yet)
       come with a built-in set of exclusion patterns, so you will need to define them yourself. These commit patterns should be in line with your project's commit parser configuration.

       To set commit exclusion patterns for a conventional commits parsers, add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

          [tool.semantic_release.changelog]
          # Recommended patterns for conventional commits parser that is scope aware
          exclude_commit_patterns = [
              '''chore(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''ci(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''refactor(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''style(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''test(?:\([^)]*?\))?: .+''',
              '''build\((?!deps\): .+)''',
              '''Initial [Cc]ommit.*''',
          ]

          • changelog.mode - Choose the changelog mode ('update' or 'init')

   Defining your Release Branches
       PSR  provides  a  powerful feature to manage release types across multiple branches which can allow you to configure your project to have different release branches for different purposes, such as
       pre-release branches, beta branches, and your stable releases.

       NOTE:
          Most projects that do NOT publish pre-releases will be fine with PSR's built-in default.

       To define an alpha pre-release branch when you are working on a fix or new feature, you can add the following to your pyproject.toml file:

          [tool.semantic_release.branches.alpha]
          # Matches branches with the prefixes 'feat/', 'fix/', or 'perf/'.
          match = "^(feat|fix|perf)/.+"
          prerelease = true
          prerelease_token = "alpha"

       Any time you execute semantic-release version on a branch with the prefix feat/, fix/, or perf/, PSR will determine if a version bump is needed and if so, the resulting version will be  a  pre-re‐
       lease version with the alpha token. For example,
                                                                         ┌───────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────┐

   Configuring VCS Releases
       You can set up Python Semantic Release to create Releases in your remote version control system, so you can publish assets and release notes for your project.

       In  order to do so, you will need to place an authentication token in the appropriate environment variable so that Python Semantic Release can authenticate with the remote VCS to push tags, create
       releases, or upload files.

   GitHub (GH_TOKEN)
       For local publishing to GitHub, you should use a personal access token and store it in your environment variables. Specify the name of  the  environment  variable  in  your  configuration  setting
       remote.token.  The default is GH_TOKEN.

       To generate a token go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click on "Generate new token".

       For Personal Access Token (classic), you will need the repo scope to write (ie. push) to the repository.

       For fine-grained Personal Access Tokens, you will need the contents permission.

   GitLab (GITLAB_TOKEN)
       A personal access token from GitLab. This is used for authenticating when pushing tags, publishing releases etc. This token should be stored in the GITLAB_TOKEN environment variable.

   Gitea (GITEA_TOKEN)
       A personal access token from Gitea. This token should be stored in the GITEA_TOKEN environment variable.

   Bitbucket (BITBUCKET_TOKEN)
       Bitbucket does not support uploading releases but can still benefit from automated tags and changelogs. The user has three options to push changes to the repository:

       1. Use SSH keys.

       2. Use an App Secret, store the secret in the BITBUCKET_TOKEN environment variable and the username in BITBUCKET_USER.

       3. Use an Access Token for the repository and store it in the BITBUCKET_TOKEN environment variable.

   Testing your Configuration
       It's time to test your configuration!

          # 1. Run the command in no-operation mode to see what would happen
          semantic-release -v --noop version

          # 2. If the output looks reasonable, try to run the command without any history changes
          #    '-vv' will give you verbose debug output, which is useful for troubleshooting
          #    commit parsing issues.
          semantic-release -vv version --no-commit --no-tag

          # 3. Evaluate your repository to see the changes that were made but not committed
          #    - Check the version number in your pyproject.toml
          #    - Check the distribution files from the build command
          #    - Check the changelog file for the new release notes

          # 4. If everything looks good, make sure to commit/save your configuration changes
          git add pyproject.toml
          git commit -m "chore(config): configure Python Semantic Release"

          # 5. Now, try to run the release command with your history changes but without pushing
          semantic-release -v version --no-push --no-vcs-release

          # 6. Check the result on your local repository
          git status
          git log --graph --decorate --all

          # 7a. If you are happy with the release history and resulting commit & tag,
          #     reverse your changes before trying the full release command.
          git tag -d v0.0.1  # replace with the actual version you released
          git reset --hard HEAD~1

          # 7b. [Optional] Once you have configured a remote VCS token, try
          #     running the full release command to update the remote repository.
          semantic-release version --push --vcs-release
          #    This is optional as you may not want a personal access token set up or make
          #    make the release permanent yet.
