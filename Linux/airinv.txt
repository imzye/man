NAME
       airinvCommand-line interpreter for the C++ Simulated Airline Inventory Management System library

SYNOPSIS
       airinv [--prefix] [-v|--version] [-h|--help] [-b|--builtin] [-f|--for_schedule] [-i|--inventory <path-to-inventory-input-file>] [-s|--schedule <path-to-schedule-input-file>] [-o|--ond <path-to-ond-
       input-file>] [-y|--yield <path-to-yield-input-file>] [-l|--log <path-to-output-log-file>]

DESCRIPTION
       airinv is a small program showing how to use the AirInv library.

       airinv accepts the following options:

       --prefix
        Show the AirInv installation prefix.

       -v, --version
        Print the currently installed version of AirInv on the standard output.

       -h, --help
        Produce that message and show usage.

       -b, --builtin
        The sample BOM tree can be either built-in or parsed from an input file. That latter must then be given with either the -i/--inventory option or the set of -s/--schedule, -o/--ond options.

       -f, --for_schedule
        The BOM tree should be built from a schedule file (instead of from an inventory dump).

       -i, --inventory <path-to-input-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the (CSV) input file specifying the inventory (flight-date) details.

       -s, --schedule <path-to-input-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the (CSV) input file specifying the network/schedule (flight-period) details.

       -o, --ond <path-to-input-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the (CSV) input file specifying the O&D (origin/destination) details.

       -y, --yield <path-to-input-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the (CSV) input file specifying the yield rule details.

       -l, --log <path-to-output-log-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the output log file.

       See the output of the `airinv --help' command for default options.
