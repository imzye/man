DESCRIPTION
       Check  if  all  servers  in the PVFS2 volume at MOUNTPOINT are running.
       pvfs2-ping will go through several phases
       Checking pvfstab
              finds the first pvfs2tab file according to the usual  rules  and
              displays  the  initial  server,  the storage name, and the local
              mount point.
       Initialization

              mation.  Displays the meta servers and the data servers, as well
              as on which port they are running
       Verify Response
              verifies all servers in the PVFS2 volume respond to requests
       Identifier Consistency
              Makes sure all servers agree that the file-system identifier for
              the filesystem is the same on all servers
       Root Handle Check
              Makes sure that only one server owns the file system's root han‐
              dle
