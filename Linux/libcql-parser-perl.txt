NAME
       CQL::ModifierSet - represents a base string and modifier strings

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       This class is used as a delegate by both CQLRelation and CQLProxNode - two functionally very separate classes that happen to require similar data structures and functionality.

       A ModifierSet consists of a ``base'' string together with a set of zero or more type=value pairs, where both type and value are strings.  Types may be null, values may not.

METHODS
   new()
       Creates a new modifier set with the specified base.

   getBase()
       Returns the base string with which the modifier set was created.

   addModifier()
       Adds a modifier of the specified type and value to a modifier set.

   modifier()
       Returns a modifier with a given type, or null if a modifier of that type isn't present.

   getModifiers()
       Returns a list of modifiers each represented by a 2 element array ref.
