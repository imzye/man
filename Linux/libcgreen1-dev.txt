NAME
       cgreen - a framework for C and C++ unit tests and mocking

DESCRIPTION
       Cgreen is a framework for creating and running compact and easy-to-read unittests for C and/or C++.

       Here are some of its features:

       • Fluent API resulting in very readable tests

       • Expressive and clear output using the default reporter

       • Fully functional mocks, both strict and loose

       • Each test runs in its own process for test suite robustness

       • Automatic discovery and running of tests using dynamic library inspection

       • Extensive and expressive constraints for many datatypes

       • BDD-flavoured test declarations with Before and After declarations

       • Extensible reporting mechanism

       • Fully composable test suites

       • An isolated test can be run in a single process for debugging
