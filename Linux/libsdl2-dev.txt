NAME
       sdl2-config - script to get information about the installed version of SDL

SYNOPSIS
       sdl2-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--cflags] [--libs] [--static-libs]

DESCRIPTION
       sdl2-config  is a tool that is used to configure and determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs, libraries, and plugins that use SDL.  It is also used
       internally by the m4 macros that are included with SDL.

       In new code, consider using pkg-config(1) or pkgconf(1) instead of sdl2-config.  To support cross-compiling, if the environment variable PKG_CONFIG is set, its value should be used instead of  the
       literal name pkg-config or pkgconf.

       In Autotools build systems, the preferred way to detect SDL is with the PKG_CHECK_MODULES([SDL], [sdl2]) macro invocation from pkg.m4(7).

       In Meson build systems, the preferred way to detect SDL is with Meson's usual dependency('sdl2') function call.

       In  CMake  build  systems,  the preferred way to detect SDL is to use find_package(SDL2 CONFIG) and optionally find_package(SDL2 CONFIG COMPONENTS SDL2main), then link to SDL2::SDL2 and optionally
       SDL2::SDL2main.

OPTIONS
       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program or library that uses SDL.

              The pkg-config equivalent is ${PKG_CONFIG:-pkg-config} --cflags sdl2.

       --exec-prefix[=DIR]
              If DIR is not specified, print the exec prefix of the current SDL installation.  The pkg-config equivalent is ${PKG_CONFIG:-pkg-config} --variable=exec_prefix sdl2.

              If DIR is specified, use it instead of the installation exec prefix that SDL was built with when computing the output for the --cflags, --libs and --static-libs options.  This  option  must
              be  specified  before  any of the options --cflags, --libs and --static-libs.  The pkg-config equivalent is ${PKG_CONFIG:-pkg-config} --define-variable=exec_prefix=DIR [--cflags|--libs|...]
              sdl2.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program that uses SDL.

              The pkg-config equivalent is ${PKG_CONFIG:-pkg-config} --libs sdl2.

       --static-libs
              Print the linker flags that are necessary to statically link a program that uses SDL.

              The pkg-config equivalent is ${PKG_CONFIG:-pkg-config} --static --libs sdl2.

       --prefix[=DIR]
              If DIR is not specified, print the prefix of the current SDL installation.  The pkg-config equivalent is ${PKG_CONFIG:-pkg-config} --variable=prefix sdl2.

              If DIR is specified, use it instead of the installation prefix that SDL was built with when computing the output for the --cflags, --libs and --static-libs options.   This  option  is  also
              used  for  the  exec  prefix  if  --exec-prefix was not specified.  This option must be specified before any of the options --cflags, --libs and --static-libs.  The pkg-config equivalent is
              ${PKG_CONFIG:-pkg-config} --define-variable=prefix=DIR [--cflags|--libs|...]  sdl2.

       --version
              Prints the currently installed version of SDL on standard output.  The pkg-config equivalent is ${PKG_CONFIG:-pkg-config} --modversion sdl2.

EXAMPLES
       gcc -o main.o $(sdl2-config --cflags) main.c
              is how you might use sdl2-config to compile a C source file for an executable program.

       gcc -o my_app $(sdl2-config --libs) main.o util.o
              is how you might use sdl2-config to link compiled objects into an executable program.
