NAME
       mwrank - determines the rank of an elliptic curve E over Q by 2-descent and generating points for E(Q) modulo torsion

DESCRIPTION
       mwrank  is organized as a loop where the user enters curves one by one and the program displays what it can compute about them.  An elliptic curve is entered by giving its Weierstrass coefficients
       (which may be integers or rationals, either as [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6] or as a1 a2 a3 a4 a6.

       Here are mwrank command line options (can be in any order):

       -h      help            prints this info and quits

       -q      quiet           turns OFF banner display

       -v n    verbosity       sets verbosity to n (default=1)

       -o      PARI/GP output  turns ON extra PARI/GP short output (default is OFF)

       -p n    precision       sets precision to n decimals (default=15)

       -b n    quartic bound   bound on quartic point search (default=10)

       -x n    n aux           number of aux primes used for sieving (default=6)

       -l      list            turns ON listing of points (default ON unless v=0)

       -t      trace           turns ON trace of quartic equivalence testing (debugging only)

       -s      selmer_only     if set, computes Selmer rank only (default: not set)

       -d      skip_2nd_descent        if set, skips the second descent for curves with 2-torsion (default: not set)

       -S n    sat_bd          upper bound on saturation primes (default=1000, -1 for automatic)
