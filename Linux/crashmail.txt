NAME
       crashlist - Compile a CrashMail nodelist

SYNOPSIS
       crashlist dir

DESCRIPTION
       Builds  an  index  for  the  nodelists  in  the  specified  directory  (or  in the current directory if no directory is specified). To find out what nodelists to read, CrashList uses a file called
       cmnodelist.prefs in the nodelist directory. The format of this file is as follows:

       <nodelist name> [<default zone>]

       As the name of the nodelist, you can either specify the full name of the nodelist or just the base name of the nodelist (without .xxx at the end).  If you just specify  the  base  name,  CrashList
       will  use  the latest nodelist with that name (selected by date, not the extension). A default zone can be used for regional nodelists without a Zone line. All lines beginning with a semicolon are
       treated as comments. Pointlists should be in BinkleyTerm format and should be specified after the real nodelists.
