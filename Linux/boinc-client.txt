NAME
       boinccmd - The command line interface to the BOINC client.

SYNOPSIS
       boinccmd [--host hostname[:port]] [--passwd passwd] {command}
       boinccmd [-hV]

       Notice that the order of the options is important. The --host and --passwd options must precede any command.

DESCRIPTION
       The  BOINC  command  tool (boinccmd) provides a command line interface to control a running BOINC client (boinc(1)). It communicates with a running client using port 31416 over TCP/IP. It can only
       connect to one client at a time.

OPTIONS
       --host hostname[:port]
              Connect to the host hostname.  The default host is localhost.

       --passwd passwd
              Use passwd as password for RPC authentication. If the current working directory contains a file gui_rpc_auth.cfg, boinccmd will read the password from this file.

       -h, --help
              Show a help message and all commands.

       -V, --version
              Show the version of the program.
