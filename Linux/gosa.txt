NAME
       gosa.conf - GOsa configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The gosa.conf file contains configuration information for GOsa, a powerful GPL'ed framework for managing accounts and systems in LDAP databases.

       The  gosa.conf  file is a XML style configuration file. It is parsed by the GOsa web application during log in.  The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Tag keywords
       in the file are case-insensitive. Comments should be placed outside of XML tags and should be encapsulated inside of <!-- --> tags.

       The gosa.conf file can be used to configure the look and feel, behaviour and access control of the GOsa webinterface.

Configuration layout
       The configuration has to be specified inside of the <conf> tags. It basically consists of three main parts: menu definition, definition of subdialogs (tabbed dialogs) and the main configuration  -
       including information about several locations.

       Layout example:

         <?xml version="1.0"?>

         <conf configVersion="...." >
           <!-- Menu definition -->
           <menu>
           ...
           </menu>

           <!-- Tabbed dialog definitions -->
           ...

           <!-- Global setup -->
           <main>

              <!-- Location specific setups -->
              <location name="">
                ...
              </location>

           </main>

         </conf>

Menu definition
       This tag defines the side and icon menu inside the interface. Defining an entry here is no guarantie to get it shown, though. Only entries with matching ACL's get shown.

       There are two types of entries inside of the menu: section and plugin

       Defining a section

       Open a <section> tag including a name attribute. This will show up in the menu as a new section later on.  Own entries are not handled via I18N by default. Close the </section> tag after your plu‐
       gin definitions.

       Defining a plugin

       Open a <plugin> tag including a class attribute. The class should be present inside your GOsa setup - the entry will be ignored if it is not.

       Plugins should have an acl entry, that allows GOsa to decide whether a user is allowed to see a plugin or not.  The acl string matches with an ACL definition done inside of GOsa.

       You can override an icon by specifying the icon attribute.

       For every plugin, you can provide at least seven additional hooks: precreate, preremove, premodify postcreate, postremove, postmodify and check.

       These can be used to perform special actions when a plugins gets a create, delete, modify or check request. As a parameter, these keywords get a shell script or program to the task.

       NOTE:  Any  hook call using data input from users (ie: passwords) should take measures to prevent shell injection attacks that could lead to RCE. Specifically with Passwords, Gosa has been updated
       to base64 encode new_password and current_password used for all hook calls to mitigate this risk. All other values get escapeShellArg() escaped only, which can be exploited in certain  conditions.
       Any hook using a password value needs to base64 decode the value before using it.

       Example password hook: to run a single command, like gam, to update passwords, in User Password premodify:

              /usr/local/bin/gam update user %uid password $(echo %new_password|base64 -d)

       The create / delete / modify keywords

       These keywords take a full executable path of a script. You can provide certain parameters in form of LDAP attributes. '%uid' will pass the current user id, '%dn' the current object dn, etc.

       The script gets executed before(pre) and after(post) create, delete or modify tasks.

       The check keyword

       This  keyword  takes a full executable path of a script. Check is triggered after you press the -I "Apply" or -I "OK" button. The complete LDAP entry as it will be written to the LDAP is passed to
       your script. If parts of the entry do not match some logic of your script, just print an error message to STDOUT. GOsa will show this message and abort the current process of saving the  entry  to
       the LDAP.

       Example menu definition:

         <menu>
           <section name="My account">
             <plugin acl="users/user:self" class="user" check="/usr/local/bin/test_user.sh" />
             <plugin acl="users/samba:self" class="sambaAccount" postcreate="/usr/local/bin/create_share '%uid'" />
           </section>
         </menu>

Tabbed dialog definitions
       Tab definitions define the sub plugins which get included for certain tabbed dialogs. If you change something here, never (!) remove the primary (the first) "tab" tag which is defined. Most tabbed
       dialogs need a primary plugin.

       *tab should be looked for by a defined plugin. This one will take every tab defined class and will show it inside of a tabbed dialog with the header defined in name .

       Example tabbed dialog definition:

         <grouptabs>
           <tab class="group" name="Generic" />
           <tab class="environment" name="Environment" />
           <tab class="appgroup" name="Applications" />
           <tab class="mailgroup" name="Mail" />
         </grouptabs>

Main section
       The main section defines global settings, which might be overridden by each location definition inside of this global definition.

       Example layout:

         <main default="Example Net"
               listSummary="false"
               ... >

               <location name="Example Net"
                         hash="md5"
                         accountPrimaryAttribute="cn"
                         ...

                         <referral uri="ldaps://ldap.example.net:636/dc=example,dc=net"
                                   admin="cn=gosa-admin,dc=example,dc=net"
                                   password="secret" />

               </location>

         </main>

       Generic options

       forceGlobals bool

       The forceGlobals statement enables PHP security checks to force register_global settings to be switched off.

       forceSSL bool

       The forceSSL statement enables PHP security checks to force encrypted access to the web interface. GOsa will try to redirect to the same URL - just with https://.

       warnSSL bool

       The warnSSL statement enables PHP security checks to detect non encrypted access to the web interface. GOsa will display a warning in this case.

       modificationDetectionAttribute string

       The  modificationDetectionAttribute  statement enables GOsa to check if a entry currently being edited has been modified from someone else outside GOsa in the meantime. It will display an informa‐
       tive dialog then. It can be set to entryCSN for OpenLDAP based systems or contextCSN for Sun DS based systems.

       logging string

       The logging statement enables event logging on GOsa side. Setting it to true, GOsa will log every action a user performs via syslog. If you use rsyslog and configure it to mysql logging,  you  can
       browse all events within GOsa.

       GOsa will not log anything, if the logging value is empty or set to false.

       loginAttribute string

       The loginAttribute statement tells GOsa which LDAP attribute is used as the login name during login. It can be set to uid, mail or both.

       copyPaste bool

       The copyPaste statement enables copy and paste for LDAP entries managed with GOsa.

       enableSnapshots bool

       The enableSnapshots statement enables a snapshot mechaism in GOsa. This enables you to save certain states of entries and restore them later on.

       snapshotBase dn

       The snapshotBase statement defines the base where snapshots should be stored inside of the LDAP.

       snapshotURI uri

       The snapshotURI variable defines the LDAP URI for the server which is used to do object snapshots.

       snapshotAdminDn dn

       The snapshotAdminDn variable defines the user which is used to authenticate when connecting to snapshotURI.

       snapshotAdminPassword string

       The snapshotAdminPassword variable defines the credentials which are used in combination with snapshotAdminDn and snapshotURI in order to authenticate.

       config dn

       The config statement defines the LDAP base, where GOsa stores management information, such as site wide locking and user notifications.

       templateCompileDirectory path

       The templateCompileDirectory statements defines the path, where the PHP templating engins smarty should store its compiled GOsa templates for improved speed. This path needs to be writeable by the
       user your webserver is running with.

       timezone string

       The  timezone statements defines the timezone used inside of GOsa to handle date related tasks, such as password expiery, vacation messages, etc.  The timezone value should be a unix conform time‐
       zone value like in /etc/timezone.

       honourIvbbAttributes bool

       The honourIvbbAttributes statement enables the IVBB mode inside of GOsa. You need the ivbb.schema file from used by german authorities.

       strictNamingRules bool

       The strictNamingRules statement enables strict checking of uids and group names. If you need characters like . or - inside of your accounts, set this to false.

       allowUidProposalModification bool

       The allowUidProposalModification statement enables the abilitiy to modify uid proposals when creating a new user from a template.

       honourUnitTags bool

       The honourUnitTags statement enables checking of unitTag attributes when using administrative units. If this is set to true GOsa can only see objects inside  the  administrative  unit  a  user  is
       logged into.

       rfc2307bis bool

       The  rfc2307bis  statement enables rfc2307bis style groups in GOsa. You can use member attributes instead of memberUid in this case. To make it work on unix systems, you've to adjust your NSS con‐
       figuration to use rfc2307bis style groups, too.

       ppdPath path

       The ppdPath variable defines where to store PPD files for the GOto environment plugins.

       ppdGzip bool

       The ppdGzip variable enables PPD file compression.

       resolutions path

       The resolutions variable defines a plain text file which contains additional resolutions to be shown in the environment and system plugins.

       htaccessAuthentication bool

       The htaccessAuthentication variable tells GOsa to use either htaccess authentication or LDAP authentication. This can be used if you want to use i.e. kerberos to authenticate the users.

       gosaSupportURI URI

       The gosaSupportURI defines the major gosa-si server host and the password for GOsa to connect to it.  can be used if you want to use i.e. kerberos to authenticate the users.

       The format is:

       credentials@host:port

       gosaSupportTimeout integer

       The gosaSupportTimeout sets a connection timeout for all gosa-si actions. See gosaSupportURI for details.

       Browser and display options

       listSummary true/false

       The listSummary statement determines whether a status bar will be shown on the bottom of GOsa generated lists, displaying a short summary of type and number of elements in the list.

       sendCompressedOutput true/false

       The sendCompressedOutput statement determines whether PHP should send compressed HTML pages to browsers or not. This may increase or decrease the performance, depending on your network.

       storeFilterSettings true/false

       The storeFilterSettings statement determines whether GOsa should store filter and plugin settings inside of a cookie.

       language string

       The language statement defines the default language used by GOsa. Normally GOsa autodetects the language from the browser settings. If this is not working or you want to force the  language,  just
       add the language code (i.e. de for german) here.

       theme string

       The  theme  statement  defines  what theme is used to display GOsa pages. You can install some corporate identity like theme and/or modify certain templates to fit your needs within themes. Take a
       look at the GOsa FAQ for more information.

       sessionLifetime int

       The sessionLifetime value defines when a session will expire in seconds. For Debian systems, this will not work because the sessions will be removed by a cron job instead. Please modify the  value
       inside of your php.ini instead.

       Password options

       passwordMinLength integer

       The passwordMinLength statement determines whether a newly entered password has to be of a minimum length.

       passwordMinDiffer integer

       The passwordMinDiffer statement determines whether a newly entered password has to be checked to have at least n different characters.

       passwordProposalHook command

       The  passwordProposalHook  can  be  used  to let GOsa generate password proposals for you.  Whenever you change a password, you can then decide whether to use the proposal or to manually specify a
       password.

       /usr/bin/apg -n1

       strictPasswordRules bool

       The strictPasswordRules tells GOsa to check for UTF-8 characters in the supplied password. These Characters can lead to non working authentications if UTF-8 and  none  UTF-8  systems  locales  get
       mixed. The default is "true".

       handleExpiredAccounts bool

       The handleExpiredAccounts statement enables shadow attribute tests during the login to the GOsa web interface and forces password renewal or account lockout.

       useSaslForKerberos bool

       The  useSaslForKerberos  statement  defines  the  way  the  kerberos  realm  is  stored in the userPassword attribute. Set it to true in order to get {sasl}user@REALM.NET, or to false to get {ker‐
       beros}user@REALM.NET. The latter is outdated, but may be needed from time to time.

       LDAP options

       ldapMaxQueryTime integer

       The ldapMaxQueryTime statement tells GOsa to stop LDAP actions if there is no answer within the specified number of seconds.

       schemaCheck bool

       The schemaCheck statement enables or disables schema checking during login. It is recommended to switch this on in order to let GOsa handle object creation more efficient.

       ldapTLS bool

       The ldapTLS statement enables or disables TLS operating on LDAP connections.

       accountPrimaryAttribute cn/uid

       The accountPrimaryAttribute option tells GOsa how to create new accounts. Possible values are uid and cn.  In the first case GOsa creates uid style DN entries:
       uid=superuser,ou=staff,dc=example,dc=net
       In the second case, GOsa creates cn style DN entries:
       cn=Foo Bar,ou=staff,dc=example,dc=net
       If you choose "cn" to be your accountPrimaryAttribute you can decide whether to include the personal title in your dn by selecting personalTitleInDN.

       accountRDN pattern

       The accountRDN option tells GOsa to use a placeholder pattern for generating account RDNs. A pattern can include attribute names prefaced by a % and normal text:
       accountRDN="cn=%sn %givenName"
       This will generate a RDN consisting of cn=.... filled with surname and given name of the edited account. This option disables the use of accountPrimaryAttribute and personalTitleInDn in your  con‐
       fig. The latter attributes are maintained for compatibility.

       personalTitleInDN bool

       The personalTitleInDN option tells GOsa to include the personal title in user DNs when accountPrimaryAttribute is set to "cn".

       userRDN string

       The userRDN statement defines the location where new accounts will be created inside of defined departments. The default is ou=people.

       groupsRDN string

       The groupsRDN statement defines the location where new groups will be created inside of defined departments. The default is ou=groups.

       sudoRDN string

       The sudoRDN statement defines the location where new groups will be created inside of defined departments. The default is ou=groups.

       sambaMachineAccountRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa looks for new samba workstations.

       ogroupRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new object groups inside of defined departments. Default is ou=groups.

       serverRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new servers inside of defined departments. Default is ou=servers.

       terminalRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new terminals inside of defined departments. Default is ou=terminals.

       workstationRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new workstations inside of defined departments. Default is ou=workstations.

       printerRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new printers inside of defined departments. Default is ou=printers.

       componentRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new network components inside of defined departments. Default is ou=components.

       phoneRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new phones inside of defined departments. Default is ou=phones.

       phoneConferenceRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new phone conferences inside of defined departments. Default is ou=conferences.

       faxBlocklistRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa creates new fax blocklists inside of defined departments. Default is ou=blocklists.

       systemIncomingRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa looks for new systems to be joined to the LDAP.  Default is ou=incoming.

       systemRDN string

       This statement defines the base location for servers, workstations, terminals, phones and components. Default is ou=systems.

       ogroupRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa looks for object groups.  Default is ou=groups.

       aclRoleRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa stores ACL role definitions.  Default is ou=aclroles.

       phoneMacroRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa stores phone macros for use with the Asterisk phone server.  Default is ou=macros,ou=asterisk,ou=configs,ou=systems.

       faiBaseRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa looks for FAI settings.  Default is ou=fai,ou=configs,ou=systems.

       faiScriptRDN, faiHookRDN, faiTemplateRDN, faiVariableRDN, faiProfileRDN, faiPackageRDN, faiPartitionRDN string

       These statement define the location where GOsa stores FAI classes. The complete base for the corresponding class is an additive of faiBaseRDN an and this value.

       deviceRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa looks for devices.  Default is ou=devices.

       mimetypeRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa stores mime type definitions.  Default is ou=mimetypes.

       applicationRDN string

       This statement defines the location where GOsa stores application definitions.  Default is ou=apps.

       ldapFilterNestingLimit integer

       The  ldapFilterNestingLimit statement can be used to speed up group handling for groups with several hundreds of members.  The default behaviour is, that GOsa will resolv the memberUid values in a
       group to real names.  To achieve this, it writes a single filter to minimize searches. Some LDAP servers (namely Sun DS) simply crash when the filter gets too big. You  can  set  a  member  limit,
       where GOsa will stop to do these lookups.

       ldapSizelimit integer

       The ldapSizelimit statement tells GOsa to retrieve the specified maximum number of results. The user will get a warning, that not all entries were shown.

       ldapFollowReferrals bool

       The ldapFollowReferrals statement tells GOsa to follow LDAP referrals.

       Account creation options

       uidNumberBase integer

       The  uidNumberBase  statement defines where to start looking for a new free user id. This should be synced with your adduser.conf to avoid overlapping uidNumber values between local and LDAP based
       lookups. The uidNumberBase can even be dynamic. Take a look at the baseIdHook definition below.

       gidNumberBase integer

       The gidNumberBase statement defines where to start looking for a new free group id. This should be synced with your adduser.conf to avoid overlapping gidNumber values between local and LDAP  based
       lookups. The gidNumberBase can even be dynamic. Take a look at the nextIdHook definition below.

       idAllocationMethod traditional/pool

       The  idAllocationMethod statement defines how GOsa generates numeric user and group id values. If it is set to traditional GOsa will do create a lock and perform a search for the next free ID. The
       lock will be removed after the procedure completes.  pool will use the sambaUnixIdPool objectclass settings inside your LDAP. This one is unsafe, because it does not check for concurrent LDAP  ac‐
       cess and already used IDs in this range.  On the other hand it is much faster.

       minId integer

       The minId statement defines the minimum assignable user or group id to avoid security leaks with uid 0 accounts. This is used for the traditional method

       uidNumberPoolMin/gidNumberPoolMin integer

       The uidNumberPoolMin/gidNumberPoolMin statement defines the minimum assignable user/group id for use with the pool method.

       uidNumberPoolMax/gidNumberPoolMax integer

       The uidNumberPoolMax/gidNumberPoolMax statement defines the highest assignable user/group id for use with the pool method.

       nextIdHook path

       The  nextIdHook  statement  defines  a  script  to be called for finding the next free id for users or groups externaly. It gets called with the current entry "dn" and the attribute to be ID'd. It
       should return an integer value.

       useAutoComplete bool

       The useAutoComplete statement allows you to enable/disable the auto-completion mode when searching for LDAP objects in a given container. Enable it, if you encounter long typing delays in  GOsa²'s
       search field.

       passwordDefaultHash string

       The  passwordDefaultHash  statement  defines the default password hash to choose for new accounts. Valid values are crypt/standard-des, crypt/md5, crypt/enhanced-des, crypt/blowfish, crypt/sha256,
       crypt/sha512, md5, sha, ssha, smd5, clear and sasl.  The complete list is displayed in the "Password storage" pull-down menu in each user's "Generic/Personal Information" view.  These values  will
       be overridden when using templates.

       idGenerator string

       The idGenerator statement describes an automatic way to generate new user ids. There are two basic functions supported - which can be combined:

        a) using attributes

           You can specify LDAP attributes (currently only sn and givenName) in
           braces {} and add a percent sign before it. Optionally you can strip it
           down to a number of characters, specified in []. I.e.

             idGenerator="{%sn}-{%givenName[2-4]}"

           will generate an ID using the full surname, adding a dash, and adding at
           least the first two characters of givenName. If this ID is used, it'll
           use up to four characters. If no automatic generation is possible, a
           input box is shown.

        b) using automatic id's

           I.e. specifying

             idGenerator="acct{id:3}"

           will generate a three digits id with the next free entry appended to
           "acct".

             idGenerator="acct{id!1}"

           will generate a one digit id with the next free entry appended to
           "acct" - if needed.

             idGenerator="ext{id#3}"

           will generate a three digits random number appended to "ext".

       Samba options

       sambaSID string

       The sambaSID statement defines a samba SID if not available inside of the LDAP. You can retrieve the current sid by net getlocalsid.

       sambaRidBase integer

       The sambaRidBase statement defines the base id to add to ordinary sid calculations - if not available inside of the LDAP.

       sambaHashHook string

       The  sambaHashHook  Field,  if blank, samba passwords are not generated or manipulated.  If not blank, Gosa will generate an NTLM hash when a user's password is set, and will lock/unlock this when
       the account is locked/unlocked using internal functions.  LM hashing is intentionally broken (sets the LM hash to a non-valid string) as the method is ancient, broken, and rainbow tables exist for
       all passwords to it. IFF it is needed, set this field to "NTLM+LM" and a valid LM hash will be set along side the NTLM one. Note that Gosa does not use this to specify an actual Hook  command,  it
       only cares if its empty, not empty, or contains "NTLM+LM".

       Safe default: "NTLM" or leave blank.

       sambaIdmapping bool

       The sambaIdMapping statement tells GOsa to maintain sambaIdmapEntry objects. Depending on your setup this can drastically improve the windows login performance.

       Asterisk options

       ctiHook path

       The ctiHook statement defines a script to be executed if someone clicks on a phone number inside of the addressbook plugin. It gets called with two parameters:

       ctiHook $source_number $destination_number

       This script can be used to do automatted dialing from the addressbook.

       Mail options

       mailMethod Cyrus/SendmailCyrus/Kolab/Kolab22

       The mailMethod statement tells GOsa which mail method the setup should use to communicate with a possible mail server. Leave this undefined if your mail method does not match the predefined ones.

       Cyrus maintains accounts and sieve scripts in cyrus servers.  Kolab/Kolab22 is like cyrus, but lets the kolab daemon maintain the accounts.  SendmailCyrus is based on sendmail LDAP attributes.

       cyrusUseSlashes bool

       The cyrusUseSlashes statement determines if GOsa should use "foo/bar" or "foo.bar" namespaces in IMAP. Unix style is with slashes.

       cyrusDeleteMailbox bool

       The cyrusDeleteMailbox statement determines if GOsa should remove the mailbox from your IMAP server or keep it after the account is deleted in LDAP.

       cyrusAutocreateFolders string

       The cyrusAutocreateFolders statement contains a comma separated list of personal IMAP folders that should be created along initial account creation.

       postfixRestrictionFilters path

       The postfixRestrictionFilters statement defines a file to include for the postfix module in order to display user defined restriction filters.

       postfixProtocols path

       The postfixProtocols statement defines a file to include for the postfix module in order to display user defined protocols.

       mailAttribute mail/uid

       The mailAttribute statement determines which attribute GOsa will use to create accounts.  Valid values are mail and uid.

       imapTimeout Integer (default 10)

       The imapTimeout statement sets the connection timeout for imap actions.

       mailFolderCreation  Every  mail  method  has  its own way to create mail accounts like share/development or shared.development@example.com which is used to identify the accounts, set quotas or add
       acls.

       To override the methods default account creation syntax, you can set the mailFolderCreation option.

       Examples

        mailFolderCreation="%prefix%%cn%"              => "shared.development"
        mailFolderCreation="my-prefix.%cn%%domain%"    => "my-prefix.development@example.com">

       Placeholders

        %prefix%    The methods default prefix. (Depends on cyrusUseSlashes=FALSE/TRUE)
        %cn%        The groups/users cn.
        %uid%       The users uid.
        %mail%      The objects mail attribute.
        %domain%    The domain part of the objects mail attribute.
        %mailpart%  The user address part of the mail address.
        %uattrib%   Depends on mailAttribute="uid/mail".

       mailUserCreation This attribute allows one to override the user account creation syntax, see the mailFolderCreation description for more details.

       Examples

        mailUserCreation="%prefix%%uid%"           => "user.foobar"
        mailUserCreation=my-prefix.%uid%%domain%"  => "my-prefix.foobar@example.com"

       vacationTemplateDirectory path

       The vacationTemplateDirectory statement sets the path where GOsa will look for vacation message templates. Default is /etc/gosa/vacation.

       Example template /etc/gosa/vacation/business.txt:

          DESC:Away from desk
          Hi, I'm currently away from my desk. You can contact me on
          my cell phone via %mobile.

          Greetings,
          %givenName %sn

       Debug options

       displayErrors bool

       The displayErrors statement tells GOsa to show PHP errors in the upper part of the screen. This should be disabled in productive deployments,  because  there  might  be  some  important  passwords
       around.

       ldapstats bool

       The ldapstats statement tells GOsa to track LDAP timing statistics to the syslog. This may help to find indexing problems or bad search filters.

       ignoreAcl dn

       The ignoreAcl value tells GOsa to ignore complete ACL sets for the given DN. Add your DN here and you'll be able to restore accidentally dropped ACLs.

       debugLevel integer

       The debugLevel value tells GOsa to display certain information on each page load. Value is an AND combination of the following byte values:

       DEBUG_TRACE   = 1

       DEBUG_LDAP    = 2

       DEBUG_MYSQL   = 4

       DEBUG_SHELL   = 8

       DEBUG_POST    = 16

       DEBUG_SESSION = 32

       DEBUG_CONFIG  = 64

       DEBUG_ACL     = 128

       DEBUG_SI      = 256

       DEBUG_MAIL    = 512

LDAP resource definition
       For every location you define inside your gosa.conf, you need at least one entry of the type referral.  These entries define the way how to connect to some directory service.

       Example:

         <referral uri="ldap://ldap.example.net/dc=example,dc=net"
                   admin="cn=gosa-admin,dc=example,dc=net"
                   password="secret" />

       uri  is a valid LDAP uri extendet by the base this referral is responsible for.  admin is the DN which has the permission to write LDAP entries. And password is the corresponding password for this
       DN.

       You can define a set of referrals if you have several server to connect to.

Settings for the environment plugin
       In order to make full use of the environment plugin, you may want to define the location where kiosk profiles will be stored on the servers harddisk.

       This is done by the kioskPath keyword defined within the environment class definition inside your gosa.conf.

       Example:

         <plugin acl="users/environment"
                 class="environment"
                 kioskPath="/var/spool/kiosk"/>

       Make sure, that this path is writeable by GOsa.

Settings for the FAI plugin
       The FAI plugin can be used in a way that it generates branched or freezed releases inside your repository. Specifying the postcreate and postmodify keywords in the servrepository definition, calls
       the provided script as a hook when adding or removing branches. This script should do the rest inside of your repository.

       Example:

         <tab class="servrepository"
                 repositoryBranchHook="/opt/dak/bin/get_extra_repos"
                 postcreate="/opt/dak/bin/handle_repository '%lock_dn' '%lock_name' '%lock_type' />

       %lock_dn keeps the base DN of the source branch, %lock_name the name of the new branch and %lock_type is either "freeze" or "branch".

       The repositoryBranchHook outputs additional releases, that are not retrieveable with the standard GOsa/FAI methods.

       If you have only one release, or want to define a default release to be shown by GOsa, define the defaultFaiRelease="ou=sarge,ou=fai,ou=configs,ou=syst..."  within the faiManagement class  defini‐
       tion

Settings for the addressbook plugin
       The  addressbook  plugin  can  be configured to store the addressbook data on a special location. Use the addressbookBaseDN keyword within the addressbook class definition inside your gosa.conf to
       configure this location.

       Default: ou=addressbook.

Settings for system plugins
       For the workstationStartup and terminalStartup classes, you can define the systemKernelsHook keyword. It can load additional kernels that are not retrieveable by standard GOsa/FAI mechanisms.

       In order to make use of SNMP information, you can set the snmpCommunity in the terminfo class definition.

       To enable the burn CD image function, you can specify the systemIsoHook in the workgeneric class. You will get a CD symbol in the systems list - which calls the hook if pressed.
