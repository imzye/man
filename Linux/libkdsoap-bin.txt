NAME
       kdwsdl2cpp - KDAB's WSDL to C++ compiler

USAGE
       Header file: kdwsdl2cpp [options] -o <headerfile> <wsdlfile>

       Impl.  file: kdwsdl2cpp [options] -o <cppfile> -impl <headerfile> <wsdlfile>

       Both files : kdwsdl2cpp [options] -both <basefile> <wsdlfile>

OPTIONS
       -h, -help
              display this help and exit

       -v, -version
              display version

       -s, -service
              name of the service to generate

       -o <file>
              output the generated file into <file>

       -impl <headerfile>
              generate the implementation(.cpp) file, and #include <headerfile>

       -both <basefilename>
              generate both the header(.h) and the implementation(.cpp) file

       -server
              generate server-side base class, instead of client service

       -exportMacro <macroname>
              set the export declaration to use for generated classes

       -namespace <ns>
              put all generated classes into the given C++ namespace

       -namespaceMapping <mapping>
              add the uri=code mapping if <mapping> begins with '@', read from file instead one entry per line (affects the generated class names)

       -optional-element-type <type>
              use <type> as the getter return value for optional elements.  <type> can be either raw-pointer, boost-optional or std-optional

       -keep-unused-types
              keep the wsdl unused types to the cpp generation step

       -import-path <importpath>
              search for files first in this path before downloading them. may be specified multiple times.  the file needs to be located at: <importpath>/<url-host>/<url-path>

       -use-local-files-only
              only use local files instead of downloading them automatically. this can be used to force the correct use of the import-path option

       -help-on-missing
              When groups or basic types could not be found, display available types (helps with wrong namespaces)

       -pkcs12file
              Load a certificate from a PKCS12 file. You can use this option if the WSDL file (or files referring to it) is served from a location which require certificate based authentication

       -pkcs12password
              Pass the password for the certificate file if required.  This option is not secure and should be used with caution if other users of the machine are capable to see the running processes ran
              by the current user.
