NAME
       ARanyM - Atari Running on Any Machine - aratapif

SYNOPSIS
       aratapif tap_device host_IP atari_IP netmask mtu_size

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the aratapif program.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       aratapif is used for setting up the network device in ARAnyM. It's basically stripped down version of standard ifconfig command that works on the TAP device only and so it's safe to setuid root.
