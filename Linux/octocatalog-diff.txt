NAME
       octocatalog-diff - Compile and compare Puppet catalogs

SYNOPSIS
       octocatalog-diff [options]

DESCRIPTION
       octocatalog-diff is a tool to detect and display differences in Puppet catalogs compiled from different environments. The catalogs may be obtained through any of the following means:

              •      Compilation using a local puppet instance

              •      Puppet master 3.x/4.x HTTP API

              •      PuppetDB HTTP API

              •      Precompiled JSON catalogs

       octocatalog-diff  filters  out attributes or resources with no effect (e.g. tags) and displays only state differences between the two catalogs. It does not require a working Puppet master (or
       puppetserver), making it suitable for development use and use in Continuous Integration environments.

USAGE
       For a list of all  available options, please consult the output of octocatalog-diff --help.  Usage examples are available under /usr/share/doc/octocatalog-diff.
