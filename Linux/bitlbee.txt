NAME
       BitlBee - IRC gateway to IM chat networks

SYNOPSIS
       bitlbee [-I] [-c configuration file] [-d configuration directory]

       bitlbee -D [-i address] [-p port number] [-n] [-v] [-c configuration file] [-d configuration directory]

       bitlbee -h

DESCRIPTION
       BitlBee is an IRC daemon that can talk to instant messaging networks and acts as a gateway. Users can connect to the server with any normal IRC client and see their 'buddy list' in &bitlbee.

       bitlbee is normally started as a system service (with init scripts, systemd units or equivalent). It can also be run as an inetd(8) / xinetd(8) service or a stand-alone daemon with the options below.

       To use it, connect to it with an IRC client with a command such as "/connect localhost"

RUN MODES
       -I     Run in inetd(8) mode. This is the default setting for historical reasons, but not the recommended one (See ForkDaemon below).

       -D     Run in Daemon mode. In this mode, BitlBee forks to the background and waits for new connections. All clients will be served from one process.  This mode is also useful for debugging.

       -F     Run  in ForkDaemon mode. This is similar to ordinary daemon mode, but every client gets its own process. Easier to set up than inetd mode, and without the possible stability issues. This is the
              recommended runmode for most use cases.

OPTIONS
       -i address
              When running in daemon mode, specifies the network interface (identified by IP address) to which the daemon should attach. Use this if you don't want BitlBee to listen on every interface (which
              is the default behaviour).

       -p port number
              When running in daemon mode, specifies the port number on which BitlBee should listen for connections. 6667 is the default value.

       -n     Wehn running in daemon mode, this option prevents BitlBee from forking into the background.

       -v     Be more verbose. This only works together with the -n flag.

       -c path to other configuration file
              Use a different configuration file.

       -d path to user settings directory
              BitlBee  normally  saves  every user's settings in /var/lib/bitlbee/. If you want the settings to be stored somewhere else (for example, if you don't have write permissions in the default loca‐
              tion), use this option.

       -h     Show help information.
