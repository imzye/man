NAME
     mgp2ps — generate PostScript file from MagicPoint file

SYNOPSIS
     mgp2ps [-cirtV] [-f psfile] [-p papersize] [-x xmargin] [-y ymargin] mgpfile

DESCRIPTION
     mgp2ps is a converter from MagicPoint file mgpfile to PostScript file.  If -f option is specified, PostScript will be generated to psfile.  Otherwise, printed to the standard output.

     If there exists foo.eps corresponding to foo.gif (or whatever), the encapsulated PostScript file will be included to the PostScript file instead.

     The following options are available:

     -c      Generate color PostScript file (experimental).  By default mgp2ps will generate monochrome postscript file.

     -i      Paint inside icon symbols.

     -r      Stack the paper in reverse order.

     -V      Be verbose.
