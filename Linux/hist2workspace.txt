SYNOPSIS
       usage: hist2workspace [-h] [-standard_form STANDARD_FORM]
                             [-number_counting_form NUMBER_COUNTING_FORM] [-v] [-vv]

DESCRIPTION
       hist2workspace is a utility to create RooFit/RooStats workspace from histograms

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              show this help message and exit

       -standard_form
              default  model,  which  creates  an  extended PDF that interpolates between RooHistFuncs

              This is much faster for models with many bins and uses significantly less memory

       -number_counting_form
              This was the original model in 5.28 (without patches). It uses a Poisson for each

              bin of the histogram.  This can become slow and memory intensive when there are many bins.

       -v     Switch HistFactory message stream to INFO level.

       -vv    Switch HistFactory message stream to DEBUG level.

                                                                                                                                                                                              hist2workspace(1)
