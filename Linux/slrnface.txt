NAME
       slrnface - show X-Faces in X11 terminal emulator

SYNOPSIS
       slrnface  [ -xOffsetChar x_char_offset ] [ -yOffsetChar y_char_offset ] [ -xOffsetPix x_pixel_offset ] [ -yOffsetPix y_pixel_offset ] [ -XFacePad left_padding ] [ -ink fg_color ] [ -paper bg_color
       ] [ -padColor pad_color ]

DESCRIPTION
       The slrnface helper utility can be used from slrn(1), mutt(1) or similar programs to show X-Faces in Usenet articles or mail messages when those programs are run in an X11 terminal emulator.  This
       utility is not intended to be run directly from the command line.  Instead, the master programs should be configured to invoke slrnface when appropriate.

       Different  terminal  emulators  have  different  screen layouts. Some might have scroolbars (on either side), a menubar or something else. Terminal window which slrnface uses might contain some of
       these "decorations," but it is impossible to determine if that is the case at run time. Therefore it is impossible to determine the exact location at which the X11 window  with  the  X-Face  image
       should  be  placed. Default hardcoded values are appropriate for several terminal emulators, but not for all of them. The placement can be controlled by command line arguments, but it is suggested
       to use X resources for this task.

       While slrnface is running and showing X-Face, the left mouse button can be used to move the window.

RESOURCES
       The slrnface helper is controlled by the resources set for the terminal emulator in which it runs, not for the slrnface class or instance. That is because correct execution entirely depends on the
       master program and the geometry of the terminal emulator in use and has little to do with slrnface itself. All resources have a command line parameter equivalent.

       However, a lot of popular terminal emulators have a certain amount of hardcoded brain damage and setting X resources will not have any effect with them. This usually  happens  because  of  illegal
       characters in the WM_CLASS property. In those cases command line arguments are the only remaining option.

   xOffsetChar
       The horizontal offset for the X-Face window from the terminal's upper right corner expressed in character units.

   yOffsetChar
       The  vertical  offset  for  the  X-Face  window from the terminal's upper right corner expressed in character units.  The exact value in pixels will be calculated at run time, as well as the pixel
       equivalent for xOffestChar.  There are some lousily coded terminals which are not very helpful with this, so the calculation might not be perfect.

   xOffsetPix
       The horizontal offset for the X-Face window from the terminal's upper right corner expressed in pixels.

   yOffsetPix
       The vertical offset for the X-Face window from the terminal's upper right corner expressed in pixels. This value is added to the character offset provided by the yOffsetChar resource and  the  re‐
       sulting  sum  is substracted from the vertical coordinate of the terminal's upper right corner. The equivalent calculation for the horizontal coordinate is done with the xOffsetChar and xOffsetPix
       resources. In both cases, pixel value resources are provided for finer control.

   XFacePad
       This value tells slrnface how many pixels should be cleared on the left side of the X-Face image. In the case of long subject lines the image may be displayed over characters and having some spac‐
       ing between them would be beneficial.

   ink
       This is the foreground color for the X-Face image. The more common name for this resource is foreground.  However, that name is not used because there is a high probability that it would be inher‐
       ited from the terminal's resources. A lot of users use light foreground and dark background for terminals. Since X-Faces should normally be viewed with dark foreground on light background,  inher‐
       iting the colors from the terminal setup would present a negative image by default. In order to avoid that, slrnface uses different resource name.

   paper
       This is the background color for the X-Face image.

   padColor
       This is the color for the padding region set with XFacePad resource.

EXAMPLES
       The following example demonstrates how to set resources for xterm.

   Example 1: horizontal offsets for xterm
       Since slrnface looks at the resources defined for the terminal's class and name, an example setting is:

       xterm.slrnface.xOffsetChar:     1
       xterm.slrnface.xOffsetPix:      2

       It  is  better to use the application name, rather than class, because some other terminals use XTerm as their class, since they try to be feature compatible. However, they might not have the same
       screen layout, so resources set for the terminal class might not yield the desired effect in all terminals.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DISPLAY        The name of the display where the terminal runs. This environment variable is the only way to pass it to slrnface.

       WINDOWID       Used for determining terminal's X window id. It must be set by a terminal emulator.

       LANG, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES
                      These environment variables will be used when determining the location of the appropriate resource file.

EXIT STATUS
       The slrnface helper doesn't print any diagnostic, because it doesn't know if that is the appropriate action. In cases when diagnostic output is appropriate, it  can't  guarantee  that  the  output
       would be visible to the user. Therefore it returns distinct error status for every kind of problem and relies on the parent process to take the appropriate action.

       It should be noted that slrnface forks early in its execution. The parent process exits immediately, returning success status to its parent. The child process continues execution, reading commands
       from  the FIFO in the $HOME/.slrnfaces directory and executing them as appropriate. In the case where there is a problem with the process' startup, the fork doesn't happen and slrnface exits imme‐
       diately, returning the appropriate error status. The following exit values are returned:

       0   Successful completion.

       1   slrnface couldn't connect to the display.

       2   Terminal emulator didn't set the WINDOWID environment variable or its value was invalid.

       3   slrnface couldn't find its controlling terminal.

       4   Terminal's width or height are not set.

       5   There was a problem with the FIFO setup.

       6   fork(2) failed.
