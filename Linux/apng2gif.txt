NAME
       apng2gif -  convert APNG animated images to GIF files

SYNOPSIS
         apng2gif <INPUT *.png> <OUTPUT *.gif> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Progrmam apng2gif converts APNG into animated GIF format.

       The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) file format is an extension to the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification. It allows for animated PNG files that work similarly to animated GIF
       files, while retaining backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files and adding support for 8-bit transparency and 24-bit images.

       Default run values are /t 128, no background color. A short syntax help is provided without any command line arguments.

OPTIONS
       /b COLOR
           Background blend color. Format: #RGB in hex, like #808080, or three values in decimal. Like: 128 128 128. If this option is used, option /t is ignored

           With option:

            /b #ff0000   or
            /b 255 0 0

           will set the background color as red, so partially transparent pixels will be composed over red.

       /t LEVEL
           Transparency threshold level between 0..155. Default is 128. pixels with alpha level less than 128 will become fully transparent.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.

STANDARDS
       None.
