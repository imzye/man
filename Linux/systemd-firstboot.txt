NAME
       systemd-firstboot, systemd-firstboot.service - Initialize basic system settings on or before the first boot-up of a system

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-firstboot [OPTIONS...]

       systemd-firstboot.service

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-firstboot initializes the most basic system settings interactively on the first boot, or optionally non-interactively when a system image is created. The service is started if
       ConditionFirstBoot=yes is satisfied. This essentially means that /etc/ is empty, see systemd.unit(5) for details.

       The following settings may be set up:

       •   The system locale, more specifically the two locale variables LANG= and LC_MESSAGES

       •   The system keyboard map

       •   The system time zone

       •   The system hostname

       •   The machine ID of the system

       •   The root user's password

       Each of the fields may either be queried interactively by users, set non-interactively on the tool's command line, or be copied from a host system that is used to set up the system image.

       If a setting is already initialized, it will not be overwritten and the user will not be prompted for the setting.

       Note that this tool operates directly on the file system and does not involve any running system services, unlike localectl(1), timedatectl(1) or hostnamectl(1). This allows systemd-firstboot to
       operate on mounted but not booted disk images and in early boot. It is not recommended to use systemd-firstboot on the running system while it is up.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --root=root
           Takes a directory path as an argument. All paths will be prefixed with the given alternate root path, including config search paths. This is useful to operate on a system image mounted to the
           specified directory instead of the host system itself.

       --image=path
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If specified all operations are applied to file system in the indicated disk image. This is similar to --root= but operates on file systems
           stored in disk images or block devices. The disk image should either contain just a file system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table, following the Discoverable Partitions
           Specification[1]. For further information on supported disk images, see systemd-nspawn(1)'s switch of the same name.

       --locale=LOCALE, --locale-messages=LOCALE
           Sets the system locale, more specifically the LANG= and LC_MESSAGES settings. The argument should be a valid locale identifier, such as "de_DE.UTF-8". This controls the locale.conf(5)
           configuration file.

       --keymap=KEYMAP
           Sets the system keyboard layout. The argument should be a valid keyboard map, such as "de-latin1". This controls the "KEYMAP" entry in the vconsole.conf(5) configuration file.

       --timezone=TIMEZONE
           Sets the system time zone. The argument should be a valid time zone identifier, such as "Europe/Berlin". This controls the localtime(5) symlink.

       --hostname=HOSTNAME
           Sets the system hostname. The argument should be a hostname, compatible with DNS. This controls the hostname(5) configuration file.

       --machine-id=ID
           Sets the system's machine ID. This controls the machine-id(5) file.

       --root-password=PASSWORD, --root-password-file=PATH, --root-password-hashed=HASHED_PASSWORD
           Sets the password of the system's root user. This creates/modifies the passwd(5) and shadow(5) files. This setting exists in three forms: --root-password= accepts the password to set directly on
           the command line, --root-password-file= reads it from a file and --root-password-hashed= accepts an already hashed password on the command line. See shadow(5) for more information on the format of
           the hashed password. Note that it is not recommended to specify plaintext passwords on the command line, as other users might be able to see them simply by invoking ps(1).

       --root-shell=SHELL
           Sets the shell of the system's root user. This creates/modifies the passwd(5) file.

       --kernel-command-line=CMDLINE
           Sets the system's kernel command line. This controls the /etc/kernel/cmdline file which is used by kernel-install(8).

       --prompt-locale, --prompt-keymap, --prompt-timezone, --prompt-hostname, --prompt-root-password, --prompt-root-shell
           Prompt the user interactively for a specific basic setting. Note that any explicit configuration settings specified on the command line take precedence, and the user is not prompted for it.

       --prompt
           Query the user for locale, keymap, timezone, hostname, root's password, and root's shell. This is equivalent to specifying --prompt-locale, --prompt-keymap, --prompt-timezone, --prompt-hostname,
           --prompt-root-password, --prompt-root-shell in combination.

       --copy-locale, --copy-keymap, --copy-timezone, --copy-root-password, --copy-root-shell
           Copy a specific basic setting from the host. This only works in combination with --root= (see above).

       --copy
           Copy locale, keymap, time zone, root password and shell from the host. This is equivalent to specifying --copy-locale, --copy-keymap, --copy-timezone, --copy-root-password, --copy-root-shell in
           combination.

       --setup-machine-id
           Initialize the system's machine ID to a random ID. This only works in combination with --root=.

       --force
           systemd-firstboot doesn't modify existing files unless --force is specified. For modifications to /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, systemd-firstboot only modifies the entry of the "root" user instead
           of overwriting the entire file.

       --delete-root-password
           Removes the password of the system's root user, enabling login as root without a password unless the root account is locked. Note that this is extremely insecure and hence this option should not
           be used lightly.

       --welcome=
           Takes a boolean argument. By default when prompting the user for configuration options a brief welcome text is shown before the first question is asked. Pass false to this option to turn off the
           welcome text.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

CREDENTIALS
       systemd-firstboot supports the service credentials logic as implemented by LoadCredential=/SetCredential= (see systemd.exec(1) for details). The following credentials are used when passed in:

       "passwd.hashed-password.root", "passwd.plaintext-password.root"
           A hashed or plaintext version of the root password to use, in place of prompting the user. These credentials are equivalent to the same ones defined for the systemd-sysusers.service(8) service.

       "passwd.shell.root"
           Specifies the shell binary to use for the specified account. Equivalent to the credential of the same name defined for the systemd-sysusers.service(8) service.

       "firstboot.locale", "firstboot.locale-messages"
           These credentials specify the locale settings to set during first boot, in place of prompting the user.

       "firstboot.keymap"
           This credential specifies the keyboard setting to set during first boot, in place of prompting the user.

       "firstboot.timezone"
           This credential specifies the system timezone setting to set during first boot, in place of prompting the user.

       Note that by default the systemd-firstboot.service unit file is set up to inherit the listed credentials from the service manager. Thus, when invoking a container with an unpopulated /etc/ for the
       first time it is possible to configure the root user's password to be "systemd" like this:

           # systemd-nspawn --image=... --set-credential=firstboot.locale:de_DE.UTF-8 ...

       Note that these credentials are only read and applied during the first boot process. Once they are applied they remain applied for subsequent boots, and the credentials are not considered anymore.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
       systemd.firstboot=
           Takes a boolean argument, defaults to on. If off, systemd-firstboot.service won't interactively query the user for basic settings at first boot, even if those settings are not initialized yet.
