DESCRIPTION
       Crawl  is  a  fun  game in the grand tradition of similar games like Rogue, Hack and Moria. The objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave complex and retrieve the Orb of Zot, guarded by
       many horrible and hideous creatures.

       If you have never played Crawl (or a similar game) before, select the tutorial from the starting menu. The tutorial explains the interface in five easy lessons. Once you're familiar with the  con‐

       This is the Stone Soup version of Dungeon Crawl.
