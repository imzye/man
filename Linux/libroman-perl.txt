NAME
       Roman - functions for converting between Roman and Arabic numerals

VERSION
       Version 1.24

SYNOPSIS
               use Roman;

               $arabic = arabic($roman) if isroman($roman);
               $roman = Roman($arabic);
               $roman = roman($arabic);

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides some functions which help conversion of numeric notation between Roman and Arabic.

       Tests if argument is valid roman number

   Roman

BUGS
       Domain of valid Roman numerals is limited to less than 4000, since proper Roman digits for the rest are not available in ASCII.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-roman /AT/ rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Roman>.  I will be notified, and then
       you'll automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.
