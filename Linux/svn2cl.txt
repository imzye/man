NAME
       svn2cl - Create a ChangeLog from a subversion log.

SYNOPSIS
       svn2cl [OPTION]...  [PATH]...

DESCRIPTION
       svn2cl generates a classic GNU-style ChangeLog from the log messages in a subversion repository.  It acts as a wrapper around the 'svn log' command, parsing the XML output with an XSLT stylesheet.
       Alternatively it can generate HTML output intended for use with the svn2html.css style sheet that comes with svn2cl.

       In  addition to its own options, it accepts and passes along most svn log options; see 'svn help log' for a list of those and their documentation.  If PATH is not given, svn2cl will run svn log on
       the current directory, so it should do the right thing when run from the top of a subversion checkout of the project.

       --strip-prefix=NAME
              Strip NAME from the first part of all file names (e.g. project/trunk).  By defaults the current path inside the repository is stripped.

       --linelen=NUM
              Wrap lines at NUM characters.  By default, lines are wrapped at 75 characters.  This option is ignored when the --html option is specified.

       --group-by-day
              This option causes all commit messages to be grouped by day, as long as all the changes are by the same author.  By default each message is listed separately with its own timestamp.

       --separate-daylogs
              Include a blank line between log entries when they are grouped by day.  Only useful with the --group-by-day option.  This option is  ignored  when  the  --html  option  is  specified,  edit
              svn2html.css to tune the layout.

       -i, --include-rev
              Include the subversion revision number in the ChangeLog.  If the --html option is specified this is implied, edit svn2html.css to turn it off.

       -a, --include-actions
              Add action labels [ADD], [DEL] and [CPY] tags to files to show the operation that is performned on the files.

       --break-before-msg[=NUM]
              Add a line break (or multiple line breadks) between the paths and the log message.  If the --html option is specified this option is ignored, edit svn2html.css to set spacing.

       --reparagraph
              Newlines inside paragraphs are ignored and paragraphs are re-wrapped.  Paragraphs are separated by empty lines.

       --title=NAME
              If outputting an HTML file the NAME is used as the title.  This option is ignored for normal text output.

       --revision-link=NAME
              This  option  is  used to generate links from the revision numbers in the generated HTML file.  If NAME contains two hashes '##' that part will be replaced by the revision number, otherwise
              the revision number will be appended to NAME.  Only the first occurrence of '##' will be replaced.
              This option is ignored for normal text output.

       --ticket-link=NAME
              This option is used to generate links from references to tickets within the commit message in the generated HTML file.  Anything that looks like a ticket reference  (e.g.  '#foo')  will  be
              replaced with a link to NAME with the ticket part ('foo' in the example) appended.
              This option is ignored for normal text output.

       --ticket-prefix=NAME
              This option is used for finding ticket markers in the commit message (when the --ticket-link option is used).  The default value is '#'.
              This option is ignored for normal text output.

       --ignore-message-starting=STRING
              Any log messages that start with the specified STRING are ignored and will not show up in the output.  The STRING comparison is case sensitive.

       -o, -f, --output=FILE, --file=FILE
              Output ChangeLog to FILE instead of the default ChangeLog (or ChangeLog.html for HTML output).

       --stdout
              Output ChangeLog to stdout instead of to a file.

       --authors=FILE
              The FILE is used to map author names as exported by svn to full names.  See the section on AUTHORS FILES below for more information.
              Note that the --authors option can have poor performance in some cases.

       --html Generate an HTML file containing a ChangeLog instead of the default text ChangeLog file.  This feature is still experimental.  The svn2html.css file that is included in the distribution can
              be used to format the HTML.

       -h, --help
              Show short summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Show version of program.

       Optional  PATH  arguments  and  the  following  options  are  passed  directly  to  the 'svn --xml log' command: -r, --revision, --targets, --stop-on-copy, --username, --password, --no-auth-cache,
       --non-interactive, --config-dir and --limit.
       See 'svn help log' for more information on these options.

AUTHORS FILES
       An authors file is basically an XML file that should look something like:
           <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
           <authors>
             <author uid="arthur">
               Arthur de Jong &lt;arthur@arthurdejong.org&gt;
             </author>
           </authors>
       svn2cl searches for <author> tags with the specified uid attribute.  The content from the author tag is substituted for the author name.

       The <author> tag may also contain XML child tags which can be useful for embedding HTML into the result.  For this to work namespace information should be included for HTML output:
           <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
           <authors xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
             <author uid="arthur">
               Arthur de Jong &lt;<html:b>arthur@arthurdejong.org</html:b>&gt;
             </author>
           </authors>
       The svn2cl distribution contains a sample authors.xml file.

       As a bonus a plain text authors file that looks like the following is automatically converted to the XML representation:
           arthur:Arthur de Jong <arthur@arthurdejong.org>

NOTES
       Note that the default revison range for svn log is BASE:1.  This means that svn2cl will not always include the most recent revisons of the repository. Either run 'svn update' before running svn2cl
       or pass '-r HEAD:1'.

EXAMPLES
       Run svn log recursively on the current directory and generate a text ChangeLog file in the current directory for the entire log history:
           svn2cl

       Output the changes from the last week, while including revision numbers in the ChangeLog:
           svn2cl -i -r "HEAD:{`date -d '7 days ago' '+%F %T'`}"
       (actually subversion will include the first revision before the specified period)

       Generate an HTML changelog for svn://svn.example.com/project/trunk, removing "project/trunk" from the file names in the changelog.  Group all commits per day into  one  ChangeLog  entry  and  only
       include changes from 2005:
           svn2cl --html --strip-prefix=project/trunk --group-by-day \
                  -r '{2006-01-01}:{2005-01-01}' \
                  svn://svn.example.com/project/trunk
