   Installation
       The latest stable version of OpenShot Video Editor for Linux, Mac, Chrome OS, and Windows can be downloaded from the official download page at https://www.openshot.org/download/. You can find  our
       latest  unstable  versions  (i.e.  daily builds) at https://www.openshot.org/download#daily (these versions are updated very frequently, and often contain many improvements not yet released in our
       stable build).

   Windows (Installer)
       Download the Windows installer from the official download page (the download page contains both 64-bit and 32-bit versions), double click it, and follow the directions on screen.  Once  completed,
       OpenShot will be installed and available in your Start menu.  [image] [image]

   Windows (Portable)
       If  you need to install OpenShot on Windows without Administrator permissions, we also support a portable installation process. Download the Windows installer from the official download page, open
       the command prompt, and type the following commands:

       Install portable version of OpenShot (no administrator permissions required)

          cd C:\Users\USER\Downloads\
          OpenShot-v2.6.1-x86_64.exe /portable=1 /currentuser /noicons
       [image]

   Mac
       Download the DMG file from the official download page, double click it, and then drag the OpenShot application icon into your Applications shortcut. This is very similar to how most  Mac  applica‐
       tions are installed. Now launch OpenShot from Launchpad or Applications in Finder.  [image]

   Linux (AppImage)
       Most  Linux distributions have a version of OpenShot in their software repositories, which can be installed using your package manager / software store.  However, these packaged versions are often
       very outdated (be sure to check the version number: Help→About OpenShot). For this reason, we recommend installing an AppImage from the official download page.

       Once downloaded, right click on the AppImage, choose Properties, and mark the file as Executable.  Finally, double click the AppImage to launch OpenShot. If double clicking does not  launch  Open‐
       Shot,  you  can  also  right  click on the AppImage, and choose Execute or Run. For a detailed guide on installing our AppImage and creating a launcher for it, see our AppImage Installation Guide.
       [image]

   Linux (PPA)
       For Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Mint, etc…), we also have a PPA (Personal Package Archive), which adds our official OpenShot software repository to your package  manager,  making  it
       possible to install our latest version, without relying on our AppImages.

       Stable PPA (Contains only official releases)

          sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openshot.developers/ppa
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install openshot-qt python3-openshot

       Daily PPA (Highly experimental and unstable, for testers)

          sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openshot.developers/libopenshot-daily
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install openshot-qt python3-openshot

   Chrome OS (Chromebook)
       Chrome OS supports Linux apps, but this feature is off by default. You can turn it on in Settings.  Once Linux is enabled, you can install and run OpenShot Linux AppImages on any x86-based Chrome‐
       book. The command below will download our AppImage and configure your system to run OpenShot successfully.

       • Navigate to chrome://os-settings/crostini (Copy/Paste)

       • Under “Linux (Beta)” select “Turn On”. Default values are fine.

       •

         When the Terminal appears (i.e. black window), Copy/Paste the following command:

                • bash <(wget -O - http://openshot.org/files/chromeos/install-stable.sh)

   Video Tutorials
       If you prefer to learn by watching videos instead of reading, we have many official video tutorials that cover a wide range of beginner and introductory topics. These videos are a great next  step
       on your way to master OpenShot Video Editor!

       • Video: Getting Started

       • Video: The Basics (Part 1)

       • Video: The Basics (Part 2)

       • Video: Basic Animation

       • Video: Trim, Slice, and Split

       • Video: Chroma Key

       • Video: Masks & Transitions

       • Video: Backup & Recovery

   Step 1 – Import Photos & Music
       Before we can begin making a video, we need to import media files into OpenShot. Most video, image and music file formats will work. Drag and drop a few videos or images and a music file from your
       Desktop to OpenShot. Be sure to drop the files where the arrow in the illustration is pointing to.  [image]

       Alternative methods to add files to your projects are described in the section Import Files. The “Show All”, “Video”, “Audio”, “Image” filters above the added files allows you to only see the file
       types you are interested in.

   Step 2 – Add Photos to Timeline
       Next,  drag  each video or photo onto a track in the timeline (as seen in the illustration).  The timeline represents your final video, so arrange your photos (i.e. clips) in whatever sequence you
       want them to appear in your video. If you overlap two clips, OpenShot will automatically create a smooth fade between them, displayed by blue rounded rectangles between the  clips.  Remember,  you
       can rearrange the clips as many times as needed by simply dragging and dropping them.

       You can also shorten or lengthen each clip, by clicking the left or right edge and dragging your mouse. For example, if you want a photo to last longer than 10 seconds (the default duration), sim‐
       ply grab the right edge of the photo (on the timeline), and drag it to the right (to increase the clip’s duration on the timeline).  [image]

   Step 3 – Add Music to Timeline
       To  make  our creation more interesting, we need to add some music. Click on the music file that you imported in step 1, and drag it onto the timeline. If the song is too long, grab the right edge
       of your music clip, and resize it smaller (that will make it end earlier). You could also insert the same file multiple times, if your music is too short.  [image]

   Step 4 – Preview your Project
       To preview what our video looks & sounds like, click the Play button under the preview window.  You can also pause, rewind, and fast-forward your video project by clicking the  corresponding  but‐
       tons.  [image]

   Step 5 – Export your Video
       Once  you  have edited your photo slide-show video, the last step is to export the project. Exporting converts your OpenShot project into a single video output file. By using the default settings,
       the video works on most media players (such as VLC) or websites (such as YouTube, Vimeo, …).

       Click on the Export Video icon at the top of the screen (or use the File→Export Video menu).  The default values will work fine, so just click the Export Video button to  render  your  new  video.

   Video Editing Basics
       You do not need to be a trained videographer to understand how to create videos well. Simple editing can keep your viewers engaged longer, and add a professional feel, even if you are not  a  pro‐
       fessional video editor.

       Basically,  video editing is taking footage, cutting it up, removing the pieces you do not want, and keeping the bits you do. Back in the old days, editing was slicing reels of film and piecing it
       together. Thankfully software makes the whole process much more manageable.

       There are three main jobs of video editing:

       1. Remove mistakes or unwanted sections

       2. Keep the video moving at an engaging pace

       3. Insert supporting footage, audio, or titles

       Use these three points as a checklist as you edit.

   Computer
       Video editing does not require an expensive machine, especially if you are a beginner. It would be best if you had a decent monitor and graphics card. If you have an  older  computer,  check  your
       system specifications against OpenShot’s System Requirements to make sure it works for video editing.  Unfortunately, many older computers are not fast enough for video editing, and you should up‐
       grade your whole system, if possible.

   Accessories
       Before  beginning  a  video  project, ensure there is enough storage space on your computer to save all the necessary clips. For example, one hour of 1080i video, such as from a mini-DV camcorder,
       takes up nearly 11 GB of storage. If your computer’s internal storage device cannot store all the clips, the solution is to buy an external drive.

       It would help if you had several cables, usually Firewire or USB, to connect your computer, external hard drive, and a camera. Different computers and cameras accept  other  connectors,  so  check
       your manuals before buying anything.

   Practical Tips
       Becoming  a  great  video editor isn’t effortless, but with practice and patience, you’ll be editing like a professional in no time. Here are a few of the essential tips and techniques you need to
       know to become a skilled video editor.

       1.

           Pick the Right Computer
                  While having a great computer won’t necessarily make you a great video editor, a faster computer will allow you to focus more of your time on the story you’re trying to tell rather than
                  your computer rendering. Everyone has their own opinions about what computer is best for editing, but it all depends on your own preferences.

       2.

           Keep Shooting
                  Record more video that you think you will need for your project. Include video that enhances the scene, sets a mood, or tells a story. You can use the extra video for smooth transitions
                  in your project. If you are comfortable using multiple devices, use two devices simultaneously the insert video from either device into your project.

       3.

           Organize Your Project Files
                  Composition is the key to success, whether you are running Linux, on a Mac, or a Windows machine. Be sure to label video files, audio files, and even still images clearly and  keep  all
                  your  clips  on  the same device and in the same folder for easy access. OpenShot tries to keep up with your clips, but if you move them after your project is saved, you could lose your
                  entire project. Organizing before you begin editing can be very advantageous.

       4.

           Watch Everything
                  Watching everything is the first step in the editing process. Writer and filmmaker David Andrew Stoler says there is gold in the most unlikely of places: “Some of the most beautiful ex‐
                  pressions you’re going to get from the actors are after the cut.”

       5.

           Edit for a Story
                  Remember that as you edit, you are telling a story. Editing is so much more than merely cutting footage and adding effects. It is an opportunity to take  your  audience  on  a  journey.
                  Whether you are editing a complex narrative film or only putting together a personal video, you tell a more in-depth story.

       6.

           Keyboard Shortcuts
                  One  of  the  easiest  ways  to tell the difference between and professional video editor and a novice is to simply look at how much they use the keyboard. Editors that have been in the
                  business for some time know that a few seconds saved add up over the length of the project.

       7.

           Learn the Lingo
                  Video editing is not just a hobby or a profession; it is an industry. And just like any industry, there is a ton of jargon to learn. Practically speaking, you do not need  to  know  all
                  the terms on the Glossary to become a better video editor, but a fundamental knowledge of the terms may help you communicate better with other video editors or clients.

       8.

           Assemble, Then Make a Rough Cut
                  Drag  and  drop  all your video footage into a timeline and make sure your frame size and frame rates are consistent. Begin a new timeline and drag-and-drop the best clips into what be‐
                  comes your assembly cut. Remember to save your work frequently, and notate the date and time of each version.

       9.

           Refine Your Video
                  In this phase, your rough cut begins to resemble a cohesive project.  Adjust the sound and color, make sure the dialog is audible, and add music, titles,  or  graphics  in  this  phase.
                  Color  correction is the process of setting your footage to a color baseline. No matter how great your subject looks on set, you will almost always need to do some basic post-processing
                  for a consistent video.

       10.

           Refine Some More
                  A slow scene can set the mood and add tension or it can bore an audience.  A fast scene can add adrenaline to your audience’s systems or it can give them  headaches.  Some  editors  cut
                  their projects several different ways before they find the right pace. Do not let cutting your project several times discourage you.

   Exporting
       People  view  most  of  their  projects on phones, tablets, or computers, so it is essential to know how to export for the web. The goal when exporting a video for the web is to create the highest
       quality possible with the smallest file size. Four main factors determine the file size of your finished video:

       •

         Codec: A codec determines the type of file format (MP4, AVI, MOV). The more compression performed by the codec, the smaller your video’s size. Videos that are smaller in file  size  tend  to  be
                lower in visual quality.

       •

         Resolution:
                Resolution  refers  to the number of horizontal and vertical pixels (dots on display) your video contains. For example, a 4K UHD (2160P) video has four times the resolution of FHD (1080P)
                video. A higher resolution means more information to store so that you will have larger file sizes.

       •

         Bit Rate:
                The Bit Rate is the measure of the speed of data processing of your video.  A higher bit rate means higher-quality video and larger files. OpenShot allows you to manually set the Bit Rate
                / Quality in the Advanced tab of the Export Video window.

       •

         Frame Rate:
                The frequency (in Hz) at which consecutive images, called frames, appear on the display is the Frame Rate. Typically, you export your video in the film standard (24fps) or the  TV  broad‐
                cast standard of 30fps (or 25fps in PAL).  While there is not much wiggle room here, you should note that if you decide to export your video in 48fps, 50fps, or 60fps, your file size dou‐

       For step-by-step instructions on the basic usage of OpenShot, be sure to read the Quick Tutorial.

   Built-in Tutorial
       When you first launch OpenShot, you will be presented with a friendly built-in tutorial. It will demonstrate and explain the basics. Clicking Next will jump to the next topic. You can always  view
       this tutorial again from the Help→Tutorial menu.  [image]

   Tracks & Layers
       OpenShot uses tracks to layer videos and images. The top most track is the top layer, and the bottom track is the bottom layer. If you are familiar with layers in a photo editing application, then
       you  should  be  quite  familiar with this concept. OpenShot will stack the layers and mix each one together, just like a photo editing application. You can have an unlimited number of tracks, but
       typically a simple video project will not need more than 5 tracks.

       For example, imagine a 3 track video project [image]

   Keyboard Shortcuts
       Here is a list of the default keyboard shortcuts supported by OpenShot. You can configure these shortcuts in the Preferences window, which is opened by selecting Edit→Preferences from the OpenShot
       menu bar.  (On macOS, choose OpenShot Video Editor→Preferences.)  Learning a few of these shortcuts can save you a bunch of time!

   Files
       To create a video, we need to make media files available to our project by importing files into OpenShot. Most media file types are recognized, such as videos, images, and audio files.  Files  can
       be viewed and managed in the Project Files panel.

       Note that imported files are not copied anywhere, they remain in the physical location they were before and are simply being made available to your video project. So, they must not be deleted, re‐
       named, or moved after adding them to your project. The “Show All”, “Video”, “Audio”, “Image” filters above the files allows you to only see the file types you are interested in.  You can also tog‐
       gle the view between details and thumbnails view of your files.

       These are all possible methods to import media files into OpenShot: [image]

   Split Clip
       If  you  need  to cut a file into many smaller clips before editing, the Split Clip dialog is built exactly for this purpose. Right click on a file, and choose Split Clip… from the file menu. This
       opens the Split Clip dialog. Use this dialog to quickly cut out as many small clips as you need. The dialog stays open after you create a clip, to allow you to repeat the steps for your next clip.
       When you are finished, simply close the dialog.  [image]

       Please refer to the section Trimming & Slicing for more ways to cut and slice clips directly in the timeline.

   Export Clips
       If you want your clips available outside of your OpenShot project, or want to copy all your video assets to one place, you can do this with the Export Clips dialog. Simply Ctrl+Click to select any
       clips or files you like, then Right Click and choose Export Clips. In the dialog that appears, choose a destination folder, and click Export.

       NOTE: This will export each clip using it’s original video profile (width, height, framerate, aspect ratio, etc…). It also supports any Split Clip (described above). For example, if you have split
       a long video file into many different clips (and named them), you can now export all the clips as separate video files (using the original clip’s video profile).  [image]

   Add to Timeline
       In certain cases, you might need to add many files to the timeline at the same time. For example, a photo slide show, or a large number of short video clips. The Add to Timeline dialog  can  auto‐
       mate this task for you. First, select all files you need to add, right click, and choose Add to Timeline.  [image]

   Properties
       To  view  the  properties  of any imported file in your video project, right click on the file, and choose File Properties.  This will launch the file properties dialog, which displays information
       about your media file. For certain types of images (i.e. image sequences), you can adjust the frame rate on this dialog also.  [image]

   Remove from Project
       This will remove a file from the project. It will not delete the underlying physical file though, so removing a file from the project merely makes it unavailable for this video project.

   Clips
       Each media file you add to the OpenShot timeline is called a clip and is visualized by a dark, rounded rectangle (as seen in the screenshot below). A clip has many properties, which affect how and
       when the clip is rendered and composited, such as position, layer, scale, location, rotation, and alpha. OpenShot can animate these properties over time, and when combined, can create some amazing
       effects.

       To display a clip’s properties, either right-click and choose Properties or double click on the clip. Clip properties appear in the properties dock, in alphabetical order. These properties can  be
       filtered by typing a few letters in the filter box, at the top of the property panel.

       To adjust a property, you can:

       • click on its value and drag the slider from side to side for a coarse adjustment

       • double click on its value and enter a value. Numerical values display to 2 decimal places, but you can enter more precise numbers. You can often enter valid values that are outside the range of‐
         fered by the slider adjustment.

       • right-click or double-click to select an option (for non-numerical values)

       Clip properties are part of the Animation system. If you change a clip property, you create a keyframe at the current position of the playhead. If you want a property to apply throughout the clip,
       you must place the playhead at (or before) the start of the clip before making the change. An easy way to locate the start of a clip is to use ‘next/previous marker’ on the Timeline toolbar.  [im‐

   Trimming & Slicing
       OpenShot  has  many easy ways to adjust the start and end trim positions of a clip (otherwise known as trimming). The most common method is simply clicking and dragging the left (or right) edge of
       the clip.  Here is a list of all methods for cutting or trimming clips in OpenShot:

       Keep in mind that the above cutting methods also have Keyboard Shortcuts, to save even more time.

   Preset Menu
       OpenShot has tons of great preset animations and clip properties, such as fading, sliding, zooming, etc… These presets can be accessed by right clicking on a clip.  [image]

   Transform
       To quickly adjust the location, scale, rotation, and shear of a clip, select a clip on the timeline. By default, the selected clip appears in the preview window with transform controls (blue lines
       and squares). Or if disabled, right click on a clip and choose Transform. Dragging the blue squares will adjust scale, and dragging the center will move the image. Dragging the mouse on  the  out‐
       side of the blue lines will rotate the image. Dragging along the blue lines will shear the image in that direction. Dragging the circle in the middle will move the origin point that controls where
       we  rotate  the  image.  Note: Pay close attention to the play-head position (red playback line).  Key frames are automatically created at the current playback position, to help create animations.

       For more info on key frames and animation, see Animation.

   Effects
       In addition to the many clip properties which can be animated and adjusted, you can also drop an effect directly onto a clip. Each effect is represented by a small letter icon. Clicking the effect
       icon will populate the properties of that effect, and allow you to edit (and animate) them. For the full list of effects, see Effects.  [image]

   Properties
       Below is a list of clip properties which can be edited, and in most cases, animated over time. To view a clip’s properties, right click and choose Properties.  The  property  editor  will  appear,
       where  you can change these properties. Note: Pay close attention to where the play-head (i.e. red playback line) is. Key frames are automatically created at the current playback position, to help
       create animations.

   Details
       Gravity:
          Gravity sets an initial position for the clip, once it has been scaled as above. The options are:

          • Top Left – the top and left edges of the clip align with the top and left edges of the screen

          • Top Center – the top edge of the clip aligns with the top edge of the screen; the clip is horizontally centered on the screen.

          • Top Right – the top and right edges of the clip align with the top and right edges of the screen

          • Left – the left edge of the clip aligns with the left edge of the screen; the clip is vertically centered on the screen.

          • Center (default) – the clip is centered horizontally and vertically on the screen.

          • Right – the right edge of the clip aligns with the right edge of the screen; the clip is vertically centered on the screen.

          • Bottom Left – the bottom and left edges of the clip align with the bottom and left edges of the screen

          • Bottom Center – the bottom edge of the clip aligns with the bottom edge of the screen; the clip is horizontally centered on the screen.

          • Bottom Right – the bottom and right edges of the clip align with the bottom and right edges of the screen

       Scale:
          This is the initial resizing method, which may be further adjusted by Scale X and Scale Y (below). The options are:

          • Best Fit (default) – the clip is as large as possible without changing the aspect ratio.

          • Crop – the aspect ratio of the clip is maintained while the clip is enlarged to fill the entire screen, even if that means some of it will be cropped.

          • None – the clip is its original size.

          • Stretch – the clip is stretched to fill the entire screen, changing the aspect ratio if necessary.

       Volume Mixing:
          Mixing audio involves adjusting volume levels so that they maintain a good range within each clip, and then adjusting them in proportion to other clips used in the project. The following values
          are available:

          • None - Make no adjustments to volume data before mixing audio

          • Average - Automatically divide the volume of each clip based on the # of overlapping clips. For example, 2 overlapping clips would each have 50% volume.

          • Reduce - Automatically reduce the clip’s volume by 20%, allowing it to mix with other clips, and reducing the likelihood of over-volume loud events.

          Consider the following guidelines when adjusting volume levels:

          • If you combine particularly loud audio clips on multiple tracks, clipping (a staccato distortion) may occur. To avoid clipping, reduce volume levels.

          • If  you need to adjust the volume separately in different parts of a clip (for example, one person’s voice is faint, while later another’s is too loud), you can use keyframes to vary the vol‐
            ume throughout the clip.

          • If the original level of a clip is much too high or low, you can change the input level. However, adjusting the level will not remove any distortion that may have resulted from recording  the
            clip too high. In those cases, it is best to re-record the clip.

   Transitions
       A  transition  is  used to gradually fade (or wipe) between two clips. In OpenShot, transitions are represented by blue, rounded rectangles on the timeline. They are automatically created when you
       overlap two clips, and can be added manually by dragging one onto the timeline from the Transitions panel. A transition must be placed on top of a clip (overlapping it), with the most common loca‐
       tion being the beginning or end.

   Direction
       Transitions adjust the alpha/transparency of the clip below it, and can either fade from opaque to transparent, or transparent to opaque. Right click and choose Reverse Transition  to  change  the
       direction of the fade. You can also manually adjust the Brightness curve, animating the fade in any way you wish.  [image]

   Cutting & Slicing
       OpenShot has many easy ways to adjust the start and end positions of a transition (otherwise known as cutting). The most common method is simply grabbing the left (or right) edge of the transition
       and dragging. Here is a list of methods for cutting transitions in OpenShot:

       Keep in mind that all of the above cutting methods also have Keyboard Shortcuts.

   Mask
       Like  Clips,  transitions  also  have properties which can be animated over time. The fade (or wipe) can be adjusted with the Brightness curve, or held at a constant value to create a transparency
       mask on top of a clip.

   Custom Transition
       Any greyscale image can be used as a transition (or mask), by adding it to your /.openshot_qt/transitions/ folder. Just be sure to name your file something that is easily recognizable, and restart
       OpenShot. Your custom transition/mask will now show up in the list of transitions.

   Properties
       Below is a list of transition properties which can be edited, and in most cases, animated over time. To view a transition’s properties, right click and choose Properties. The property editor  will
       appear,  where you can change these properties. NOTE: Pay close attention to where the play-head (i.e. red playback line) is. Key frames are automatically created at the current playback position,
       to help create animations.

   Effects
       Effects are used in OpenShot to enhance or modify the audio or video of a clip. They can modify pixels and audio data, and can generally enhance your video projects. Each effect has its own set of
       properties, most which can be animated over time.

       Effects can be added to any clip by dragging and dropping them. Each effect is represented by a small colored icon and the first letter of the effect name. To view an effect’s properties, click on
       the effect icon.  The property editor will appear, where you can edit these properties. Note: Pay close attention to where the play-head (i.e. red playback line) is. Key frames  are  automatically
       created at the current playback position, to help create animations.  [image]

   Video Effects
       Effects  are  generally divided into two categories: video and audio effects. Video effects modify the image and pixel data of a clip. Below is a list of video effects, and their properties. Often
       it is best to experiment with an effect, entering different values into the properties, and observing the results.

   Alpha Mask / Wipe Transition

   Color Shift
       Shift the colors of an image up, down, left, and right (with infinite wrapping).

       Each pixel has 4 color channels:

       • Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (i.e. transparency)

       • Each channel value is between 0 and 255

       The Color Shift effect simply “moves” or “translates” a specific color channel on the X or Y axis. Not all video and image formats support an alpha channel, and in those cases, you  will  not  see
       any changes when adjusting the color shift of the alpha channel.

   Export
       Exporting converts your OpenShot project (clips, effects, animations, titles) into a single video output file (using a process called video encoding). By using the default settings,  the  exported
       video will be compatible with most media players (such as VLC) and websites (such as YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook).

       Click on the Export Video icon at the top of the screen (or use the File→Export Video menu).  The default values will work fine, so just click the Export Video button to render your new video. You
       can also create your own custom export profiles, see Profiles.

   Simple Mode
       While  video encoding is very complicated, with dozens of interrelated settings and options, OpenShot makes it easy, with sensible defaults, and most of this complexity hidden away behind our Sim‐
       ple tab, which is the default export view.  [image]

   Advanced Mode
       Most users will never need to switch to the Advanced tab, but if you need to customize any of the video encoding settings, for example, custom bitrates, different codecs, or limiting the range  of
       frames exported, this is the tab for you.

   Animation
       OpenShot  has been designed specifically with animation in mind. The powerful curve-based animation framework can handle most jobs with ease, and is flexible enough to create just about any anima‐
       tion. Key frames specify values at certain points on a clip, and OpenShot does the hard work of interpolating the in-between values.

   Key Frames
       To create a key frame in OpenShot, simply position the play-head (i.e. playback position) at any point over a clip, and edit properties in the property dialog. If the property supports key frames,
       it  will turn green, and a small icon (circle=Bézier, diamond=linear, square=constant) will appear on the bottom of your clip at that position. Move your play-head to another point over that clip,
       and adjust the properties again. All animations require at least 2 key frames, but can support an unlimited number of them.

       To adjust the interpolation mode, right click on the small graph icon next to a property value.
       For more info on creating key frames for location, rotation, scale, shear, and location, see Transform.
       For more info on preset animations, see Preset Menu.
       For more info on clip properties, see Properties.

   Bézier Presets
       When using a Bézier curve for animation, OpenShot includes more than 20 curve presets (which affect the shape of the curve). For example, Ease-In has a more gradual slope at the beginning,  making
       an animation move slower at the beginning, and faster at the end. Ease-In/Out (Back) has a gradual beginning and ending, but actually goes past the expected value and then back (producing a bounce
       effect).

       To choose a curve preset, right click on the small graph icon next to a key frame.  [image]

   Image Sequences
       If you have a sequence of similarly named images (such as, cat001.png, cat002.png, cat003.png, etc…), you can simply drag and drop one of them into OpenShot, and you will be prompted to import the
       entire sequence.  [image]

       To  adjust  the frame rate of the animation, right click and choose File Properties in the Project Files panel, and adjust the frame rate. Once you have set the correct frame rate, drag the anima‐
       tion onto the timeline.  [image]

   Titles
       Adding text and titles is an important aspect of video editing, and OpenShot comes with an easy to use Title Editor. Use the Title menu (located in the main menu of OpenShot) to launch  the  Title
       Editor. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T.

   Overview
       [image]

   Custom Titles
       OpenShot  can use any vector SVG image file as a title template. Just add an SVG image file to your .openshot_qt/title_templates/ folder, and it will appear the next time you open the Title Editor
       interface. You can also right click on any SVG files in your Project Files panel, and choose Edit Title or Duplicate Title.

   3D Animated Titles
       Adding a 3D animated title is just as easy, using our Animated Title dialog. Use the Title menu (located in the main menu of OpenShot) to launch the Animated Title editor. You  can  also  use  the
       keyboard shortcut Ctrl+B.  [image]

   Installing Inkscape & Blender
       These  features  require  the latest version of Blender (https://www.blender.org/download/) and Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/release/) be installed, and the OpenShot Preferences updated with the
       correct paths to the Blender & Inkscape executable. See the General tab in Preferences.

       For a detailed guide on how to install these dependencies, see Blender & Inkscape Guide.

   Profiles
       A video profile is a collection of common video settings (size, frame rate, aspect ratio). Profiles are used during editing, previewing, and exporting to provide a quick way to switch between com‐
       mon combinations of these settings.

       If you often use the same profile, you can set a default profile: Edit→Preferences→Preview.

   Project Profile
       The project profile is used when previewing your project and editing. The default project profile is HD 720p 30fps.  It is best practice to always switch to your target profile  before  you  begin
       editing. For example, if you are targeting 1080p 30fps, switch to that profile before you begin editing your project. For a full list of included profiles see Profile List.  [image]

   Custom Profile
       Although OpenShot has more than 400 profiles (Profile List) included by default, you can also create your  own  custom  profiles.  Create  a  new  text  file  in  the  ~/.openshot_qt/profiles/  or
       C:\Users\USERNAME\.openshot_qt\profiles folder. Use the following text as your template (i.e. copy and paste this into the new file):

   Profile List
       OpenShot includes a large list of common profiles.

   Definitions
       • Profile Name: This is a short, friendly name for a video profile (FHD 1080p 30 fps, for example)

       • FPS: Frames Per Second

       • DAR: Display Aspect Ratio (i.e. 1920:1080 reduces to 16:9 aspect ratio)

       • SAR: Sample Aspect Ratio (i.e. 1:1 ratio == square pixel, 2:1 horizontal rectangular pixel). The SAR directly affects the display aspect ratio. For example, a 4:3 video can be displayed as 16:9,
         if it uses rectangular pixels. However, rectangular pixels will cause the final display width to be adjusted.

       • PAR: Pixel Aspect Ratio (identical to SAR - but some people prefer this term instead)

       • SAR Adjusted Width: This is the width of the final display image, taking SAR (i.e. non-square pixels) into account

       • Interlaced: Display alternating lines of the video image (odd lines, even lines), mostly used by analog broadcasting

       • NTSC: NTSC is an analog TV color system used mostly in America (usually 29.97 fps)

       • PAL: PAL is an analog TV color system used in Europe, Australia, and much of the rest of the world (usually 25 fps)

       • UHD: Ultra High Definition

       • QHD: Quad High Definition

       • FHD: Full High Definition

       • HD: High Definition (usually defined as any resolution at equal or greater than 1280x720 pixels)

       • SD: Standard Definition (usually defined as any resolution smaller than 1280x720 pixels)

   Import & Export
       Video  editing  projects  (including tracks, clips, and keyframes) can be imported and exported from OpenShot Video Editor in widely supported formats (EDL: Edit Decision Lists, and XML: Final Cut
       Pro format). For example, if you start editing a video in a different program (Adobe Premier, Final Cut Pro, etc…), but later need to move all your edits to OpenShot (or vice versa).

   EDL (Edit Decision Lists)
       The following features are supported when importing and exporting an EDL file with OpenShot.

       Example EDL format supported by OpenShot:

   XML (Final Cut Pro format)
       The following features are supported when importing and exporting an XML file with OpenShot. This XML format is supported in many video editors (not just Final Cut Pro). In fact,  most  commercial
       video editors have some support for importing and exporting this same XML format.

   Example XML Output (tree view)

   Preferences
       The  Preferences window contains many important settings and configuration options for OpenShot. They can be found in the top menu under Edit→Preferences. Many settings will require OpenShot to be
       restarted after your changes are applied.

       NOTE: Some features such as Animated Titles and external SVG editing require setting the paths for Blender and Inkscape under the General tab. And if you notice audio playback issues, such as  au‐
       dio drift, you many need to adjust the audio settings under the Preview tab.

   General
       [image]

       The General tab of the Preferences window allows you to modify the settings that apply to OpenShot as a whole.

   Preview
       [image]

       The  Preview  tab  of the Preferences window allows you to set a Default Video Profile for your project, if you have a preference for a specific editing profile. More about Profiles. Also, you can
       adjust the real-time preview audio settings, for example, which audio device and sample rate to use.

   Autosave
       [image]

       Autosave is a saving function in OpenShot which automatically saves the current changes to your project after a specific number of minutes, helping to reduce the risk or impact  of  data  loss  in
       case of a crash, freeze or user error.

   Recovery
       Before  each  save,  a  copy  of  the  current  project  is  created  in  a  recovery folder, to further reduce the risk of data loss. The recovery folder is located at ~/.openshot_qt/recovery/ or
       C:\Users\USERNAME\.openshot_qt\recovery. If you need to recover a corrupt or broken *.osp project file, please find the most recent copy in the recovery folder, and copy/paste  the  file  in  your
       original  project folder location (i.e. the folder that contains your broken project), and then open this recovered project file in OpenShot. Many versions of each project are stored in the recov‐
       ery folder, and if you still have issues with the recovered *.osp file, you can repeat this process with older versions contained in the recovery folder.

   Cache
       [image]

       Cache settings can be adjusted to make real-time playback faster or less CPU intensive. The cache is used to store image and audio data for each frame of video requested. The more frames that  are
       cached,  the smoother the real-time playback will be. However, the more that needs to be cached requires more CPU to generate the cache. There is a balance, and the default settings provide a gen‐
       erally sane set of cache values, which should allow most computers to playback video and audio smoothly.

   Debug
       [image]

       Here you can modify how much data should be logged. Normally, Debug Mode (verbose) is off.  The default port is 5556. If you want to help improve OpenShot you can enable Send Anonymous Metrics and
       Errors.

   Performance
       [image]

       Please  keep  in  mind  that hardware acceleration is experimental at the moment. OpenShot supports both decoding and encoding acceleration. For more information take a look at our Github HW-ACCEL
       Doc.  NOTE: On systems with older graphics cards, hardware acceleration may not always be faster than CPU encoding.

   Keyboard

       This is where hotkeys can be seen and re-assigned, as described under Keyboard Shortcuts.

   Location
       [image]

       Default file path locations for saving/opening projects, importing files, and exporting videos can be configured here. This can save you time by defaulting the open/save file dialogs to  the  most
       appropriate starting folder (options described below).

   Developers
       If  you are a programmer (or want to become a programmer), and are interested in developing new features, fixing bugs, or improving the user interface for OpenShot, the following sections will ex‐
       plain how to get started and get involved!

   The Big Picture
       OpenShot Video Editor has 3 main components, a Python & PyQt user interface (openshot-qt), a C++ audio library (libopenshot-audio) and a C++ video library (libopenshot). If you  are  not  familiar
       with Python, PyQt, or C++, those would be great topics to research and learn more about at this point.

       However, many bugs can be fixed and new features added with only Python knowledge, since the C++ components are not involved in the user interface at all. Python is an amazing language, and is su‐
       per fun to learn, and is the only prerequisite skill needed to become an OpenShot developer!

       WARNING:
          The instructions that follow are for Ubuntu Linux, which is the easiest environment to configure for OpenShot development.  If you are using another OS, I suggest running a virtual machine with
          Ubuntu LTS before continuing any further.

          If  you must use a Windows or Mac system for development, start by referring to the build notes in the libopenshot wiki.  Building the library with all of its dependencies is the most challeng‐
          ing part of the process.

          • Windows Build Instructions

          • Mac Build Instructions

   Getting the Latest Source Code
       Before we can fix any bugs or add any features, we need to get the source code onto your computer.

       Use git to clone our 3 repositories:

          git clone https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot-audio.git
          git clone https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot.git
          git clone https://github.com/OpenShot/openshot-qt.git

   Configuring your Development Environment
       In order to actually compile or run OpenShot, we need to install some dependencies on your system. The easiest way to accomplish this is with our Daily PPA. A PPA is an unofficial  Ubuntu  reposi‐
       tory, which has our software packages available to download and install.

          sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openshot.developers/libopenshot-daily

       At  this  point, you should have all 3 OpenShot components source code cloned into local folders, the OpenShot daily PPA installed, and all of the required development and runtime dependencies in‐
       stalled. This is a great start, and we are now ready to start compiling some code!

   libopenshot-audio (Build Instructions)
       This library is required for audio playback and audio effects.  It is based on the JUCE audio framework.  Here are the commands to build it:

          cd libopenshot-audio
          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dist ..
          make
          make install

       Essentially, we are switching to the libopenshot-audio/build folder, then running cmake .. on the parent folder.  This finds dependencies and creates all the needed Makefiles used to compile  this
       library.   Then  make  uses  those  Makefiles  to  compile  this library, and make install installs them in the location we specified.  If CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX isn’t set, the files will install to
       /usr/local/ (by default) and make install will require administrative privileges to run.

   libopenshot (Build Instructions)
       This library is required for video decoding, encoding, animation, and just about everything else.  It does all the heavy lifting of video editing and video playback.   Here  are  the  commands  to
       build it:

          cd libopenshot
          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake -DLIBOPENSHOT_AUDIO_DIR=../../libopenshot-audio/build/dist ..
          make

       Essentially,  we  are  switching to the libopenshot/build folder, then running cmake .. on the parent folder.  This finds dependencies and creates all the needed Makefiles used to compile this li‐
       brary.  Then make uses those Makefiles to compile this library.  Because we provided the location of our compiled libopenshot-audio installation, that version of the library will be  used  instead
       of the system version (if any).

       We don’t install our libopenshot after building, because we don’t need to.  For testing purposes, we can tell OpenShot to use libopenshot right from our build directory.

   openshot-qt (Launch Instructions)
       This  is our main PyQt Python application.  Because it is written in Python, it does not require any compiling to run.  To launch OpenShot from the source code with our newly-built libopenshot-au‐
       dio and libopenshot libraries, use the following commands:

          cd openshot-qt
          PYTHONPATH=../libopenshot/build/src/bindings/python
          python3 src/launch.py

       This should launch the OpenShot user interface.  Any changes you have made to the source code files (*.py Python files, *.ui PyQt UI files, etc…) will be  included.   This  requires  the  libopen‐
       shot-audio and libopenshot libraries, and if anything went wrong with the steps above, OpenShot will likely not launch.

       If OpenShot launches at this point, congratulations!  You now have a working local version of OpenShot, which is running off your local source code.  Try making some changes to the source code and
       re-launch OpenShot… you should now see your changes!

   Glossary
       There is much technical terminology in today’s fast-moving media-centric world.  If you find yourself wondering what a video production term or an acronym means, you are certainly not alone.  Like
       most industries, video production has a language all its own. Here is a list of terms commonly found in video editing. Becoming familiar with these terms only makes your job easier.  [image]

   Definitions
       These definitions are a work-in-progress. Please let us know if you need a term defined by contacting support@openshot.org.

       -A- -B- -C- -D- -E- -F- -G- -H- -I- -J- -K- -L- -M- -N- -O- -P- -Q- -R- -S- -T- -U- -V- -W- -X- -Y- -Z-

   -A-
       A-Roll:
              The Principal video that is usually someone speaking.

       Aliasing:
              The undesirable jagged or stair-stepped appearance of angled lines in an image, graphic, or text.

       Alpha: Alpha  blending  is a convex combination of two colors allowing for transparency effects in computer graphics.  The value of alpha in the color code ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 repre‐
              sents a fully transparent color, and 1.0 represents a fully opaque color.

       Alpha Channel:
              An alpha channel is a channel in an image or movie clip that controls the opacity region.

       Ambient Noise:
              Ambient noise is background noise specific to the shooting location.

       Animation:
              The technique of making inanimate objects or drawings appear to move in motion pictures or computer graphics.

       Anti-Aliasing:
              Anti-aliasing is a process for smoothing jagged lines in an image.  Anti-aliasing can also mean a method of filtering out erroneous frequencies in an audio signal.

       Artifact:
              An artifact is undesired data in an image because of digital processing.

       Aspect Ratio:
              The ratio of width to height in a flat surface or 2-dimensional abstract construction, such as an image, video, character, or pixel.  The standard ratios for NTSC  SD  videos  are  4:3  (or
              1.33:1) and HD 16:9 (or 1.77:1).  The most common aspect ratios for motion pictures are 1.85:1 and 2.35:1.

       ATSC:  ATSC is a digital broadcast standard that replaced the older analog NTSC standard.  The standard covers both standard and high-definition formats.

       Audio Sample Rate:
              The  number of samples taken per second to reproduce audio digitally.  The higher the sample rate, the higher the quality of the digital audio.  A rate of 44,100 samples per second produces
              CD-quality audio and captures the range of human hearing.

   -B-
       B-roll:
              B-roll is supplemental footage that provides supporting details and greater flexibility when editing video.  Common examples include the footage used to cut away from an interview  or  news
              report to help tell the story.

       Bit:   The elementary unit for digital storage.  A BIT can be either a 1 (one) or a 0 (zero).

       Bit Depth:
              In  digital  graphics  and video, bit depth indicates the number of colors an image can display.  A high-contrast (no gray tones) black and white image is 1bit, meaning it can be off or on,
              black or white.  As bit depth increases, more colors become available.  24-bit color allows for displays of millions of colors.  Similarly, in digital audio, bit depth indicates the  number
              of bits per sample.  The higher the number, the better the sound quality.

       Bitrate:
              The  frequency  at  which bits (binary digits) pass a given physical or metaphorical point, measured in bps (bits per second).  For every second in the video, the Bit Rate, or Data Rate, is
              the amount of data used each second.  The bitrate, in Kilobits per second, can be variable or constant.

       Blue Screen:
              A blue screen is a blue background that the subject stands in front of that the computer later replaces with another background in post-production.  See also  blue  screen  compositing  and
              green screen.

       Blue Screen Compositing:
              The process of making all blue elements in an image transparent and placing a different background underneath.

   -C-
       Capture:
              The process of transferring source video from a camcorder or tape deck to a computer.  If the source video is analog, the capture process converts the video to digital.

       Channel:
              A channel is one of several grayscale components used to make up a color image.  Red, green, and blue channels make up RGB images, with an optional alpha channel for transparency.

       Chromakey:
              Chromakey  is  a  method  of creating transparency in a video source by selecting a specific “key color” to create an alpha matte.  It is frequently used on news programs to display weather
              graphics behind talent and for visual effects compositing.

       Clip:  A digitized or captured portion of video, audio, or both.  Clips are media files added to the Timeline, usually part of a more extensive recording.

       Codec: Codec is a video compression technology used to compress data in a video file.  Codec stands for “Compression Decompression.” An example of a popular codec is H.264.

       Color Correction:
              The process of altering the color of a video, especially one shot under less than ideal conditions, such as low light.

       Compositing:
              Construction of a composite image by combining multiple images and other elements.

       Coverage:
              Coverage is the process of shooting additional footage and camera angles to cover the action in the scene.  Coverage is so that the editor has a more excellent range  of  choices  when  the
              film reaches the post-production stage.

       Compression:
              The process of reducing data, such as in an audio or video file, into a form that requires less space.

       Crop Factor:
              Crop  factor is a number (typically from 1.3-2.0) that represents the ratio of a sensor’s imaging area to that of a full-frame sensor.  Try multiplying the focal length of your lens by your
              camera sensor’s crop factor.  It gives you the focal length for the lens/sensor combination.

       Crawl: Crawl is a text effect where the text moves right-to-left (in the English-speaking world).

       Cross-fade:
              A cross-fade is a simultaneous fade-in of one audio or video source as another fades out so that they overlap temporarily.  Also called a dissolve.

       Cut:   A cut is an instantaneous change from one shot to another.

       Cut-in (Insert Shot):
              It is a type of shot that most often shows the objects the subject is in contact with or manipulating.  Cut-in shots are correspondingly helpful to b-roll because they stray from  the  sub‐
              ject for a short time.

       Cutting on Action:
              Cutting  on action is a technique used to create a more interesting scene. The concept is simple… when you cut in the middle of an action, it will appear less jarring and more visual inter‐
              esting.

   -D-
       Data Rate:
              The amount of data moved over time (for example, 10 MB per second).  Often used to describe a hard drive’s ability to retrieve and deliver information.

       Denominator:
              The number or expression below the line in a fraction (such as 2 in ½).

       Digital Video:
              Digital video is an electronic representation of moving visual images (video) in the form of encoded digital data.  In contrast, analog video represents moving  visual  images  with  analog
              signals.  Digital video comprises a series of digital images displayed in rapid succession.

       Digitize:
              To convert analog video or audio to digital form.

       Dissolve:
              Dissolve is an image transition effect where one picture gradually disappears as another appears.  Also called a cross-fade.

   -E-
       Editing:
              Editing  is  the  process  or  result of selectively sequencing video and audio clips into a new video file.  Typically involves reviewing raw footage and transferring desired segments from
              source footage into a new predetermined sequence.

       Effect:
              Synthetic sounds and animations created in the digital domain applied to a clip to change a specific parameter of video or audio.  Examples: the color of a visual element or the  reverb  on
              an audio track.

       Encode:
              To merge the individual video signals (for example, red, green, and blue) into a combined signal, or to convert a video file to a different format using a codec.

       Export:
              Export refers to the process of assembling your edited video project into a single file that then plays back on its own, shared, or uploaded.

   -F-
       Fade:  A fade is the gradual diminishing or heightening of visual or audio intensity.  Usage: fade-out, fade to black, fade-in, or fade up from black.

       Fade-in:
              1.(n.) a shot that begins in total darkness and gradually lightens to full brightness.  2. (v.) To gradually bring sound from inaudibility to the required volume.

       Fade-out:
              1.(n.) a shot that begins in full brightness and gradually dims to total darkness.  2. (v.) To gradually bring sound from the required volume to inaudibility.

       Filter:
              A  video filter is a software component that performs some operation on a multimedia stream.  Multiple filters used in a chain, known as a filter graph, are the process in which each filter
              receives input from its upstream filter.  The filter graph processes the input and outputs the processed video to its downstream filter.

       Final Cut:
              The final video production, assembled from high-quality clips, and ready for export to the selected delivery media.

       Finishing:
              The stage that brings together all assets of a piece.  Your output from this stage is your master/sub-master.

       Footage:
              Derived from having feet of film, this is almost synonymous with video clips.

       Frame: In filmmaking, video production, animation, and related fields, a frame is one of the many still images which compose the complete moving picture.

       Frames Per Second (fps):
              The number of frames played every second.  At 15 fps and lower, the human eye can detect individual frames, causing the video to appear jerky.

       Frame Rate:
              Frame rate (expressed in frames per second or FPS) is the frequency (rate expressed in Hz) at which consecutive images called frames appear on display.  The term applies equally to film and
              video cameras, computer graphics, and motion capture systems.  Common Frame Rate Examples: 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 60.

       Frequency:
              The number of audio cycles per second, expressed in hertz (Hz).  Frequency determines the pitch of a sound.

   -G-
       Gamma: A measurement of the intensity of mid-tones in an image.  Adjusting the gamma adjusts the level of the mid-tones while leaving the blacks and whites untouched.

       GPU:   Graphics processing unit.  A microprocessor with built-in capabilities for handling 3D graphics more efficiently than a CPU (central processing unit).

       Gravity:
              Gravity in OpenShot is a property of each clip that sets the clip’s initial position on the screen.

       Green screen
              A green background that the subject stands in front of that is another background in post-production.

       Green Screen Compositing
              The process of making all green elements in an image transparent and placing a different background underneath, so it appears that the subject is in a different location.

   -H-
       High Definition (HD):
              A general term for a video signal with a significantly higher resolution than standard definition.

       HDMI:  High Definition Multimedia Interface.  Interface for transmitting high definition digital audio and video data.

       HDR:   HDR (high dynamic range) is the compositing of two images, one that correctly exposes the highlights, and another that properly exposes the dark areas.  When composited together, you get  a
              properly exposed image.

       HDTV:  High Definition TV.  A broadcast format that allows for a higher resolution signal than the traditional formats, NTSC, PAL, and SECAM.

       HDV:   High Definition Video.  The format used to record HDTV-quality data with video camcorders.

       Headroom:
              The space between the top of a character’s head and the top of the frame.

       Hiss:  Noise caused by imperfections in the recording medium.

       Hue:   The  shade  of  a  color.  This is the general color category into which the color falls.  For example, pink, crimson, and plum are different colors, but they all fall under the hue of red.
              White, black, and gray tones are not hues.

   -I-
       Image Stabilizer:
              Also referred to as an electronic image stabilizer.  A technique used to remove the movement caused by camera shake.

       Importing:
              Importing is the process of transferring videos from your camera onto your computer or into a piece of editing software.

       Interframe Compression:
              A compression scheme, such as MPEG that reduces the amount of video information by storing only the differences between a frame and those preceding it.

       Interpolation:
              Used in animation to calculate the motion in between two user-generated keyframes so that the editor does not need to animate each frame manually.  This speeds up the process and makes  the
              resulting animation smoother.

       Intertitles:
              Titles that appear on their own between footage.  Commonly seen in silent movies to substitute dialogue, also used as chapter headings.

   -J-
       J-Cut: An edit in which the audio starts before the video, giving the video a dramatic introduction.  Also known as an audio lead.

       Jog    To move forward or backward through video by playing it one field or frame at a time.

       Jump Cut:
              A  jump  cut  is an unnatural, abrupt switch between shots identical in the subject but slightly different in screen location, so the subject appears to jump from one screen location to an‐
              other.

   -K-
       Key:   A method for creating transparency, such as a bluescreen key or a chroma key.

       Keyframe:
              A keyframe is a frame that contains a record of specific settings (e.g., scale, rotation, brightness).  Start and endpoints for animated effects.  By setting multiple keyframes, you can ad‐
              just these parameters as the video plays to animate certain aspects.

   -L-
       L-Cut: An L-cut is an edit in which the video ends before the audio.  L-cuts act as a subtle transition from one scene to the next.

       Letterbox:
              A technique used to preserve the original aspect ratio of a motion picture when played on a TV.  Letterboxing adds black bars to the top and bottom of the screen.

       Linear Editing:
              A form of video editing which lays out cuts sequentially, one by one, to produce the final scene. This contrasts with non-linear editing which allows cutting in any order.

       Log:   A record of start and end timecode, reel numbers, scene descriptions, and other information for a specified clip.

       Lossless:
              A compression scheme that results in no loss of data from decompressing the file.  Lossless files are generally quite large (but still smaller than uncompressed versions) and sometimes  re‐
              quire considerable processing power to decode the data.

       Lossy: Lossy  compression is a compression scheme that degrades quality.  Lossy algorithms compress digital data by eliminating the data least sensitive to the human eye and offer the highest com‐
              pression rates available.

   -M-
       Mark In:
              Placing a marker at the beginning of where you want your clip to start.

       Mark Out:
              Placing a marker at the beginning of where you want your clip to end.

       Match Action:
              Match action (or match cut) is a technique where an editor will cut from one visually similar scene to another.

       Memory Bank:
              A Memory Bank is a video that documents specific periods or events in someone’s life.  It can be set to music, make use of natural sound, record vacations, or just capture moments in every‐
              day life.

       Marker:
              An object used to mark a location.  Clip markers signify essential points within a clip.  Timeline markers indicate scenes, locations for titles, or other significant points within  an  en‐
              tire movie.  Use clip markers and timeline markers for positioning and trimming clips.

       Mask:  The transparent area of an image, typically defined by a graphic shape or a bluescreen background.  Also called a matte.

       Matte: Matte is an image mask used in visual effects to control applying an effect to certain parts of the image.

       Montage:
              A  montage is a self-contained sequence of shots assembled in juxtaposition to each other to communicate an idea or mood.  The implied relationship between seemingly unrelated material cre‐
              ates a new message.

       Motion Artifact:
              Visual interference caused by the difference between the frame rate of the camera and the motion of the object.  The most common display of this is when filming  a  computer  or  television
              screen.  The screen flickers or a line scans down it, which is the difference in frame rates and a lack of synchronization between the camera and television.

   -N-
       Noise: Undesired data in a video or audio signal.  See also artifact.

       Non-linear Editing:
              An  editing system that performs edits at any time, in any order.  Access is random, which means that the system can jump to specific pieces of data without having to look through the whole
              footage to find it.

       Numerator:
              The number or expression above the line in a fraction (such as 1 in ½).

       NTSC:  NTSC is an abbreviation for National Television Standards Committee.  NTSC is the group that initially developed the black & white and subsequently  color  television  system.   The  United
              States,  Japan,  and  many  other  countries use NTSC.  Five-hundred twenty-five interlaced lines make up NTSC that display at a rate of 29.97 frames per second.  ATSC Has now superseded by
              NTSC.

   -O-
       Offline Editing:
              Editing a rough cut using low-quality clips, and then producing the final cut with high-quality clips, usually on a more sophisticated editing system  than  that  used  for  developing  the
              rough.

       Online Editing:
              Doing all editing (including the rough cut) on the same clips that produce the final cut.

       Opacity:
              An inverse measure of the level of transparency in an image, which is of importance when compositing.  An image’s alpha channel stores its opacity information.

   -P-
       PAL:   PAL  is an abbreviation for Phase Alternate Line.  This is the video format standard used in many European countries.  Six-hundred twenty-five lines make up a PAL picture that displays at a
              rate of 25 frames per second.

       Pan:   A horizontal movement of the camera on a fixed axis.

       Pan and Scan:
              A method of converting widescreen images to a 4:3 aspect ratio.  Cropping the video so that it fills the entire screen and panning it into position shows the essential parts of the scene.

       Picture in Picture (PIP):
              An effect of superimposing a small window of footage over a larger window and the two play at the same time.

       Pixel: One of the tiny dots that make up the representation of an image in a computer’s memory.  The smallest unit of a digital image.

       Pixel Aspect Ratio:
              Aspect ratio is the ratio between the width and height of your video; the Pixel Aspect Ratio is the ratio between the width and height of the pixels.  A standard Pixel Aspect Ratio is 1:1.

       Pixelation:
              The display of large, blocky pixels in an image caused by over-enlarging it.

       Playhead:
              When editing audio or video in a current computer, the Playhead is a graphic line in the Timeline that represents the current accessed position, or frame, of the material.

       Post-production (Post):
              Post-production (post) is any video production activity following the initial recording.  Typically, post involves editing, the addition of background music, voice-over, sound effects,  ti‐
              tles, and various visual effects resulting in completed production.

       Poster Frame:
              A single frame of a clip, selected as a thumbnail to indicate the clip’s contents.

       Project:
              A project is all the files, transitions, effects, and animations that you make or use within OpenShot.

   -R-
       Raw Footage:
              Raw footage is pre-edited footage, usually direct from the camera.

       Real-time:
              Real-time  occurs  immediately,  without delay for rendering.  If a transition occurs in real-time, there is no waiting, the computer creates the effect or transition on-the-fly, showing it
              the results immediately.

       Rendering:
              The process by which the video editing software and hardware convert the raw video, effects, transitions, and filters into a new continuous video file.

       Render Time:
              The render time is the time it takes an editing computer to composite source elements and commands into a single video file.  Rendering allows the sequence, including titles and  transition
              effects, to play in full motion.

       Resolution:
              Resolution  refers to the actual number of horizontal and vertical pixels your video contains.  Common resolution Examples: (SD) 640×480, (HD) 854x480, (HD) 1280×720, (FHD) 1920×1080, (QHD)
              2560x1440, (UHD) 3840x2160, and (FUHD) 7680x4320.  Often the numbers that appear vertically refer to the resolution.  The examples listed would appear as SD, 480p, 720p,  1080p,  1440p,  4K
              and 8K, respectively.

       RGB:   Monitors, cameras, and digital projectors use the primary colors of light (Red, Green, and Blue) to make images.

       RGBA:  A file containing an RGB image plus an alpha channel for transparency information.

       Roll:  Roll is a text effect commonly seen in end credits, where text typically moves from the bottom to the top of the screen.

       Rough cut:
              A rough cut is a preliminary edit of footage in the approximate sequence, length, and content of a finished program.

   -S-
       Sample Rate:
              In digital audio, the number of samples per second.  The higher the number, the better the sound quality.

       Scene: Action that occurs in one location at one time.

       Scrub: Scrubbing is an act of moving the cursor or playhead across the Timeline manually.  Once specific to audio tracks, the term now also refers to video tracks.

       Shot:  A recording of a single take.

       Slow-motion:
              A  shot  in  which  action  takes place at a slower than average speed.  The camera achieves slow-motion by speeding up the frame rate during recording and then playing back the frames at a
              slower speed.

       Snap:  Snapping quickly positions an object in alignment with grid lines, guidelines, or another object.  Snapping causes the object to automatically jump to an exact position when the user  drags
              it to the proximity of the desired location.

       Splice:
              The process of physically attaching two pieces of film using tape or cement.

       Split cut (L-cut or J-cut):
              An edit in which the audio starts before or after the picture cut.  Used for easing the transition from one scene or shot to another.

       Splitscreen:
              A unique effect that displays two or more scenes simultaneously on different parts of the screen.

       Sound Effects:
              Sound effects are contrived audio, usually prerecorded, incorporated with a video soundtrack to resemble a real occurrence.  Blowing on a microphone, for example, might simulate wind to ac‐
              company hurricane images.

       Soundtrack:
              The soundtrack is the audio portion of a video recording, often multifaceted with natural sound, voiceovers, background music, or other sounds.

       Stabilization:
              Image stabilization is a family of techniques that reduce blurring associated with the motion of a camera or other imaging device during exposure.

       Standard Definition (SD):
              Television broadcasting standard with a lower resolution than high definition.

       Step:  The act of moving forward or backward through video one frame at a time.

       Still Frame:
              A single frame of video is repeated, so it appears to have no motion.

       Straight Cut:
              The  most common edit, consecutive clips placed one after another in the Timeline window.  Straight cuts are preferable to transitions when the scenes are similar, and you do not want edits
              to be noticeable.

       Superimposing:
              Combining images, where one or more layers involve transparency.

       Sync (Synchronization):
              Synchronization refers to the relative timing of audio (sound) and video (image) parts during creation, post-production (mixing), transmission, reception, and play-back processing.

       SECAM: Systeme Electronique Couleur Avec Memoire, a TV format used mainly in Eastern Europe, Russia, and Africa.

   -T-
       Tilt:  Tilting is a cinematographic technique in which the camera stays in a fixed position but rotates up/down in a vertical plane.

       Timecode:
              The timecode is the discrete address given to each frame of the video (for example, 1:20:24:09).  Timecode makes frame-accurate editing possible and allows editors to identify  scenes  pre‐
              cisely in a log.

       Time-lapse:
              It  is  a technique for capturing each frame in a video at a much slower rate than usual.  When played back at regular speed, time appears to go by faster.  An editing program achieves this
              by fast-forwarding or increasing the speed of your video.

       Timeline:
              The Timeline is an editing interface that lays out a video project in a linear fashion consisting of clips laid horizontally across the screen.

       Timeline Editing:
              Timeline editing is a computer-based method of editing, in which bars proportional to the length of a clip, represent video and audio clips on a computer screen.

       Titling:
              Titling is the process or result of incorporating on-screen text as credits, captions, or any other alphanumeric communication.

       Track: A separate audio or video layer on a timeline.

       Transcode:
              Converting a digital file to another digital file format.  This usually involves audio and video compression.

       Transparency:
              Percentage of the opacity of a video clip or element.

       Transition:
              A method of juxtaposing two scenes.  Transitions can take many forms, including cuts, dissolves, and wipes.

       Trim:  Removing frames from the beginning, middle, or end of a clip.

   -V-
       Video Format:
              The video format is a standard that determines the way a video signal records on videotape.  Standards include DV, 8-mm, Beta, and VHS.

       Voiceover:
              A term used to describe off-camera narration that is not part of a scene (non-diegetic).

       VTR:   A Videotape recorder also referred to as a ‘deck’.  Decks duplicate videotapes and inputting and outputting from a computer.

   -W-
       Widescreen:
              A format in which the width-to-height ratio of the frame is greater than 4:3 so that it is significantly wider than it is tall.

       Wipe:  A wipe is a transition from one shot to another.  The edge of the transition moves across the original image as a line or a pattern, revealing the new shot.

   -Z-
       Zoom:  A shot where the image grows more substantial or smaller by adjusting the focal length of the lens instead of physically moving the camera.
