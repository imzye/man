NAME
       run_scaled - run an X11 application upscaled or downscaled

SYNOPSIS
       run_scaled [--scaling=VALUE] application [application-arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       run_scaled uses xpra(1) to show any X11 application with arbitrary scaling applied.

EXAMPLES
       run_scaled xterm -ls
              Starts the command "xterm -ls", with the default scaling of 2.
              The xterm window will be twice as big as it normally would be.

       run_scaled --scaling=250% firefox
              Start firefox, upscaled by 250%.

OPTIONS
       --scaling=VALUE
              The scaling factor to apply, specified as:

              number ie: 2, 1.5

              fraction
                     ie: 3/2

              percentage
                     ie: 250%
       If unspecified, the default value is 2.

LIMITATIONS
       The scaling value is limited to the range 0.1 to 10, and even within that range, values lower than 1 may not work correctly with large displays.
