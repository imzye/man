NAME
       azove - Another Zero-One Vertex Enumeration tool

SYNOPSIS
       azove [-c] [-r] [-e] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Azove  is  a  tool designed for counting (without explicit enumeration) and enumeration of 0/1 vertices.  Given a polytope by a linear relaxation or facet description P = {x | Ax <= b}, all 0/1 points
       lying in P can be counted or enumerated.  This is done by intersecting the polytope P with the unit-hypercube [0,1] d.  The integral vertices (no fractional ones) of this intersection will be  enumer‐
       ated.  If P is a 0/1 polytope, azove solves the vertex enumeration problem.  In fact it can also solve the 0/1 knapsack problem and the 0/1 subset sum problem.

       FILE is a file in the cddlib .ine format.

       Statistics and timings are written to stderr.  Output in cddlib .ext format is written to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -c     Only count the number of 0/1 vertices [default: enumeration].

       -r     Generate random variables order for the BDDs [default: variable order given by input].  This may help in case of hard instances.

       -e     Exact arbitrary precision.
