NAME
       debomatic - Automatic build machine for Debian source packages

SYNOPSIS
       debomatic -c|--config conffile [-i|--interactive] [-q|--quit]

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool  provides a simple build machine for Debian source packages.  It is designed to be very simple to use and self-sufficient during package build process and chroot updates. It support al‐
       most every Debian-based distribution, given its repositories follow standard Debian repository structure.

       sbuild and an active Internet connection (broadband is suggested) are required in order for debomatic to work properly.

       You have to run it using root privileges due to the chroot creation process.

OPTIONS
       -c, --config conffile
              You have to specify a configuration file for debomatic to work.

       -i, --interactive
              By default, debomatic runs in full daemon mode and it detaches itself from its parent. If you do not want this, you can use this option and debomatic will run in interactive mode.

       -q, --quit
              Terminate running debomatic instance or remove obsolete locks left.
