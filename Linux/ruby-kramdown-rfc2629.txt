NAME
       kramdown-rfc - tool to generate XML2RFC XML from Markdown

SYNOPSIS
       kramdown-rfc [mydraft.mkd]

DESCRIPTION
       kramdown(1) is a markdown parser by Thomas Leitner, which has a number of backends for generating HTML, Latex, and markdown again.

       kramdown-rfc is an additional backend to that: it allows the generation of XML2RFC XML markup (also known as RFC 2629, RFC 7449, or RFC 7991 compliant markup), designed as a source format for doc‐
       uments in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for Comments (RFC) series, to be processed by the xml2rfc utility.

       If no file specified, STDIN will be used. If you are typing input, you can send an EOF by pressing ^D.

EXAMPLE
        kramdown-rfc mydraft.mkd > mydraft.xml
        xml2rfc mydraft.xml
