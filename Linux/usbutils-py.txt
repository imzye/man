NAME
       lsusb.py - list USB devices

SYNOPSIS
       lsusb.py [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       lsusb.py  is  a  utility  for  displaying information about USB buses in the system and the devices connected to them. It uses the usb.ids file to associate a human-readable name to the vendor and
       product IDs.

       In comparison with lsusb(8), this program can display additional information such as the interface speed of a device, and details of a device's interfaces including the driver bound  to  them  and
       Linux devices provided by the driver, and the details of device and interface endpoints.

OPTIONS

       -U, --hide-hubs
