NAME
       eximon - Monitor Exim

SYNOPSIS
       eximon

DESCRIPTION
       The  Exim monitor is an application which displays in an X window information about the state of Exim's queue and what Exim is doing.  An admin user can perform certain operations on messages from
       this GUI interface; however all such facilities are also available from the command line, and indeed, the monitor itself makes use of the command line to perform any actions requested.
