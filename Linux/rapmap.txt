NAME
       rapmap - rapid sensitive and accurate DNA read mapping via quasi-mapping

SYNOPSIS
       rapmap [pseudoindex|pseudomap|quasiindex|quasimap] <options>

DESCRIPTION
       RapMap  is  a  testing ground for ideas in quasi-mapping / (lightweight / pseudo) transcriptome alignment. That means that, at this point, it is somewhat experimental. The develop branch will have
       the latest improvements and additions, but is not guaranteed to be stable between commits. Breaking changes to the master branch will be accompanied by a tag to the  version  before  the  breaking
       change.  Currently, RapMap is a stand-alone quasi-mapper that can be used with other tools. It is also being used as part of Sailfish and Salmon. Eventually, the hope is to create and stabilize an
       API so that it can be used as a library from other tools.

OPTIONS
       Rapmap contains 4 subcommands:

              pseudoindex - builds a k-mer-based index (see rapmap_pseudoindex(1))

              pseudomap - map reads using a k-mer-based index (see rapmap_pseudomap(1))

              quasiindex - builds a suffix array-based (SA) index (see rapmap_quasiindex(1))

              quasimap - map reads using the SA-based index (see rapmap_quasimap(1))
