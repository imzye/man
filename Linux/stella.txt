       -tia.vsizeadjust <-5-5>
              Adjust the display height of the TIA image.

       -tia.inter <1|0>
              Use interpolation for the TIA image (results in blending/smoothing of the image).

       -tia.fs_stretch <1|0>

       -tia.dbgcolors <r|o|y|g|b|p...>
              Assigns the colours (r)ed, (o)range, (y)ellow, (g)reen, (b)lue and (p)urple to each graphical register P0/M0/P1/M1/PF/BL, respectively.  Currently, these can be changed around to apply dif‐
              ferent colours to the respective register.

              Blargg TV effects 'resolution' (only available in custom mode, range -1.0 to 1.0).

       -tv.artifacts <number>
              Blargg TV effects 'artifacts' (only available in custom mode, range -1.0 to 1.0).

       -tv.bleed <number>
              Blargg TV effects 'bleed' (only available in custom mode, range -1.0 to 1.0).

       -tv.phosphor <always|byrom>
              Determines  how  phosphor mode is enabled. If always, then the ROM properties entry is ignored, and phosphor mode is always turned on.  Otherwise, the ROM properties determine whether phos‐
              phor mode is used for each ROM.

       -tv.phosblend <0-100>
              Enable phosphor blending level; 0 implies no mixing, and 100 is full mixing (not recommended). Note that this doesn't actually enable phosphor mode; that is done for each  ROM  in  the  ROM
              properties.  Higher  blend values will intensify the phosphor effect. Depending on your display and personal preferences, the optimal default for you may vary. Slow LCDs (especially for of‐
              fice use) may only need a low blend of around 30, while fast switching gamer LCDs may need about 70 to look similar to a CRT.

       -tv.scanlines <0-100>
              TV effects scanline intensity, where 0 means completely off.

       -cheat <code>

       -loglevel <0|1|2>
              Indicates level of logging to perform while the application is running. Zero completely disables logging (except for serious errors), while the remaining numbers show increasingly more  de‐
              tail.

       -logtoconsole <1|0>
              Indicates  that  logged  output  should  be  printed to the console/commandline as it's being collected. An internal log will still be kept, and the amount of logging is still controlled by
              loglevel.

       -joydeadzone <number>
              Sets the joystick deadzone area for analog joysticks. Accepts a number from 0 - 29, and uses the formula 3200 + number * 1000. So the possible deadzone values range from 3200 to 32200.

       -psense <number>
              Sensitivity for emulation of paddles when using analog paddles. Valid range of values is from 1 to 30, with larger numbers causing faster movement

              Impact of fast paddle movement on input averaging.

              Automatic trigger rate of the fire buttons in Hz (0 = disabled)

       -joyallow4 <1|0>
              Allow all 4 directions on a joystick to be pressed simultaneously. Bumper Bash ignores this setting, and always allows all 4 directions.

       -modcombo <1|0>
              Use modifier (Shift/Alt/Control)-x key combos. This is normally enabled, since the 'Quit' command is tied to 'Control-q'. However, there are times when you want to  disable  them.   E.g.  a
              2-player game is using either the 'f' or 'r' keys for movement, and pressing Control (for Fire) will perform an unwanted action associated with Control-r or Control-f default keys.

       -saport <lr|rl>
              Determines how to enumerate the Stelladaptor/2600-daptor devices in the order they are found: 'lr' means first is left port, second is right port, 'rl' means the opposite.

              Sensitivity for emulation of paddles when using a mouse. number may range from 1 to 20, with larger numbers causing faster movement.

              Sensitivity for emulation of trackball controllers when using a mouse.  number may range from 1 to 20, with larger numbers causing faster movement.

       -dsense <number>
              Sensitivity  for  emulation  of  paddles when using a digital device (joystick digital axis or button, keyboard key, etc.). number may range from 1 to 20, with larger numbers causing faster
              movement.

       -cursor <0|1|2|3>
              Set mouse cursor state in UI/emulation modes.

       -dev.tiadriven <1|0>
              Set unused TIA pins to be randomly driven high or low on a read/peek.

       -dev.rwportbreak <1|0>
              Since the 2600 has no dedicated R/W line, different addresses are used for RAM read or write access.  If the code reads from such a write address, this causes an unwanted, semi-random write
              to that address.  When this option is enabled, such reads interrupt emulation and the debugger is entered.

       -dev.wrportbreak <1|0>
              Same as above.  If the code writes to such a read address, nothing happens. But a developer should be made aware of it, because this indicates a problem with the code.  When this option  is
              enabled, such writes interrupt emulation and the debugger is entered.

       -plr.thumb.trapfatal <true|false>
              The  default  of true allows the Thumb ARM emulation to throw an exception and enter the debugger on fatal errors.  When disabled, such fatal errors are simply logged, and emulation contin‐
              ues.  Do not use this unless you know exactly what you're doing, as it changes the behaviour as compared to real hardware.

       -<plr|dev>.eepromaccess <1|0>
              When enabled, each read or write access to the AtariVox/SaveKey EEPROM is signalled by a message.

       -dev.tia.type <standard|koolaidman|cosmicark|pesco|quickstep|heman|custom>
              Set emulated TIA type.

       -dev.tia.plinvphase <1|0>
              Enable/disable inverted HMOVE clock phase for players (Kool Aid Man glitch).

       -dev.tia.msinvphase <1|0>
              Enable/disable inverted HMOVE clock phase for missiles (Cosmic Ark stars glitch).

       -dev.tia.blinvphase <1|0>
              Enable/disable inverted HMOVE clock phase for ball.

       -dev.tia.delaypfbits <1|0>
              Enable/disable playfield bits delayed by one color clock (stray playfield pixels in Pesco).

       -dev.tia.delaypfcolor <1|0>
              Enable/disable playfield color delayed by one color clock (colored step borders in Quick Step!).

       -dev.tia.delaybkcolor <1|0>
              Enable/disable background color delayed by one color clock (stray pixels in Indy 500 menu hack).

       -dev.tia.delayplswap <1|0>
              Enable/disable player swap delayed by one color clock (He-Man title glitch).

       -dev.tia.delayblswap <1|0>
              Enable/disable ball swap delayed by one color clock.

       -<plr|dev>.tv.jitter <1|0>
              Enable TV jitter/roll effect, when there are too many or too few scanlines per frame.

       -<plr|dev>.tv.jitter_recovery <1-20>
              When TV jitter/roll effect is enabled, determines how long to delay recovery time (recovery spread over multiple frames).

       -<plr|dev>.colorloss <1|0>
              Enable/disable the PAL color-loss effect.

       -<plr|dev>.debugcolors <1|0>
              Enable/disable the fixed debug colors.

       -<plr|dev>.timemachine <1|0>
              Enables the Time Machine.

       -<plr|dev>.tm.size <20-1000>
              Defines the Time Machine buffer size.

       -<plr|dev>.tm.uncompressed <0-1000>
              Defines the uncompressed Time Machine buffer size.  Must be less than Time Machine the buffer size.

       -<plr|dev>.tm.interval <1f|3f|10f|30f|1s|3s|10s>
              Defines the interval between two save states.

       -<plr|dev>.tm.horizon <3s|10s|30s|1m|3m|10m|30m|60m>
              Defines the horizon of the Time Machine.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
       The Atari 2600 console controls and controllers are mapped to the computer's keyboard as shown in the following sections. However, most of these events can be remapped to other keys on  your  key‐
       board or buttons on your joystick.
