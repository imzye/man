NAME
       ptochain - add control points to a Hugin project between consecutive photos

SYNOPSIS
       ptochain [options] --output output.pto input.pto

        Options:
         -m | --makefile file  Output Makefile
         -o | --output file    Output project
         -h | --help           Outputs help documentation.

DESCRIPTION
       ptochain is a wrapper around various tools that generates control points.  Output is in the form of a .pto project.

       Consecutive photos in the project are selected for feature matching and connected into one or more chains of connected images.  If points already exist between photos then matching will be skipped
       i.e. this tool is a noop if a full set of control points already exist in the project.

       If the --makefile option is given, rules for generating the project are written to a Makefile, if --makefile isn't set then these rules will be executed immediately.

       Control point generator parameters are set via Option lines in the input project:

         #hugin_cpgenSize 1500
         #hugin_cpgenNumber 25
         #hugin_cpgenRansac true
         #hugin_cpgenRefine false
