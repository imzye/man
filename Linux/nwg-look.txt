NAME
       nwg-look - GTK3 settings editor for wlroots environments like Sway.

SYNOPSIS
       nwg-look [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes nwg-look, a GTK3 settings editor designed to work properly in wlroots-based Wayland environments, such as Sway.  The look and feel is strongly influenced by LXAppear‐
       ance, but nwg-look is intended to free the user from a few inconveniences: it works natively on Wayland, and it applies gsettings directly, so you don't need to add anything special to  your  Sway
       configuration.

OPTIONS
       -a     Apply stored gsettings and quit.

       -d     Enable debug messages.

       -r     Restore to default values and quit.

       -v     Display version information.

       -x     Export config files and quit.

USAGE
       With Sway, you don't need any special stuff in your Sway configuration file.  This means you should remove any "gsettings" or "import-gsettings" directives from your Sway configuration.

COMPATIBILITY
       Some gsettings keys have no direct counterparts in Gtk.Settings.  While exporting the settings.ini file, nwg-look uses the most similar values:

       Settings that no longer work include:

       •      Toolbar style (deprecated since GTK 3.10)

       •      Toolbar icon size (deprecated since GTK 3.10)

       •      Show button images (deprecated since GTK 3.10)

       •      Show menu images (deprecated since GTK 3.10)

       •      Enable event sounds (does not seem to affect non-GNOME environments)

       •      Enable input feedback sounds (does not seem to affect non-GNOME environments)
