NAME
       sss_rpcidmapd - sss plugin configuration directives for rpc.idmapd

CONFIGURATION FILE
       rpc.idmapd configuration file is usually found at /etc/idmapd.conf. See idmapd.conf(5) for more information.

SSS CONFIGURATION EXTENSION
   Enable SSS plugin
       In section “[Translation]”, modify/set “Method” attribute to contain sss.

   [sss] config section
       In order to change the default of one of the configuration attributes of the sss plugin listed below you will need to create a config section for it, named “[sss]”.

       Configuration attributes

       memcache (bool)
           Indicates whether or not to use memcache optimisation technique.

           Default: True

SSSD INTEGRATION
       The sss plugin requires the NSS Responder to be enabled in sssd.

       The attribute “use_fully_qualified_names” must be enabled on all domains (NFSv4 clients expect a fully qualified name to be sent on the wire).

EXAMPLE
       The following example shows a minimal idmapd.conf which makes use of the sss plugin.

           [General]
           Verbosity = 2
           # domain must be synced between NFSv4 server and clients
           # Solaris/Illumos/AIX use "localdomain" as default!
           Domain = default

           [Mapping]
           Nobody-User = nfsnobody
           Nobody-Group = nfsnobody

           [Translation]
           Method = sss
