SYNOPSIS
         package MyApp::Config;

         use Moose;
         use MooseX::Configuration;

         has database_name => (
             is      => 'ro',
             isa     => 'Str',
             default => 'MyApp',
             section => 'database',
             key     => 'name',
             documentation =>
                 'The name of the database.',
         );

         has database_username => (

             key     => 'username',
             documentation =>
                 'The username to use when connecting to the database. By default, this is empty.',
         );

         my $config = MyApp::Config->new( config_file => '/path/to/config/myapp.ini' );
         $config->write_file( ... );

DESCRIPTION
       This module lets you define attributes which can come from a configuration file. It also adds a role to your class which allows you to write a configuration file.

       It is based on using a simple INI-style configuration file, which contains sections and keys:

         key1 = value
         key2 = 42

         [section]
         key3 = 2

ATTRIBUTE API
       Simply using this module in your class changes your class's attribute metaclass to add support for defining attributes as configuration items.

       There are two new parameters you can pass when defining an attribute, "section" and "key". These tell the module how to find the attribute's value in the configuration file. The "section"
       parameter is optional. If you don't set it, but do provide a key, then the section defaults to "_", which is the main section of the config file.

       If you pass a "section" you must also pass a "key".

       Defining an attribute as a configuration item has several effects. First, it changes the default value for the attribute. Before looking at a "default" or "builder" you define, the attribute will
       first look in the config file for a corresponding value. If one exists, it will use that, otherwise it will fall back to using a default you supply.

       If you do supply a default, it must be a string (or number), not a reference or undefined value.

       All configuration attributes are lazy. This is necessary because the configuration file needs to be loaded and parsed before looking up values.

       The "documentation" string is used when generating a configuration file. See below for details.

CLASS API
       Your config class will do the MooseX::Configuration::Trait::Object role. This adds several attributes and methods to your class.

   config_file attribute
       The "config_file" attribute defines the location of the configuration file. The role supplies a builder method that you can replace, "_build_config_file". It should return a string or
       Path::Class::File object pointing to the configuration file. It can also return "undef".

       If you don't provide your own builder, then the "config_file" will default to "undef".

   $config->_raw_config()
       This returns the raw hash reference as read by Config::INI::Reader. If no config file was defined, then this simply returns an empty hash reference.

   $config->write_config_file( ... )
       This method can be used to write a configuration file. It accepts several parameters:

       •   file

           This  can  be  either a path or an open filehandle. The configuration text will be written to this file. This defaults to the value of "$self->config_file()". If no file is provided or already
           set in the object, this method will die.

       •   generated_by

           If this parameter is passed, it will be included as a comment at the top of the generated file.

       •   values

           This should be a hash reference of attribute names and values to write to the config file. It is optional.

       When writing the configuration file, any configuration item that was set in the configuration file originally will be set in the new file, as  will  any  value  passed  in  the  "values"  key.  An
       attribute value set in the constructor or by a default will not be included in the generated file.

       Keys without a value will still be included in the file as a comment.

       If  an  attribute  includes a documentation string, that string will appear as a comment above the key. If the attribute defines a simple scalar default, that will also be included in the comment,
       unless the default is the empty string. Finally, if the attribute is required, that is also mentioned in the comment.

DONATIONS
       If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time creating free software, and would  appreciate  any
       support you'd care to offer.

       Please note that I am not suggesting that you must do this in order for me to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as
       it interests me.

       Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working on free software full time, which seems
       unlikely at best.

       To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the button on this page: <http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html>

BUGS
       Please  report  any  bugs or feature requests to "bug-moosex-configuration@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org>.  I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be
       notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.
