NAME
       Parcellite - Lightweight GTK+ Clipboard Manager

SYNOPSIS
       parcellite [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Parcellite is a lightweight GTK+ clipboard manager. This is a stripped down, basic-features-only clipboard manager with a small memory footprint for those who like simplicity.

       Parcellite features a clipboard CLI. Unrecognized options and the contents of your standard input get copied to your clipboard. See CLI EXAMPLES.

       Look at the tool tips by hovering over each item in the prefrences dialog.

OPTIONS
       -?, --help
              Show help options

       Parcellite by default runs as daemon. In this mode Parcellite will keep your clipboard
              and primary contents safe.  It also displays the status Icon (depending on -n) and preferences.

       -n, --no-icon
              Do not use status icon

       -c, --clipboard
              Print clipboard contents -p, --primary Print primary contents

ACTIONS
       Parcellite's  actions  perform commands using the contents of your clipboard. "%s" in the command is replaced with the clipboard contents. Use double quotes "%s" to expand env variables like $HOME
       to /home/your_name Use single quotes '%s' to feed your action with env variables without shell expansion. Use %% if you want a literal %.  See the man page for gnuC printf (man 2 printf) for  more
       information.

CLI EXAMPLES
        echo "copied to clipboard" | parcellite
        parcellite "copied to clipboard"
        echo "copied to clipboard" | parcellite -c

Hotkeys
        The available hotkey modifiers are <Ctrl>, <Alt> <Shift>, <Release>, <Meta>, <Super>, <Hyper>, <Mod[1-5]>

Preferences
       Right-click on the parcellite icon in the systray to access the preferences.

Behavior Tab
       Clipboards
              generally checking all these boxes is appropriate.

       History
               Check 'Save history' to save history on close.
               'Position history' - Set the location where history appears. If unchecked, appears where the mouse is.
               'X' - X location in pixels. 0 is top of screen.
               'Y' - Y location in pixels. 0 is left of screen.

               'Max Data Size (MB)' - Set Maximum amount of data to copy for each entry in MBytes. 0 is no limit.

       Miscellaneous
               'Search As You Type' - If checked, does a search-as-you-type. Turns red if not found. Goes to top (Alt-E) line when no chars are entered for search

               'Case Sensitive Search' - If checked, does case sensitive search.

               'Ignore Whitespace Only' - If checked, will ignore any clipboard additions that contain only whitespace.

               'Trim Whitespace' - If checked, will trim whitespace from beginning and end of entry.

               'Trim Newlines' - If checked, will replace newlines with spaces.

Display Tab
        'Show in Single line' does nothing.

        'Show in reverse order' reverses the history so the first entry is last and the last is first.

        'Persistent History' Adds a list that is permanent and never goes away.

        'Persistent As Separate List' Enables the persistent history hotkey, and the persistent history will appear with this key.

        'Persistent On Top' If the above option is checked, this has no effect. Otherwise, if this option is checked the Persistent History will appear on the top of the list. Unchecked, it appears on
       the bottom.

        'Paste All Entry Delimiter' Delimiter to denote start of a history entry.

        'Alternate Non-printing Display' If checked, displays tabs, newlines, and spaces with alternate characters.

        'Omit items' refers to omitting characters that don't fit in the history window width. This is for display only.

        'Multiuser' If checked, enables checking for multiple users.

        'Parcellite Icon Name' Sets the name of the Parcellite icon. This name is used by gnome, which usually looks in /usr/share/pixmaps. See the Open Desktop Spec for more details.

History Dialog Behavior
       Use the Ctrl or Shift key in conjunction with right-click.

       If you hold Ctrl, then it toggles the delete on a single item.

       If you hold Shift while holding down right-click (this is like a right-drag), then it toggles each item as it enters the item.

       To complete the delete, hit enter.
