NAME
       conspy - virtual console spy tool

SYNOPSIS
       conspy [ options ] [ console ]

DESCRIPTION
       Conspy allows the user to take control of a Linux virtual console.  The user can see what is displayed on the console and their keystrokes are sent to it.

       To exit from conspy press the escape key three times in quick succession.

COMMAND LINE
       -g COLSxROWS, --geometry COLSxROWS
              Specify the console size.  Conspy can almost always correctly guess the size so this is only useful when it complains it can't.

       -V, --version
              Print the program's version and exit.

       -v, --viewonly
              Don't send keystrokes to the virtual console.

       console
              If  supplied,  console  must  be a number in the range 1 .. 63, corresponding to the virtual console device /dev/tty1 .. /dev/tty63.  If not supplied the currently active virtual console is
              opened and tracked.

LIMITATIONS
       Conspy will not pass keystrokes to a virtual console whose keyboard is configured to send scan codes.  X configures its keyboard like this.  If the terminal does not have at least  64  colours  no
       colour will be displayed.  Conspy ignores the mouse.  Conspy may display some non-ASCII characters incorrectly.

       The  kernel reports the console geometry and cursor position using bytes which limits both to 255 maximum.  Conspy can usually guess the correct display size from the truncated version, but if the
       cursor position is beyond line 255 or column 255 conspy will put it in the wrong place.

       Conspy depends on terminfo and curses working correctly for your terminal, and sometimes they don't.  Konsole is/was one example of where they don't.  Typing  control-L  will  redraw  the  screen,
       which usually fixes the mess created.  It also sends a control-L to the virtual console, of course.

FILES
       /dev/ttyX, /dev/vc/X
              The characters typed are sent to this device.  The latter is for devfs. It is only used if the former does not exist.

       /dev/vcsaX, /dev/vcc/aX
              The display of the virtual console is read from here.  The latter is for devfs. It is only used if the former does not exist.
