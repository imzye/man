NAME
       cen64 - Cycle-Accurate Nintendo 64 Simulator

SYNOPSIS
       cen64 [Options] <PIF IPL ROM Path> [Cart ROM Path]

DESCRIPTION
       CEN64 is a new Nintendo 64 emulator which aims for perfect emulation by simulating the hardware inside the Nintendo 64 itself, down to the register-transfer level (RTL). It is still heavy un‐
       der development and currently does not have any sound emulation.

       Being a cycle-accurate emulator, CEN64 has considerably high hardware requirements to achieve passable performance when emulating most Nintendo 64 titles. However, similar to the higan emula‐
       tor,  the  cycle  accuracy  guarantess  very  high  compatibility and despite its early development stage, CEN64 already allows one to run several commercial titles without or with only minor
       glitches.

       As a distinctive feature among Nintendo 64 emulators, CEN64 offers emulation support for the 64DD external disk drive that was never released outside Japan and even there is considered  rare.
       Thus, CEN64 offers the unique possibility for anyone to play any of the rare titles that were exclusively released on the 64DD.

OPTIONS
       CEN64 currently supports only a very limited amount of options, a summary of these options is shown below.

       -debug [addr][:port]
              Starts the debugger on interface:port. By default, CEN64 uses localhost:64646.

       -profile
              Profile the ROM (cpu-side).

       -multithread
              Run in a threaded (but quasi-accurate) mode. This mode cannot be run with the debugger.

       -ddipl <path>
              Path to the 64DD IPL ROM (enables 64DD mode).

       -ddrom <path>
              Path to the 64DD disk ROM (requires -ddipl).

       -headless
              Run emulator without user-interface components.

       -noaudio
              Run emulator without audio.

       -novideo
              Run emulator without video.

       -is-viewer
              IS Viewer 64 present.

       -controller num=<1-4>
              Controller with no pak.

              Pak options:
                num=<1-4>,pak=rumble
                num=<1-4>,mempak=<path>
                num=<1-4>,tpak_rom=<path>,tpak_save=<path>

       -eep4k <path>
              Path to 4 kbit EEPROM save.

       -eep16k <path>
              Path to 16 kbit EEPROM save.

       -sram <path>
              Path to SRAM save.

       -flash <path>
              Path to FlashRAM save.
