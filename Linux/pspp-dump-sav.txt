NAME
       pspp-dump-sav - dissect SPSS system file

SYNOPSIS
       pspp-dump-sav [-d | --data[=maxcases]] file...
       pspp-dump-sav --help | -h
       pspp-dump-sav --version | -v

DESCRIPTION
       The  pspp-dump-sav program reads each SPSS system file file and prints its contents.  The output format is useful for debugging system file readers and writers and for discovering how to interpret un‐
       known or poorly understood records.  End users may find the output useful for providing the PSPP developers information about system files that PSPP does not accurately read.

OPTIONS
       -d[maxcases]
       --data[=maxcases]
              By default, pspp-dump-sav does not print any of the data in a system file, only the file headers.  Specify this option to print the data as well.  If maxcases is specified, then it  limits  the
              number of cases printed.

       -h
       --help Prints a usage message on stdout and exits.

       -v
       --version
              Prints version information on stdout and exits.

BUGS
       Some errors that prevent files from being interpreted successfully cause pspp-dump-sav to exit without reading any additional files given on the command line.
