NAME
       annex-to-annex-reinject - use 'git annex reinject' to redo annex-to-annex

VERSION
       version 0.008

SYNOPSIS
       annex-to-annex-reinject SOURCEANNEX DESTANNEX

DESCRIPTION
       Wrapper around git annex reinject --known, invoked in DESTANNEX, on the files in the git-annex objects dir of the SOURCEANNEX (usually SOURCEANNEX/.git/annex/objects).  After reinjecting files,
       the git-annex branch of SOURCEANNEX is updated so that it does not think the content is present there anymore.

       Suppose that you use annex-to-annex(1) to migrate files from ~/work to ~/old on your laptop, where each of ~/work and ~/old are git annexes.  Then on your USB backup drive, you can use this script
       to move the contents of migrated files from your clone of ~/work to your clone of ~/old:

           % annex-to-annex-reinject /media/spwhitton/usb/work /media/spwhitton/usb/old

OPTIONS
       None.
