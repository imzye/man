NAME
       xycpt - generate GMT colour palette table (cpt) files from column data.

SYNOPSIS
       xycpt [-b rgb] [-d] [-f rgb] [-h] [-n rgb] [-o file] [-r registration]
             [-u] [-v] [-V] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The xycpt program generates discrete or continuous cpt files from
       simple input describing sample values of the colour (or greyscale)
       range. The input consists of 1–4 columns. For 2 and 4 columns, the
       first column is interpreted as a (double) z value, for 1 and 3 the z
       value is taken implicitly. For 1 and 2 columns the final column will be
       taken as a greyscale value. For 3 and 4, the last 3 columns are taken
       as RGB values.

       The program will read from stdin if a file is not specified as the
       final argument, and write to stdout if the -o option is not specified.

OPTIONS
       In the following, all rgb specifications should be of the form
       red/green/blue where the colour components are integers in the range 0
       to 255.

       -b, --background rgb
           Set the background colour of the output.

       --backtrace-file path
           Specify a file to which to write a formatted backtrace. The file
           will only be created if there is a backtrace created, typically
           when an error occurs.

       --backtrace-format format
           Specify the format of the backtrace written to the files specified
           by --backtrace-file, one of plain, xml or json.

       -d, --discrete
           Output a discrete cpt file, the default is continuous.

       -f, --foreground rgb
           Set the foreground colour of the output.

       -h, --help
           Brief help.

       -n, --nan rgb
           Set the NaN (no data) colour of the output.

       -o, --output file
           Write the output to file, rather than stdout.

       -r, --registration string
           For discrete (using the -d option) conversion, specifies upper,
           middle or lower registration of the data value. For the upper and
           lower types the final (respectively the first) colour is omitted
           from the output; only the z value is used. For middle registration
           all the colours appear in the output.

       -u, --unit
           Colour values are specified as floating point numbers in the range
           0–1 rather than as integers in the range 0–255.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose operation.

       -V, --version
           Version information.
