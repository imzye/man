NAME
       Gendarme Defect To Ignore List

SYNOPSIS
       gd2i defects.xml list.ignore [--extra-check] [--syntax-check] [--quiet] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       gd2i is small tool to help you create, or update, an ignore-list baseline from an XML list of defects (generated by Gendarme).

OPTIONS
       defects.xml
              The, XML formatted, list of defects produced by Gendarme on your project.

       list.ignore
              The, text, file listing ignored defects entries for your project. If the file does not already exists (i.e. an update) then it will be created.  See gendarme(5) for the format of this file.

       --extra-check
              Report ignore entries, from an existing 'list.ignore' file, that does not match any defect, from the 'defects.xml' file.

       --syntax-check
              Report syntax error found when processing an existing 'list.ignore' file.

       --quiet
              Used to disable progress and other information which is normally written to stdout.

       --version
              Display the tool's version number. This will match the Mono version number that this copy of Gendarme was released with.

       --help Show help about the command-line options.

EXIT STATUS
       0      The tool returns 0 when no error has occurred.

       1      The tool returns 1 if some command-line parameter were not valid.

       2      The  tool  execution was interrupted by a non-handled exception. This is likely a bug inside the tool and should be reported on Novell's bugzilla (http://bugzilla.novell.com) or on the mailing-
              list.
