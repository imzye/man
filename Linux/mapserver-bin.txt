NAME
       sortshp - sort a Shape data set

SYNOPSIS
       sortshp [ infile outfile item [ascending | descending] | -v]

DESCRIPTION
       sortshp  sorts a Shape data set based on a single column in ascending or descending order. Supports INTEGER, DOUBLE and STRING column types. Useful for prioritizing shapes for rendering and/or la‐
       beling.

       The idea here is that if you know that you need to display a certain attribute classed by a certain value, it will be faster for MapServer to access that value if it is at the beginning of the at‐
       tribute file.

OPTIONS
       infile The name of the .shp file

       outfile
              The name of the .shp/.shx and .dbf files to create

       item   Name of the field to sort on

       ascending, descending
              Sort order (default: ascending)

       -v     Display mapserver version and build options.

EXAMPLE
       This example uses a roads file ('roads_ugl') that has a field with road classes in integer format ('class1').

              sortshp roads_ugl roads-sort class1 ascending

       Result:
              A new Shape data set named 'roads-sort.shp' is created with shapes sorted in ascending order, according to the values in the 'class1' field.
