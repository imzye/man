NAME
       cvsweb - a CGI interface to your CVS repository

SYNOPSIS
       http://localhost/cgi-bin/cvsweb/

DESCRIPTION
       cvsweb is a CGI script that offers convenient web access to your CVS repository. As such, you are unlikely to find it useful to run it by hand, and there are no command line options; instead visit
       the URL above.

FILES
       /etc/cvsweb/cvsweb.conf
              cvsweb configuration file. You must set up the location of your repositories here before the CGI script will work.

       /etc/cvsweb/cvsweb.conf-<symbolic_name>
              Per-CVSROOT configuration file.  <symbolic_name> must be the symbolic name given in @CVSrepositories in /etc/cvsweb.conf.
