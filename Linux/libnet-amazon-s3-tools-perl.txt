NAME
       s3get - Retrieve contents of S3 items

SYNOPSIS
       s3get [options]

       s3get [options] [ bucket/item ...]

        Options:
          --access-key    AWS Access Key ID
          --secret-key    AWS Secret Access Key
        Environment:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET

OPTIONS
       --help  Print a brief help message and exits.

       --man   Prints the manual page and exits.

       --verbose
               Output what is being done as it is done.

       --access-key and --secret-key
               Specify  the  "AWS Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.  --access-key is the "Access Key ID", and --secret-key is the "Secret Access Key".  These are effectively the "username" and
               "password" to the AWS account, and should be kept confidential.

               The access keys MUST be specified, either via these command line parameters, or via the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET environment variables.

               Specifying them on the command line overrides the environment variables.

       --secure
               Uses SSL/TLS HTTPS to communicate with the AWS service, instead of HTTP.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET
               Specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID contains the "Access Key ID", and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET  contains  the  "Secret  Access  Key".   These  are
               effectively the "username" and "password" to the AWS service, and should be kept confidential.

               The access keys MUST be specified, either via these environment variables, or via the --access-key and --secret-key command line parameters.

               If the command line parameters are set, they override these environment variables.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration options will be read from the file "~/.s3-tools" if it exists.  The format is the same as the command line options with one option per line.  For example, the file could contain:

           --access-key <AWS access key>
           --secret-key <AWS secret key>
           --secure

       This example configuration file would specify the AWS access keys and that a secure connection using HTTPS should be used for all communications.

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves S3 items, and outputs them to stdout.

BUGS
       Report bugs to Mark Atwood mark@fallenpegasus.com.

       Occasionally the S3 service will randomly fail for no externally apparent reason.  When that happens, this tool should retry, with a delay and a backoff.

       Access to the S3 service can be authenticated with a X.509 certificate, instead of via the "AWS Access Key Identifiers".  This tool should support that.

       It might be useful to be able to specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" in the user's "~/.netrc" file.  This tool should support that.

       Errors and warnings are very "Perl-ish", and can be confusing.

       Trying to access an item that does not exist or is not accessible by the user generates less than helpful error messages.

       Trying to retrieve a bucket instead of an item is silently skipped.

TODO
         option to write to files instead of stdout
         option to write to paths instead of stdout
         option to write to a tar file stream, for multiple items
         option to write extended file attributes based on S3 & HTTP metadata
         option to have a progress bar
