NAME
       genpyt - generate the PINYIN lexicon

SYNOPSIS
       genpyt lexicon-file result-file log-file slm-file

DESCRIPTION
       genpyt is used to generate the PINYIN lexicon.  It only works on zh_CN.UTF-8 locale.

ARGUMENTS
       lexicon-file
           Specify a dictionary file. It should be a line-based text file in utf-8 encoding . Each line looks like:

              CCC  id  [pinyin'pinyin'pinyin]*

           A default dictionary file can be found at /usr/share/sunpinyin/dict.utf8.

       result-file
           The output binary PINYIN lexicon file. This lexicon contains a trie presenting the key tree of PINYIN. And all of the candidate words are sorted using the unigram in slm-file. This file can be
           used with sunpinyin input method engines.

       log-file
           Specify the file to where the log goes. The log-file can be seen as the human-readble presentation of the binary output file.

       slm-file
           The language model from which the unigram information are retrieved. Typically, the slm-file is generated by slmthread.
