SECURITY
       pure-quotacheck switches real and effective uids/gids as soon as possi‐
       ble. Root privileges are never given back.
       pure-quotacheck  refuses to scan directories with uid = 0 (root) or gid
       = 0 (wheel/root) .
       pure-quotacheck performs a chroot() call  to  the  home  directory.  It
       never traverses parent directories.
       pure-quotacheck only scans real files (no socket, no pipe, etc) .
       pure-quotacheck  enforces read access on directories to prevent against
       people doing chmod 0 before a quota scan.
       pure-quotacheck enforces write access on the home directory to properly
       write the .ftpquota file.
       pure-quotacheck never scans the same inode/device pair twice.
