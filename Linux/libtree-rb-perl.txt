NAME
       Tree::RB::Node - A node class for implementing Red/Black trees

VERSION
       This document describes Tree::RB::Node version 0.500006

SYNOPSIS
           use Tree::RB;

           my $tree = Tree::RB->new;
           $tree->put('France'  => 'Paris');
           $tree->put('England' => 'London');

           my $node = $tree->delete('France'); # $node is a Tree::RB::Node object
           print $node->key; # 'France'
           print $node->val; # 'Paris'

DESCRIPTION
       A Tree::RB tree is made up of nodes that are objects of type Tree::RB::Node

INTERFACE
       A Tree::RB::Node object supports the following methods:

   new()
       Creates and returns a new node.

   key([KEY])
       Get/set the key of the node. This is what the nodes are sorted by in the tree.

   val([VALUE])
       Get/set the value of the node. This can be any scalar.

   color([COLOR])
       Get/set the color of the node. Valid colors are the constants RED and BLACK which are exported by Tree::RB::Node::_Constants

   parent([PARENT])
       Get/set the parent of the node, which must be another Tree::RB::Node object.

   left([NODE])
       Get/set the left child node of the node, which must be another Tree::RB::Node object.

   right([NODE])
       Get/set the right child node of the node, which must be another Tree::RB::Node object.

   min()
       Returns the node with the minimal key starting from this node.

   max()
       Returns the node with the maximal key starting from this node.

   leaf()
       Returns the first leaf node found starting from this node, using a depth first, left to right search.

   successor()
       Returns the node with the smallest key larger than this node's key, or "undef" if it is the node with the maximal key.

   predecessor()
       Returns the node with the greatest key smaller than this node's key, or "undef" if it is the node with the minimal key.

   as_lol([NODE])
       Returns a list of lists representing the tree whose root is either NODE if NODE is specified, or this node otherwise.

       This could be used for printing a tree, as the following snippet shows (this assumes that Tree::DAG_Node is also installed)

           use strict;
           use Tree::DAG_Node;
           use Tree::RB;

           my $t = Tree::RB->new;

           foreach (qw/the rain in spain falls mainly in the plains/) {
               $t->put($_, "${_} val");
           }

           my $tree = Tree::DAG_Node->lol_to_tree( $t->root->as_lol );
           $, = "\n";
           print @{ $tree->draw_ascii_tree };

       This will print

                             |
                          <B:rain>
                      /-------------------\
                      |                   |
                    <R:in>             <B:the>
               /-----------\            /------\
               |           |            |      |
           <B:falls>   <B:mainly>   <R:spain> <*>
             /---\    /------\        /---\
             |   |    |      |        |   |
            <*> <*>  <*> <R:plains>  <*> <*>
                           /---\
                           |   |
                          <*> <*>

   strip([$callback])
       Strips off all nodes under this node. If a callback is specified, it will be called once for each node that is detached, with the detached node as its sole argument.

DEPENDENCIES
       None.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.
