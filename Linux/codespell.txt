NAME
       codespell - detect spelling mistakes in source code

SYNOPSIS
       codespell [OPTIONS] [file1 file2 ... fileN]

DESCRIPTION
       codespell is designed to find and fix common misspellings in text files.  It is designed primarily for checking misspelled words in source code, but it can be used with other files as well.

       usage: codespell [-h] [--version] [-d] [-c] [-w] [-D DICTIONARY]

              [--builtin  BUILTIN-LIST]  [--ignore-regex  IGNORE_REGEX]  [--ignore-multiline-regex  IGNORE_MULTILINE_REGEX]  [-I  FILES] [-L WORDS] [--uri-ignore-words-list WORDS] [-r REGEX] [--uri-regex
              URI_REGEX] [-s] [--count] [-S SKIP] [-x FILES] [-i MODE] [-q LEVEL] [-e] [-f] [-H] [-A LINES] [-B LINES] [-C LINES] [--stdin-single-line] [--config CONFIG] [--toml TOML] [files ...]

   positional arguments:
       files  files or directories to check

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -d, --disable-colors
              disable colors, even when printing to terminal

       -c, --enable-colors
              enable colors, even when not printing to terminal

       -w, --write-changes
              write changes in place if possible

       -D, --dictionary DICTIONARY
              comma-separated list of custom dictionary files that contain spelling corrections. If this flag is not specified or equals "-" then the default dictionary is used.

       --builtin BUILTIN-LIST
              comma-separated list of builtin dictionaries to include (when "-D -" or no "-D" is passed). Current options are: - 'clear' for unambiguous errors - 'rare' for rare (but  valid)  words  that
              are likely to

       be errors
              - 'informal' for making informal words more formal - 'usage' for replacing phrasing with recommended

       terms  - 'code' for words from code and/or mathematics that

       are likely to be typos in other contexts (such as
              uint)

       - 'names' for valid proper names that might be typos
              - 'en-GB_to_en-US' for corrections from en-GB to en-US The default is 'clear,rare'.

       --ignore-regex IGNORE_REGEX
              regular  expression  that  is  used  to  find  patterns  to  ignore  by  treating  as whitespace. When writing regular expressions, consider ensuring there are boundary nonword chars, e.g.,
              "\bmatch\b". Defaults to empty/disabled.

       --ignore-multiline-regex IGNORE_MULTILINE_REGEX
              regular expression that is used to ignore text that may span multi-line regions. The regex is run with re.DOTALL. For example to allow skipping of regions of  Python  code  using  begin/end
              comments one could use: --ignore-multiline-regex '# codespell:ignore-begin *\n.*# codespell:ignore-end *\n'. Defaults to empty/disabled.

       -I, --ignore-words FILES
              comma-separated  list  of  files  that contain words to be ignored by codespell. Files must contain 1 word per line. Words are case sensitive based on how they are written in the dictionary
              file.

       -L, --ignore-words-list WORDS
              comma-separated list of words to be ignored by codespell. Words are case sensitive based on how they are written in the dictionary file.

       --uri-ignore-words-list WORDS
              comma-separated list of words to be ignored by codespell in URIs and emails only. Words are case sensitive based on how they are written in the dictionary file. If  set  to  "*",  all  mis‐
              spelling in URIs and emails will be ignored.

       -r, --regex REGEX
              regular expression that is used to find words. By default any alphanumeric character, the underscore, the hyphen, and the apostrophe are used to build words. This option cannot be specified
              together with --write-changes.

       --uri-regex URI_REGEX
              regular expression that is used to find URIs and emails. A default expression is provided.

       -s, --summary
              print summary of fixes

       --count
              print the number of errors as the last line of stderr

       -S, --skip SKIP
              comma-separated list of files to skip. It accepts globs as well. E.g.: if you want codespell to skip .eps and .txt files, you'd give "*.eps,*.txt" to this option.

       -x, --exclude-file FILES
              ignore whole lines that match those in the commaseparated list of files EXCLUDE. The lines in these files should match the to-be-excluded lines exactly

       -i, --interactive MODE
              set interactive mode when writing changes: - 0: no interactivity.  - 1: ask for confirmation.  - 2: ask user to choose one fix when more than one is

       available.
              - 3: both 1 and 2

       -q, --quiet-level LEVEL
              bitmask  that  allows  suppressing messages: - 0: print all messages.  - 1: disable warnings about wrong encoding.  - 2: disable warnings about binary files.  - 4: omit warnings about auto‐
              matic fixes that were

       disabled in the dictionary.
              - 8: don't print anything for non-automatic fixes.  - 16: don't print the list of fixed files.  - 32: don't print configuration files.  As usual with bitmasks, these levels can be combined;
              e.g. use 3 for levels 1+2, 7 for 1+2+4, 23 for 1+2+4+16, etc. The default mask is 34.

       -e, --hard-encoding-detection
              use chardet to detect the encoding of each file. This can slow down codespell, but is more reliable in detecting encodings other than utf-8, iso8859-1, and ascii.

       -f, --check-filenames
              check file names as well

       -H, --check-hidden
              check hidden files and directories (those starting with ".") as well.

       -A, --after-context LINES
              print LINES of trailing context

       -B, --before-context LINES
              print LINES of leading context

       -C, --context LINES
              print LINES of surrounding context

       --stdin-single-line
              output just a single line for each misspelling in stdin mode

       --config CONFIG
              path to config file.

       --toml TOML
              path to a pyproject.toml file.
