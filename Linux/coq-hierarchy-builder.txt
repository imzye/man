NAME
       coq.hb - Command line utility to apply patches generated by HB.

DESCRIPTION
       After building your project with logging enabled, eg

              COQ_ELPI_ATTRIBUTES='hb(log(raw))' make

       each  file.v  file contanining calls to HB is paired with a file.v.hb patch file which can be applied by this utility. You can also use COQ_ELPI_ATTRIBUTES='hb(log)' to get terms printed in a
       nicer, more compact, way but without all details they may not be parsable without manual editing.

   usage:
       hb patch [-f] <file.v>..
              Applies the patches in <file.v.hb> to <file.v>.  -f forces patch application even if the source file is newer than the patch.

       hb reset <file.v>..
              Erases all generated code from source file. It does nothing if the file is not patched. If a patch file <file.v.hb> exists it is renamed to <file.v.hb.old>.

       hb show <file.v.hb>..
              Lists all the patches contained in <file.v.hb> (debugging).

       Command line utility to apply patches generated by HB.
