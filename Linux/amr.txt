NAME
     amr — automake replacement

SYNOPSIS
     amr [-acmrshv]

DESCRIPTION
     AMR allows you to autogenerate sample/final Makefiles. This allows you to maintain all the makefiles of your project in a simple and centralized way. You'll probably need to use AMR for the initial port
     to acr for you applications.

     AMR is on early and experimental stage. So you'll probably find a lot of problems, bugs and missfeatures. Please feel free to documentate, and send patches and ideas for it.

USAGE
     AMR allows you to create different kind autogenerated ACR files: configure.amr, configure.acr, Makefile.acr.

     -a      Scan source code files recursively from the current directory and generates a configure.amr. Is recommended to run this command for each directory where you have source files. (acr -d)

     -c      Parses the configure.amr and prints out a sample configure.acr.

     -d      Reads the configure.amr and prints the directories where you'll need to run amr. You can easily automate this process in autogen.sh

     -m      Parses configure.amr to generate the Makefile.acr

     -s      Generate shellscripts instead of Makefiles.

     -r      Show report.

     -h      Show help message.

     -v      Prints the version number of AMR.
