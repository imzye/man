NAME
       checkapoppw - checks APOP password against the file ~/Maildir/.password

SYNOPSIS
       checkapoppw prog

DESCRIPTION
       checkapoppw reads descriptor 3 through end of file and then closes descriptor 3.  There must be at most 512 bytes of data before end of file.

       The  information  supplied  on descriptor 3 is a login name terminated by \0, a password terminated by \0, a timestamp terminated by \0, and possibly more data.  There are no other restrictions on the
       form of the login name, password, and timestamp.

       If the password is unacceptable, checkapoppw exits 1.  If checkapoppw is misused, it may instead exit 2.  If there is a temporary problem checking the password, checkapoppw exits 111.

       If the password is acceptable, checkapoppw runs prog.

       prog consists of one or more arguments.

Compatible tools
       There are other tools that offer the same interface as checkapoppw

       Note that these tools do not follow the getopt interface.  Optional features are controlled through (1) the tool name and (2) environment variables.

The password database
       checkapoppw checks the APOP password against the content of the file Maildir/.password (not encrypted) in the user's home directory corresponding to the login name.

       Maildir may be overidden through the environment variable $MAILDIR.

Process-state changes
       Before invoking prog, checkapoppw sets up $USER, $HOME, $SHELL, its supplementary groups, its gid, its uid, and its working directory.

FILES
       ~/Maildir/.password
