NAME
       nut - analyze meals with the USDA Nutrient Database

SYNOPSIS
       nut

DESCRIPTION
       NUT

       allows  you  to record what you eat and analyze your meals for nutrient composition.  Nutrient levels are expressed as a percentage of the DV or Daily Value,
       the familiar standard of food labeling in the United States.  The essential fatty acids, Omega-6 and Omega-3, are not currently mentioned in these standards,
       and a reference value has been supplied.

       NUT  uses  Tcl/Tk  to create an SQLite database that holds its own code, the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, and your personal data for meals,
       recipes, and weight logs.

       INSTALLATION and LOAD of USDA Database:

       If your desktop system does not have Tcl/Tk available, download and install the free (community) version of ActiveTcl from http://www.activestate.com/.

       Download the full ascii version of the USDA Nutrient Database, available from http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata or  from  http://nut.sourceforge.net,  and
       unzip it in some directory.

       Run  "update-nut", an executable included in the NUT distribution, in the same directory where you put the USDA database.  This script will load your new NUT
       database with the NUT code.  After this step, run "nut" to start NUT.  Initially, NUT will see the USDA tables and load them as well as any legacy files from
       previous versions of NUT.  After these steps, both "update-nut" and the USDA files are not required and can be deleted.

       "nut" can start the program with a different location for the NUT database and a different location for legacy files.  These changes are easily made by edit‐
       ing "nut".

       In addition, a value can be changed in "nut" to make the program usable on screens with a high resolution.  NUT will check how many pixels you have and  cre‐
       ate  a  font/window combination that is always legible.  Change the "appSize" variable in "nut" to between 0.7 (small) and 1.3 (almost fullscreen) to magnify
       the default Tk font and window sizes appropriately.

       OVERVIEW of PROGRAM

       A typical session with NUT begins with a glance at "Analyze Meals" to see the daily averages from the last few meals.  Normally, one analyzes more  than  one
       day but less than two weeks to get a fairly recent overview of nutritional quality and adherence to plan.

       "Record Meals & Recipes" is where meals are planned or else simply recorded if unplanned.  A slider can  either be moved directly or else clicked
        on the left or right to move backward or forward to get to the current meal.  A simple "Food Search" entry brings up the foods in the database and if one is
       selected, it is immediately added to the meal.  A major feature of NUT is to be able to associate meal foods with automatic portion control for  various  nu‐
       trients  so  you  can more easily plan meals that are both nutritionally complete and in accord with your personal regimen.  This function also allows you to
       save a "meal" as a recipe to be added to the USDA database, or to designate a meal as a Customary Meal for easier data entry later.

       "View Foods" shows comprehensive nutrient listings for each food, in serving sizes as described by the USDA nutrient database.  Any of  these  serving  sizes
       can be scaled and easily added to a meal, and NUT remembers your preferred serving sizes.

       "Personal Options" allows the nutrient standards to be changed.  These personal standards are customized and the rest of the program follows these standards.
       It is unlikely that the straight "Daily Value", a high-carb, low-fat diet with an absolute minimum of protein, will be optimal for you, so you can  try  dif‐
       ferent  program settings, experiment to see how you feel when eating different ways, and thus  gradually find the style of eating that is your personal opti‐
       mum.

       In addition, there is a facility to record weight and bodyfat percentages daily and see a linear extrapolation of the trend so that you do not have  to  wait
       weeks  to  know how a new strategy is working.  NUT will also automatically move calories up and down by gradual increments in order to keep lean mass up and
       fat mass down with the Calorie Auto-Set feature.

       Whenever you press a nutrient button you go to a screen that describes "The Story" for that nutrient.  This includes  various lists of foods sorted  to  help
       you find the nutrients you need.

       ANALYZE MEALS

       Meal analysis is always a daily rate of intake and not a sum.  For instance, if you eat 2000 calories a day and analyze a week of meals, the analysis reports
       2000 calories, not 14,000.  Likewise, if you eat three meals a day and 2000 calories a day and analyze a single meal of 667 calories,  the  analysis  reports
       100% of calories, not 33% of calories.  Think of NUT meal analysis as a speedometer, not an odometer.

       The range of meals shown on the screen controls many other functions in the program as it not only sets the range for showing  food lists, but also the exact
       Daily Values used in portion control.  Therefore, if you want automatic portion control to be as accurate as possible, analyzing just one meal while you  are
       planning meals is best,  although it is not required most of the time--just when you are changing strategies, such as from high-carb to low-carb.

       The  spin  button  controlling  how  many consecutive meals to analyze can be selected and cleared with a backspace to speed up making large changes.  A very
       large value will resolve to all the meals in the database, but do remember, if automatic portion control is in effect, there will be a lot of  processing  to
       get all of the program functions into sync because portion control always needs to reanalyze all meals until it is sure the requirements are properly met.

       RECORD MEALS & RECIPES

       For  the program analysis to come out right you must record all the meals the program is set for.  For instance, if NUT is set for three meals a day, and you
       eat more than three, combine them into three; if you eat less than three, record some minimal item such as an ounce of water for each missing meal.  In  this
       way,  even  if  you  take  breaks from recording, NUT will report fairly accurate daily averages and just concatenate over the breaks; but otherwise NUT will
       wrongly weight the meals as a wrong percentage of a day.

       When the program first starts, there is a button to "Delete all Meals and Set Meals per Day".  Although meals  are  deleted  from  view,  they  are  actually
       archived, so that if you return to the current number of meals per day, the meals will return to the active database.  If meal planning is not your forte, or
       if your meal schedules are highly irregular, set NUT to 1 meal per day and record a daily running total of all foods eaten.

       To actually record a meal, first determine if the slider in the upper left corner of the screen shows the correct meal; if not, click on the left or right of
       the  slider  to  nudge it one meal at a time in the right direction until the correct meal is showing.  Then click on the "Food Search" entry area to open up
       the search screen.  Type a part of a food name and all the foods that match will be shown below as you type.  Select one with a click and it will be added to
       the meal.

       You can specify quantities in either gram or ounce weights by adjusting the spin button, or by clicking on the food to open up "View Foods" so you can choose
       a serving size based on cups or some other volume measurement, but you can also let NUT set the quantity with "Auto Portion  Control".   To  achieve  portion
       control  based on calories, it is necessary to choose each of a protein, fat, and non-fiber carb food (unless some of these macronutrients are set to "Adjust
       to my meals").  But in addition, if you have noticed that you rarely achieve the "Daily Value" for some of the vitamins and minerals, they can also be chosen
       as  "Auto  Portion  Control" nutrients.  For instance, you could use Panto. Acid Auto Portion Control on something like mushrooms or avocado to make sure you
       get some of this vitamin.  In this manner, with a combination of portion-controlled foods and non-portion-controlled foods, you can plan a meal that  exactly
       meets your nutrition goals while hopefully being something you really want to eat.  When the Auto Portion Control algorithm is running, the "Food Search" en‐
       try area turns into an indeterminate progress bar and the food quantities flip around as they find the best possible solution.

       The more "Auto Portion Control" selections you make, the more complicated the process of finding the answer becomes,  some  combinations  become  impossible,
       and some combinations might send the algorithm off the deep end, in that it never completes.  Perhaps later versions of NUT will have a better way to predict
       what is going to happen.  For the time being, if you need a complicated solution using many portion-controlled foods, be ready to blow away the  window  run‐
       ning  NUT  and  start over if it doesn't work. And if a Tcl error message dialog appears, just click "OK", because the error is a transient consequence of an
       unexpected set of foods that cannot be portion controlled to the selected specification.  These problems will be rare occurrences as NUT is able to recognize
       many combinations of foods and portion-control settings that are not compatible.

       When you have a good meal planned and think you may want to repeat it, use the Customary Meals feature to save the meal.  Later, when you want something sim‐
       ilar, add the customary meal to the new meal you are planning.  If you add the same meal more than once, you don't double the foods, but you can refresh  the
       Automatic  Portion  Control  easily  by adding the meal again.  Likewise, you can save the meal multiple times without duplicating the meal foods.  Customary
       Meals can always be adapted to whatever you are going to have, by adding and deleting foods as required, and by changing quantities.

       Record a recipe in exactly the same way as a meal, but press the "Save  as a Recipe" button to add your recipe as a new food to  the  USDA  database.   Then,
       fill  in  the  blanks  with  the recipe name, the number of servings, any volume measurement you want to use to measure a serving, such as cups, teaspoons or
       pieces, etc., and if you know the weight of a serving after preparation, the recipe will be adjusted for water gained or lost in  preparation.   Furthermore,
       you will be presented with the complete nutrient screens so you can adjust the nutrient values.  This allows you to create a "recipe" that is actually just a
       processed food or food supplement, where the real ingredients are similar to the processed food or maybe just some water, but you are changing  the  nutrient
       .nfrmation  to  match  the label on a product.  On these recipe nutrient screens, the "Daily Value" percentages are the standard 2000 calorie values, not any
       modifications you may have made from "Personal Options", so that they will match the nutrition labels; however, nutrient values  can  always  be  entered  in
       grams.   When you "Save" this new recipe, it becomes just like any other food in the database.

       A  non-obvious  use for recipes is to add a new serving size to an existing food to make portion control easier.  Take one of my favorites, a roasted chicken
       wing.  The meat weighs 34 grams in an average wing but there is 40% refuse, meaning that the wing weighed on the bone comes to almost 57 grams  (34  /  0.6).
       So, you can make a recipe that is just a duplicate of the food with a slightly different name, but with a serving unit of "grams weighed with refuse" and the
       number of serving units in one serving is 56.67.  Then, at mealtime, if you need strict portion control, you go to "View Foods" and set a number of  servings
       corresponding to the weight of the wings on the bone and add it to the meal, and only the weight of the meat
        shows up in the meal.

       Yet another use for "Save as a Recipe":  Use it to quickly delete an entire meal, and then cancel the recipe.

       VIEW FOODS

       Here's  where  you  can  check out the whole nutritional record for a food based on whatever serving size you want to see represented.  Notice that many pro‐
       cessed foods have very brief summaries of nutrients with many "[No Data]" entries.  When added to meals, "[No Data]" is treated as a zero, and since nutrient
       values for specific foods vary considerably, analyses are always approximate and not nearly as precise as NUT seems to suggest.

       Additional  .nfrmation  on this screen includes refuse percentages and descriptions that can help in visualizing how much food is required, and serving sizes
       can be computed by calorie level as well as by weight.

       PERSONAL OPTIONS

       In the simplest case, you are just typing the number of grams of some nutrient that you want to ingest daily, or else clicking an option that will  automati‐
       cally  set  the  value  for you.  Because the spinbuttons move so slowly, for a big change you usually will select the old value with the mouse, backspace it
       out, and type the new value you want.   All of NUT is hooked together internally, so if your changes impact automatic portion control, there will be lots  of
       activity to get the meal and its analyses all in sync and save everything to the database.

       "Adjust  to  my  meals"  is  the  setting if you don't care what the value for a nutrient should be, or if you do care, but you manage the value by different
       means.  For instance, if you are eating low-carb, and you always plan meals to have minimal carbohydrate, "Adjust to my meals" means you don't have to hit  a
       particular carb target and yet everything will mesh properly as if you had set a carb target that was exactly equal to what is in your meals.

       Either  "Total  Fat" or "Non-Fiber Carb" can be set to "Balance of Calories" and sometimes this option will automatically appear if required in order to meet
       the Calorie requirement.

       The  options  for  polyunsaturated fat and the "Omega-6/3 Balance" target select reference values (there are no "Daily Values"  for   these)   based  on  Dr.
       William  Lands' empirical equation for the percentages of Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids in tissue phospholipids based on diet.  What this means is that the
       actual gram weights of Omega-6 vs. Omega-3 are not a very good indicator of what your body does with the fatty acids because the individual fatty acids  have
       different  "strengths" as they compete for conversion to the forms that make up the cell membrane and get chosen at random to provide a signal that is either
       strong  or  weak  in  its  effect  on  .nfammation,  blood  clotting,  etc.   Further  .nfrmation  about  this  biochemistry  is  on  the  NUT  site  at   <A
       HREF="http://nut.sourceforge.net/">http://nut.sourceforge.net/</A>.

       (Following  is  a description of the rightmost column on the screen that concerns the weight log.  At some lower screen resolutions, this column is partially
       occluded.  However, if you move the mouse over the imaginary line between the program settings and the weight log columns, there will appear a  double  arrow
       that you can click and drag to the left to bring the weight log column into full view.)

       NUT  records  daily  weight and bodyfat percentage measurements and uses linear regression to filter out the random noise and show the actual trend.  Are you
       gaining mostly fat mass or losing mostly lean mass?  This feature can tell you if you have a bathroom scale that can read  bodyfat  percentage.   The  weight
       measurement is free of units, so pounds, kilos, or even stone will work.  Although NUT reports its findings with high precision, realize that the numbers are
       not absolutely true, but you are concerned with the trends the numbers represent, so that you can modify your nutrition  strategy.   For  example,  if  total
       weight  is fairly constant but lean mass is going down and fat mass is going up, would a little more protein or less carbohydrate solve the problem? or would
       it make it worse?

       To use the feature, weigh yourself once a day at some appointed time and enter the weight and bodyfat numbers; then click on "Accept New Measurements".   NUT
       will  only  accept one set of measurements per day, but there is no harm in missing a day because the feature runs every day whether you add a measurement or
       not.  Think of each new set of measurements as a small correction to the equation to get a truer picture where you are going, and that's how you tell  if  it
       is  working, because its predictions eventually do seem to be about right.  Weight loss gurus often advise against daily weighing because they are afraid you
       will freak out on days weight goes up.  But NUT uses linear regression to remove the noise of daily measurement error and produce a clear  signal  which  way
       the  weight  is  trending, and the more daily samples, the stronger the signal.  This way you can find out more quickly that a particular strategy just isn't
       working.  Also, you can become more aware of weight loss strategies that work by reducing lean mass instead of fat mass.

       Calorie "Auto-Set" means that you will eat according to the calorie level that NUT shows and also record your weight and bodyfat percentage daily.   NUT  can
       then  determine  how best to move the calorie level to achieve gains in lean mass and loss of fat mass. A cycle begins when there are two weight/bodyfat data
       points recorded.  NUT will move calories by a maximum of 20 calories a day during a  cycle.  If both lean mass and fat mass are  trending  down,  NUT  raises
       calories;  if  both lean mass and fat mass are trending up, NUT lowers calories.  When fat mass is trending up and lean mass is trending down, NUT alternates
       between a cycle to prevent fat mass gain and a cycle to prevent lean mass loss.  A cycle ends when fat mass is trending down and lean mass  is  trending  up.
       (When a cycle begins with this favorable trend, it is allowed to continue.)  At the end of a cycle, the average calories per day during the cycle becomes the
       new calorie level, and this  change may be more than 20 calories from the previous calorie setting.

       If you are not using the Calorie Auto-Set feature, you can clear the weight log whenever you like; the usual reason would be that  you  have  started  a  new
       strategy  and  therefore want to see the new trend.   For instance, I tend to make five to seven days of measurements, check the numbers, move calories up or
       down as required, and then clear the weight log when I am trying to find the right calorie level for my latest experiment. The last weight log entry  is  al‐
       ways retained after clearing the weight log to enable a quicker start to the next cycle of logging.

       So,  should you use the Weight Log manually or use the Calorie Auto-Set feature?  I think the Calorie Auto-Set feature is best when you really do have to cut
       calories and would rather delegate the responsibility to NUT to avoid the psychological torture of having to cut yourself back.  And NUT can  slowly  improve
       your  body  composition  without  you  having to really think about it.  But do remember that you can always turn the feature off and refine your strategy if
       there is excessive hunger or other problems, or you can
        adjust the calorie level manually to speed up or slow down the progress of the Calorie Auto-Set algorithm.

       THE STORY

       When you click on a yellow nutrient button, you are taken to a tab that expounds the nutrient's story.  The screen features a list of foods sorted from  most
       to least of the nutrient of interest, and a simple graph of intake during the current analysis period that you set in "Analyze Meals".

       The  food  lists can be queried in multiple ways.  The basic queries are by weight, by calories, by an approximate serving, and by weight of food in the ana‐
       lyzed daily meals, but the results can be modified to only look at a single food group.  If you get a white screen after the "wristwatch" cursor changes back
       to  normal,  that  means  there  are  no foods that meet the criteria.  For instance, if I look at "Foods Ranked per Daily Recorded Meals" and the food group
       "Breakfast Cereals" but I have eaten no breakfast cereal, I will get a white screen.

       If a food from the list looks interesting, click on it so it will open up in "View Foods".

       USING THE SQLITE DATABASE APART FROM NUT

       This is an advanced topic that will be expanded as I receive  questions about it.  The SQLite3 database can be queried independently of the use  of  NUT  and
       indeed,  that is one reason I wrote this version of the software.  However, I doubt that knowledge of SQL is  widespread, so  first I will give an example of
       a question I asked my database:  What date did I have the greatest amount of lean mass and how much was it?

       The table we will use is "wlog", and first we are curious about the schema, or what data is in "wlog".  For this example, I will use the  "sqlite3"  commands
       that come with SQLite, but any third-party software for querying SQLite will work.

       I start up the software with the command "sqlite3 nut.sqlite" and get the output:

       SQLite version 3.7.13 2012-06-11 02:05:22
       Enter ".help" for instructions
       Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
       sqlite>

       If I need to be reminded what table I am looking for, I ask to see a list of all the tables:
       sqlite> .tables
       am                 fd_group           recipe             vf
       am_zero            food_des           rm                 vf_zero
       ar                 mealfoods          rm_zero            weight
       archive_mealfoods  meals              sql_statements     weightslope
       dv                 nut_opts           tcl_code           wlog
       dv_defaults        nutr_def           theusual
       fatslope           options            version

       (It should be noted that some of the views require Tcl procedures and thus can't be queried apart from NUT.)

       Now I ask what data is in the "wlog" table by asking to see the "schema":

       sqlite> .schema wlog
       CREATE TABLE wlog(weight real, bodyfat real, wldate int, cleardate int, primary key(wldate, cleardate));

       This is the exact SQL that created the wlog table.  Now I ask "what is the most lean mass I have had?"

       sqlite> select max(weight - weight * bodyfat / 100) as leanmass from wlog;
       125.1486

       (Don't be shocked if you think this is too low; I am not a bodybuilder or a big guy.)  Now I ask, "what was the date I had this much lean mass?"

       sqlite> select wldate from wlog where weight - weight * bodyfat / 100 = (select max(weight - weight * bodyfat / 100) from wlog);
       20110706

       Increasing  lean  mass  is  great, but as the sole measure of  body composition it leads to obesity; decreasing fat mass is great, but as the sole measure of
       body composition it leads to frailty.  What we need is an equation which increases in value as body composition improves.  Perhaps the simplest is lean  mass
       minus fat mass, or in other words, what is the "spread" between the lean mass and the fat mass quantities:

       sqlite> select wldate, round(weight - weight * bodyfat / 100, 1) as leanmass, round(weight * bodyfat / 100, 1) as fatmass, round(weight - 2 * weight * bodyfat / 100, 1) as bodycomp from wlog group by wldate;
       20150603|122.9|34.3|88.7
       20150605|123.4|33.2|90.2
       20150606|122.9|34.1|88.9
       20150607|123.2|33.2|90.1
       20150608|123.7|33.1|90.6
       20150609|123.2|33.8|89.5
       20150610|123.6|33.1|90.6
       20150611|124.0|33.4|90.7
       20150612|124.0|33.4|90.7
       20150613|123.9|33.1|90.7
       20150614|123.6|33.0|90.5
       20150615|123.9|32.3|91.5
       20150616|123.9|32.5|91.3
       20150617|124.2|32.4|91.8
       20150618|124.8|32.8|92.0
       20150619|125.3|32.3|93.0

       The  Calorie  Auto-Set feature alternates between cycles that potentially favor either lean mass gain or fat mass loss in the cases when fat mass is trending
       up and lean mass is trending down.  This is a switch you can manipulate, and it is the wlpolarity column in the table options.  "1"  means  favor  lean  mass
       gain, "0" means favor fat mass loss, and you would issue the command at the start of each Calorie Auto-Set cycle because the wlpolarity switches its state at
       the end of each cycle:

       sqlite> update options set wlpolarity = 1;

       Now, let's turn to a different task.  I've created a bad recipe and I want to delete it from the database.  First, I find the record in  the  food_des  table
       and ask to see  "NDB_No", the primary key for foods:

       sqlite> select NDB_No, Long_Desc from food_des where Long_Desc like '%ramen jello%';
       99008|Ramen jello toast, artisanal, with gelatin from pastured pork

       When I know the NDB_No, I can delete the food record from food_des and any associated weight records from weight:

       sqlite> delete from food_des where NDB_No = 99008;
       sqlite> delete from weight where NDB_No = 99008;

       Hopefully  you will never need to do this, but it is possible that automatic portion control could write a completely awry meal that NUT is unable to analyze
       when it tries to come up.  The only recourse then is to delete the meal from the database using the meal_date and meal number like this:

       sqlite> delete from mealfoods where meal_date = 20150413 and meal = 3;

       Although you can update some of the NUT data manually as in the previous examples, do note that if you update nutrient values in the food_des table, your up‐
       dates will not propagate to the existing meals in the meals table unless you reload the USDA nutrient database, this as a consequence of the table joins done
       at load time to improve performance at runtime.

       Now a question which was difficult to answer with the legacy NUT program but fairly easy to answer with SQL.  I was buying the most  expensive  eggs  because
       they  had  more Omega-3, but decided to use cheaper eggs and just take a little more fish oil.  What date did I change over?  First, I need the NDB_No of the
       expensive eggs:

       sqlite> select NDB_No, Long_Desc from food_des where Long_Desc like '%egg%' and Long_Desc like '%organic%';
       99010|Egg,yolk,raw,fresh,organic,brown,omega3,trader joe's
       99011|Egg,whole,cooked,hard-boiled,organic,brn,omega3,trader joe's

       I want to see just the raw yolks, and I want to query the "mealfoods" table, which holds the exact foods and quantities for each meal.  I know mealfoods  has
       a "meal_date" in addition to the NDB_No, so here's how I see the latest date I ate the expensive egg yolks:

       sqlite> select max(meal_date) from mealfoods where NDB_No = 99010;
       20140423

       Here's something you frugalvores might be interested in.  I added a table called "cost":

       sqlite> .schema cost
       CREATE TABLE cost (NDB_No int primary key, cost real, store text);

       The actual cost column is dollars per 100 grams of food and after I figure out the NDB_No for the food I set it with an insert command like this:

       sqlite> select NDB_No, Long_Desc from food_des where Long_Desc like '%romaine%';
       11251|Lettuce, cos or romaine, raw (Lactuca sativa var. logifolia)
       sqlite> insert into cost values (11251, 0.25841296, 'Smart & Final');

       This says that 100 grams of romaine lettuce costs about $0.25 when bought from Smart & Final.  Here's how I find my actual cost per day for the last week:

       sqlite> select meal_date, round(sum(mhectograms * cost),2) from mealfoods natural join food_des natural join cost group by meal_date order by meal_date desc limit 7;
       20150224|10.32
       20150223|10.16
       20150222|10.74
       20150221|10.04
       20150220|10.84
       20150219|10.6
       20150218|10.84

       A  "natural join" means you don't have to specify the columns you are using for a join between tables, and the database has been set up so that natural joins
       will work most of the time to get useful results.

       If I want to see the previous query every day but it is too much of a drag to type it in every time, I can create a view:

       sqlite> create view weeklycost as select meal_date, round(sum(mhectograms * cost),2) from mealfoods natural join food_des natural join cost group by meal_date order by meal_date desc limit 7;
       sqlite> select * from weeklycost;
       20150224|10.32
       20150223|10.16
       20150222|10.74
       20150221|10.04
       20150220|10.84
       20150219|10.6
       20150218|10.84

       Here's how I find which of the foods I buy is the cheapest source of copper (see below for how I know the copper column is named "CU"):

       sqlite> select Shrt_Desc, cost / CU as val from cost natural join food_des where val is not null order by val limit 1;
       Seeds, s.nfower seed kernels, dried (helianthus annuus)|0.332843857072932

       In the same vein, although not joinable to the other tables because it allows non-food items, if I need a shopping list:

       sqlite> .schema shopping
       CREATE TABLE shopping (n integer primary key, item text);
       sqlite> insert into shopping values (null, 'radishes');
       sqlite> insert into shopping values (null, 'salmon');
       sqlite> select * from shopping;
       1|radishes
       2|salmon

       Now a food question relevant to ketogenic diets:  How do the lettuces rate for maximum potassium per gram of non-fiber carb?

       sqlite> select NDB_No, Shrt_Desc, round(K / CHO_NONFIB) as val from food_des where Long_Desc like 'Lettuce%' order by val desc;
       11250|Lettuce,butterhead (incl boston&bibb types),raw|211.0
       11251|Lettuce, cos or romaine, raw (lactuca sativa var. logifolia)|208.0
       11257|Lettuce, red leaf, raw (lactuca sativa var. crispa)|138.0
       11253|Lettuce, green leaf, raw (lactuca sativa var. crispa)|124.0
       11252|Lettuce,iceberg (incl crisphead types),raw|80.0

       I've been experimenting with coconut oil on my ketogenic diet.  Sometimes I feel I've been having too much and I cut back and other times I feel I could  use
       more,  so I increase it, but I do not have any idea what amount of coconut oil per meal has seemed satisfactory most of the time.  I know the NDB_No is 4047,
       so what I am going to do is to make a list of how much coconut oil I had per meal for the various days and then count the occurrences of each amount  of  co‐
       conut  oil,  to see what were my most popular amounts of coconut oil per meal.  The first column is ounces of coconut oil and the second column is a count of
       the days when I had that much.  I can see that 1.1 ounces per meal (a little over 2 tablespoons) was my most common dosage per meal:

       sqlite> select val, count(meal_date) as ct from (select meal_date, round(sum(mhectograms / .2835 / 3.0),1) as val from mealfoods where NDB_No = 4047 group by meal_date order by val) group by val order by ct;
       0.1|1
       0.3|1
       0.2|3
       0.4|3
       0.9|3
       1.4|4
       0.6|5
       1.7|6
       0.7|7
       1.5|7
       0.5|10
       1.3|11
       1.6|11
       0.8|14
       1.2|18
       1.0|19
       1.1|27

       If you're interested in Omega-3 fatty acids, here's a view that does the computation that NUT uses, and then we can answer the  question  "What  (supposedly)
       was the percentage of Omega-6 in my tissue phospholipids during the summer of 2014?"

       sqlite> .schema n6hufacalc
       CREATE VIEW n6hufacalc as select meal_id, 100.0 / (1.0 + 0.0441 / (900 * SHORT6 / ENERC_KCAL) * (1.0 + (900 * SHORT3 / ENERC_KCAL) / 0.0555 + (900 * LONG3 / ENERC_KCAL) / 0.005 + (900 * (FASAT + FAMS + FAPU - SHORT6 - LONG6 - SHORT3 - LONG3) / ENERC_KCAL) / 5.0 + (900 * SHORT6 / ENERC_KCAL) / 0.175)) + 100.0 / (1.0 + 0.7 / (900 * LONG6 / ENERC_KCAL) * (1.0 + (900 * SHORT3 / ENERC_KCAL) / 3.0)) as n6hufa from meals;
       sqlite> select round(avg(n6hufa)) from n6hufacalc where meal_id between 2014060000 and 2014090000;
       57.0

       The  next  query  concerns  how non-fiber carb has varied in my diet, but I need to explain a few technicalities first.  If you compare the NUT tables to the
       USDA tables, you can see that NUT doesn't have the USDA's "nut_data" table which contains the nutrient values.  This is because the food_des and meals tables
       have columns that contain the nutrient values, and these columns are named after the corresponding "Tagname" column in the table nutr_def, the nutrient defi‐
       nitions.  For instance:

       sqlite> select Tagname, NutrDesc from nutr_def where NutrDesc = 'Non-Fiber Carb';
       CHO_NONFIB|Non-Fiber Carb

       So, "CHO_NONFIB" is the "Non-Fiber Carb" column in both food_des and meals.  The meals table contains the nutrient values for each meal; think of it  as  the
       sum  of  the  foods in the mealfoods table grouped by each meal.  But while mealfoods has a "meal_date" and "meal" column to identify a meal, the meals table
       has a single "meal_id" column which concatenates both meal_date and meal into a single 10-digit long integer:

       sqlite> select max(meal_id) from meals;
       2014100701

       This is meal #1 from October 7, 2014.  Using integer division using whole numbers only, I can divide to get just the year and month like this:

       sqlite> select max(meal_id) / 10000 from meals;
       201410

       So now here's the query to answer the question "What was my average non-fiber carb intake each month?"  Since I eat three meals a day  and  each  meal  is  a
       third of a day, I need to also multiply the average by three:

       sqlite> select meal_id / 10000, avg(CHO_NONFIB) * 3 from meals group by meal_id / 10000;
       201310|304.619325085423
       201311|308.119947531993
       201312|291.772580603746
       201401|324.492761802168
       201402|293.357125842871
       201403|226.452908082339
       201404|334.078889083876
       201405|346.338731816916
       201406|175.230665453905
       201407|53.8261328350621
       201408|20.2894606139836
       201409|17.1093763102545
       201410|20.3265642461782

       To  tie it all together, let's join this result to the wlog table to answer the question "How did my lean mass vary with these monthly carb levels?"  Because
       I am joining on a customized date representation, I can't use a natural join, and I have to spell out the whole syntax for joins to specify what is going  to
       be equal to what:

       sqlite> select m.meal_id / 10000, avg(m.CHO_NONFIB) * 3, avg(w.weight - w.weight * w.bodyfat / 100) from meals m join wlog w on m.meal_id / 10000 = w.wldate / 100 group by m.meal_id / 10000;
       201310|304.619325085423|120.8396
       201311|308.119947531993|119.149733333333
       201312|291.772580603746|119.1654
