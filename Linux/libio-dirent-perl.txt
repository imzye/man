NAME
       IO::Dirent - Access to dirent structs returned by readdir

SYNOPSIS
         use IO::Dirent;

         ## slurp-style
         opendir DIR, "/usr/local/foo";
         my @entries = readdirent(DIR);
         closedir DIR;

         print $entries[0]->{name}, "\n";
         print $entries[0]->{type}, "\n";
         print $entries[0]->{inode}, "\n";

         ## using the enumerator
         opendir DIR, "/etc";
         while( my $entry = nextdirent(DIR) ) {
           print $entry->{name} . "\n";
         }
         closedir DIR;

DESCRIPTION
       readdirent returns a list of hashrefs. Each hashref contains the name of the directory entry, its inode for the filesystem it resides on and its type (if available). If the file type or inode are
       not available, it won't be there!

       nextdirent returns the next dirent as a hashref, allowing you to iterate over directory entries one by one. This may be helpful in low-memory situations or where you have enormous directories.

       IO::Dirent exports the following symbols by default:

           readdirent

           nextdirent

       The following tags may be exported to your namespace:

           ALL

       which includes readdirent, nextdirent and the following symbols:

           DT_UNKNOWN
           DT_FIFO
           DT_CHR
           DT_DIR
           DT_BLK
           DT_REG
           DT_LNK
           DT_SOCK
           DT_WHT

       These symbols can be used to test the file type returned by readdirent in the following manner:

           for my $entry ( readdirent(DIR) ) {
               next unless $entry->{'type'} == DT_LNK;

               print $entry->{'name'} . " is a symbolic link.\n";
           }

       For platforms that do not implement file type in its dirent struct, readdirent will return a hashref with a single key/value of 'name' and the filename (effectively the same as readdir). This is
       subject to change, if I can implement some of the to do items below.

CAVEATS
       This was written on FreeBSD and OS X which implement a robust (but somewhat non-standard) dirent struct and which includes a file type entry. I have plans to make this module more portable and
       useful by doing a stat on each directory entry to find the file type and inode number when the dirent.h does not implement it otherwise.

       Improvements and additional ports are welcome.

TO DO
       •   For platforms that do not implement a dirent struct with file type, do a stat on the entry and populate the structure anyway.

       •   Do some memory profiling (I'm not sure if I have any leaks or not).
