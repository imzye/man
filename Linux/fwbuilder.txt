NAME
       fwb_compile_all - Wrapper script that compiles policies for multiple firewall objects

SYNOPSIS
       fwb_compile_all -ffile.xml [-dwdir] [-av] [obj[ obj ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       fwb_compile_all  is  a  wrapper  script that compiles policies for several firewall objects in one batch job. This script takes a list of firewall object names on the command line (or '-a' command
       line option, see below) and calls policy compiler for each one. The script correctly determines which policy compiler is needed depending on the firewall platform of each object.

OPTIONS
       -a     The script processes all firewall objects in the "/Firewalls" subtree.

       -d wdir
              Specify working directory.  Compiler creates file with iptables script in this directory.  If this parameter is missing, then iptables script will be placed in the  current  working  direc‐
              tory.

       -f FILE
              Specify the name of the data file to be processed.

       -v     Script passes this option to the compiler, this makes it print diagnostic messages indicating its progress.
