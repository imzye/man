NAME
       bf - yet another Brainfuck interpreter

SYNTAX
       bf [-h] [options] <filename>

DESCRIPTION
       bf ('Yet another Brainfuck interpreter') is a simple interpreter for the esoteric Brainfuck language.

OPTIONS
       -c<num>
              Specify the number num of the last cell you are allowed to use in your Brainfuck program.

              So if you use -c0 (or just -c), you'll have one cell (one byte in memory) to use on your tape.  Brainfuck interpreter by Urban Mueller used an array of 30000 bytes (-c29999).
              Our default value is 9999. Usually you need less.

       -i     Output Brainfuck code input to stderr.

              This feature is useful if you can't find out why some Brainfuck code doesn't work the way it should e.g. ignored loops, or a Brainfuck character within a comment.

              Note: Up to 32 +, -, < and > are summarized and displayed as only one. This feature was introduced in version 20040423.

       -n     Some Brainfuck contests specify a 0 byte as End Of Input. So -n translates a \n byte input into a 0 byte input. Disadvantage: the input can only consist of one line.

       -w     Disallow byte wrap-around. This causes errors if you try to decrement ('-') a 0x00 byte or to increment ('+') a 0xFF byte.

              This feature is useful if you want to take part in Brainfuck contests where such wrapping-around is disallowed.
              By default (without -w), incrementing 0xFF results in 0x00 and decrementing 0x00 results in 0xFF.

       -,<mode>
              Specify input mode. <mode> can be:

              0 (zero) Normal input using getchar(3).
              1 Single-char input. You won't see what you type.
              2 Single-char input. You will see what you type.
              3 The same as 1, but doesn't allow escape characters if compiled with slang.
              4 The same as 2, but doesn't allow escape characters, if compiled with slang. (recommended)

              Default is 0. (In some versions the default was 4.)

LIMITATIONS
       It's not allowed to '<' below the first cell.

       It's not allowed to '>' beyond the last cell.
