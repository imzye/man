NAME
       ipig - Integrating PSMs Into Genome browser visualizations

SYNOPSIS
       ipig <psm file> |-g|-c|-cg [<config file>]

DESCRIPTION
       iPiG  targets  the integration of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) from mass spectrometry (MS) peptide identifications into genomic visualisations provided by genome browser such as the UCSC genome
       browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).

       iPiG takes PSMs from the MS standard format mzIdentML (*.mzid) or in text format and provides results in genome track formats (BED and GFF3  files),  which  can  be  easily  imported  into  genome
       browsers.

OPTIONS
       <psm file>
              indicates the file with the peptide spectrum matches (mzid/txt)

       -g, -gui
              starts the graphical user interface of iPiG

       -c, -control
              starts the gene control, necessary files have to be indicated in the configuration file

       -cg, -controlgui
              starts the graphical user interface of the gene control

       -d, -downloader
              starts the download gui

       <config file>
              a different configuration file can be indicated (otherwise ipig.conf is loaded by default)

       additional requirements:

              using a non-gui mode, a config file (ipig.conf by default) has to contain several additional parameters, e.g. indicating the reference genome etc.

              in a gui mode (-g and -cg), additional parameters can be indicated two ways, within the interface or with a config file as well.

              have a look into readme.txt and ipig.conf for examples and more details about the additional parameters
