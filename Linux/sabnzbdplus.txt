NAME
       sabnzbdplus - a web-based binary newsgrabber with nzb support.

SYNOPSIS
       sabnzbdplus [-f <configfile>] [[...other options]] [NZB file(s)]

DESCRIPTION
       SABnzbd+  is  a web-based binary newsgrabber written in Python, with support for the popular nzb file format. It takes one or more nzb files as input and from there on does all the work, including
       fetching files from Usenet, checking file integrity, and unpacking. Configuration can be done via the web interface or in the configuration file.

       Multiple servers are supported, as well as secure (ssl) connections, ipv6, scheduling, pausing and resuming downloads, queue manipulation, rss feeds, nzb indexer integration, automatic sorting,  a
       download history, email notifications, and custom post-processing scripts. An extensive API allows third party applications to interact with the program.

USAGE
       To  run  the program execute sabnzbdplus, then point your favorite web browser to http://<host>:<port>. The host and port settings default to 127.0.0.1 and 8080, respectively; the default port for
       https connections is 9090.

       New nzb files may be queued for download by putting them in the watched directory, adding them via the web interface, or from rss feeds.
