NAME
       tunctl — create and manage persistent TUN/TAP interfaces

SYNOPSIS
       tunctl [-f tun-clone-device]  [-u owner]  [-t device-name]

       tunctl [-f tun-clone-device]  -d device-name

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tunctl command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in HTML format; see below.

       tunctl allows the host sysadmin to preconfigure a TUN/TAP device for use by a particular user.  That user may open and use the device, but may not change any aspects of the host side of the interface.

USAGE
       To create an interface for use by a particular user, invoke tunctl without the -d option:

       #
       tunctl -u someuser
       Set 'tap0' persistent and owned by 'someuser'

       Then, configure the interface as normal:

       #
       ifconfig tap0 192.168.0.254 up
       #
       route add -host 192.168.0.253 dev tap0
       #
       bash -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/tap0/proxy_arp'
       #
       arp -Ds 192.168.0.253 eth0 pub

       To delete the interface, use the -d option:

       #
       tunctl -d tap0
       Set 'tap0' nonpersistent
