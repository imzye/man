NAME
       nrattach - Start a NET/ROM interface

SYNOPSIS
       nrattach [-i inetaddr] [-m mtu] [-v] port

DESCRIPTION
       Nrattach  takes many of the parameters for the port from the nrports(5)
       file. The paclen parameter is used for the device mtu unless overridden
       by a value on the command line. The port argument is the name of a port
       as given in the nrports(5) file.

       Nrattach tries to find the first free NET/ROM device in the system. The
       devices  checked  are  nr0,  nr1, nr2 and nr3 in that order. If no free
       NET/ROM device is available an error is generated and the program  ter‐
       minates.

OPTIONS
       -i inetaddr     Set the internet address of the interface. This address
                       may either be a dotted decimal address or a host name.

       -m mtu          Sets the mtu of the interface. If  this  value  is  not
                       given then the value is taken from the paclen parameter
                       in nrports.

       -v              Display the version.

SEE ALSO
       netrom(4), nrparms(4), nrports(5), ifconfig(8).

BUGS
       The program can be run many times with the same arguments creating many
       instances of the same attributes on different devices. Not a good idea.
