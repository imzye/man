NAME
       lambda2_searchp - the Local Aligner for Massive Biological DatA

SYNOPSIS
       lambda2 searchp [OPTIONS] -q QUERY.fasta -i INDEX.lambda [-o output.m8]

DESCRIPTION
       Lambda is a local aligner optimized for many query sequences and searches in protein space. It is compatible to BLAST, but much faster than BLAST and many other comparable tools.

       Detailed information is available in the wiki: <https://github.com/seqan/lambda/wiki>

       -v, --verbosity INTEGER
              Display more/less diagnostic output during operation: 0 [only errors]; 1 [default]; 2 [+run-time, options and statistics]. In range [0..2]. Default: 1.

   Input Options:
       -q, --query INPUT_FILE
              Query  sequences. Valid filetypes are: .sam[.*], .raw[.*], .gbk[.*], .frn[.*], .fq[.*], .fna[.*], .ffn[.*], .fastq[.*], .fasta[.*], .faa[.*], .fa[.*], .embl[.*], and .bam, where * is any of
              the following extensions: gz, bz2, and bgzf for transparent (de)compression.

       -a, --input-alphabet STRING
              Alphabet of the query sequences (specify to override auto-detection). Dna sequences will be translated. One of auto, dna5, and aminoacid. Default: auto.

       -g, --genetic-code INTEGER
              The translation table to use if input is Dna. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi?mode=c for ids. Default is to use the same table that was used for  the  index  or
              1/CANONICAL if the index was not translated. Default: 0.

       -i, --index INPUT_DIRECTORY
              The database index (created by the 'lambda mkindexp' command). Valid filetype is: .lambda.

   Output Options:
       -o, --output OUTPUT_FILE
              File  to  hold reports on hits (.m* are blastall -m* formats; .m8 is tab-separated, .m9 is tab-separated with with comments, .m0 is pairwise format). Valid filetypes are: .sam[.*], .m9[.*],
              .m8[.*], .m0[.*], and .bam, where * is any of the following extensions: gz, bz2, and bgzf for transparent (de)compression. Default: output.m8.

       --output-columns STRING
              Print specified column combination and/or order (.m8 and .m9 outputs only); call -oc help for more details. Default: std.

       --percent-identity INTEGER
              Output only matches above this threshold (checked before e-value check). In range [0..100]. Default: 0.

       -e, --e-value DOUBLE
              Output only matches that score below this threshold. In range [0..100]. Default: 1e-04.

       --bit-score DOUBLE
              Output only matches that score above this threshold. In range [0..1000]. Default: 0.

       -n, --num-matches INTEGER
              Print at most this number of matches per query. In range [1..10000]. Default: 256.

       --sam-with-refheader BOOL
              BAM files require all subject names to be written to the header. For SAM this is not required, so Lambda does not automatically do it to save space (especially for protein database this  is
              a lot!). If you still want them with SAM, e.g. for better BAM compatibility, use this option. One of 1, ON, TRUE, T, YES, 0, OFF, FALSE, F, and NO. Default: off.

       --sam-bam-seq STRING
              For  BLASTX  and  TBLASTX  the  matching protein sequence is "untranslated" and positions retransformed to the original sequence. For BLASTP and TBLASTN there is no DNA sequence so a "*" is
              written to the SEQ column. The matching protein sequence can be written as an optional tag, see --sam-bam-tags. If set to uniq than the sequence is omitted iff it is identical to the previ‐
              ous match's subsequence. One of always, uniq, and never. Default: uniq.

       --sam-bam-tags STRING
              Write the specified optional columns to the SAM/BAM file. Call --sam-bam-tags help for more details. Default: AS NM ae ai qf.

       --sam-bam-clip STRING
              Whether to hard-clip or soft-clip the regions beyond the local match. Soft-clipping retains the full sequence in the output file, but obviously uses more space. One of hard  and  soft.  De‐
              fault: hard.

   General Options:
       -t, --threads INTEGER
              number of threads to run concurrently. Default: autodetected.

   Seeding / Filtration:
       --adaptive-seeding BOOL
              Grow the seed if it has too many hits (low complexity filter). One of 1, ON, TRUE, T, YES, 0, OFF, FALSE, F, and NO. Default: on.

       --seed-length INTEGER
              Length of the seeds. In range [3..50]. Default: 10.

       --seed-offset INTEGER
              Offset for seeding (if unset = seed-length/2). In range [1..50]. Default: 5.

       --seed-delta INTEGER
              maximum seed distance. In range [0..1]. Default: 1.

       --seed-delta-increases-length BOOL
              Seed delta increases the min. seed length (for affected seeds). One of 1, ON, TRUE, T, YES, 0, OFF, FALSE, F, and NO. Default: off.

       --seed-half-exact BOOL
              Allow errors only in second half of seed. One of 1, ON, TRUE, T, YES, 0, OFF, FALSE, F, and NO. Default: on.

   Miscellaneous Heuristics:
       --pre-scoring INTEGER
              evaluate  score of a region NUM times the size of the seed before extension (0 -> no pre-scoring, 1 -> evaluate seed, n-> area around seed, as well; default = 1 if no reduction is used). In
              range [1..10]. Default: 2.

       --pre-scoring-threshold DOUBLE
              minimum average score per position in pre-scoring region. In range [0..20]. Default: 2.

       --filter-putative-duplicates BOOL
              filter hits that will likely duplicate a match already found. One of 1, ON, TRUE, T, YES, 0, OFF, FALSE, F, and NO. Default: on.

       --filter-putative-abundant BOOL
              If the maximum number of matches per query are found already, stop searching if the remaining realm looks unfeasible. One of 1, ON, TRUE, T, YES, 0, OFF, FALSE, F, and NO. Default: on.

       --merge-putative-siblings BOOL
              Merge seed from one region, stop searching if the remaining realm looks unfeasable. One of 1, ON, TRUE, T, YES, 0, OFF, FALSE, F, and NO. Default: on.

   Scoring:
       -s, --scoring-scheme INTEGER
              use '45' for Blosum45; '62' for Blosum62 (default); '80' for Blosum80. Default: 62.

       --score-gap INTEGER
              Score per gap character. In range [-1000..1000]. Default: -1.

       --score-gap-open INTEGER
              Additional cost for opening gap. In range [-1000..1000]. Default: -11.

   Extension:
       -x, --x-drop INTEGER
              Stop Banded extension if score x below the maximum seen (-1 means no xdrop). In range [-1..1000]. Default: 30.

       -b, --band INTEGER
              Size of the DP-band used in extension (-3 means log2 of query length; -2 means sqrt of query length; -1 means full dp; n means band of size 2n+1) In range [-3..1000]. Default: -3.

       -m, --extension-mode STRING
              Choice of extension algorithms. One of auto, xdrop, and fullSerial. Default: auto.

TUNING
       Tuning the seeding parameters and (de)activating alphabet reduction has a strong influence on both speed and sensitivity. We recommend the following alternative profiles for protein searches:

       fast (high similarity):       --seed-delta-increases-length on

       sensitive (lower similarity): --seed-offset 3
