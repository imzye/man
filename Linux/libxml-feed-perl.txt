NAME
       XML::Feed::Entry - Entry/item in a syndication feed

SYNOPSIS
           ## $feed is an XML::Feed object.
           for my $entry ($feed->entries) {
               print $entry->title, "\n", $entry->summary, "\n\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       XML::Feed::Entry represents an entry/item in an XML::Feed syndication feed.

USAGE
   XML::Feed::Entry->new($format)
       Creates a new XML::Feed::Entry object in the format $format, which should be either RSS or Atom.

   $entry->convert($format)
       Converts the XML::Feed::Entry object into the $format format, and returns the new object.

   $entry->title([ $title ])
       The title of the entry.

   $entry->base([ $base ])
       The url base of the entry.

   $entry->link([ $uri ])
       The permalink of the entry, in most cases, except in cases where it points instead to an offsite URI referenced in the entry.

   $entry->content([ $content ])
       An XML::Feed::Content object representing the full entry body, or as much as is available in the feed.

       In RSS feeds, this method will look first for <http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/#encoded> and <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml#body> elements, then fall back to a <description> element.

   $entry->summary([ $summary ])
       An XML::Feed::Content object representing a short summary of the entry.  Possibly.

       Since RSS feeds do not have the idea of a summary separate from the entry body, this may not always be what you want. If the entry contains both a <description> element and another element
       typically used for the full content of the entry--either http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/body or <http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/#encoded>--we treat that as the summary. Otherwise, we assume
       that there isn't a summary, and return an XML::Feed::Content object with an empty string in the body.

   $entry->category([ $category ])
       The category in which the entry was posted.

       Returns a list of categories if called in array context or the first category if called in scalar context.

       WARNING It's possible this API might change to have an add_category instead.

   $entry->tags([ $tag ])
       A synonym (alias) for category;

   $entry->author([ $author ])
       The name or email address of the person who posted the entry.

   $entry->id([ $id ])
       The unique ID of the entry.

   $entry->issued([ $issued ])
       A DateTime object representing the date and time at which the entry was posted.

       If present, $issued should be a DateTime object.

   $entry->modified([ $modified ])
       A DateTime object representing the last-modified date of the entry.

       If present, $modified should be a DateTime object.

   $entry->wrap
       Take an entry in its native format and turn it into an XML::Feed::Entry object.

   $entry->unwrap
       Take an XML::Feed::Entry object and turn it into its native format.
