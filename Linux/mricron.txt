NAME
       mricron - magnetic resonance image conversion, viewing and analysis

DESCRIPTION
       MRIcron  is  a GUI-based visualization and analysis tool for (functional) magnetic resonance imaging. MRIcron can be used to create 2D or 3D renderings of statistical overlay maps on brain anatomy
       images. Moreover, it aids drawing anatomical regions-of-interest (ROI), or lesion mapping, as well as basic analysis of functional timeseries (e.g. creating plots of peristimulus signal-change).
