NAME
       POE::Component::SSLify::ServerHandle - Server-side handle for SSLify

VERSION
         This document describes v1.012 of POE::Component::SSLify::ServerHandle - released November 14, 2014 as part of POE-Component-SSLify.

DESCRIPTION
               This is a subclass of Net::SSLeay::Handle because their read() and sysread()
               does not cooperate well with POE. They block until length bytes are read from the
               socket, and that is BAD in the world of POE...

               This subclass behaves exactly the same, except that it doesn't block :)

   DIFFERENCES
               This subclass doesn't know what to do with PRINT/READLINE, as they usually are not used in POE::Wheel operations...
