SYNOPSIS
       ohcount [option] [paths...]

DESCRIPTION
       Ohloh source code line counter command line tool.

              http://www.ohloh.net/

   [option] can be one of the following:

       -a, --annotate

       -d, --detect

       -h, --help

       -i, --individual

       -re

       -s, --summary

       -a, --annotate                  Show annotated source code

              The  contents  of  all  source  code  files found within the given paths will be emitted to stdout. Each line will be prefixed with a tab-delimited language name and semantic categorization
              (code, comment, or blank).

       -d, --detect                    Find source code files

              Recursively find all source code files within the given paths.  For each source code file found, the file name will be emitted to stdout prefixed with a tab-delimited language name.

       -h, --help                      Display this message

       -i, --individual                Count lines of code per file

              Count lines in all source code files within the given paths, and emit a report of the lines of code, comments, and blanks in each language per file.

       -l, --license

              Displays detected licensing information contained in each source code file.

       -re

              Prints raw entity information to the screen (mainly for debugging).

       -s, --summary                   Count lines of code (default)

              Count lines in all source code files within the given paths, and emit a report of the total number of lines of code, comments, and blanks in each language. This is the default action.

       [paths] can refer to any number of individual files or directories.

              Directories will be probed recursively. If no path is given, the current directory will be used.
