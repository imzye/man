NAME
       unihexfill - Generate range of Unifont 4- or 6-digit hexadecimal glyphs

SYNOPSIS
       unihexfill < unassigned-ranges.txt > filler-glyphs.hex

DESCRIPTION
       unihexfill is a shell script that reads a list of code point ranges from STDIN and produces filler glyphs of 4- or 6-digit code points on STDOUT.

       The  format of the input file is a combination of comment lines, single code points on a line, and start/stop pairs of code points on a line separated by a space.  Comment lines start with a semicolon
       (';') by convention.  Start and stop code points are strings of hexadecimal digits, by convention either four or six digits.

       unihexfill invokes unihexgen for each non-comment line in its input file.  If a codepoint is less than or equal to "FFFF" (i.e., 0xFFFF), a four-digit hexadecimal number is encoded within  the  corre‐
       sponding Unifont glyph as two digits on each of two rows.  Otherwise, a six-digit hexadecimal number is encoded as three digits on each of two rows.

OPTIONS
       There are no options.

FILES
       *.txt as input; *.hex as output.

EXAMPLE
       In the Unifont source package, the file font/plane01/Makefile generates Unicode Plane 1 hexadecimal filler glyphs of unassigned code points within assigned scripts with this single-line command:

              ../../bin/unihexfill < unassigned-ranges.txt > unassigned.hex

BUGS
       No known real bugs exist, except that this software does not perform extensive error checking on its input file.  Any line that appears to begin with a hexadecimal digit is fed to unihexgen.
