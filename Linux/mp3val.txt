NAME
       MP3val - A program for MPEG audio stream validation

SYNOPSIS
       mp3val [-l <log_file>] [-f] [-si] [-p] [-v] <files to validate>

DESCRIPTION
       MP3val  is  a small, high-speed tool for MPEG audio files validation and (optionally) fixing problems. It was primarily designed for verification of MPEG 1 Layer III (MP3) files, but supports also
       other MPEG versions and layers. It can be useful for finding corrupted files (e.g. incompletely downloaded).

OPTIONS
       -l <log_file>
              Log file name. If this argument is missing, all the information will be written to stdout.

       -f     Try to fix errors.

       -si    Suppress INFO messages.

       -p     Pipe mode (receive input file names from stdin). Intended for interaction with frontends. <files to validate> is ignored in this case.

       -v     Print version and exit
