NAME
       praat-open-files - Open sound files with Praat

SYNOPSIS
       praat-open-files [–new] [–wait=secs] file [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The praat-open-files command allows one to open of sound files with praat from the command line.  Any file type recognized by Praat (WAV, FLAC, MP3, etc) can be given as arguments.

OPTIONS
       --new  Launch a new instance of praat for viewing and editing the sound files.  By default, praat-open-files try to open the files in an running praat program, and fails if there is none.

              system, specify another value with the –wait option.

              praat-open-files file.wav relative/path/file.flac /absolute/path/file.mp3

       Open the three specified files with individual View & Edit windows for each one on a running instance of praat.
