              Because the argument to this option

              is rather large (up to 500 bytes) the recommended way to set this option is in the .xpilotrc file in your home directory.  The exact format is defined in the file doc/README.SHIPS in the XPilot
              distribution.  Note  that there is a nifty Unix tool called editss for easy ship creation. There is XPShipEditor for Windows and Ship Shaper for Java.  See the XPilot FAQ for details.  See also

              xpilot -shipShape myshipshapename
