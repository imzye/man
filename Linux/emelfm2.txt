NAME
       emelFM2 - a GTK2+ file manager

SYNOPSIS
       emelfm2 [OPTION]... [DIR]

DESCRIPTION
       emelFM2  is  a  file manager for UNIX-like operating systems. It uses a
       simple and efficient interface pioneered by  Norton  Commander  in  the
       1980's.  The main window is divided into three "panes" or "panels". Two
       of them show information about the contents of selected filesystem  di‐
       rectories.  That information is presented as text. The third pane shows
       the output of commands executed within the program.

       A built-in command-line, toolbar buttons or assigned keys can  be  used
       to initiate commands. A flexible filetyping mechanism provides user-de‐
       termined actions for desired filetypes.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -1,--one= DIR
              At session-start, show DIR in the first filelist pane.

       -2,--two= DIR
              At session-start, show DIR in the second filelist pane.

       DIR    Same as -2 DIR, except pane 2 is focused.

       -c,--config= DIR
              Set the configuration-data directory to  DIR  (default:  ~/.con‐
              fig/emelfm2).

       -a,--share-config= DIR
              Also  load configuration-data from directory DIR. Session config
              data are not saved to DIR.

       -e,--encoding= TYPE
              Set the filesystem character encoding to TYPE.

       -f,--fallback-encoding= TYPE
              Set the fallback encoding to TYPE (default: ISO-8859-1).

       -i,--ignore-problems
              Ignore the encoding/locale problems (use at your own risk!).

       -l,--log-all
              Maximise GTK+2 error logging.

       -m,--daemon
              Detach the emelFM2 session from its controlling  terminal.  Will
              not work when emelFM2 is compiled with debug support.

       -r,--run-at-start= COMMAND
              Run COMMAND immediately after session start.

       -s,--set-option OPTION_NAME=string-value
              Set  one-line  config  option.  "OPTION_NAME=string-value"  is a
              string in the format used in the config file.

       -t,--trash= DIR
              Set   the   trash   directory   to    DIR    (default:    ~/.lo‐
              cal/share/Trash/files).

       -u,--user
              Flag displayed username.

       Help options:

       -b,--build
              Display build-time parameters.

       -h,--help
              Display a brief help message.

       -v,--version
              Display the version and build information.

       These only work when emelFM2 is compiled with debug support:

       -d,--debug= N
              Set  the  debug level. N = digit from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
              Default is 5.

       -x,--verbose
              Display time and location information in  debug  messages.  Only
              works when emelFM2 is compiled with debug support.
