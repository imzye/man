NAME
       ChromImpute - Large-scale systematic epigenome imputation

SYNOPSIS
       java -Xmx[GB]g -jar /usr/share/java/chromimpute.jar [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ChromImpute  is software for large-scale systematic epigenome imputation.  ChromImpute takes an existing compendium of epigenomic data and uses it to predict signal tracks for mark-sample combina‐
       tions not experimentally mapped or to generate a potentially more robust version of data sets that have been mapped experimentally. ChromImpute bases its predictions on features from signal tracks
       of other marks that have been mapped in the target sample and the target mark in other samples with these features combined using an ensemble of regression trees.

OPTIONS
       Convert
              Converts signal tracks into binned signal resolution tracks.

       ComputeGlobalDist
              Computes the global distance based on correlation for each mark in each sample with the same mark in all other samples. Creates a file for each mark in each sample containing a ranked  list
              of the globally nearest samples.

       GenerateTrainData
              This command takes a directory of converted data and global distances and generates a set of training data instances.

       Train  This command trains regression trees based on the feature data produced by GenerateTrainData.

       Apply  This command applies the predictors generated in the Train command to generate the imputed data.

       Eval   Compares the agreement between an observed and imputed data set.

       Version
              Give the version of ChromImpute.
