NAME
       mda-lmtp - MDA that uses LMTP to do the mail delivery

SYNOPSIS
       mda-lmtp [-addr_network net] -addr addr -d recipient -f from

DESCRIPTION
       mda-lmtp is a very basic MDA that uses LMTP to do the mail delivery.

       It takes command line arguments similar to maildrop or procmail, reads an email via standard input, and sends it over the given LMTP server.  Supports connecting to LMTP servers over UNIX sockets and
       TCP.

       It can be used when your mail server does not support LMTP directly.

EXAMPLE
       mda-lmtp --addr=localhost:1234 -f juan@casa -d jose < email
