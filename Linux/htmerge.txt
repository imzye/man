NAME
       htmerge - create document index and word database for the ht://Dig search engine

SYNOPSIS
       htmerge [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Htmerge is used to create a document index and word database from the files that were created by htdig. These databases are then used by htsearch to perform the actual searched.

OPTIONS
       -a     Use  alternate work files. Tells htdig to append .work to database files, causing a second copy of the database to be built. This allows the original files to be used by htsearch during the in‐
              dexing run.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -d     Prevent the document index from being created.

       -s     Print statistics about the document and word databases after htmerge has finished.

       -v     Run in verbose mode. This will provide some hints as to the progress of the merge. This can be useful when running htmerge interactively since some parts (especially the word database creation)
              can take a very long time.

       -w     Prevent the word database from being created.

ENVIRONMENT
       TMPDIR In addition to the command line options, the environment variable TMPDIR will be used to designate the directory where intermediate files are stored during the sorting process.

FILES
       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.
