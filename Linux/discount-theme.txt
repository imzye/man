NAME
     theme — create a web page from a template file

SYNOPSIS
     theme [-C option-flags] [-c options] [-d root] [-E] [-f] [-o file] [-p pagename] [-t template] [-V] [textfile]

DESCRIPTION
     The theme utility takes a markdown(7)-formatted textfile (or stdin if not specified,) compiles it, and combines it with a template (page.theme by default) to produce a web page.   If a path to the tem‐
     plate is not specified, theme looks for page.theme in the current directory, then each parent directory up to the document root (set with -d or, if unset, the root directory of the system.)  If
     page.theme is found, theme copies it to the output, looking for <?theme action?> html tags and processing the embedded action as appropriate.

     theme processes the following actions:

     author    Prints the author name(s) from the mkd_doc_author(3) function.

     body      Prints the formatted markdown(7) input file.

     date      Prints the date returned by mkd_doc_date(3) or, if none, the date the input file was last modified.

     dir       Prints the directory part of the pagename

     include(file)
               Prints the contents of file.  Markdown(7) translation will NOT be done on this file.

     source    The filename part of the pagename.

     style     Print any stylesheets (see mkd-extensions(7)) found in the input file.

     title     Print the title returned by mkd_doc_title(3), or, if that does not exist, the source filename.

     version   Print the version of discount(7) that this copy of theme was compiled with.

     If input is coming from a file and the output was not set with the -o option, writes the output to file-sans-text.html (if) file has a .text suffix, that will be stripped off and replaced with .html;
     otherwise a .html will be appended to the end of the filename.)

     The options are as follows:

     -d root  Set the document root to root

     -E       Normally theme will not expand <?theme body?> or <?theme toc?> in the <head> section, or <?theme style?> in the <body> section, but the -E option overrides this and allows expansions every‐
              where.

     -f       Forcibly overwrite existing html files.

     -o filename
              Write the output to filename.

     -p path  Set the pagename to path.

     -t filename
              Use filename as the template file.

RETURN VALUES
     The theme utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
