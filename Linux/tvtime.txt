NAME
       stationlist.xml - tvtime station configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.tvtime/stationlist.xml

DESCRIPTION
       The  stationlist.xml file contains the configuration of channel information for capture cards with tuners.  It contains a list of active channels along with their frequencies, renumbering informa‐
       tion, and channel name.  The stationlist.xml file is updated by tvtime at runtime to store settings across sessions.  For this reason, you should not edit this file while  tvtime  is  running,  as
       your changes may be overwritten.

       This  file  is  created  or updated whenever channel information is changed in tvtime.  This is done when renumbering a channel, using the channel scanner, or manually activating or deactivating a
       specific channel from the list.

       Channel settings are saved specific to norm and frequency table.

           <?xml version="1.0"?>
           <!DOCTYPE stationlist PUBLIC "-//tvtime//DTD stationlist 1.0//EN"
             "http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/DTD/stationlist.dtd">
           <stationlist xmlns="http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/DTD/">
             <list norm="NTSC" frequencies="US-Cable">
               <station ... />
               ... station list
             </list>
           </stationlist>

       That is, each norm/frequency combination will get its own section in the configuration file.  The frequencies name is not special, you can have frequencies="foobar" and running
           tvtime -f foobar
       will do the right thing.  The norm, however, must match the norm being used.

       Entries in a list are in the following form:

           <station name="CNN" active="1" position="18"
                    band="US Cable" channel="18"/>
           <station name="DSF" active="1" position="12"
                    band="VHF E2-E12" channel="E12"/>

STATIONS
       Each station has its own properties that should be set.

       name   The human-readable name of the current station.

       active When set to 1, the channel is active.  To deactivate the channel, set this value to 0.

       position
              This setting specifies the position the channel occupies on the dial.  This allows users to arbitrarily map any particular channel to a particular position on the dial.

       band
       channel

              The possible bands and channels available in tvtime are:

              Band name          Channels provided
              US Cable           1–99
              US Cable 100       100–125
              US Two-Way         T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12 T13, T14
              US Broadcast       2–83
              China Broadcast    1–68, A1–A7, B1–B31, C1–C5
              Japan Broadcast    1–62
              Japan Cable        13–63
              VHF E2-E12         E1–E12
              VHF S1-S41         S1–S41
              VHF Misc           X, Y, Z, Z+1, Z+2
              VHF France         K01–K10, KB–KQ, H01–H19
              VHF Russia         R1–R12, SR1–SR19
              VHF Australia      AS1–AS12, AS5A, AS9A
              VHF Italy          A–H, H1, H2
              VHF Ireland        I1–I9
              VHF South Africa   1–13
              UHF                U21–U69
              UHF Australia      AU28–AU69
              Australia Optus    01–058

              Custom channels can be included manually by specifying the frequency in megahertz:

                  <station name="2" active="1" position="0"
                           band="Custom" channel="55.69MHz"/>

       norm   A per-channel norm can be specified in the stationlist.  This is for stations which receive both PAL and SECAM stations, such that they can choose the colour  encoding  format  per-channel.
              The only valid values here are either PAL or SECAM.

       network
              Sets the name of the network for the OSD display.  In NTSC regions, this is set from the XDS information in the VBI if VBI decoding is enabled.

       call   Sets the call letters of the network for the OSD display.  In NTSC regions, this is set from the XDS information in the VBI if VBI decoding is enabled.

       xmltvid
              Sets the XMLTV channel identifier to associate this channel with if tvtime cannot automatically make the association.  For following channel definition in an XMLTV file:

                <channel id="I10119.labs.zap2it.com">
                  <display-name>CICA</display-name>
                  <display-name>TV Ontario (CICA)</display-name>
                  <display-name>Canadian Independent</display-name>
                </channel>

              An associated stationlist entry would be:

                  <station name="2" active="1" position="0"
                           band="Custom" channel="55.69MHz"
                           xmltvid="I10119.labs.zap2it.com"/>
