NAME
       ieee1284_ecp_fwd_to_rev, ieee1284_ecp_rev_to_fwd - ECP direction switching

SYNOPSIS

       int ieee1284_ecp_fwd_to_rev(struct parport *port);

       int ieee1284_ecp_rev_to_fwd(struct parport *port);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions are used to switch directions when in ECP mode. On negotiation to ECP mode the direction is forward (in other words, host-to-peripheral). Use ieee1284_ecp_fwd_to_rev to switch from
       forward to reverse, and ieee1284_ecp_rev_to_fwd to switch from reverse to forward.

       They act on the parallel port associated with port, which must be claimed.

RETURN VALUE
       E1284_OK
           Direction switched successfully.

       E1284_NOTIMPL
           The port lacks the required capability. This could be due to a limitation of this version of libieee1284, or a hardware limitation.

       E1284_INVALIDPORT
           The port parameter is invalid (for instance, perhaps the port is not claimed).
