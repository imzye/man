NAME
       Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX - Interpreter of the ArabTeX notation of Arabic

SYNOPSIS
           use Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX;        # imports just like 'use Encode' would, plus extended options

           while ($line = <>) {                # maps the ArabTeX notation for Arabic into the Arabic script

               print encode 'utf8', decode 'arabtex', $line;       # 'ArabTeX' alias 'Lagally' alias 'TeX'
           }

           # ArabTeX lower ASCII transliteration <--> Arabic script in Perl's internal format

           $string = decode 'ArabTeX', $octets;
           $octets = encode 'ArabTeX', $string;

           Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX->encoder('dump' => '!./encoder.code');  # dump the encoder engine to file
           Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX->decoder('load');   # load the decoder engine from module's extra sources

DESCRIPTION
       ArabTeX is an excellent extension to TeX/LaTeX designed for typesetting the right-to-left scripts of the Orient. It comes up with very intuitive and comprehensible lower ASCII transliterations,
       the expressive power of which is even better than that of the scripts.

       Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX implements the rules needed for proper interpretation of the ArabTeX notation of Arabic. The conversion ifself is done by Encode::Mapper, and the user interface is built on
       the Encode::Encoding module.

   ENCODING BUSINESS
       Since the ArabTeX notation is not a simple mapping to the graphemes of the Arabic script, encoding the script into the notation is ambiguous. Two different strings in the notation may correspond
       to identical strings in the script. Heuristics must be engaged to decide which of the representations is more appropriate.

       Together with this bottle-neck, encoding may not be perfectly invertible by the decode operation, due to over-generation or approximations in the encoding algorithm.

       There are situations where conversion from the Arabic script to the ArabTeX notation is still convenient and useful. Imagine you need to edit the data, enhance it with vowels or other diacritical
       marks, produce phonetic transcripts and trim the typography of the script ... Do it in the ArabTeX notation, having an unrivalled control over your acts!

       Nonetheless, encoding is not the very purpose for this module's existence ;)

   DECODING BUSINESS
       The module decodes the ArabTeX notation as defined in the User Manual Version 4.00 of March 11, 2004, <ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/arabtex/doc/arabdoc.pdf>. The implementation uses
       three levels of Encode::Mapper engines to solve the problem:

       Hamza writing
           Hamza  carriers  are  determined  from  the  context in accordance with the Arabic orthographical conventions.  The first level of mapping expands every "<'>" into the verbatim encoding of the
           relevant carrier.  This level of processing can become optional, if people ever need to encode the hamza carriers explicitly.

           Interpretation of geminated hamza "<''>" is correct here, as opposed to ArabTeX itself. In order to deduce the proper spelling rules, we  resorted  to  <http://www.arabic-morphology.com/>  and
           experimented with words like "<ra''asa>", "<ru''isa>", "<tara''usuN>", etc.

           On this level, word-internal occurrences of "<T>" get translated into "<t>", which is an extension to the notation that simplifies some requirements in modeling of the Arabic morphology.

       Grapheme generation
           The core level includes most of the rules needed, and converts the ArabTeX notation to Arabic graphemes in Unicode. The engine recognizes all the consonants of Modern Standard Arabic, plus the
           following letters:

                               [ "|",           ""         ],              # invisible consonant
                               [ "B",           "\x{0640}" ],              # consonantal ta.twil

                               [ "T",           "\x{0629}" ],              # ta' marbu.ta
                               [ "H",           "\x{0629}" ],              # ta' marbu.ta silent

                               [ "p",           "\x{067E}" ],              # pa'
                               [ "v",           "\x{06A4}" ],              # va'
                               [ "g",           "\x{06AF}" ],              # gaf

                               [ "c",           "\x{0681}" ],              # .ha with hamza
                               [ "^c",          "\x{0686}" ],              # gim with three
                               [ ",c",          "\x{0685}" ],              # _ha with three
                               [ "^z",          "\x{0698}" ],              # zay with three
                               [ "^n",          "\x{06AD}" ],              # kaf with three
                               [ "^l",          "\x{06B5}" ],              # lam with bow above
                               [ ".r",          "\x{0695}" ],              # ra' with bow below

           There are many nice features in the notation, like assimilation, gemination, hyphenation, all implemented here.  Defective and historical writings of vowels are supported, too! Try yourself if
           your fonts can handle these ;)

           Word-initial  sequences  like  "<lV-all>",  "<lV-al->", "<lV-al-CC>" and "<lV-aC-C>", where "V" stands for a short, possibly quoted or missing, vowel, and "C" represents a fixed consonant, are
           processed according to the requirements of the Arabic orthography. Thus, "<li-al-laylaTi>" reduces to "<li-llaylaTi>", "<li-al-rra^guli>" becomes "<lir-ra^guli>", and  "<la-al-ma^gdu>"  equals
           "<lal-ma^gdu>", while "<li-alla_dI>" turns into "<lilla_dI>".

       Wasla and ligatures
           Wasla  is  introduced if there is a preceding long or short vowel, and the blank space is one newline, one tabulator, or up to four single spaces. Optionally, diacritical marks in between laam
           and 'alif go after the latter letter, since most of the current systems rendering the Arabic script do not produce the desired ligatures  if  the  two  kinds  of  graphemes  are  not  adjacent
           immediately.

       There  are  modes  and  options  in ArabTeX that have not been dealt with yet in Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX. Still, mutual consistency of the systems is very high. This new release does support vowel
       quoting and works in the ArabTeX's "\vocalize" mode by default. The other conversion modes are implemented, too, as described below within the "enmode" and "demode" methods.

   EXPORTS, ENGINES & MODES
       The module exports as if "use Encode" also appeared in the package. The "import" options, except for the first-place subsequence of ":xml", ":simple" or ":describe", are just delegated  to  Encode
       and imports performed properly.

       If  the first element in the list to "use" is ":xml", all XML markup, or rather any data enclosed in the well-paired and non-nested angle brackets "<" and ">", will be preserved. Properties of the
       Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX engines can be generally controlled through the Encode::Mapper API.

       In case the next, possibly the first, element in this list is ":simple", rules in the engines get simplified so that quotes be mapped to empty strings and infrequent or experimental  notations  of
       vowels  not be interpreted in the extra manner of ArabTeX. Using ":simple" is recommended for simple every-day tasks where these nuances would have no impact and where full initialization would be
       bothering.

       The ":describe" option calls the Encode::Mapper's "describe" method on the module's engines right after their compilation.

       Initialization of the engines takes place the first time they are used, unless they have already been defined.  There are two explicit methods for it:

       encoder
           Initialize or redefine the encoder engine. If no parameters are given, rules in the module are compiled into a list of Encode::Mapper objects. Currently, the "--dump" and "--load" options have
           some experimental meaning.

       decoder
           See the description of "encoder".

       There are five conversion modes currently recognized in this module, and their aliases are mapped according to the module's %modemap hash. Selection of the appropriate mode is  done  best  through
       the "enmode" and "demode" functions of Encode::Arabic, or with a direct call of the namesake methods in Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX:

           our %Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX::modemap = (           # the module provides these definitions

                   'default'       => 3,                           'undef'         => 0,

                   'fullvocalize'  => 4,   'full'          => 4,

                   'vocalize'      => 3,   'nosukuun'      => 3,

                   'novocalize'    => 2,   'novowels'      => 2,   'none'          => 2,

                   'noshadda'      => 1,   'noneplus'      => 1,
               );

           # the function calls might be preferred as more comfortable

           Encode::Arabic::demode 'arabtex', 'full';           # like 'encode' and 'decode' of Encode

           Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX->demode('fullvocalize');    # like the Encode::Encoding interfaces

           # how modes can be set easily

           use Encode::Arabic ':modes';   enmode 'arabtex', 'undef';   demode 'arabtex', 'noneplus';

       enmode
           Currently in development. The mode is fixed to 'undef' internally.

       demode
           Enforces the proper version of the final, third level of the Encode::Mapper engines.
