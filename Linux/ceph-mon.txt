NAME
       ceph-mon - ceph monitor daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-mon -i monid [ --mon-data mondatapath ]

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-mon  is  the  cluster  monitor  daemon  for  the Ceph distributed file system. One or more instances of ceph-mon form a Paxos part-time parliament cluster that provides extremely reliable and
       durable storage of cluster membership, configuration, and state.

       The mondatapath refers to a directory on a local file system storing monitor data. It is normally specified via the mon data option in the configuration file.

OPTIONS
       -f, --foreground
              Foreground: do not daemonize after startup (run in foreground). Do not generate a pid file. Useful when run via ceph-run(8).

       -d     Debug mode: like -f, but also send all log output to stderr.

       --setuser userorgid
              Set uid after starting.  If a username is specified, the user record is looked up to get a uid and a gid, and the gid is also set as well, unless --setgroup is also specified.

       --setgroup grouporgid
              Set gid after starting.  If a group name is specified the group record is looked up to get a gid.

       -c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
              Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.

       --mkfs Initialize the mon data directory with seed information to form and initial ceph file system or to join an existing monitor cluster.  Three pieces of information must be provided:

              • The cluster fsid.  This can come from a monmap (--monmap <path>) or explicitly via --fsid <uuid>.

              • A list of monitors and their addresses.  This list of monitors can come from a monmap (--monmap <path>), the mon host configuration value (in ceph.conf or via -m host1,host2,...), or (for
                backward compatibility) the deprecated mon addr lines in ceph.conf.  If this monitor is to be part of the initial monitor quorum for a new Ceph cluster, then it must be  included  in  the
                initial list, matching either the name or address of a monitor in the list.  When matching by address, either the public addr or public subnet options may be used.

              • The monitor secret key mon..  This must be included in the keyring provided via --keyring <path>.

       --keyring
              Specify a keyring for use with --mkfs.

       --no-config-file
              Signal that we don't want to rely on a ceph.conf, either user provided or the default, to run the daemon.  This will entail providing all necessary options to the daemon as arguments.

AVAILABILITY
       ceph-mon is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at https://docs.ceph.com for more information.
