       --help Show command help and exit.

           WARNING!!! This removes all metadata of watched, marked as watched, and downloaded videos from
           ytcc's database. This cannot be undone! In most cases you won't need this command, but it is
           useful to keep the database size small.

       OPTIONS:

           You can export your YouTube subscriptions at https://takeout.google.com. In the takeout you
           find a CSV file with your subscriptions. To speed up the takeout export only your
           subscriptions, not your videos, comments, etc.

           The OPML export was available on YouTube some time ago and old versions of ytcc were also able
           to export subscriptions in the OPML format.
