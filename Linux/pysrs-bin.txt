NAME
       envfrom2srs - rewrites the envelope sender address in view of remailing it

SYNOPSIS
       envfrom2srs [fwdomain] email

DESCRIPTION
       Rewrite the email with an SRS encoded version.  fwdomain is used as forward domain.

       WARNING:
          Use only if absolutely necessary.  It is very inefficient and a security risk.

CONFIG FILE
       The program uses /etc/mail/pysrs.cfg, if available:

          [srs]
          secret = 'shhhh!'
          maxage = 8
          hashlength = 8
          fwdomain =  'mydomain.com'
          separator = '='
