NAME
       mkpasswd.pl - example to generate new password with String::MkPasswd

SYNOPSIS
         mkpasswd.pl [-options]

         #!/bin/sh
         NEW_PASSWD=`mkpasswd.pl`

DESCRIPTION
       This program generates a random password, allowing for some tuning of character distribution.  The password is sent to standard output.

   OPTIONS
       -l # | --length=#
           The total length of the password.  The default is 9.

       -d # | --digits=#
           The minimum number of digits that will appear in the final password.  The default is 2.

       -c # | --lower=#
           The minimum number of lower-case characters that will appear in the final password.  The default is 2.

       -C # | --upper=#
           The minimum number of upper-case characters that will appear in the final password.  The default is 2.

       -s # | --special=#
           The minimum number of non-alphanumeric characters that will appear in the final password.  The default is 1.

       -2 | --distribute
           If specified, password characters will be distributed between the left- and right-hand sides of the keyboard.  This makes it more difficult for an onlooker to see the password as it is typed.

       --nodigits | --no-digits
           Alias for --digits=0.

       --nolower | --no-lower
           Alias for --lower=0.

       --noupper | --no-upper
           Alias for --upper=0.

       --nospecial | --no-special
           Alias for --special=0.

BUGS
       •   While not really a bug, the .pl extension has been added to avoid conflict with the program of the same name distributed with Expect.

TODO
       •   For completeness, add user password setting functionality as found in Expect's mkpasswd(1) example.
