CTL_MBOXLIST(8)                   Cyrus IMAP                   CTL_MBOXLIST(8)

NAME
       ctl_mboxlist - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Perform operations on the mailbox list database

SYNOPSIS
       ctl_mboxlist [ -C config-file ] -d [ -x ] [-y] [ -p partition ] [ -f filename ]
       ctl_mboxlist [ -C config-file ] -u [ -f filename ]
       ctl_mboxlist [ -C config-file ] -m [ -a ] [ -w ] [ -i ] [ -f filename ]
       ctl_mboxlist [ -C config-file ] -v [ -f filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       ctl_mboxlist  is  used  to perform various administrative operations on
       the mailbox list database.

       ctl_mboxlist reads its configuration options out of  the  imapd.conf(5)
       file  unless  specified otherwise by -C.  The configdirectory option in
       imapd.conf(5) is used to determine the default location  of  the  mail‐
       boxes database.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -d     Dump the contents of the database to standard output in a porta‐
              ble  flat-text  format.  NOTE: In Cyrus versions 2.2.13 and ear‐
              lier, the dump format did not include the  mailbox  type  flags,
              breaking  remote  mailboxes  (frontends, mupdate master, unified
              backends) when undumped.

       -x     When performing a dump, remove the  mailboxes  dumped  from  the
              mailbox list (mostly useful when specified with -p).

       -y     When  performing  a dump, also list intermediary mailboxes which
              would be hidden from IMAP.

       -p partition
              When performing a dump, dump only those mailboxes that  live  on
              partition.

       -f filename
              Use  the  database  specified by filename instead of the default
              (configdirectory/mailboxes.db*).

       -u     Load the contents of the database from standard input.  The  in‐
              put MUST be in the format output by the -d option.

       NOTE:
          Both  the old and new formats can be loaded, but the old format will
          break remote mailboxes.

       -m     For backend servers in the Cyrus Murder, synchronize  the  local
              mailbox list file with the MUPDATE server.

       -a     When used with -m, assume the local mailboxes file is authorita‐
              tive, that is, only change the mupdate server, do not delete any
              local mailboxes.

       IMPORTANT:
          USE  THIS  OPTION  WITH CARE, as it allows namespace collisions into
          the murder.

       -w     When used with -m, print out what would be done but do not  per‐
              form the operations.

       -i     When  used  with -m, asks for verification before deleting local
              mailboxes.

       -v     Verify the consistency of the  mailbox  list  database  and  the
              spool  partition(s).  Mailboxes  present in the database and not
              located on a spool partition, and those located on a spool  par‐
              tition  (directory containing a valid cyrus.header file) and not
              present in the database will be reported.  Note that this  func‐
              tion is very I/O intensive.

EXAMPLES
       ctl_mboxlist -d
          Dump the mailboxes list in portable text format.

       ctl_mboxlist -u < newmboxlist.dump
          Undump  (restore)  the  mailboxes  database from newmboxlist.dump, a
          portable text formatted file.

       ctl_mboxlist -m
          Synchronize our mailboxes database with the  MUPDATE  server.   (One
          may  commonly  put  a  command  like  this into the START section of
          cyrus.conf(5) on backend nodes of a  Murder  cluster  to  cause  the
          backend to synchronize its mailbox list with the mupdate master upon
          startup).

       ctl_mboxlist -m -w
          The same as above, but only show us what would be done, don't  actu‐
          ally do it.

       ctl_mboxlist -m -a
          Populate the Mupdate server from our copy of the mailboxes database.

          NOTE:
              Be  very careful with this option, as it can create conflicts in
              the Murder.

       ctl_mboxlist -m -i
          Synchronize our mailboxes database with the MUPDATE server  interac‐
          tively, asking for verification before deleting any local mailboxes.
