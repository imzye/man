DESCRIPTION
       Cil is a small but useful command-line issue list. It saves issues, comments and attachments as local files which you can check in to your repository.

       init [--path=PATH] [--bare]
           Creates a local '.cil' file and an 'issues' directory. If PATH is specified, the config file and directory will be created in the destination directory.

           Usually,  cil  will  write  a  small  ".cil" file such that you can use various filter commands immediately and can also serve as an example config file. Using "--bare" just touches the ".cil"
           config file ready for your own manipulation.

       summary [filters]
           Displays a one line summary for each issue. You may filter on both the Status and Label fields.

       list [filters]
           Shows each issue with more information. You may filter on both the Status and Label fields.

       add [--mine] [summary]
           Adds an issues after you have edited the input.  Text passed after 'add' will be used as the bug summary line.

           If you use the --mine flag, the AssignedTo field is automatically set to you (saves having to copy and paste the CreatedBy field).

       show ISSUE
           Shows the issue name with more detail.

       status ISSUE NEW_STATUS
           Shortcut so that you can set a new status on an issue without having to edit it.

       depends-on ISSUE1 ISSUE2
           Shortcut so that cil will add a 'DependsOn' from issue 1 to issue 2. Conversley, issue 2 will also then contain a 'Precedes' pointer to issue 1.

       precedes ISSUE1 ISSUE2
           This is the exact opposite of "depends-on" and is here for convenience and completeness. ie. issue 1 has to be completed before issue 2.

       status ISSUE NEW_STATUS
           Shortcut so that you can set a new status on an issue without having to edit it.

       steal ISSUE
           Shortcut to assign this issue to yourself. It reads your "~/.cilrc" file for your UserName and UserEmail and uses this to populate the "AssignedTo" field in the issue.

       edit ISSUE
           Edits the issue. If it changes, set the updates time to now.

       comment ISSUE
           Adds a comment to an issues after you have edited the input.

       attach ISSUE FILENAME
           Adds that particular filename to an existing issue.

       extract ATTACHMENT [--filename=FILENAME]
           Extracts the file from the attachment number. If filename if given uses that, otherwise it will use the original one saved along with the attachment.

       am  Applies an email message to the issue list. It tries to figure out the type of email it is, whether it is a new issue or a comment on an already existing issue. For example,  if  it  can  find
           valid issue names in the subject or body of the message, it adds it as a comment to that issue. If it can't find any valid issue names, it presumes it's a new issue and adds that.

           Note: this command will deal with Mailbox format files later on.

       track ISSUE
           This command outputs one or more command which you should run so that your VCS knows about your issue. It makes sure all the comments and attachments are done too.

       fsck
           Tries to help you organise your issues if any aren't valid or have broken relationships.

FILTERS
       Filters can be used on both the "summary" and "list" commands. Most can be combined. See each individual filter for details.

       --status=STATUS
           You can choose any of the Statuses which might appear in your issues. This status does not have to be defined in your ".cil" file, even if you have "StatusStrict" turned on.

       --label=LABEL
           You can choose any of the Labels which might appear in your issues. This label does not have to be defined in your ".cil" file, even if you have "LabelStrict" turned on.

       --is-open, --is-closed
           These  check  both  "StatusOpenList" and "StatusClosedList" from your ".cil" file. If both are specified, you're likely to get no issues unless you explicitly defined a status as being in both
           lists (for whatever reason you have).

       --assigned-to=EMAIL_ADDRESS, --is-mine
           These items are mutually exclusive. The "--assigned-to" just checks the email address in the AssignedTo field. It does not match anything else in that field, including any  preceding  name  or
           any angle brackets.

           The "--is-mine" filter is a shortcut to asking if AssignedTo is you. Cil knows your email address if you define it in your user's "~/.cilrc" file as "UserEmail".

.cil
       The ".cil" file is used to configure bits and pieces within cil for this particular issue list. The following options are available and where stated, may be declared multiple times:

       The ".cil" file is fairly simple and an example can be seen here:

           UseGit: 1
           StatusStrict: 1
           StatusOpenList: New
           StatusOpenList: InProgress
           StatusClosedList: Finished
           LabelStrict: 1
           LabelAllowedList: Type-Enhancement
           LabelAllowedList: Type-Defect
           LabelAllowedList: Priority-High
           LabelAllowedList: Priority-Medium
           LabelAllowedList: Priority-Low

       UseGit
           Default: 0, Type: Boolean (0/1)

           Determines whether to use Git or not. Some features require Git though Cil is perfectly usable without.

       StatusStrict
           Default: 0, Type: Boolean (0/1)

           If this is set to a true value then cil checks that the status you enter into an issue (after adding or editing) is also in the allowed list (see StatusAllowedList).

       StatusOpenList
           Default: empty, Type: List

           This list is checked against when filtering with --is-open.

       StatusClosedList
           Default: empty, Type: List

           This list is checked against when filtering with --is-closed.

       StatusAllowedList
           This list is automatically generated from the StatusOpenList and the StatusClosedList. It does not have to appear in the config file.

       LabelStrict
           Default: 0, Type: Boolean (0/1)

           This determines that labels you enter are checked against LabelAllowedList. Set to 1 if you require this feature.

       LabelAllowedList
           Default: empty, Type: List

           This determines which labels are allowed if you have turned on LabelStrict.

~/.cilrc
       The "~/.cilrc" file is read to configure the user's preferences for all cil lists they're using. It is of the same format as the ".cil" file and contains the following options:

           UserName: Andrew Chilton
           UserEmail: andychilton@gmail.com

       UserName
           Default: 'Name', Type: String

           This is used as a default in the "CreatedBy" and "AssignedTo" fields in any issues/comments/attachments you add.

       UserEmail
           Default: 'Email', Type: String

           This is used as a default in the "CreatedBy" and "AssignedTo" fields in any issues/comments/attachments you add.

BUGS
       Probably. Let me know :-)

TODO
       To get a ToDo list for cil, clone the repo, find the issues/ dir and type:

           $ cil --is-open

       This gives the current outstanding issues in cil.
