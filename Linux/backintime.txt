DESCRIPTION
       Back  In  Time is a simple backup tool for Linux. The backup is done by
       taking snapshots of a specified set of folders.

       All you have to do is configure: where to save snapshots, what  folders
       to  backup.   You can also specify a backup schedule: disabled, every 5
       minutes, every 10 minutes, every hour, every  day,  every  week,  every
       month.  To  configure  it use one of the graphical interfaces available
       (backintime-gnome or backintime-kde4).

       It acts as  a  'user  mode'  backup  tool.  This  means  that  you  can
       backup/restore  only folders you have write access to (actually you can
       backup read-only folders, but you can't restore them).

       If you want to run it as root you need to use 'sudo -i backintime'.

       A new snapshot is created only if  something  changed  since  the  last
       snapshot (if any).

       A snapshot contains all the files from the selected folders (except for
       exclude patterns). In order to reduce disk space it use hard-links  (if
       possible)  between  snapshots  for  unchanged files. This way a file of
       10MiB, unchanged for 10 snapshots, will use only 10MiB on the disk.

       When you restore a file 'A', if it already exists on the file system it
       will be renamed to 'A.backup.currentdate'.

       For  automatic  backup  it use 'cron' so there is no need for a daemon,
       but 'cron' must be running.

   Modes
       Local
           Store snapshots on local HDD's (internal or USB). The drive has  to
           be mounted before creating a new snapshot.

       Local encrypted
           Store  encrypted  snapshots on local HDD's (internal or USB).  Back
           In Time uses 'encfs' with standard  configuration  to  encrypt  all
           data.  Please take a look at A NOTE ON SECURITY.

       SSH
           With  Mode set to SSH you can store the backup on a remote host us‐
           ing the SecureShellHost protocol (ssh).  The remote  path  will  be
           mount  local  using  sshfs to provide file-access for the graphical
           interface and the backup process.  Rsync and other processes called
           during  backup  process  will run directly on the remote host using
           ssh.

           To prepare your user account for ssh-mode  you  have  to  create  a
           password-less  login  to  the  remote host (for further information
           look at  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/152).   Type
           in  terminal 'ssh-keygen -t rsa' hit enter for default path and en‐
           ter a passphrase for the private key.

           Finally    type    'ssh-copy-id    -i    ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub     <RE‐
           MOTE_USER>@<HOST>' and enter your password on remote host.

           In  Settingsdialog you need to set the host and remote user. If you
           enter a relative path (no leading / ) it  will  start  from  remote
           users  homedir. The password has to be the passphrase for your pri‐
           vate key.

           Cipher (the algorithm used to encrypt the data during transfer)
           To optimize performance you can choose the cipher used by ssh.  De‐
           pending  on  your environment you can have a massive speed increase
           compared to the default cipher.

           benchmark-cipher will give you an overview over which cipher is the
           fastest in your environment.

           If the bottleneck of your environment is the hard-drive or the net‐
           work you will not see a big difference between the ciphers. In this
           case you should rather stay on 'default'.

           Please read security information about the cipher before using them
           in untrusted networks (Wifi,  Internet).  Some  of  them  (Arcfour,
           3DES, ...) should be handled as not secure anymore.

           Remote Host
           If  your  remote  host is an embedded Linux NAS or any other device
           with limited functions, you could run into some problems caused  by
           feature-less  commands.   For  example  some  devices  may not have
           hardlink support for 'cp', 'chmod' and 'rsync'. In this case it may
           help  to  install  so-called  Optware  or Entware on your device if
           available.

           WARNING: THIS IS ONLY FOR EXPERIENCED USERS!
           If you don't know how to compile packages and how to modify a Linux
           system you should NOT try to do this. There is a significant chance
           to break your device and make it completely unusable with the  fol‐
           lowing  procedure.  We  will not take any warranty for this. Make a
           backup of your device before proceed!  You have been warned!

           You should install at least packages called 'bash', 'coreutils' and
           'rsync'.   You  will  have  to  change  users  default  shell  from
           '/bin/sh'   to   '/opt/bin/bash'   in   '/etc/passwd'.    To    add
           '/opt/bin:/opt/sbin:'  to the start of the PATH environment you can
           use  'Add  prefix  to  SSH  commands'  in  'Expert  Options'   with
           'PATH=/opt/bin:/opt/sbin:\$PATH'.

           To  check  if  it  does work you can compare the output of '/bin/cp
           --help' and '/opt/bin/cp --help'. If 'ssh <user>@<host> cp  --help'
           called  from  your  PC  will print the same as '/opt/bin/cp --help'
           called on the remote host (via interactive  ssh  session)  you  are
           ready to go.

           If  you  have questions on how to install and configure the Optware
           please refer to the community of your device. You can also  take  a
           look   on  Back  In  Time  FAQ  on  GitHub  https://github.com/bit-
           team/backintime/wiki/FAQ

           If you successfully modified your device to be able to make backups
           over  ssh,  it would be nice if you write a 'How to' on Launchpad's
           Answers so we can add this to the FAQ.

       SSH encrypted
           Store encrypted snapshots on remote  hosts  using  SSH.  Backintime
           uses 'encfs --reverse' to mount the root filesystem '/'. Rsync will
           sync this encrypted view of '/' to a remote host over SSH. All  en‐
           coding  will  be  done  on  the local machine. So the password will
           never be exposed to the remote host and you can use the  (normally)
           more powerful processor in you local machine for encryption instead
           of weak NAS CPU's. The downside on this is 'encfs  --reverse'  does
           not support 'Filename Initialization Vector Chaining' and 'Per-File
           Initialization Vectors' from the  standard  configuration  (take  a
           look at 'man encfs' for further information). Please take a look at
           A NOTE ON SECURITY.

           Because of all data is transferred encrypted the log  output  shows
           encrypted  filenames,  too.  In the Logview-Dialog you can use 'de‐
           code' option to decrypt the paths  automatically  or  you  can  use
           'backintime  decode'  to  manually decrypt paths. Back In Time will
           show all snapshots decoded so you can browse all files as normal.

           Exclude does not support wildcards ('foo*',  '[fF]oo',  'fo?')  be‐
           cause  after  encoding a file these wildcards can't match any more.
           Only separate asterisk that match a full file or folder  will  work
           ('foo/*',  'foo/**/bar').  All  other  excludes that have wildcards
           will be silently ignored.

           Please refer to the 'SSH' section above for information on  setting
           up the SSH connection.

   Password
       If  'Save  Password to Keyring' is activated Back In Time will save the
       Password into GnomeKeyring (Seahorse) or KDE-KWallet. Both  are  secure
       password storages which encrypt the password with the users login-pass‐
       word. So they can only be accessed if the user is logged in.

       A backup cronjob during the user isn't logged in can  not  collect  the
       password  from keyring. Also if the homedir is encrypted the keyring is
       not accessible from cronjobs (even if the user is logged in). For these
       cases  the  password can be cached in RAM. If 'Cache Password for Cron'
       is activated Back In Time will start a small daemon in user-space which
       will  collect  the password from keyring and provide them for cronjobs.
       They will never be written to the harddrive but a user with  root  per‐
       missions could access the daemon and read the password.

   user-callback
       During  backup process the application can call a user callback at dif‐
       ferent steps.  This callback is "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/backintime/user-call‐
       back" (by default $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is ~/.config).

       The first argument is the profile id (1=Main Profile, ...).

       The second argument is the profile name.

       The third argument is the reason:

              1      Backup process begins.

              2      Backup process ends.

              3      A  new  snapshot was taken. The extra arguments are snap‐
                     shot ID and snapshot path.

              4      There was an error. The  second  argument  is  the  error
                     code.
                     Error codes:

                     1      The application is not configured.

                     2      A "take snapshot" process is already running.

                     3      Can't  find snapshots folder (is it on a removable
                            drive ?).

                     4      A snapshot for "now" already exist.

              5      On (graphical) App start.

              6      On (graphical) App close.

              7      Mount all necessary drives.

              8      Unmount all drives.

A NOTE ON SECURITY
       There  was  a  paid security audit for EncFS in Feb 2014 which revealed
       several potential vulnerabilities.

       From https://defuse.ca/audits/encfs.htm
              EncFS is probably safe as long as the adversary  only  gets  one
              copy  of  the  ciphertext and nothing more. EncFS is not safe if
              the adversary has the opportunity to see two or  more  snapshots
              of  the ciphertext at different times. EncFS attempts to protect
              files from malicious modification, but there are  serious  prob‐
              lems with this feature.

       This might be a problem with Back In Time snapshots.
