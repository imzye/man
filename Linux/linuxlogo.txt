       -u     Display the system uptime.

       -w val Set screen width to val

       -y     Display the load average.

PROCESSOR INFORMATION
   CPUINFO
       The cpuinfo supplied in /proc/cpuinfo is not always usable by linux_logo.

       If the cpuinfo for your microprocessor generates ugly output, send the output from your /proc/cpuinfo to the author.

   FORMAT
       The format string special sequences start with # (use ## to print #). All other characters, except for \n,  are printed as is.

       Seq   Description               Output

       \\n   carriage return

       Notes:

       •   The letter after the # must be capitalized.

       •   Options not available are silently ignored.

       •   Megahertz only available on some platforms and newer kernels.

       •   See defaults.h on how to have #N report in non-english numbers.

       •   Plural [#S] gives nothing if there is 1 cpu, gives 's' otherwise.

       •   The "-y" and "-u" [display uptime and load average] command line options don't affect the output if a custom format is used.

       The default banner format is:

       "#O Version #V, Compiled #C\n \
       #N #M#X#T Processor#S, #R RAM, #B Bogomips Total\n \
       #H\n"

       The default banner format displays the following on the author's computer:
                                                                        Linux Version 2.2.0-pre5, Compiled #47 Fri Jan 8 10:37:09 EST 1999
                                                                           One 188MHz AMD K6 Processor, 64M RAM, 374.37 Bogomips Total
                                                                                                     deranged
       Another example would be:

       linux_logo -F "Redhat Linux 5.2\nKernel Version #V\n#U\n#L\n"

       which would display:
                                                                                                Redhat Linux 5.2
                                                                                            Kernel Version 2.2.0-pre5
                                                                                            Uptime 11 hours 4 minutes
                                                                                          Load average 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

   LOGO SELECTION
       The -L command line option is used to choose which logo to use.

       •   "-L list" will list all of the logos available

       •   "-L NAME" will display the logo with name NAME.

       •   "-L NUM" will display logo with number NUM (deprecated)

       •   "-L random_xy" will pick a logo at random, with criteria xy.

           When you replace x with the letter:
            b : pick a random banner mode logo
            c : pick a random classic mode logo
            e : pick a logo from either banner or classic

           When you replace y with the letter:
            a: pick a random ascii logo
            n: pick a non-ascii logo
            e: pick either type of logo

           So to summarize:
            "-L random_ba" picks a random ascii banner,
            "-L random_ce" picks a random classic logo
            "-L random_ee" picks any logo, etc.

DEBIAN
       The  Debian pre-packaged version of linux_logo includes the Debian logo in addition to the 'Classic' and 'Banner' logos. The Debian logo is the default logo unless one of the other logos is speci‐
       fied on the command line.

CONFIG FILES
       ~/.linux_logo and /etc/linux_logo.conf can be filled with command line options and will be parsed before the actual command line
