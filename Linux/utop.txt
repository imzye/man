NAME
       utoprc - Configuration file of utop

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.utoprc

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes  the  format of the ~/.utoprc file. This is a text file which contains the configuration of utop. Comments start with a '!' and empty lines are ignored. Configuration
       lines are of the form:

               <wildcard>: <value>

       <wildcard> may contain the '*' asterisk character. In that case any key which matches the pattern is given the value after the colon.

       The boolean key autoload can be set to false to disable the autoloading of files in $OCAML_TOPLEVEL_PATH/autoload at startup.

       The key external-editor can be set to a command line. It is used to edit the input when pressing C-x C-e. It defaults to the contents of the EDITOR environment variable.

       The key profile may have the value dark or light.  This is the same as calling UTop.set_profile in ~/.config/utop/init.ml.

       The following style keys are used by utop:

               * identifier
               * module
               * comment
               * doc
               * constant
               * keyword
               * symbol
               * string
               * char
               * quotation
               * error
               * directive
               * parenthesis
               * blanks

       For each of these keys, the following sub-keys are used:

               * key.foreground
               * key.background
               * key.bold
               * key.underline
               * key.reverse
               * key.blink

       key.foreground and key.background are colors, and the others are booleans. Colors may be one of the standard terminal colors:

               * black
               * red
               * green
               * yellow
               * blue
               * magenta
               * cyan
               * white
               * light-black
               * light-red
               * light-green
               * light-yellow
               * light-blue
               * light-magenta
               * light-cyan
               * light-white

       or X11 colors, prefixed with "x-". For example:

               identifier.foreground:  x-goldenrod

       Colors can also be given by their RGB components, written #RRGGBB. For example:

               identifier.foreground:  #5fbf7f

       utop will choose the nearest color of the terminal when specifying an X11 color or a color given by its RGB components. If you are using gnome-terminal or konsole, you can  enable  256  colors  by
       setting the environment variable TERM to "xterm-256color".
