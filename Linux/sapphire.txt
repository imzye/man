NAME
       sapphire — minimal but configurable window manager

SYNOPSIS
       sapphire [-display displayname  | -version ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the sapphire command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       sapphire is a minimal but configurable window manager for X11R6. It supports themes in the form of X resource files, and has a customisable menu.

       The  Debian  version  receives  Debian menu entries automatically in a "Debian" submenu by default, you can add entries specifically to sapphire (in the rest of the menu) in the default-menu file. For
       more information, see update-menus (1) and the FILES section below.

       Users can also set their own options in $HOME/.sapphire/wmconf (an X resource file).

OPTIONS
       -display displayname
                 Use the X-server display 'displayname'.

       -version  Show version of program.

FILES
       /etc/X11/sapphire/menu/default-menu
                 menu entries specific to sapphire (you can edit this one, it's a conffile)

       /etc/X11/sapphire/menu/menudefs.hook
                 Debian menu entries in sapphire's format, not read directly, do not edit (edit default-menu            instead)

       /etc/X11/sapphire/menu/default
                 this menu file is the one sapphire actually reads, it is automatically generated from the other two by update-menus, do not edit (edit default-menu instead)

       $HOME/.sapphire/wmconf
                 user-specific options

       /usr/share/sapphire/themes
                 themes directory, all of the above may refer to themes from here (the files themselves are X resource files)

HISTORY
       Sapphire was originally developed from Decklin Foster's aewm, and also uses some code from Blackbox (for gradients).
