NAME
       Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Aromaticity - Aromaticity handling routines

DESCRIPTION
       Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Aromaticity encodes some aromaticity handling subroutines for aromatisation and kekulisation. Both implementations are experimental, handle only some specific cases and are
       neither stable nor bug-free, thus should be used with caution.

METHODS
       aromatise( $moiety )
           Mark electron cycles as aromatic.

       kekulise( $moiety, $order_sub )
           Find  nonfused even-length aromatic cycles consisting only of B, C, N, P, S and mark them with alternating single and double bonds.  Subroutine as well accepts an optional subroutine reference
           $order_sub, providing external order for atoms.  This is needed to stabilise the algorithm, as otherwise the outcomes of bond assignment may turn out different.  $order_sub is called  with  an
           atom as $_[0] and is expected to return a value providing a distinct order indication for every atom.  These can be any scalar values, comparable using Perl's "cmp" operator.  If $order_sub is
           not given, initial atom order in input is consulted.

       electron_cycles( $moiety )
           Find  electron  cycles  according  to  "Finding Electron Cycles" algorithm from <https://depth-first.com/articles/2021/06/30/writing-aromatic-smiles/>.  Use with caution: the implementation is
           experimental.
