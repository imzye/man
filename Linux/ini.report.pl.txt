SYNOPSIS
       ini.report.pl [options]

               Options:
               -convert
               -help
               -inFileName anInputFileName
               -outFileName anOutputFileName
               -pathForHTML aPathForHTML
               -release aVersionNumber
               -table

               -webPage

       All switches can be reduced to a single letter.

       Exit value: 0.

       Typical switch combinations:

       o No switches
           Produce a text report on all versions.

       o -c
           Convert "Changes" to "Changelog.ini".

           Use -c -i CHANGES to read a file called "CHANGES".

       o -r 1.23
           Produce a text report on a specific version.

           Since -c is not used, -i defaults to "Changelog.ini".

       o -t
           Produce a HTML report on all versions.

           The report will just be a HTML "table", with CSS for Deploy.Action and Deploy.Reason.

           The table can be embedded in your own web page.

       o -r 1.23 -t
           Produce a HTML report on a specific version.

           The report will just be a HTML "table", with CSS for Deploy.Action and Deploy.Reason.

           The table can be embedded in your own web page.

       o -w
           Produce a HTML report on all versions.

           The report will be a HTML "page", with CSS for Deploy.Action and Deploy.Reason.

       o -r 1.23 -w
           Produce a HTML report on a specific version.

           The report will be a HTML "page", with CSS for Deploy.Action and Deploy.Reason.

OPTIONS
       o -convert
           This specifies that the program is to read an old-style "Changes" file, and is to write a new-style "Changelog.ini" file.

           When -convert is used, the default -inFileName is "Changes", and the default -outFileName is "Changelog.ini".

       o -help
           Print help and exit.

       o -inFileName anInputFileName
           The name of a file to be read.

           When the -convert switch is used, -inFileName defaults to "Changes", and -outFileName defaults to "Changelog.ini".

           In the absence of -convert, -inFileName defaults to "Changelog.ini", and -outFileName is not used.

       o -outFileName anOutputFileName
           The name of a file to be written.

       o -pathForHTML aPathForHTML
           The path to the HTML::Template-style templates used by the -table and -webPage switches.

           Default: '/usr/share/perl-Module-Metadata-Changes/templates/module/metadata/changes'.

       o -release aVersionNumber
           Report on a specific release/version.

           If this switch is not used, all versions are reported on.

       o -table
           Output the report as a HTML table.

           HTML is escaped using "HTML::Entities::Interpolate".

           The table template is called "ini.table.tmpl".

       o -urlForCSS aURLForCSS
           The URL to insert into the web page, if using the -webPage switch, which points to the CSS for the page.

           Defaults to /.sysassets/css/module/metadata/changes/ini.css.

       o -verbose
           Print verbose messages.

       o -webPage
           Output the report as a HTML page.

           The page template is called "ini.page.tmpl".

           This switch automatically activates the -table switch.
