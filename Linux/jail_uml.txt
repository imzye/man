DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jail_uml command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in HTML format; see below.

       jail_uml is a small utility to run UML in a jailed chroot as the user user or with id uid.

       When user does not exist it will be assumed to be an uid.
