NAME
       JRD - Java Runtime Decompiler

SYNOPSIS
       (./start.sh|start.bat) [-verbose] # launches GUI

       (./start.sh|start.bat) [-verbose] (-help|-h|-overwrite|-init)

       (./start.sh|start.bat) [-verbose] (-listclasses|-listdetails|-bytes|-base64bytes|-compile|-decompile|-api|-listjvms|-listplugins) [-saveas [-savelike]]

OPTIONS
   Standard options
       -help, -h
               Print this help text.

       -verbose
               All exceptions and some debugging strings will be printed to standard error.

       -version
               Print version project name, version and build timestamp.

       -listjvms
               List all local Java processes and their PIDs.

       -listplugins
               List all currently configured decompiler plugins and their statuses.

       -listclasses <PUC> [<CLASS REGEX>...]
               List all loaded classes of a process, optionally filtering them.

               Only '-savelike exact' or '-savelike default' are allowed as saving modifiers.

       -listdetails <PUC> [<CLASS REGEX>...]
               Similar to -listclasses, only more details are printed about classes.

       -base64bytes <PUC> <CLASS REGEX>...
               Print Base64 encoded binary form of requested classes of a process.

       -bytes <PUC> <CLASS REGEX>...
               Print binary form of requested classes of a process

       -compile [-p <PLUGIN>] [-cp <PUC>] [-r] <PATH>...
               Compile local files against runtime classpath, specified by -cp.

               Use -p to utilize some plugins' (like jasm or jcoder) bundled compilers.

               Use -r for recursive search if <PATH> is a directory.

               If the argument of '-saveas' is a valid PID or URL, the compiled code will be attempted to be injected into that process.

               If multiple PATHs were specified, but no '-saveas', the process fails.

       -decompile <PUC> <PLUGIN> <CLASS REGEX>...
               Decompile and print classes of a process with the specified decompiler plugin.

               Javap can be passed options by appending them without spaces: 'javap-v-public ...' executes as 'javap -v -public ...'

       -overwrite <PUC> <FQN> [<CLASS FILE>]
               Overwrite class of a process with new bytecode. If <CLASS FILE> is not set, standard input is used.

       -init <PUC> <FQN>
               Try to initialize a class in a running JVM (has no effect in FS VMs). Because class loading is lazy, the class you need might be missing, eg. java.lang.Override.

       -api <PUC>
               Will print out which can be used to insert fields/methods to running vm

   Saving modifiers
       -saveas <PATH>
               All outputs will be written to PATH instead of to standard output.

       -savelike <SAVE METHOD>
               Specify how saving will behave.

NOTES
       All options can be with either one or two leading slashes ('-').

       When using <CLASS REGEX>, escape dollar signs '$' of inner classes to '\$'; otherwise they mean the end-of-line.

       <FQN> is the fully qualified name of a class as per the Java Language Specification ?6.7.

       <PUC>, short for PidUrlClasspath, can be one of:

              • local process PID

              • remote process URL, in the format of 'hostname:port'

              • classpath of JAR on the filesystem (classpath separator is ':')

       <SAVE METHOD> can be one of:

              • 'dir' - Result will be saved as '<PATH>/fully/qualified/name.class'. Default for .class binaries.

              • 'fqn' - Result will be saved as '<PATH>/fully.qualified.name.java'. Default for .java sources.

              • 'exact' - Result will be saved exactly to '<PATH>'. Default for everything else.

              • 'default' - Saving uses the defaults mentioned above.

                                                                                              2022-01-07T16:54:25Z                                                                                       JRD(1)
