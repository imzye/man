NAME
       Weasel::Element - The base HTML/Widget element class

VERSION
       version 0.32

SYNOPSIS
          my $element = $session->page->find("./input[\@name='phone']");
          my $value = $element->send_keys('555-885-321');

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the base class for all page elements, encapsulating the regular element interactions, such as finding child element, querying attributes and the tag name, etc.

DEPENDENCIES
ATTRIBUTES
       session
           Required.  Holds a reference to the Weasel::Session to which the element belongs.  Used to access the session's driver to query element properties.x

       _id Required.  Holds the element_id used by the session's driver to identify the element.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
       find($locator [, scheme => $scheme] [, widget_args => \@args ] [, %locator_args])
           Finds the first child element matching c<$locator>.  Returns "undef" when not found.  Optionally takes a scheme argument to identify non-xpath type locators.

           In  case  the  $locator is a mnemonic (starts with an asterisk ['*']), additional arguments may be provided for expansion of the mnemonic.  See Weasel::FindExpanders::HTML for documentation of
           the standard expanders.

           Any arguments passed in the $widget_args array reference, are passed to the widget's constructor.

       find_all($locator [, scheme => $scheme] [, widget_args => \@args ] [, %locator_args])
           Returns, depending on scalar vs array context, a list or an arrayref with matching elements.  Returns an empty list or ref to an empty  array  when  none  found.   Optionally  takes  a  scheme
           argument to identify non-xpath type locators.

           In  case  the  $locator is a mnemonic (starts with an asterisk ['*']), additional arguments may be provided for expansion of the mnemonic.  See Weasel::FindExpanders::HTML for documentation of
           the standard expanders.

           Any arguments passed in the $widget_args array reference, are passed to the widget's constructor.

       get_attribute($attribute)
           Returns the value of the element's attribute named in $attribute or "undef" if none exists.

           Note: Some browsers apply default values to attributes which are not
             part of the original page.  As such, there's no direct relation between
             the existence of attributes in the original page and this function
             returning "undef".

           Note: Those users familiar with Selenium might be looking for a method
             called "is_selected" or "set_selected". Weasel doesn't have that
             short-hand. Please use "get_attribute"/"set_attribute" with an
             attribute name of "selected" instead.

       set_attribute($attribute, $value)
           Sets the value of the element's attribute named in $attribute.

           Note: Those users familiar with Selenium might be looking for a method
             called "is_selected" or "set_selected". Weasel doesn't have that
             short-hand. Please use "get_attribute"/"set_attribute" with an
             attribute name of "selected" instead.

       get_text()
           Returns the element's 'innerHTML'.

       has_class
       is_displayed
           Returns a boolean indicating if an element is visible (e.g.  can potentially be scrolled into the viewport for interaction).

       click()
           Scrolls the element into the viewport and simulates it being clicked on.

       send_keys(@keys)
           Focusses the element and simulates keyboard input. @keys can be any number of strings containing unicode characters to be sent.  E.g.

              $element->send_keys("hello", ' ', "world");

       tag_name()
           Returns the name of the tag of the element, e.g. 'div' or 'input'.
