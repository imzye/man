NAME
       graywolf - placement tool for digital VLSI design

SYNOPSIS
       graywolf [options] designName [windowId] [flowdirectory]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a utility used to perform placement of digital VLSI designs. It is based on some code from the early 90s and it is one of the building blocks of the open source qflow digital design flow.

OPTIONS
       -n     no graphics

       -d     prints debug info and performs extensive error checking

       -g     general mode

       -p     pick mode

       -w     parasite mode will inherit a window

USAGE
       Typically, you would be in a directory with a [DESIGN].cel file and a [DESIGN].par file and then run:

          graywolf [DESIGN]

       where [DESIGN] is the file name of the design. More information about the input and output files is found below.

       However,  it  is  recommended to use the qflow digital design flow instead of running graywolf directly. qflow prepares the input files from standardized files, and converts the output to standardized
       files.

INPUT
       Two input files are necessary to run graywolf. A .cel file containing the design, and a .par file containing the parameters which define the technology. The .cel file may be created from a  .blif  de‐
       sign file and a .lef library file with the script "blif2cel.tcl" in the qflow package.

OUTPUT
       The main output from graywolf is a .pl1 file containing the layout of the design. This may be converted to a .def file using the script "place2def.tcl" in the qflow package. A .def file is a standard‐
       ized description of a layout.
