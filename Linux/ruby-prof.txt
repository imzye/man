NAME
       ruby-prof - A fast ruby profiler

SYNOPSIS
       ruby-prof options <script.rb> [--] [profiled-script-command-line-options]

DESCRIPTION
       ruby-prof  is a fast profiler for ruby. It can be used as a stand-alone program (that this man page documents) or as a ruby library. Simply run the ruby program you want to profile using ruby-prof
       : ruby-prof script.rb At the end of execution the time spent in each method is displayed.

OPTIONS
       -p, --printer=printer
              Select a printer:
              flat - Prints a flat profile as text (default).
              flat_with_line_numbers - same as flat, with line numbers.
              graph - Prints a graph profile as text.
              graph_html - Prints a graph profile as html.
              call_tree - format for KCacheGrind
              call_stack - prints a HTML visualization of the call tree
              dot - Prints a graph profile as a dot file

       -m, --min_percent=min_percent
              The minimum percent a method must take before being included in output reports. this option is not supported for call tree.

       -f, --file=path
              Output results to a file instead of standard out.

       --mode=measure_mode
              Select what ruby-prof should measure:
              process - Process time (default).
              wall - Wall time.
              cpu - CPU time (Pentium and PowerPCs only).
              allocations - Object allocations (requires patched Ruby interpreter).
              memory - Allocated memory in KB (requires patched Ruby interpreter).
              gc_runs - Number of garbage collections (requires patched Ruby interpreter).
              gc_time - Time spent in garbage collection (requires patched Ruby interpreter).

       -s, --sort=sort_mode
              Select how ruby-prof results should be sorted:
              total - Total time
              self - Self time
              wait - Wait time
              child - Child time

       --replace-progname
              Replace $0 when loading the .rb files.

       -v     Show version, set $VERBOSE to true, profile script if option given

       -d     Set $DEBUG to true

       -R, --require-noprof lib
              require a specific library (not profiled)

       -E, --eval-noprof code
              execute the ruby statements (not profiled)

       -x, --exclude regexp
              exclude methods by regexp (see method elimination)

       -X, --exclude-file file
              exclude methods by regexp listed in file (see method elimination)

       --exclude-common-cycles
              make common iterators like Integer#times appear inlined

       --exclude-common-callbacks
              make common callbacks invocations like Integer#times appear inlined so you can see call origins in graph

       -h, --help
              Show help message

       --version
              Show version 0.13.1
