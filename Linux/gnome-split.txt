NAME
       GNOME Split - File splitter for GNOME desktop

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-split [-s|-m] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       GNOME  Split is a tool that allows you to split files and merge them back.  It is written in Java and uses a GTK+ user interface (thanks to the java-gnome project). The goal is to offer a na‐
       tive implementation of similar projects which can handle multiple file formats (e.g. Xtremsplit).

       -s, --split
              display the split view

       -m, --merge
              display the merge view
