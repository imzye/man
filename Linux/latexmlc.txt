NAME
       "latexmlc" - An omni-executable for LaTeXML, capable of
         stand-alone, socket-server and web service conversion.
         Supports both core processing and post-processing.

SYNOPSYS
       See the OPTIONS section in LaTeXML::Common::Config for usage information.

DESCRIPTION
       latexmlc provides a client which automatically sets up a LaTeXML local server
         if necessary (via latexmls).

         If such server already exists, the client proceeds to communicate normally.

         A stand-alone conversion (the default) can also be requested via --expire=-1
