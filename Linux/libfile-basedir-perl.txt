NAME
       File::UserDirs - Find extra media and documents directories

VERSION
       version 0.09

SYNOPSIS
        use File::UserDirs qw(:all);
        print xdg_desktop_dir; # e.g. /home/user/Desktop

DESCRIPTION
       This module can be used to find directories as informally specified by the Freedesktop.org xdg-user-dirs software. This gives a mechanism to locate extra directories for media and documents files.

FUNCTIONS
       May be exported on request.  Also the group ":all" is defined which exports all methods.

   xdg_desktop_dir
        my $dir = xdg_desktop_dir;

       Returns the desktop directory. Unless changed by the user, this is the directory Desktop in the home directory.

   xdg_documents_dir
        my $dir = xdg_documents_dir;

       Returns the documents directory. Unless changed by the user, this is the home directory.

   xdg_download_dir
        my $dir = xdg_download_dir;

       Returns the download directory. Unless changed by the user, this is the home directory.

   xdg_music_dir
        my $dir = xdg_music_dir;

       Returns the music directory. Unless changed by the user, this is the home directory.

   xdg_pictures_dir
        my $dir = xdg_pictures_dir;

       Returns the pictures directory. Unless changed by the user, this is the home directory.

   xdg_publicshare_dir
        my $dir = xdg_publicshare_dir;

       Returns the public share directory. Unless changed by the user, this is the home directory.

   xdg_templates_dir
        my $dir = xdg_templates_dir;

       Returns the templates directory. Unless changed by the user, this is the home directory.

DIAGNOSTICS
       ""xdg-user-dir" failed to start: %s"
           The executable "xdg-user-dir" could not be run, most likely because it was not installed. See "DEPENDENCIES".

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       The  location  of the directories can be specified by the user in the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/user-dirs.dirs. It is a shell file setting a number of environment variables. To find the exact pathname
       from Perl, run:

        use File::BaseDir qw(config_home);
        print config_home('user-dirs.dirs');

   Example customised user-dirs.dirs
        XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Workspace"
        XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR="$HOME/Files"
        XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$HOME/Files/Downloads"
        XDG_MUSIC_DIR="$HOME/Files/Audio"
        XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/Files/Images"
        XDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR="$HOME/public_html"
        XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR="$HOME/Files/Document templates"
        XDG_VIDEOS_DIR="$HOME/Files/Video"

DEPENDENCIES
       This module requires the executable xdg-user-dir from the package "xdg-user-dirs". Source code is available from <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-user-dirs/>.
