NAME
       File::Slurp::WithinPolicy - Applies filesystem policies to File::Slurp

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Slurp::WithinPolicy qw(:all);

         my $text = read_file( 'filename' );
         my @lines = read_file( 'filename' );
         write_file( 'filename', $text );
         append_file( 'filename', $more_text );
         overwrite_file( 'filename', $text );
         my @files = read_dir( '/path/to/dir' );

DESCRIPTION
       This provides the File::Slurp interface within a policy defined by File::Policy.  By default, File::Policy is a no-op and this behaves identically to File::Slurp.  System administrators may want
       to override the default File::Policy implementation to enforce a local filesystem policy (see File::Policy).
