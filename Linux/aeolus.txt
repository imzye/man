NAME
       aeolus - synthesised pipe organ emulator

DESCRIPTION
       Aeolus  is  a synthesised (i.e. not sampled) pipe organ emulator that should be good enough to make an organist enjoy playing it. It is a software synthesiser optimised for this job, with possibly
       hundreds of controls for each stop, that enable the user to "voice" his instrument.

       Main features of the default instrument: three manuals and one pedal, five different temperaments, variable tuning, MIDI control of course, stereo, surround or Ambisonics  output,  flexible  audio
       controls including a large church reverb.
