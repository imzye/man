NAME
       nvidia-bug-report.sh - creates a report to troubleshoot NVIDIA driver problems.

SYNOPSIS
       nvidia-bug-report.sh

DESCRIPTION
       nvidia-bug-report.sh collects information about your system (requires root privileges) and creates a file called 'nvidia-bug-report.log.gz' in order to diagnose NVIDIA driver issues. This file can
       then be sent to linux-bugs@nvidia.com or reported to the NVIDIA Linux forum (https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/board/98/linux/).

NOTES
       To  make  sure  this  log  file includes as much relevant information as possible, please start the X server with `startx -- -logverbose 6` and run `nvidia-bug-report.sh` after the problem has oc‐
       curred.  If X can not be started or the machine appears to have crashed, please check if you can log into it remotely (e.g. via ssh or telnet) and run `nvidia-bug-report.sh` in the  remote  shell,
       if possible.
