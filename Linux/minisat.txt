NAME
       minisat - fast and lightweight SAT solver

SYNOPSIS
       minisat [options] input-file result-output-file

       minisat takes as input a plain or gzipped DIMACS formatted file. The satisfiability of this input problem is indicated both via standard output and the return value.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the minisat command. MiniSat is a minimalistic, open-source SAT solver, developed to help researchers and developers alike to get started on SAT. Winning all the
       industrial categories of the SAT 2005 competition, MiniSat is a good starting point both for future research in SAT, and for applications using SAT.

       Despite the NP completeness of the satisfiability problem of Boolean formulas (SAT), SAT solvers are often able to decide this problem in a reasonable time frame. As all other NP complete problems
       are reducible to SAT, the solvers have become a general purpose tool for this class of problems.

OPTIONS
       --help, --help-verb Show (verbose) summary of options.

       -pre, -no-pre
              Enable (default) or disable preprocessing.

       -verb {0,1,2}
              Set the verbosity of informational output (set to 0 for silent, defaults to 1)

       -cpu-lim <unsigned>
              Set a limit on CPU time (seconds, defaults to 2147483647).

       -mem-lim <unsigned>
              Set a limit on memory usage (MB, defaults to 2147483647).

       -dimacs <output-file>
              Print (possibly preprocessed) input problem in DIMACS format and stop.

       -luby, -no-luby
              Enable (default) or disable the Luby restart sequence.

       -rnd-init, -no-rnd-init
              Randomize the initial activity values (defaults to off).

       -gc-frac <double>
              The fraction of wasted memory allowed before a garbage collection is triggered (non-negative, defaults to 0.2).

       -rinc <double>

       -var-decay <double>
              Variable activity decay factor (0 <= value <= 1, defaults to 0.95).

       -cla-decay <double>
              Clause activity decay factor (0 <= value <= 1, defaults to 0.999).

       -rnd-freq <double>
              The frequency with which the decision heuristic tries to choose a random variable (0 <= value <= 1, defaults to 0).

       -rnd-seed <double>
              Random seed  for random variable selection (non-negative, defaults to 9.16483e+07).

       -phase-saving {0,1,2}
              Controls the level of phase saving (0=none, 1=limited, 2=full, defaults to 2).

       -ccmin-mode {0,1,2}
              Controls conflict clause minimization (0=none, 1=basic, 2=deep, defaults to 2)

       -rfirst <int>
              The base restart interval (positive, defaults to 100).

       -rcheck, -no-rcheck
              Enable (costly) or disable (default) checking for redundant clauses.

       -asymm, -no-asymm
              Shrink clauses by asymmetric branching (disabled by default).

       -elim, -no-elim
              Perform variable elimination (enabled by default).

       -simp-gc-frac <double>
              The fraction of wasted memory allowed before a garbage collection is triggered during simplification (non-negative, defaults to 0.5).

       -sub-lim <int>
              Do not check if subsumption against a clause larger than this value (-1 <= value, defaults to 1000). -1 means no limit.

       -cl-lim <int>
              Variables are not eliminated if they produce a resolvent with a length above this limit (-1 <= value, defaults to 20). -1 means no limit.

       -grow <int>
              Number of additional clauses that may be introduced when eliminating a variable.  Defaults to 0.

EXIT CODES
       0  if  parsing  the  command line options fails, usage information is requested, or output of the input problem in DIMACS format succeeds.  1 if interrupted by SIGINT or if an input file cannot be
       read, 3 if parsing the input fails, 10 if found satisfiable, and 20 if found unsatisfiable.
