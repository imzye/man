DESCRIPTION
       A  PCU  (Packet  Control  Unit) is one of the two GPRS elements in the BSS. It implements the RLC and MAC layers of the GPRS Um (radio) interface on the MS-facing side, as well as the Gb Interface
       (NS,BSSGP) on the SGSN-facing side.

       OsmoPCU is the Osmocom implementation of this PCU functionality.
