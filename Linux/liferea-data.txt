NAME
       Liferea - GTK desktop news aggregator

SYNOPSIS
       liferea [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Liferea  (Linux Feed Reader) is an aggregator for online news feeds.  It can be used to maintain a list of subscribed feeds, browse and search through their items and displays their contents.  Ad‐
       ditionally Liferea allows one to sync subscriptions and read headlines with online accounts of TinyTinyRSS and TheOldReader.

OPTIONS
       Liferea options:

       -v, --version
              Print version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display a option overview and exit.

       -a, --add-feed=URI
              Add a new subscription URI which can be a feed or website URL.

       -w, --mainwindow-state=STATE
              Start Liferea with its mainwindow in STATE: shown, hidden.

       -p, --disable-plugins
              Start with all plugins disabled.

       --debug-all
              Print debugging messages of all types.

       --debug-cache
              Print debugging messages for the cache handling.

       --debug-conf
              Print debugging messages of the configuration handling.

       --debug-db
              Print debugging messages of the configuration handling.

              Print debugging messages of all GUI functions.

       --debug-html
              Enables HTML rendering debugging. Each time Liferea renders HTML output it will also dump the generated HTML into $XDG_CACHE_DIR/liferea/output.html.

       --debug-net
              Print debugging messages of all network activities and display the HTTP/S User-Agent string.

       --debug-parsing
              Print debugging messages of all parsing functions.

       --debug-update
              Print debugging messages of the feed update processing.

       --debug-vfolder
              Print debugging messages of the search folder matching.

DBUS INTERFACE
       To allow integration with other programs Liferea provides a DBUS interface for automatic creation of new subscriptions. The script liferea-add-feed is a convenient way to use this interface.  Just
       pass a valid feed URL as parameter and the feed will be added to the feed list. You can also pass non-feed URLs to use feed auto discovery.  See the EXAMPLES section.

ENVIRONMENT
       http_proxy (for HTTP connections)
       https_proxy (for HTTPS connections)
              If  defined  and  a proxy is not specified in the Liferea preferences (which uses the proxy settings provided by dconf), their value will be used as proxy URIs. Both are used by many common
              CLI tools, so make sure to export them in a dedicated subshell.

       LIFEREA_FEED_CMD_TIMEOUT
              If defined, overrides the default timeout for feed generating commands with the number of seconds given in this variable. It must be an integer value greater than zero; invalid values  will
              be ignored.

       LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS
              If defined, randomizes and anonymizes the default HTTP/S User-Agent string.

       LIFEREA_UA
              If defined, its value replaces the default HTTP/S User-Agent string.

       LIFEREA_UA has always precedence over LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS, so the latter can be safely defined in global shell initialization files.

EXAMPLES
       $ http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:3128" liferea
       $ http_proxy="http://username:password@proxy.example.com:3128" liferea
              Will alter each outgoing request to use proxy.example.com on port 3128 as proxy. If DNS resolution does not work, an IP address can be used instead.

       $ LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS=1 liferea --debug-net
              Will alter each outgoing HTTP/S request to randomize Liferea's version and hide the operative system in use.  In addition, prints the HTTP/S User-Agent and all outgoing network requests.

       $ LIFEREA_UA="Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0" liferea
              Will alter each outgoing HTTP/S request to pose as Firefox on Linux.

       $ liferea-add-feed "feed:https://www.example.com/feed.rss"
       $ liferea --add-feed "https://www.example.com/feed.rss"
              Subscribe to "example.com/feed.rss". Remember to supply a valid and correctly escaped feed URL as parameter. Please note that Liferea needs to be running for liferea-add-feed to work.

FILES

              Contains the current list of subscriptions.

       $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/liferea/liferea.css
