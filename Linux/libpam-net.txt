NAME
       pam_usernet - join the user own network namespace at login

SYNOPSIS
       pam_usernet.so

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_usernet PAM module allow each user in usernet group to have their own network namespace.

       If a network namespace having the same name as the username exists, pam runs the user shell in that namespace. If such a namespace does does not exist, it is created during the login process.

       The system administrator can create a network namespace for each user in usernet group. Each namespace must be named after each username.  Users will get their own network namespace at login.

       When pam_usernet is used together with a specific cado(1) configuration users can configure their own networking services. (see https://github.com/rd235/cado)

OPTIONS
       group=groupname
           the module operates on users in the group groupname instead of usernet.

       lodown
           leave the localhost lo interface in the state DOWN.

       rootshared
           Leave the root filesystem / as shared so mounts can propagate out to the parent namespace. Warning: this feature can create security vulnerabilities if not properly used.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_IGNORE
           User does not belong to the usernet group.

       PAM_ABORT
           Error in retrieving the user id or in the namespace creation/joining.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           Success.

EXAMPLES
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/sshd or /etc/pam.d/login
