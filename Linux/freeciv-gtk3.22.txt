DESCRIPTION
       Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in  which  each
       player becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ul‐
       timate goal: To become the greatest civilization.

       Players of Civilization II® by Microprose® should feel at  home,  since
       one aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

       Freeciv  is  maintained by an international team of coders and enthusi‐
       asts, and is easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out
       there!

       This  is  the  client program used to connect to a Freeciv server - see
       also freeciv-server(6) . freeciv-gtk2,  freeciv-gtk3,  freeciv-gtk3.22,
       freeciv-qt,  freeciv-sdl, and freeciv-sdl2 can also spawn their own lo‐
       cal server for single-player games.

       This manual page only lists the command line arguments.  For  more  de‐
       tails  about using freeciv-gtk2, freeciv-gtk3,freeciv-gtk3.22, freeciv-
       sdl, freeciv-sdl2, freeciv-qt, or freeciv-xaw, see  the  Client  Manual
       which  can be found at the Freeciv website ⟨http://www.freeciv.org/⟩ as
       well as the documentation which is part of the Freeciv distribution.

OPTIONS
       The following options are accepted by all clients. They may not be com‐
       bined; that is, "-np caesar 5557" will not work, instead you would need
       to enter "-n caesar -p 5557". All options have a short form (single hy‐
       phen  and  single letter) and a long form (double hyphen and a complete
       word); their effects are identical.

       -A protocol, --Announce protocol
              Uses protocol when searching for games on a LAN.  Possible  val‐
              ues for protocol are:

              IPv4

              IPv6

              none

       -a, --autoconnect
              Skips  the  connect  dialog, automatically inserting the default
              values. This is quite convenient when all has been set up  prop‐
              erly.

       -d level_number, --debug level_number
              Sets  the  amount  of  debugging information to be logged in the
              file  named  by  the  -l  option.  Acceptable  values  for   the
              level_number are:

              0    for fatal messages only.

              1    for fatal and error messages.

              2    for fatal, error and normal messages (default).

              3    for fatal, error, normal, and verbose messages.

       -F [ signal_number ], --Fatal [ signal_number ]
              Raise  a custom signal on failed assertion.  If signal_number is
              not specified, then the ABRT signal will be used.

       -f filename, --file filename
              Loads a saved game file (filename). This is for reloading previ‐
              ously  saved  games,  or for starting scenarios from the command
              line.

       -h, --help
              Prints a short summary of the standard command line options.

       -l filename, --log filename
              Defines a log file, filename, to be produced during  processing.
              Use the -d option to set how much is logged.  By default, fatal,
              error, and normal messages are printed to standard output.  With
              a  log  file,  such messages go to the log instead.  If filename
              already exists, it is appended to.

       -M URL, --Meta URL
              Specifies the URL of the metaserver to connect to. A  metaserver
              is  a  place  where  Freeciv servers can publish their presence.
              Freeciv clients consult the metaserver to offer users  a  selec‐
              tion  of  games to join. By default, the standard metaserver run
              by the Freeciv maintainers will be used.

       -n name, --name name
              Specifies the user name (name) to use to connect to the  server.
              This option is critical when reconnecting to a game. Please note
              that you might need to quote your username.

       -p port, --port port
              Specifies the server port to connect  to.  By  default  this  is
              5556, if in doubt ask the server administrator.

       -P string, --Plugin string
              Specifies the plugin to use for sound output.  Available options
              for string are:

              none

              sdl

       -r filename, --read filename
              Specifies a file, filename, of server commands  which  a  server
              spawned by the client will automatically read and process, as if
              you had typed them in at the server's prompt.

       -s address, --server address
              Specifies the game server address to  connect  to.  This  server
              might easily run on the same machine as the client.

       -S name, --Sound name
              Specifies  the sound set to use. A file called name.soundspec is
              searched for in the usual places (see the FILES section).

       -t name, --tiles name
              Specifies the map graphics ("tiles") to be used within the game.
              A  file called name.tilespec is searched for in the usual places
              (see the FILES section). Currently the following  tilespecs  are
              distributed with Freeciv:

              • amplio2.tilespec

              • cimpletoon.tilespec

              • hex2t.tilespec

              • isophex.tilespec

              • isotrident.tilespec

              • trident.tilespec

       -v, --version
              Prints the version number and exits.

       --     All  parameters  following this -- will be considered as client-
              specific parameters.

       -- -e, -- --eventthread
              Initializes the event subsystem in other thread.  Only available
              for the freeciv-sdl client under Linux or BeOS.

       -- -f, -- --fullscreen
              Starts  the  client in full screen mode. Only implemented in the
              freeciv-sdl and freeciv-sdl2 client.

       -- -h, -- --help
              Print the client-specific parameter help.

       -- -r WIDTHxHEIGHT, -- --resolution WIDTHxHEIGHT
              Behave as if screen resolution were  WIDTHxHEIGHT.  Only  imple‐
              mented in the freeciv-gtk3 and freeciv-gtk3.22 clients.

       -- -t theme, -- --theme theme
              Use  a particular GUI theme. Only implemented in the freeciv-sdl
              and freeciv-sdl2 clients.

EXAMPLES
       freeciv-gtk3 --name "King Richard" --server io.daimi.aau.dk
              Starts the GTK3 client using the name King Richard and  connect‐
              ing to the server at io.daimi.aau.dk.

       freeciv-sdl -a -t trident
              Starts the SDL client with the trident tiles and autoconnects to
              localhost.

FILES
       ~/.freeciv/freeciv-client-rc-[version-number]
              This is where your local settings will be stored.

       tilespecs
              These are searched for in the data path; see ENVIRONMENT.

       soundspecs
              These are searched for in the data path; see ENVIRONMENT.

       The freeciv-modpack(6) utility can be used to locate and download addi‐
       tional  content  such as tilesets and soundsets and (for client-spawned
       servers only) scenarios and rulesets; it saves files under ~/.freeciv .

ENVIRONMENT
       The Freeciv client accepts these environment variables:

       FREECIV_CAPS
              A string containing a list of  "capabilities"  provided  by  the
              server.  The compiled-in default should be correct for most pur‐
              poses, but if you are familiar with the capability  facility  in
              the  source  you  may use it to enforce some constraints between
              clients and server.

       FREECIV_COMPRESSION_LEVEL
              Sets the compression level for network traffic.

       FREECIV_DATA_ENCODING
              Sets the character encoding used for data files, savegames,  and
              network  strings).  This should not normally be changed from the
              default of UTF-8, since that is the format of the supplied rule‐
              sets and the standard network protocol.

       FREECIV_INTERNAL_ENCODING
              Sets  the  character  encoding  used  internally  by the freeciv
              client.  This generally needs to match the GUI toolkit,  so  its
              default  depends on the specific client; most clients default to
              UTF-8.

       FREECIV_LOCAL_ENCODING
              Sets the local character encoding (used for the command line and
              terminal  output). The default is inferred from other aspects of
              the environment.

       FREECIV_MULTICAST_GROUP
              Sets the multicast group (for the LAN tab).

       FREECIV_DATA_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories pointing  to  the  freeciv
              data  directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following di‐
              rectories, in order, for any data files: the current  directory;
              the  "data" subdirectory of the current directory; the subdirec‐
              tory ".freeciv/2.6" in the user's home directory; and the direc‐
              tory  where  the files are placed by running "make install".  If
              not set, FREECIV_PATH is checked before these defaults are used.

       FREECIV_SAVE_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories pointing  to  the  freeciv
              save  directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following di‐
              rectories, in order, for save files: the current directory;  and
              the  subdirectory ".freeciv/saves" in the user's home directory.
              If not set, FREECIV_PATH is checked before  these  defaults  are
              used;  in this case Freeciv also looks in "saves" potential sub‐
              directories.

              (This does not affect where the server  spawned  by  the  client
              creates   save   game   files;   these  are  always  created  in
              ".freeciv/saves" in the user's home directory.)

       FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories pointing  to  the  freeciv
              scenario  directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following
              directories, in order, for scenario files:  the  current  direc‐
              tory;  the  "data/scenarios"  subdirectory of the current direc‐
              tory;  the  subdirectories  ".freeciv/2.6/scenarios"  and   then
              ".freeciv/scenarios"  in  the user's home directory; and the di‐
              rectory where the files are placed by  running  "make  install".
              If  not  set,  FREECIV_PATH is checked before these defaults are
              used; in this case Freeciv also looks in "scenario" and "scenar‐
              ios" potential subdirectories.

              (This  does  not  affect  where the server spawned by the client
              creates  scenario   files;   these   are   always   created   in
              ".freeciv/scenarios" in the user's home directory.)

       FREECIV_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories to look for various files.
              This   variable   has   no    effect    if    FREECIV_DATA_PATH,
              FREECIV_SAVE_PATH  and  FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH  are  defined  to‐
              gether; those variables are  the  recommended  way  to  override
              paths,  with FREECIV_PATH provided only for backward compatibil‐
              ity with older versions of Freeciv; FREECIV_PATH will be removed
              in a future release. The precise search path depends on the type
              of file being searched for.

       FREECIV_OPT
              Specifies  a  file  to  contain  local  settings,   instead   of
              ~/.freeciv/freeciv-client-rc-[version-number].

       HOME   Specifies the user's home directory.

       http_proxy
              Set this variable accordingly when using a proxy.

       LANG  or  LANGUAGE
              Sets the language and locale on some platforms.

       LC_ALL  or  LC_CTYPE
              Similar to LANG (see documentation for your system).

       USER   Specifies the username of the current user.
