NAME
       maketext - translate and make messages

SYNOPSIS
         maketext [OPTION] [--domain=TEXTDOMAIN] MSGKEY [PARAM...]
         maketext [OPTION] -s MSGKEY [PARAM...]

DESCRIPTION
       The "maketext" script translates a natural language message into the user's language, by looking up the translation in a message MO file, and process the plural transformation with Maketext.

       The "maketext" script is a command-line interface to Locale::Maketext::Gettext(3) (and Locale::Maketext(3)).  It can be used in shell scripts, etc, to translate, maketext and return the result.
       By this way, it enables Maketext to be integrated into other programming languages/systems, like bash/csh, python, PHP, C, etc.  It works like the command-line program gettext.

       For example:

         % maketext -s "[*,_1,virus was,viruses were] found in [*,_2,file,files]." 0 1
         0 viruses were found in 1 file.
         % maketext -s "[*,_1,virus was,viruses were] found in [*,_2,file,files]." 1 3
         1 virus was found in 3 files.
         %

OPTIONS
       -d,--domain=TEXTDOMAIN
           Retrieve translated messages from TEXTDOMAIN.

       -s  Adds a new line to the end of the output so that it behaves like the `echo' or the `gettext' command.

       -h,--help
           Display the help messages.

       -V,--version
           Display version information and exit.

       MSGKEY
           The original text used to look up translated text.

       PARAM...
           Parameters to Maketext for the plural and other text functions.

ENVIRONMENT
       TEXTDOMAIN
           TEXTDOMAIN is used to determine the text domain when the -d parameter is not given.

       TEXTDOMAINDIR
           TEXTDOMAINDIR is used to search the message catalog/MO file if it does not reside in the system locale directories.

NOTES
       Maketext language function override, like "quant" or "numerate", is not available here.  Suggestions are welcome.

       The current system locale directory search order is: /usr/share/locale, /usr/lib/locale, /usr/local/share/locale, /usr/local/lib/locale.  Suggestions are welcome.
