NAME
       gdbm_load - re-create a GDBM database from a dump file.

SYNOPSIS
       gdbm_load   [-MUnr]   [-b   NUM]   [-c   NUM]   [-m   MODE]   [-u   NAME|UID[:NAME|GID]]   [--block-size=NUM]  [--cache-size=NUM]  [--mmap=NUM]  [--mode=MODE]  [--no-meta]  [--replace]  [--update]
       [--user=NAME|UID[:NAME|GID]] FILE [DB_FILE]

       gdbm_load [-Vh] [--help] [--usage] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       Create a gdbm database file DB_FILE from the dump file FILE.  If the FILE argument is not supplied, output the created database to the standard error.

       If the input file is in ASCII dump format, the mode and ownership of the created database are restored from the information in the dump.  This can be overridden using the command line options (see
       below).

OPTIONS
       -b, --block-size=NUM
              Sets block size.

       -c, --cache-size=NUM
              Sets cache size.

       -M, --mmap
              Use memory mapping.

       -m, --mode=MODE
              Set database file mode (octal number).

       -n, --no-meta
              Do not attempt to restore database meta-data (mode and ownership).

       -r, --replace
              Replace existing keys.  This must be used together with the -U (--update) option.

       -U, --update
              Update an existing database.  Key/value pairs from the dump file will be added to that database, without removing the existing keys.  To overwrite keys that are duplicated in the dump file,
              use the --replace option.

              If the database does not exist, it will be created.

       -u, --user=NAME|UID[:NAME|GID]
              Set file ownership.

       -h, --help
              Print a short usage summary.

       --usage
              Print a list of available options.

       -V, --version
              Print program version
