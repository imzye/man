CONDOR_FETCHLOG(1)                                                                              HTCondor Manual                                                                              CONDOR_FETCHLOG(1)

NAME
       condor_fetchlog - HTCondor Manual

       Retrieve a daemon's log file that is located on another computer

SYNOPSIS
       condor_fetchlog [-help | -version ]

       condor_fetchlog [-pool centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]] [-master | -startd | -schedd | -collector | -negotiator | -kbdd ] machine-name subsystem[.extension]

DESCRIPTION
       condor_fetchlog contacts HTCondor running on the machine specified by machine-name, and asks it to return a log file from that machine.  Which log file is determined from the subsystem[.extension] ar‐
       gument.  The log file is printed to standard output. This command eliminates the need to remotely log in to a machine in order to retrieve a daemon's log file.

       For security purposes of authentication and authorization, this command requires ADMINISTRATOR level of access.

       The subsystem[.extension] argument is utilized to construct the log file's name. Without an optional .extension, the value of the configuration variable named subsystem _LOG  defines  the  log  file's
       name. When specified, the .extension is appended to this value.

       The subsystem argument is any value $(SUBSYSTEM) that has a defined configuration variable of $(SUBSYSTEM)_LOG, or any of

       • NEGOTIATOR_MATCH

       • HISTORY

       • STARTD_HISTORY

       A value for the optional .extension to the subsystem argument is typically one of the three strings:

       1. .old

       2. .slot<X>

       3. .slot<X>.old

       Within these strings, <X> is substituted with the slot number.

       A subsystem argument of STARTD_HISTORY fetches all condor_startd history by concatenating all instances of log files resulting from rotation.

OPTIONS
          -help  Display usage information

          -version
                 Display version information

          -pool centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]
                 Specify a pool by giving the central manager's host name and an optional port number

          -master
                 Send the command to the condor_master daemon (default)

          -startd
                 Send the command to the condor_startd daemon

          -schedd
                 Send the command to the condor_schedd daemon

          -collector
                 Send the command to the condor_collector daemon

          -kbdd  Send the command to the condor_kbdd daemon

EXAMPLES
       To get the condor_negotiator daemon's log from a host named head.example.com from within the current pool:

          condor_fetchlog head.example.com NEGOTIATOR

       To get the condor_startd daemon's log from a host named execute.example.com from within the current pool:

          condor_fetchlog execute.example.com STARTD

       This  command  requested  the condor_startd daemon's log from the condor_master. If the condor_master has crashed or is unresponsive, ask another daemon running on that computer to return the log. For
       example, ask the condor_startd daemon to return the condor_master 's log:

          condor_fetchlog -startd execute.example.com MASTER

EXIT STATUS
       condor_fetchlog will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
