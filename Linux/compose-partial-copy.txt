NAME
       compose-partial-copy - copy part of compose to another location

SYNOPSIS
       compose-partial-copy [OPTIONS...]  COMPOSE DESTINATION

DESCRIPTION
       compose-partial-copy  copies  parts  of compose to another location via
       rsync. You can specify which variants and/or architectures you want  to
       copy.  Multiple invocations of rsync may be used to achieve the desired
       result.

       Unrecognized arguments will be passed directly to rsync.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       --arch=ARCH
              Copy only this architecture. Can be used multiple times.

              Any binary architecture is allowed. If you want the source  data
              (RPMs,  ISOs,  repositories  etc.) to be copied too, you have to
              explictly add --arch=src. If no arch filter  is  specified,  the
              variant  as  a whole gets copied including all binary and source
              content.

       --variant=VARIANT
              Copy only this variant. Can be used multiple times.

       -n, --dry-run
              Only print rsync commands, do not copy anything.

              You can append -- --dry-run at the end of command line  to  pass
              the  dry-run  option  to rsync. In that case it will actually be
              called, but just print some debugging information.

EXIT CODE
       This tool exits with status code of 0 on success and non-zero value  on
       failure.
