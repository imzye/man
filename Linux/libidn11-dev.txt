NAME
       stringprep_locale_charset - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stringprep.h>

       const char * stringprep_locale_charset( void);

ARGUMENTS
        void

DESCRIPTION
       Find  out  current  locale charset.  The function respect the CHARSET environment variable, but typically uses nl_langinfo(CODESET) when it is supported.  It
       fall back on "ASCII" if CHARSET isn't set and nl_langinfo isn't supported or return anything.

       Note that this function return the application's locale's preferred charset (or thread's locale's preffered charset, if your system  support  thread-specific
       locales).  It does not return what the system may be using.  Thus, if you receive data from external sources you cannot in general use this function to guess
       what charset it is encoded in.  Use stringprep_convert from the external representation into the charset returned by this function, to have data in  the  lo‐
       cale encoding.

       Return value: Return the character set used by the current locale.  It will never return NULL, but use "ASCII" as a fallback.
