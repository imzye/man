KEA-SHELL(8)                          Kea                         KEA-SHELL(8)

NAME
       kea-shell - Text client for Control Agent process

SYNOPSIS
       kea-shell  [-h] [-v] [--host] [--port] [--path] [--timeout] [--service]
       [command]

DESCRIPTION
       The kea-shell provides a REST client for the Kea  Control  Agent  (CA).
       It  takes  command as a command-line parameter that is being sent to CA
       with proper JSON encapsulation. Optional arguments may be specified  on
       the  standard  input.  The  request  is sent via HTTP and a response is
       retrieved, displayed on the standard output.

ARGUMENTS
       The arguments are as follows:

       -h     Displays help regarding command-line parameters.

       -v     Displays the version.

       --host Specifies the host to connect to. Control Agent must be  running
              at the specified host. If not specified, 127.0.0.1 is used.

       --port Specifies the TCP port to connect to. Control Agent must be lis‐
              tening at the specified port. If not specified, 8000 is used.

       --path Specifies the path in the URL to connect to. If  not  specified,
              an  empty  path  is  used. As Control Agent listens at the empty
              path, this parameter is useful only with a reverse proxy.

       --timeout
              Specifies the connection timeout in seconds. If  not  specified,
              10 (seconds) is used.

       --service
              Specifies  the  service  that is the target of a command. If not
              specified, Control Agent will be targeted. May be used more than
              once to specify multiple targets.

       command
              Specifies  the  command  to  be  sent  to  CA. If not specified,
              "list-commands" is used.

DOCUMENTATION
       Kea comes with an extensive Kea  Administrator  Reference  Manual  that
       covers all aspects of running the Kea software - compilation, installa‐
       tion, configuration, configuration examples, and much  more.  Kea  also
       features  a  Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea
       can print with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
       available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea distribu‐
       tion.     The     Kea      documentation      is      available      at
       https://kb.isc.org/docs/kea-administrator-reference-manual .

       Kea  source code is documented in the Kea Developer's Guide. Its online
       version is available at https://jenkins.isc.org/job/Kea_doc/doxygen/.

       The Kea project website is available at https://kea.isc.org.

MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT
       There are two public mailing  lists  available  for  the  Kea  project.
       kea-users (kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while
       kea-dev (kea-dev at lists.isc.org)  is  intended  for  Kea  developers,
       prospective  contributors,  and  other  advanced  users. Both lists are
       available at https://lists.isc.org. The community provides  best-effort
       support on both of those lists.

       ISC    provides    professional   support   for   Kea   services.   See
       https://www.isc.org/kea/ for details.
