DESCRIPTION
       GtkLP is an graphical frontend for CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing System.
       It is used to have an easy (and graphical) access to all of the many options of cups-managed printers.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by gtklp:

       -P printer
            Use printer as default destination.

       -d printer
            This option is equivalent to "-P".

       -c configdir
            Use configdir to set an alternative path to the configfiles for GtkLP.

       -S server
            The name of the CUPS-Server.

       -h server
            The same as -S.

       -p port
            The port of CUPS-Server, 631 per default.

       -l
            Only list the chosen options as a list of commandline-parameters for lpr.
            Nice for scripting purposes...

       -D
            Debug.

       -V
            Displays the version of GtkLP.

       -b
            Use builtin defaults instead of saved options

       -i
            Ignore data on stdin.
            Sometimes useful, e.g. for printing from some versions of the Acrobat Reader.

       -F
            Hide the File-Tab if file is given at the command-line.

       -U user
            The name of the cups-User to use.

       -# n
            Make n copies per default.

       -n n
            The same as -#.

       -H
            Help

       -C
            Force console-mode

       -o option=value
            Specify extra options, same syntax as lpr

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -q priority
            Specify the priority of the print job, from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest)

       -t jobname
            Specify the jobname

       -J jobname
            The same as -t.

       If called as lp, the following options differ from GtkLP`s options:

       -X   Force X-Mode, even if GTKLP_FORCEX is not set to 1

       -P page-list
            Specifies which pages to print in the  document.  The list  can  contain a list of numbers and ranges (#-#) separated by commas (e.g. 1,3-5,16).

       -H handling
            Specifies  when the job should be printed. A value of immediate will print the file immediately, a value of hold will hold the job indefinitely, and a time value (HH:MM) will hold the job un‐
            til the  specified  time.  (does this option work ?)

       If called as lpr, the following options differ from GtkLP`s options:

       -X   Force X-Mode, even if GTKLP_FORCEX is not set to 1

       -C jobname
            Specify the jobname

       -T jobname
            The same as -C.

       -p   Specifies  that  the print  file  should  be  formatted with  a  shaded header with the date, time, job name, and  page  number.  This  option  is  equivalent   to "-oprettyprint" and is only
            useful when printing text files.

       -l   Specifies that the print file  is  already  formatted for  the  destination and should be sent without filtering. This option is equivalent to "-oraw".

       Some other options from systemv`s lp and berkeley`s lpr are ignored
       without error message

PATHS
       GtkLP looks for config-files under
       <configdir>
       then under
       $HOME/.gtklp/
       and at last under
       /etc/gtklp/.

       To hide Printers from users, use the following pathes:
       /etc/gtklp/accept/
       /etc/gtklp/deny/
       $HOME/.gtklp/

       Just put an empty file with the name of the printer the user should see by default to accept, put an empty file with the name of the printer the user should never see to deny.  If only accept  ex‐
       ists, all but the accepted printers are allowed.  If only deny exists, all but the denied printers are accepted.
       All users can deny accepted printers, but they can't unhide denied ones.

SPECIAL
       In GtkLP you can define a browser to open the help URL, the CUPS-Homepage and so on.  Just use the your favorite HTML browser. The first $1 in command-line will be substituted by the URL.

       If you can't connect to an X-Server, GtkLP acts as console-lpr.

       If called as lpr, or lp, GtkLP acts on console and has some other command-line parameters, see above.

VARIABLES
       You can set the following environment variables to influence the behaviour of GtkLP:

       CUPS_SERVER
            The default CUPS-server to connect to

       IPP_PORT
            The default Port of the CUPS-server to connect to

       PRINTER
            The default printer to use

       GTKLP_FORCEX
            Set to 1 to force X-Mode for lpr and lp

ERROR
       GtkLP produces the following Error-Codes:

       0    normal program termination

       1    small error, wrong parameters, etc.

       2    Server Problems, server not found, no default printer found, etc.

       3    BAD error. Fields declared too short, too many printers, etc.
