Test::MinimumVersion(3pm)                                                           User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                           Test::MinimumVersion(3pm)

NAME
       Test::MinimumVersion - does your code require newer perl than you think?

VERSION
       version 0.101083

SYNOPSIS
       Example minimum-perl.t:

         #!perl
         use Test::MinimumVersion;
         all_minimum_version_ok('5.008');

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even an extremely long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last ten years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

FUNCTIONS
   minimum_version_ok
         minimum_version_ok($file, $version);

       This test passes if the given file does not seem to require any version of perl newer than $version, which may be given as a version string or a version object.

   all_minimum_version_ok
         all_minimum_version_ok($version, \%arg);

       Given either a version string or a version object, this routine produces a test plan (if there is no plan) and tests each relevant file with "minimum_version_ok".

       Relevant files are found by File::Find::Rule::Perl.

       "\%arg" is optional.  Valid arguments are:

         paths   - in what paths to look for files; defaults to (bin, script, t, lib,
                   xt/smoke, and any .pm or .PL files in the current working
                   directory) if it contains files, they will be checked
         no_plan - do not plan the tests about to be run
         skip    - files to skip; this can be useful in weird cases like gigantic
                   files, files falsely detected as Perl, or code that uses
                   a source filter; this should be an arrayref of filenames

   all_minimum_version_from_metayml_ok
         all_minimum_version_from_metayml_ok(\%arg);

       This routine checks META.yml for an entry in requires for perl.  If no META.yml file or no perl version is found, all tests are skipped.  If a version is found, the test proceeds as if
       "all_minimum_version_ok" had been called with that version.

   all_minimum_version_from_metajson_ok
         all_minimum_version_from_metajson_ok(\%arg);

       This routine checks META.json for an entry in requires for perl.  If no META.json file or no perl version is found, all tests are skipped.  If a version is found, the test proceeds as if
       "all_minimum_version_ok" had been called with that version.

   all_minimum_version_from_mymetayml_ok
         all_minimum_version_from_mymetayml_ok(\%arg);

       This routine checks MYMETA.yml for an entry in requires for perl.  If no MYMETA.yml file or no perl version is found, all tests are skipped.  If a version is found, the test proceeds as if
       "all_minimum_version_ok" had been called with that version.

   all_minimum_version_from_mymetajson_ok
         all_minimum_version_from_mymetajson_ok(\%arg);

       This routine checks MYMETA.json for an entry in requires for perl.  If no MYMETA.json file or no perl version is found, all tests are skipped.  If a version is found, the test proceeds as if
       "all_minimum_version_ok" had been called with that version.
