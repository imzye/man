NAME
       EMBOSS::ACD - parse EMBOSS ACD (AJAX Command Definition) files

AUTHOR
       Luke McCarthy <lukem@gene.pbi.nrc.ca>

SYNOPSIS
         use EMBOSS::ACD;

         $acd = EMBOSS::ACD->new($acdfile);

         $application = $acd->name;

         $description = $acd->documentation;

         @groups = $acd->groups;

         foreach $parameter ($acd->param) {
               while (($attribute, $value) = each %$parameter) {
                       ...
               }
         }

DESCRIPTION
       EMBOSS::ACD parses EMBOSS Ajax Command Definition files and provides object-oriented access to the data contained therein.

       For a complete specification of the ACD format, see http://emboss.sourceforge.net/developers/acd

       Note that no checks are performed to ensure that the ACD file is semantically valid.  Specifically, datatypes and attributes that aren't defined in the specification can occur in the file and will
       be parsed as normal.  This is a good thing, as the module remains useful even if new datatypes are added by local developers or the EMBOSS crew.

       Public methods are described below:

       new($acdfile)
           Parses the specified ACD file.  Returns a new EMBOSS::ACD object on success, and dies on failure.

           $acdfile is the full path to a valid ACD file.

       name()
           Returns the name of the application whose ACD file was parsed.

       documentation()
           Returns a short description of the application whose ACD file was parsed.

       groups()
           Returns a list of functional groups to which the application belongs.  For a list of possible groups, see http://emboss.sourceforge.net/developers/acd/syntax.html#sect2214

       param($param)
           Returns  a  reference  to  a  hash  describing  the  specified parameter.  The hash contains key-value pairs corresponding to the attributes specified in the ACD file, plus the keys 'name' and
           'datatype'.  The value of the 'datatype' key is the canonical name  of  the  data  type,  regardless  of  any  abbreviation  in  the  ACD  file.   For  a  list  of  possible  data  types,  see
           http://emboss.sourceforge.net/developers/acd/syntax.html#sect23

           If no parameter is specified, a list of all parameters is returned.  The members of the list are hash references as described above.

           Note that, in accordance with the ACD specification, attribute names are not expanded if they are abbreviated in the ACD file.

           $param is either undefined (see above) or the name of the desired parameter.

       canonical_datatype($datatype)
           Returns the canonical name of the specified abbreviated datatype, or undefined if the abbreviation is ambiguous or not recognized.

       None that I know of...
