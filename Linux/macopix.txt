NAME
       MaCoPiX - Mascot Constructive Pilot for X

SYNOPSIS
       macopix [ options ...  ] [ mascot-file ]
       macopix [ options ...  ] --menu menu-file

DESCRIPTION
       MaCoPiX is a desktop mascot program running under UNIX / X window systems.  This program could be an evolved one from ActX (Activate X window system).
       Currently, you can make following types of mascots using MaCoPiX.

                - Focus follower (Window sitters : likely ActX)

                - Fixed style      (Desktop wappen?)

       Furthermore, you can select with or without a digital clock for each types of mascots. So, MaCoPiX can be used as a sort of desktop clock applications. (But the clock function is still poor.)
       The biff function is also avairable for POP/APOP/UNIX local spool environments.  The all configuration of MaCoPiX, even including the creation and edit of mascots, is aveirable via GUI menu.
       And, please pay attention that mascot files of MaCoPiX has no compatibility with those of ActX.

ENVIRONMENT
       MaCoPiX is running on X Window System (should be running on a compositing window manager.)  of any UNIX operating systems.  But, you needs

            - Gtk+3      > ver3.22   (or Gtk+2 > ver2.24)

            - gettext    > ver0.10

       to run this program.
       MaCoPiX can be used on any Window Managers without any problems.

BASIC OPERATION
       -  The right click for popup menu.  In this poppup menu, you can change the current mascot and all configuration of MaCoPiX.  Furthermore, you can create new mascot from this menu.  If you want to
       save your changes, you should execute "Save" command in this popup menu.

       - The left drag for mascot's horizontal position change on title bar, if the mascot is in the window-sitter mode.  In the case of fix position mascots, the left drag should be the change of  fixed
       position of the mascot.

       - "Click Animation", "Sound Playback" & "Balloon Talk" can be shown
        with the left click on the mascot.

       - If you started it with the biff-mode, the biff bitmap appears in the case that you have new (or unread) mails.  The left click on this biff bitmap enables you to check From: & Subject: of unread
       mails.

       - If your mouse cursor entered the panel of digital clock (if you are using it), the date description tip appears on it.
