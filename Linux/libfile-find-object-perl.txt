File::Find::Object(3pm)                                                             User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                             File::Find::Object(3pm)

NAME
       File::Find::Object - An object oriented File::Find replacement

VERSION
       version 0.3.9

SYNOPSIS
           use File::Find::Object;
           my $tree = File::Find::Object->new({}, @targets);

           while (my $r = $tree->next()) {
               print $r ."\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       File::Find::Object does the same job as File::Find but works like an object and with an iterator. As File::Find is not object oriented, one cannot perform multiple searches in the same
       application. The second problem of File::Find is its file processing: after starting its main loop, one cannot easily wait for another event and so get the next result.

       With File::Find::Object you can get the next file by calling the next() function, but setting a callback is still possible.

FUNCTIONS
   new
           my $ffo = File::Find::Object->new( { options }, @targets);

       Create a new File::Find::Object object. @targets is the list of directories or files which the object should explore.

       options

       depth
           Boolean - returns the directory content before the directory itself.

       nocrossfs
           Boolean - doesn't continue on filesystems different than the parent.

       followlink
           Boolean - follow symlinks when they point to a directory.

           You can safely set this option to true as File::Find::Object does not follow the link if it detects a loop.

       filter
           Function reference - should point to a function returning TRUE or FALSE. This function is called with the filename to filter, if the function return FALSE, the file is skipped.

       callback
           Function reference - should point to a function, which would be called each time a new file is returned. The function is called with the current filename as an argument.

   next
       Returns the next file found by the File::Find::Object. It returns undef once the scan is completed.

   item
       Returns the current filename found by the File::Find::Object object, i.e: the last value returned by next().

   next_obj
       Like next() only returns the result as a convenient File::Find::Object::Result object. "$ff->next()" is equivalent to "$ff->next_obj()->path()".

   item_obj
       Like item() only returns the result as a convenient File::Find::Object::Result object. "$ff->item()" is equivalent to "$ff->item_obj()->path()".

   $ff->set_traverse_to([@children])
       Sets the children to traverse to from the current node. Useful for pruning items to traverse.

       Accepts a single array reference.

       Example:

           $ff->set_traverse_to([ grep { ! /\A\./ } @{ $ff->get_traverse_to }]);

   $ff->prune()
       Prunes the current directory. Equivalent to $ff->set_traverse_to([]).

   [@children] = $ff->get_traverse_to()
       Retrieves the children that will be traversed to. Returns a single array reference.

       (Example under "set_traverse_to").

   [@files] = $ff->get_current_node_files_list()
       Gets  all  the  files  that appear in the current directory. This value remains constant for every node, even after traversal or calls to set_traverse_to() and is useful to use as the basis of the
       argument for set_traverse_to().

       Returns a single array reference.

BUGS
       No bugs are known, but it doesn't mean there aren't any.

SEE ALSO
       There's an article about this module in the Perl Advent Calendar of 2006: <http://perladvent.pm.org/2006/2/>.

       File::Find is the core module for traversing files in perl, which has several limitations.

       File::Next, File::Find::Iterator, File::Walker and the unmaintained File::FTS are alternatives to this module.
