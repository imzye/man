NAME
       plmake - Experimental "make" utility based on Makefile::Parser

VERSION
       This document describes plmake 0.14 released on March 10, 2007.

SYNOPSIS
           $ plmake
           $ plmake test
           $ plmake -f Makefile all

DESCRIPTION
       This utility mainly serves as a quick check for what does and what does not work in Makefile::Parser. Please don't use it in production.

LIMITATIONS
       There are quite a lot of limitations in the underlying Makefile::Parser:

       •   Directives are not supported.

       •   Double colon rules don't work

       •   Multi-target rules are not supported.

       •   .PHONY is not supported.
