NAME
       ftptop - display running status on proftpd server connections

SYNOPSIS
       ftptop

DESCRIPTION
       The  ftptop  command  displays  the current status of FTP sessions in a
       continuously updating top like format.

OPTIONS
       -A          Filter the display to show sessions that  are  authenticat‐
                   ing.

       -a          Filter  the  display to hide sessions that are authenticat‐
                   ing.

       -D          Filter the display to show sessions that are downloading.

       -S          Specify the ServerName for a  specific  virtual  host.   If
                   used,  ftptop will only show sessions for the given virtual
                   host.

       -d          Specify the delay, in seconds, between  display  refreshes.
                   The  default  is  2  seconds.  Only values between 0 and 15
                   seconds are accepted.

       -f          Specify the full path to proftpd's run-time scoreboard file
                   (configured    via    the   ScoreboardFile   directive   in
                   proftpd.conf).  If proftpd's  default  directory  has  been
                   changed  via  this  directive, ftptop must either be recom‐
                   piled or  this  option  must  be  used  in  order  to  find
                   proftpd's  scoreboard.   -h  Display a short usage descrip‐
                   tion, including all available options.

       -I          Filter the display to show sessions that are idle.

       -i          Filter the display to hide sessions that are idle.

       -U          Filter the display to show sessions that are uploading.

       -V          Print out the version of ftptop and quit.

       While ftptop is running, hit the 'q' key to quit.  The 't' key  toggles
       between  display  modes.  Currently there are two display modes: normal
       and transfer speed modes.
