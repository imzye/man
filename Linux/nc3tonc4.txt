NAME
       nc3tonc4 - a program to convert netCDF 3 files to netCDF 4 format files

SYNOPSIS

       name

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nc3tonc4 command.

       nc3tonc4 is a program that converts a netCDF 3 file into netCDF 4 format, optionally unpacking variables packed as short integers (with scale_factor and add_offset) to floats, and adding zlib compres‐
       sion (with the HDF5 shuffle filter and fletcher32 checksum). Data may also be quantized (truncated) to a specified precision to improve compression.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -h     Shows a summary of the available options.

       -o     Overwrite destination file (default is to raise an error if output file already exists).

       --vars A comma separated list of variable names to copy (default is to copy all variables).

       --classic=(0|1)
              Use NETCDF4_CLASSIC format instead of NETCDF4 (default = 1).

       --zlib=(0|1)
              Activate (or disable) zlib compression (the default is to activate).

       --complevel=(1-9)
              Set the zlib compression level (6 is default).

       --shuffle=(0|1)
              Activate (or disable) the shuffle filter (it is active by default).

       --fletcher32=(0|1)
              Activate (or disable) the fletcher32 checksum (it is not active by default).

       --unpackshort=(0|1)
              Unpack short integer variables to float variables using scale_factor and add_offset netCDF variable attributes (it is active by default).

       --quantize=(comma separated list of variable name=integer pairs)
              Truncate  the  data  in  the  specified variables to a given decimal precision. For example, 'speed=2, height=-2, temp=0' will cause the variable 'speed' to be truncated to a precision of 0.01,
              'height' to a precision of 100 and 'temp' to 1. This can significantly improve compression. The default is not to quantize any of the variables.

       --quiet=(0|1)
              If set to 1, don't print any diagnostic information.

       --chunk=(integer)
              The number of records along unlimited dimension to write at once. The default is 10. It is ignored if there is no unlimited dimension. If chunk=0, it means write all the data at once.

       --istart=(integer)
              The number of the record to start at along unlimited dimension. The default is 0. This option is ignored if there is no unlimited dimension.

       --istop=(integer)
              The number of the record to stop at along unlimited dimension. The default is 1. This option is ignored if there is no unlimited dimension.
