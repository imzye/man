PGObject::Type::DateTime(3pm)                                                       User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                       PGObject::Type::DateTime(3pm)

NAME
       PGObject::Type::DateTime - DateTime Wrappers for PGObject

VERSION
       Version 2.0.2

SYNOPSIS
          PGObject::Type::DateTime->register();

       Now all Datetime, Timestamp, and TimestampTZ types are returned returned as datetime objects.  Date and time modules may require subclasses to serialize properly to the database.

ONGOING WORK IN 2.X
       During the 2.x series we expect to work on better NULL support.  Right now this is all delegated to clild classes, but there are likely to be cases where we add this to our library directly.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a basic wrapper around DateTime to allow PGObject-framework types to automatically tie date/time related objects, but we handle date and timestamp formats in our from_db
       routines.

       This specific module only supports the ISO YMD datestyle.  The MDY or DMY datestyles may be usable in future versions but datestyles other than ISO raise ambiguity issues, sufficient that they
       cannot always even be used in PostgreSQL as input.

       This module also provides basic default handling.  Times are assigned a date of '0001-01-01' and dates are assigned a time of midnight.  Whether this is set is persisted, along with whether
       timezones are set, and these are returned to a valid ISO YMD format on export, if a date component was initially set.

       This means you can use this for general math without worrying about many of the other nicities.  Parsing ISO YMD dates and standard times (24 hr format) is supported via the from_db interface,
       which also provides a useful way of handing dates in.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   register
       By default registers 'date', 'time', 'timestamp', and 'timestamptz'

   _new
       Constructor for the PGDate object. Fully compliant with DateTime "_new" constructor which it uses internally to instantiate objects.

       We need to hook this constructor instead of the regular "new" one, because this one is referred to directly on numerous occasions.

   today
       Wraps "DateTime::today", clearing the internal flag which causes "is_time()" to return a non-false value.

   last_day_of_month
       Wraps "DateTime::last_day_of_month", clearing the internal flag which causes "is_time()" to return a non-false value.

   from_day_of_year
       Wraps "DateTime::from_day_of_year", clearing the internal flag which causes "is_time()" to return a non-false value.

   truncate( to => ... )
       Wraps "DateTime::from_day_of_year", clearing the internal flag which causes "is_time()" to return a non-false value, if the "to" argument is not one of "second", "minute" or "hour".

   from_db
       Parses a date from YYYY-MM-DD format and generates the new object based on it.

   to_db
       Returns the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

   is_date($to_set)
       If $to_set is set, sets this.  In both cases, returns whether the object is now a date.

   is_time($to_set)
       If $to_set is set, sets this.  In both cases, returns whether the object is now a time.

   is_tz($to_set)
       If $to_set is set, sets this.  In both cases, returns whether the object is now a date.
