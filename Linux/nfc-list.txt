NAME
       nfc-list - list NFC targets

SYNOPSIS
       nfc-list [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       nfc-list  is  a  utility  for  listing any available tags like ISO14443-A, FeliCa, Jewel or ISO14443-B (according to the device capabilities).  It may detect several tags at once thanks to a mechanism
       called anti-collision but all types of tags don't support anti-collision and there is some physical limitation of the number of tags the reader can discover.

       This tool displays all available information at selection time.

OPTIONS
       -v     Tells nfc-list to be verbose and display detailed information about the targets shown.  This includes SAK decoding and fingerprinting is available.

       -t X   Polls only for types according to bitfield value of X:

                 1: ISO14443A
                 2: Felica (212 kbps)
                 4: Felica (424 kbps)
                 8: ISO14443B
                16: ISO14443B'
                32: ISO14443B-2 ST SRx
                64: ISO14443B-2 ASK CTx
               128: ISO14443B iClass
               256: ISO14443A-3 Jewel
               512: ISO14443A-2 NFC Barcode

              So 1023 (default) polls for all types.  Note that if 16, 32, 64 or 128 then 8 is selected too.

EXAMPLE
       For an ISO/IEC 14443-A tag (i.e.Mifare DESFire):

           ATQA (SENS_RES): 03  44
              UID (NFCID1): 04  45  35  01  db  24  80
             SAK (SEL_RES): 20
                 ATS (ATR): 75  77  81  02  80
