NAME
       nettle-lfib-stream - pseudorandom generator

SYNOPSIS
       nettle-lfib-stream [seed]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nettle-lfib-stream command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       nettle-lfib-stream  outputs  a  sequence  of  pseudorandom  (non-cryptographic) bytes, using Knuth's lagged fibonacci generator, optionally using the integer seed as the seed. If no seed is given,
       time(2) is used.

       Warning: The stream is useful for testing, but should not be used to generate cryptographic keys or anything else that needs real randomness.
