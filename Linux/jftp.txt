DESCRIPTION
        JFtp is a graphical Java network and file transfer client. It
        supports FTP using its own FTP API and various other protocols like
        SMB, SFTP, NFS, HTTP, and file I/O using third party APIs. It
        includes many advanced features such as recursive directory
        up/download, browsing FTP servers while transferring files, FTP
        resuming and queueing, browsing the LAN for Windows shares, and
