NAME
       App::REPL - A container for functions for the iperl program

VERSION
       Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
       This module contains functions that the iperl program automatically imports into any package it enters, for interactive convenience.

       Please see the README for general information.

EXPORT
FUNCTIONS
   x
       Print arguments with "Data::Dumper::Dumper"

   p
       Print arguments with "print"

   env
       Return a hashref containing the (stored -- not current) lexical environment.

   ret
       Return a reference to the value of the previous evaluation -- that is, a reference to whatever irepl printed after the last Perl you evaluated.  This function will probably evolve to take an
       argument $n, to return the $n'th previous result.

   rdebug ($value)
       With no arguments, bump $REPL::DEBUG.  With an argument, set $REPL::DEBUG to that.  This is for debugging iperl itself; currently at 1 it shows eval'd code, and at 2 it dumps the PPI document
       corresponding to entered code.

   help (commands)
       With no arguments, print a brief message.  With an argument, either print corresponding help or -- in the case of 'commands', currently the only optional argument -- call perldoc appropriately.

BUGS
       Does not reliably report errors in eval'd code.

       Does not try hard enough to collect a return value from eval'd code.

       Makes probably dangerous use of PPI.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-app-repl@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=App-REPL>.  I will be notified, and then
       you'll automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.
