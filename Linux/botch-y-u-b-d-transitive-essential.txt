NAME
       botch-y-u-b-d-transitive-essential - Find out why source packages are B-D transitive essential.

SYNOPSIS
       botch-y-u-b-d-transitive-essential [options] architecture Packages Sources [pkgname]

DESCRIPTION
       Find the reasons why source packages are B-D transitive essential.  Assumes that Architecture:all packages need not be bootstrapped.  Operates on the strong dependency graph.

       An optional package name as the last argument limits the output to that package.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display help.

       -k, --keep
           Keep the temporary files

       -T, --timers
           time all program executions

       -o, --output=DIR
           Output directory. Default is the current directory

       -t, --tmp=DIR
           Temporary directory. Default is created by mktemp(1)

       -v, --verbose
           Be more verbose

       -d, --debug
           Maximum verbosity

       -D, --develop
           Execute tools from the source checkout instead of $PATH

EXAMPLE
       To find out why src:sysvinit is b-d-transitive-essential, run:

        botch-y-u-b-d-transitive-essential amd64 Packages Sources sysvinit

       Edges from installation sets to source packages (builds-from relationships) can be hard to diagnose. You can use dose-ceve to create a graph that doesn't condense binary packages to their installation
       sets. This has the disadvantage that also non-strong dependencies are also included.

        dose-ceve -G pkg -T dot --deb-native-arch=amd64 --deb-builds-from --deb-drop-b-d-indep deb://Packages debsrc://Sources > graph.dot
        botch-graph-shortest-path graph.dot - --source __ID__:"src:build-essential (= 12.2)" --target __ID__:"src:sysvinit (= 2.88dsf-59.8)" > out.dot
        xdot out.dot
