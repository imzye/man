NAME
       emu8051 - Simulator/emulator for the Intel 8051 family of microcontrollers

SYNOPSIS
       emu8051 [OPTION]... [FILENAME]

DESCRIPTION
       emu8051 is a simulator/emulator for the Intel 8051 family of microcontrollers. It is available in two versions: a console (text-only) version and a graphical version (using the GTK+ toolkit). This
       is an Open-Source project. The program can load Intel HEX files.

       Once  loaded,  a program can be run (it will run indefinitely or until a breakpoint is encountered). You can also use the STEP button to execute only a single instruction at a time and see the ef‐
       fects on registers and memory.

       It is written in C++, and uses Perl scripts to generate automatically C++ functions corresponding to each assembly instruction of the 8051 microcontroller.

OPTIONS
