NAME
       oscap-docker - Tool for running oscap within docker container or image

DESCRIPTION
       oscap-docker  tool  can  asses  vulnerabilities or security compliance of running Docker containers or cold Docker images. OpenSCAP tool oscap(8) is used underneath. Definition of vulnerabilities (CVE
       stream) is downloaded from product vendor.

   Compliance scan of Docker image
       Usage: oscap-docker image IMAGE_NAME OSCAP_ARGUMENT [OSCAP_ARGUMENT...]

       Run any OpenSCAP oscap(8) command within chroot of mounted docker image. Learn more about arguments in oscap(8) man page.

   Compliance scan of Docker container
       Usage: oscap-docker container CONTAINER_NAME OSCAP_ARGUMENT [OSCAP_ARGUMENT...]

       Run any OpenSCAP oscap(8) command within chroot of mounted docker container. Result of this command may differ from scanning just an image due to defined mount points.

   Vulnerability scan of Docker image
       Usage: oscap-docker image-cve IMAGE_NAME [--results oval-results-file.xml [--report report.html]]

       Attach docker image, determine OS variant/version, download CVE stream applicable to the given OS, and finally run vulnerability scan.

   Vulnerability scap of Docker container
       Usage: oscap-docker container-cve CONTAINER_NAME [--results oval-results-file.xml [--report report.html]]

       Chroot to running container, determine OS variant/version, download CVE stream applicable to the given OS and finally run a vulnerability scan.

       In order to use different oscap(8) binary pass it like --oscap=<path/to/oscap>, as the first argument.
