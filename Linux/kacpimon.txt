NAME
       kacpimon - Kernel ACPI Event Monitor

SYNOPSIS
       kacpimon

DESCRIPTION
       kacpimon is a monitor program that connects to three sources of ACPI events:

              1. /proc/acpi/event
              2. netlink
              3. the input layer (/dev/input/event*)

       kacpimon then reports on what it sees while it is connected.

       Use kacpimon to make sure your kernel is sending acpi-related events via the three sources mentioned above.

       Since  both  acpid(8)  and  kacpimon connect to the same sources, be sure to stop acpid(8) before running kacpimon.  If you are using upstart(7), use initctl(8) to stop acpid(8).  If you are using
       systemd(1), use systemctl(1) to stop acpid(8).  If you aren't using either of those, you can try killall(1) to stop acpid(8).

       Be sure to run kacpimon as root or else it won't be able to open /proc/acpi/event or the input layer:

              sudo kacpimon

       If you want to pipe the output of kacpimon to a file, be sure to use the "Esc" key to exit rather than Ctrl-C.  Using Ctrl-C will cause output to be lost.

FILES
       /proc/acpi/event
              kernel ACPI event file
