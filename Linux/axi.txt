DESCRIPTION
       axiinvokes the interpreter command line interpreter. Without arguments, the interpreter is invoked interactively. With one or several arguments, the first argument is taken as the file to execute. The
       rest of the command line is the arguments for the file being executed. With the help of the file resolver, a file does not have to have the .alsor .axcextensions. When using a  librarian,  an  initial
       module  can be automatically loaded with the help of the moption. A double system separator can be used to separate the interpreter options with the program options. Normally, the encoding mode is au‐
       tomatically detected from the running session or from the system environment. However, the eoption might be used to overwrite the default settings, especially when an file  is  based  on  one  of  the
       ISO-8859 character set.
