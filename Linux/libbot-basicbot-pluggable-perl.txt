NAME
       bot-basicbot-pluggable - A standard Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable script

VERSION
       version 1.30

DESCRIPTION
       This script acts as standard interface for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable, a generic framework for writing pluggable IRC bots in perl.  It enables the user to administrate a full-fledged bot without
       writing any perl code.

SYNOPSIS
         bot-basicbot-pluggable --nick MyBot --server irc.perl.org

OPTIONS
       --server
           The server to connect to. Defaults to localhost.

       --configfile FILE
           Read config options from specified FILE. For a discussion of possible value and format refer to the section CONFIGFILE. The default to read the configfile found by Config::Find.

       --logconfig FILE
           The logging configuration will be read from the specified file.  Please refer to Log::Log4perl::Config for its format. The parameter loglevel will be ignored if this options is supplied.

       --loglevel LEVEL
           Sets the bots loglevel to one of the following levels in decreasing order of output: trace, debug, info, warn, error or fatal. Defaults to warn.

       --nick NICKNAME
           Nickname to use. Defaults to basicbot.

       --channel CHANNELNAME
           Channel to connect to. This parameter may be provided several times.  You do not have to prefix the channel name with a hash symbol, which would have to be escaped in shell. It's automatically
           added for you.

       --password
           Sets the admin password of the Auth module. This also loads the Auth module implicitly. Please be warned that this password will probably been seen on any process listing as on ps or top.

       --module
           Modules  to  load.  This  parameter may be provided several times. You can call --list-modules to get a list of all available modules. If you do not define any module via this option, Auth and
           Loader are loaded by default.

       --list-modules
           Lists all installed modules and exits afterwards. No bot is started.

       --list-stores
           Lists all installed storage modules and exits afterwards. No bot is started.

       --store
           Defines which storage module is used to save module settings. The default is Memory, which does not save any settings between sessions but does neither leave any files  nor  need  any  special
           settings.

           This  options  take  a  string in the form key=value and can be specified multiple times. The value of the key type define which storage backend to load, all other parameters are passed to the
           object constructor as hash reference.

           For example:

             ./bot --store type=Deep --store file=foo.deep

           That command will create an Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Store::Deep object and pass "file => 'foo.deep'" to its constructor.

       --charset
           Charset to use for the bot. Defaults to utf8, but you can use any encoding listed in Encode. The IRC protocol doesn't define a specific character-set to use.   This  presents  a  big  problem,
           because if you do not use the same as everybody else in the channel you just receive garbage.

       --port
           Port to connect to on target host. This defaults to the irc standard port 6667. You won't need to define this in most cases.

       --command-line
           The bot does not connect to any irc server, but will wait on stdin on commands from the user. This mode won't actually work with a lot of irc related modules like ChanOp.

CONFIGFILE
       The bot read a configfile either found by Config::Find (usually named ~/.bot-basicbot-pluggable.yaml) or specified on the command line via --configfile on startup. The file should be a syntactical
       correct  yaml  file  with  a  hash as its first level element. It understands every option listed above and the special settings parameter, which is a hash, where the keys are module names and the
       value is a hash of configurable module settings. Easier to show than to explain:

        ---
        server: host
        nick: bot
        settings:
          Karma:
            self_ignore: 0
        store:
          type: Deep
          file: foo.deep

       All modules listed under settings are also loaded on startup.

       Please remember that you have to escape hash (or pound) signs in YAML:

        ---
        channel:
          - '#botzone'
