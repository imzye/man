NAME
       Log::Handler::Output::Socket - Send messages to a socket.

SYNOPSIS
           use Log::Handler::Output::Socket;

           my $sock = Log::Handler::Output::Socket->new(
               peeraddr    => "127.0.0.1",
               peerport    => 44444,
               proto       => "tcp",
               timeout     => 10
           );

           $sock->log(message => $message);

DESCRIPTION
       With this module it's possible to send messages over the network.

METHODS
   new()
       Call "new()" to create a new Log::Handler::Output::Socket object.

       The following options are possible:

       peeraddr
           The address of the server.

       peerport
           The port to connect to.

       proto
           The protocol you wish to use. Default is TCP.

       timeout
           The timeout to send message. The default is 5 seconds.

       persistent and reconnect
           With this option you can enable or disable a persistent connection and re-connect if the connection was lost.

           Both options are set to 1 on default.

       dump
           Do you like to dump the message? If you enable this option then all messages will be dumped with "Data::Dumper".

       dumper
           Do you want to use another dumper as "Data::Dumper"? You can do the following as example:

               use Convert::Bencode_XS;

                   dumper => sub { Convert::Bencode_XS::bencode($_[0]) }

               # or maybe

               use JSON::PC;

                   dumper => sub { JSON::PC::convert($_[0]) }

       connect
           This option is only useful if you want to pass your own arguments to "IO::Socket::INET" and don't want use "peeraddr" and "peerhost".

           Example:

                   connect => {
                       PerrAddr  => "127.0.0.1",
                       PeerPort  => 44444,
                       LocalPort => 44445
                   }

           This options are passed to "IO::Socket::INET".

   log()
       Call "log()" if you want to send a message over the socket.

       Example:

           $sock->log("message");

   connect()
       Connect to the socket.

   disconnect()
       Disconnect from socket.

   validate()
       Validate a configuration.

   reload()
       Reload with a new configuration.

   errstr()
       This function returns the last error message.
