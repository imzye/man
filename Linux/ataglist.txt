NAME
       ataglist - print audio file metadata

SYNOPSIS
       ataglist FILE

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       ataglist only takes one argument. An audio file to work on. All other arguments are ignored silently.

DESCRIPTION
       ataglist transparently outputs tagname-tagvalue pairs in the following format:

        tag-name
        tag-value

       It can be used to find out and use meta-information from audio files in shell scripts and the like.

       Calling this program by hand is probably not that useful.
