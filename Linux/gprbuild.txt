NAME
       gprbuild, gprclean, gprinstall, gprconfig, gprls, gprname, gprslave - multi-language extensible build tool

DESCRIPTION
       These programs compile, clean and install multi-language projects specified by a .gpr GNAT Project File.

       The gprconfig tool creates configurations files for the other ones, interactively unless --batch is given.

       The gprslave tool is used for distributed builds.

       The gprls tool outputs information about sources, especially whether their objects are up-to-date.

       The gprname tool generates Naming attributes, which map Ada units to source files.

       Each of them will list understood options on standard output with --help.
