NAME
       lcmaps_ban_dn.mod - LCMAPS plugin to ban a user based on the Subject DN

SYNOPSIS
       lcmaps_ban_dn.mod [-banmapfile banning file] [-no_wildcard|-disablewildcard]

DESCRIPTION
       This  plugin  is  a banning plugin and will provide the LCMAPS system with a credential banning feature based on the Distinguished Name (DN).  It will read a
       grid-mapfile and check whether the DN appears on it. If that is the case, the plug-in will fail with a LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL.  If the plugin succeeds and  DN  does
       not appear in the banning file the plugin will finish with a LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS

OPTIONS
       -banmapfile ban-mapfile
              This option sets the path to the banning file which contains the list of DNs which must be banned by the plugin.  It is strongly advised to set an ab‐
              solute path to the ban-mapfile to avoid usage of the wrong file(path). In a (setuid-)root application,  relative  paths  are  taken  with  respect  to
              /etc/grid-security/.

       -no_wildcard, -disablewildcard
              When this option is set the plug-in will only match exact DNs, i.e. /DC=org/DC=terena/DC=tcs/C=NL/* will not match.

RETURN VALUES
       LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS
              Success.

       LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL
              Failure or banned.
