NAME
       GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc - Visualize a yacc grammar as a graph

SYNOPSIS
           use GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc;
           # no objects - quicker
           my $gd = GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc::to_graph('t/calc3.output');

           # populate a GraphViz2 object with a Graph::Directed of a parser
           my $gv = GraphViz2->from_graph(GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc::graphvizify($gd));

           # OO interface, using lazy-built attributes
           my $gvp = GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc->new(file_name => $file_name);
           my $gd = $gvp->as_graph; # Graph::Directed object
           # or supply a suitable Graph::Directed object
           my $gvp = GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc->new(as_graph => $gd);
           # then get the GraphViz2 object
           my $gv = $gvp->graph;

           # DEPRECATED ways to get $gvp with populated $gv
           my $gvp = GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc->new;
           $gvp->create(file_name => 't/calc3.output');
           my $gv = $gvp->graph;
           # or give it a pre-set-up GraphViz2 object
           my $gv = GraphViz2->new(...);
           my $gvp = GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc->new(graph => $gv);
           # call ->create as above

           # produce a visualisation
           my $format = shift || 'svg';
           my $output_file = shift || "output.$format";
           $gv->run(format => $format, output_file => $output_file);

       See t/gen.parse.yacc.pl.

DESCRIPTION
       Takes a yacc grammar and converts it into a Graph::Directed object, or directly into a GraphViz2 object.

FUNCTIONS
       This is the recommended interface.

   to_graph
           my $gd = GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc::to_graph('t/calc3.output');

       Given a yacc grammar, returns a Graph::Directed object describing the finite state machine for it.

   graphvizify
           my $gv = GraphViz2->from_graph(GraphViz2::Parse::Yacc::graphvizify($gd));

       Mutates the given graph object to add to it the "graphviz" attributes visualisation "hints" that will make the "from_graph" in GraphViz2 method visualise this regular expression in the most
       meaningful way, including labels and groupings.

       It is idempotent as it simply sets the "graphviz" attribute of the relevant graph entities.

       Returns the graph object for convenience.

METHODS
       This is a Moo class, but with a recommended functional interface.

   Constructor attributes
       file_name

       The name of a yacc output file. See t/calc3.output.

       This key is optional. You need to provide it by the time you access either the "as_graph" or "graph".

       as_graph

       The Graph::Directed object to use. If not given, will be lazily built on access, from the "file_name".

       graph

       The GraphViz2 object to use. This allows you to configure it as desired.

       This key is optional. If provided, the "create" method will populate it.  If not, it will have these defaults, lazy-built and populated from the "as_graph".

           my $gv = GraphViz2->new(
                   edge   => {color => 'grey'},
                   global => {directed => 1},
                   graph  => {rankdir => 'TB'},
                   node   => {color => 'blue', shape => 'oval'},
           );

   create(file_name => $file_name)
       DEPRECATED. Mutates the object to set the "file_name" attribute, then accesses the "as_graph" attribute (possibly lazy-building it), then "graphvizify"s its "as_graph" attribute with that
       information, then "from_graph"s its "graph".

       Returns $self for method chaining.

THANKS
       Many thanks are due to the people who chose to make Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> Open Source.

       And thanks to Leon Brocard <http://search.cpan.org/~lbrocard/>, who wrote GraphViz, and kindly gave me co-maint of the module.
