NAME
       rubiks_dikcube - solver for 3x3x3 Rubik's cube using Kociemba's algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       rubiks_dikcube -t

       rubiks_dikcube -p

DESCRIPTION
       Solves a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube using Kociemba's algorithm

OPTIONS
       -t     a configuration will be entered from standard input

       -p     a pattern will be entered from standard input

CONFIGURATION FORMAT
       The input should give the successive faces as follows:
                   B
                 L U R D
                   F

       although  different  letters  can be used. So first the first 9 faces of B, followed by 3 faces of L, U, R and D all three times, followed by the faces of F.  The program will give the translation be‐
       tween the symbols actually used and the symbols used in the solution. So you might give the faces in the order
                   T
                 L F R B
                   D

       but the program will use the translation T -> B -> D -> F -> U!  Error messages about wrong position are *after* translation!

PATTERN FORMAT
       A pattern can be entered in the following format, where a solved cube is represented by
           BBB
           BBB
           BBB
        LLLUUURRRDDD
        LLLUUURRRDDD
        LLLUUURRRDDD
           FFF
           FFF
           FFF*

       Whitespace and newlines can be omitted and the * is required to start the program.
