NAME
       astdb2sqlite3 - convert astdb to SQLite 3

SYNOPSIS
       astdb2sqlite3 path/to/astdb

DESCRIPTION
       Up  until version version 11, Asterisk used an old version of the Berkeley DB 1.86 (bdb) to store its internal persistent database. In version 11 it switched to using a SQLite 3 database. This program
       is used to convert an existing bdb astdb file to astdb.sqlite3.

       Normally the conversion is done by Asterisk itself which will run this program. But you may need to run it on your own.

OPTIONS
       There is a single (and required) parameter: the path the the bdb file.  The output file name will be the same as the input, with .sqlite3 appended.

EXAMPLES
       Asterisk will typically run the following to upgrade the database:

         astdb2sqlite3 /var/lib/asterisk/astdb

       which will create /var/lib/asterisk/astdb.sqlite3.
