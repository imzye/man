NAME
       smarteigenstrat - reduction of population bias for genetic analyses

SYNOPSIS
       smarteigenstrat -i <genotypefile>  -a <indivfile>  -b <snpfile>  -p <pcafile>   -o <outputfile>      -l <logfile>  -k <numpca>  -q <qtlmode>

DESCRIPTION
       The program smarteigenstrat is part of EIGENSOFT.

       The  EIGENSOFT  package  combines  functionality from the group's population genetics methods (Patterson et al. 2006) and their EIGENSTRAT stratification method (Price et al. 2006). The EIGENSTRAT
       method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls along continuous axes of variation; the resulting correction is specific to  a  candi‐
       date  marker's  variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. The EIGENSOFT package has a built-in plot‐
       ting script and supports multiple file formats and quantitative phenotypes.

OPTIONS
       -i     genotype file (PED, PACKEDPED, EIGENSTRAT, ANCESTRYMAP or PACKEDANCESTRYMAP format)-o  output file (chisq)

       -l     logfile (screen output,including error messages)

       -q     YES for quantitative phenotype or NO otherwise

       For quantitative phenotype, sixth column of .ped file or third column of EIGENSTRAT .ind file should be real numbers.  For non-quantitative phenotype, sixth column of .ped or third  column  should
       be 'Case' or 'Control'
