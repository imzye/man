NAME
       xrestop - monitor server resources used by X11 clients

SYNOPSIS
       xrestop --help
       xrestop [ --display display ] [ --batch ] [ --delay-time seconds ] [ --max-samples count ]

DESCRIPTION
       Xrestop  uses  the X-Resource extension to provide 'top'-like statistics of each connected X11 client's server-side resource usage.  It is intended as a developer tool to aid more efficient server
       resource usage and debug server-side resource leakage.

OPTIONS
       --help, -h
              Show usage and exit.

       --version, -V
              Print version and exit.

       --display, -d <display>
              Specify X11 display to monitor.

       --delay-time, -t <seconds>
              Time in seconds between taking samples. Default is 2 seconds.

       --batch, -b
              Run in batch mode. Slightly more detailed information is streamed to stdout rather than the usual curses interface. This mode is intended for debugging a single client with something like
                xrestop -b | grep -A 15 appname

       --max-samples, -m <count>
              Specify number of times to gather and display results.  Default is continuous, which can be set with 0 (zero).

SEE ALSO
       X(7), top(1).

BUGS
       The X-Resource extension may not be 100% accurate.
