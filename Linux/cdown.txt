NAME
       cdown - query cddb database for info on a disc

SYNOPSIS
       cdown
       cdown     [-[0..9]|-d device] [-H H] [-P P] [-V|-?|-h]

DESCRIPTION
       The cdown command is a command to query the CD-ROM for track information, use this to fetch information on this CD-ROM from the CDDB databases (freedb.freedb.org), and then output the information in a
       form suitable for cdir(1).

       cdown prints the information it downloads on stdout, in a format suitable for appending to .cdtooldb.  Should there be an uncertainty as to which CD-ROM information it should  download,  it  prints  a
       list of alternatives to stderr and prompts for the user to select one.

       A network connection is required for this to operate properly.

OPTIONS
              -d device
                     specify the cdrom device

              -H host
                     get database using HOST (def=freedb.freedb.org)

              -P port
                     get database using PORT (def=888)

              -l     list available cddb hosts

              -[1..9]
                     specify /dev/cdromN (def=/dev/cdrom)

              -r     output raw answer of the CDDB server

              -v     verbose output

              -D     enable runtime debugging

              -V     print version, exit

              -[?|h] print help, exit

FILES
       ~/.cdtooldb - default database file.

ENVIRONMENT
       CDTOOLDBPATH - colon delimited path of database files to search.  It is not necessary to specify ~/.cdtooldb, as this is automatically added to the end of the search path.

       CDTOOLDEV - device file for cd-rom, overrides compile-time defaults.  CDDBHOST - host to query, overrides compile-time default
