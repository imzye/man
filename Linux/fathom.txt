NAME
       fathom - Command-line for probing Syzygy tablebases

SYNOPSIS
       fathom [--help] [--path=PATH] [--test] FEN

   WHERE:
       FEN    The position (as a FEN string) to be probed.

       --help Print this helpful message.

       --path=PATH
              Set the tablebase PATH string.

       --test Print the result only. Useful for scripts.

DESCRIPTION:
       This program is a stand-alone Syzygy tablebase probe tool.
       The program takes as input a FEN string representation of a chess position and outputs a PGN representation of the probe result.

       In addition to the standard fields, the output PGN represents the following information:
       - Result: "1-0" (white wins), "1/2-1/2" (draw), or "0-1" (black wins)
       - The Win-Draw-Loss (WDL) value for the next move: "Win", "Draw",
         "Loss", "CursedWin" (win but 50-move draw) or "BlessedLoss"
         (loss but 50-move draw)
       - The Distance-To-Zero (DTZ) value (in plys) for the next move
       - WinningMoves: The list of all winning moves
       - DrawingMoves: The list of all drawing moves
       - LosingMoves: The list of all losing moves

       The PGN contains a pseudo "principle variation" of Syzygy vs. Syzygy for the input position. Each PV move is rational with respect to preserving the WDL value. The PV does not represent the short‐
       est mate nor the most natural human moves.
