NAME
       bacula-dir - Bacula Director

SYNOPSIS
       bacula-dir [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the bacula-dir command.
       Bacula's Director Daemon acts as the controller of the network backup system: it is responsible for scheduling and coordinating backups across the network.

OPTIONS
       -c file
              Specify the configuration file to use.

       -d nn  Set debug level to nn.

       -dt    Print timestamp in debug output.

       -T     Send debug messages to the trace file.

       -f     Run in foreground (for debugging).

       -g group
              Set the group/gid to run as.

       -P     Do not create a PID file.

       -r job Run <job>.

       -s     No signals (for debugging).

       -t     Test the configuration file and report errors.

       -u user
              Set the username/uid to run as.

       -v     Set verbose mode.

       -?     Show version and usage of program.

TCP-WRAPPERS CONFIGURATION
       Tcpwrappers looks for the service name of the bacula daemons in hosts.allow , and the service names of these daemons is configured to be different from the binary.  The service names are configured to
       be %hostname%-%component% rather than bacula-dir (As defined in the bacula-dir.conf.in file)

       So the hosts.allow entry has to match %hostname%-%component% (servername-dir for example) instead of bacula-%component%

       WARNING: This means that if the hosts.allow file has the entry:

       bacula-dir: ALL

       you will not be able to run bconsole to connect to the local director!

       The entry would have to read:

       server-dir: ALL

       and this will allow the console to connect to the director.  (The process running is bacula-dir.)
