NAME
       ch-tar2dir - Unpack an image tarball into a directory

SYNOPSIS
          $ ch-tar2dir TARBALL DIR

DESCRIPTION
       Extract  the  tarball  TARBALL into a subdirectory of DIR.  TARBALL must contain a Linux filesystem image, e.g. as created by ch-docker2tar, and be compressed with gzip or xz. If TARBALL has no exten‐
       sion, try appending .tar.gz and .tar.xz.

       Inside DIR, a subdirectory will be created whose name corresponds to the name of the tarball with .tar.gz or other suffix removed. If such a directory exists already and appears to be  a  Charliecloud
       container image, it is removed and replaced. If the existing directory doesn’t appear to be a container image, the script aborts with an error.

       Additional arguments:

          --help print help and exit

          --version
                 print version and exit

       WARNING:
          Placing DIR on a shared file system can cause significant metadata load on the file system servers. This can result in poor performance for you and all your colleagues who use the same file system.
          Please consult your site admin for a suitable location.

EXAMPLE
          $ ls -lh /var/tmp
          total 57M
          -rw-r-----  1 reidpr reidpr  57M Feb 13 16:14 hello.tar.gz
          $ ch-tar2dir /var/tmp/hello.tar.gz /var/tmp
          creating new image /var/tmp/hello
          /var/tmp/hello unpacked ok
          $ ls -lh /var/tmp
          total 57M
          drwxr-x--- 22 reidpr reidpr 4.0K Feb 13 16:29 hello
          -rw-r-----  1 reidpr reidpr  57M Feb 13 16:14 hello.tar.gz
