NAME
       nauty-hamheuristic - try to find hamiltonian cycles in any graphs

SYNOPSIS
       hamheuristic [-sgu] [-vq] [-L#] [-t#] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Apply a heuristic for finding hamiltonian cycles.

              Output those which are unsuccessful.

       -s     force output to sparse6 format

       -g     force output to graph6 format If neither -s or -g are given, the output format is determined by the header or, if there is none, by the format of the first input graph.

       -u     Suppress output to outfile, give statistics instead.

              The output file will have a header if and only if the input file does.

       -p     Be content with a hamiltonian path

       -v     Give a cycle or path if one is found.

       -L# Limit number of sideways steps (default 1000+5*n)

       -t# Try # times (default 1)

       -q     suppress auxiliary information
