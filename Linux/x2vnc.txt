DESCRIPTION
       x2vnc  will  let  you use two screens on two different computers as if they were connected to the same computer. The computer with the 'main' keyboard must be running X-window, and the second com‐
       puter should have a VNC server running which will update the contents on the actual screen. This means Xvnc is not suitable, but WinVNC is.

       In listen mode ( -listen option specified ) x2vnc will wait for a connection from a VNC server on ports 5400 and 5500 (plus the optional display# value) instead of connecting to  a  specified  VNC
       server.

       For up-to-date information on x2vnc, see the x2vnc home page: http://fredrik.hubbe.net/x2vnc.html

       -display display
              The X windows display to connect from.

       -shared
              Allow multiple connections to the same VNC server.

       -north, -south, -east, -west,
              Determine which edge leads to the other screen.

       -passwdfile password-file
              With  this  option you can start x2vnc without entering a password. The file is created by vncpasswd which comes with the X-windows VNC software.  If the file does not exist, x2vnc will ask
              for a password and create the file.

       -resurface
              This option will cause the trigger window to re-surface automatically if it is covered up by another window.

       -hotkey key
              This option allows you to select which key to use to warp the pointer to and from second computer. The default is "Control-F12", any combination of modifiers can be used,  such  as  "shift-
              alt-meta-ctrl-F1" (or s-a-m-c-F1).

       -edgewidth pixels
              This  is a workaround for some X servers which do not allow the mouse to go all the way to the edge of the screen. By setting this to 2 or greater, the mouse will be able to reach the x2vnc
              window and thus warp to the windows machine. The default value is 1. If you set this value to 0, no border will be generated, which means you will have to use hotkeys to switch to the  oher
              screen.

       -desktop desktop-number
              With this option, you can make x2vnc non-sticky. This may not work with all window-managers. Note that the first desktop is usually 0 (zero). If you want x2vnc to appear on the last (right‐
              most)  desktop,  use  -1.   This  option was especially created with the sawfish edgeflipping in mind, normally you would use "-west -desktop 0" or "-east -destkop -1" with Sawfish to allow
              edgeflipping to work normally.

       -timeout seconds
              This options tells x2vnc how long to wait before warping the cursor back to the X screen if there is no activity. The reason for this is that some screen savers, such as xscreensaver,  can‐
              not activate while x2vnc is in control of the cursor. The default value is 590 seconds, which is equivalent to 9 minutes and 50 seconds. Using a value of 0 will disable timeouts completely.

       -nowheel
              This option does nothing and is left for backwards compatibility only.

       -wheelhack
              This will make x2vnc tranlate all mouse wheel events into arrow up/down events. Only use this if your VNC server doesn't understand mouse wheel events.

       -reversewheel
              Invert the up/down direction of the mouse wheel emulation.  This option only works if -wheelhack is used.

       -scrolllines lines
              When using mouse wheel emulation, this selects how many up/down events will be sent for each tick of the mouse wheel.

       -navhack
              This will map button 6 & 7 to Alt+Left/Right, which will allow the navigation buttons on some mice to behave more like they do in windows.

       -mac   Macintosh specific mode, maps second mouse button to control-mouseclick.

       -trimsel
              If the X selection looks like a URL, trim leading and trailing spaces.  This can be useful for pasting URLs into a browser.

       -noblank
              Prevent  screen  blanking on the remote desktop while you are working on the local desktop. Requires the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER or XIDLE extension to work properly. If neither of these extensions
              are present, the remote desktop will always be kept from blanking.

       -lockdelay seconds
              This is only meaningful when using the -noblank option. When this option is present. With this option, x2vnc will not attempt to wake up the remote screen if you have  been  idle  for  more
              than the specified amount of time. This is useful if you need a password to unlock the remote screen and would rather leave it blanked until you need it.

       -debug This option will make x2vnc print out information about events it sends and receives to stderr for debugging purposes.

       -accel multiplier
              This  option  allows you to control the speed of the mouse on the remote screen. 2.0 means twice as fast, 0.5 means half as fast.  Default is 1.0. Note that this is multiplied with a number
              which x2vnc calculates based on screen sizes and other factors.

       -noreconnect
              This option prevents x2vnc from automatically reconnecting if the connection is closed.

       -tunnel
              This option makes x2vnc start an SSH tunnel to the machine being controlled by x2vnc. The SSH command used can be changed by setting the X2VNC_SSH_CMD environment variable. The default is:
              ssh -A -X -f -L "$LOCALPORT:$REMOTEHOST:$REMOTEPORT" \
              "$GATEWAYHOST" 'ssh-add;sleep 60'

       -via host
              This is similar to -tunnel, but tunnels through a host different than the machine being controlled by x2vnc.

EXAMPLES
       Most common usage:
       x2vnc -passwdfile $HOME/.vncpasswd -resurface host:0

       To make x2vnc start (and re-start) automatically, add the following to your your X startup file (usually .xinitrc):
        while :;
       do
         x2vnc -passwd $HOME/.vncpasswd -resurface host:0
         sleep 2
       done
