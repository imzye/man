NAME
       patchelf - Modify ELF files

SYNOPSIS
       patchelf OPTION FILE ...

DESCRIPTION
       PatchELF  is a simple utility for modifying existing ELF executables and libraries.  It can change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executables and change the RPATH of executables and li‐
       braries.

OPTIONS
       The single option given operates on each FILE, editing in place.

       Any option taking a string argument can also take a file by prefixing the argument with the @ symbol. See EXAMPLES

       --page-size SIZE
              Uses the given page size instead of the default.

       --set-interpreter INTERPRETER
              Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executable given to INTERPRETER.

       --print-interpreter
              Prints the ELF interpreter of the executable.

       --print-os-abi
              Prints the OS ABI of the executable (EI_OSABI field of an ELF file).

       --set-os-abi ABI
              Changes the OS ABI of the executable (EI_OSABI field of an ELF file).  The ABI parameter is pretty flexible. For example, you can specify it as a "Linux", "linux", or  even  "lInUx"  -  all
              those names will set EI_OSABI field of the ELF header to the value "3", which corresponds to Linux OS ABI.  The same applies to other ABI names - System V, FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.

       --print-soname
              Prints DT_SONAME entry of .dynamic section.  Raises an error if DT_SONAME doesn't exist.

       --set-soname SONAME
              Sets DT_SONAME entry of a library to SONAME.

       --set-rpath RUNPATH
              Change the DT_RUNPATH of the executable or library to RUNPATH.

       --add-rpath RUNPATH
              Add RUNPATH to the existing DT_RUNPATH of the executable or library.

       --remove-rpath
              Removes the DT_RPATH or DT_RUNPATH entry of the executable or library.

       --shrink-rpath
              Remove from the DT_RUNPATH or DT_RPATH all directories that do not contain a library referenced by DT_NEEDED fields of the executable or library.

              For instance, if an executable references one library libfoo.so, has an RPATH "/lib:/usr/lib:/foo/lib", and libfoo.so can only be found in /foo/lib, then the new RPATH will be "/foo/lib".

       --allowed-rpath-prefixes PREFIXES
              Combined  with  the "--shrink-rpath" option, this can be used for further rpath tuning. For instance, if an executable has an RPATH "/tmp/build-foo/.libs:/foo/lib", it is probably desirable
              to keep the "/foo/lib" reference instead of the "/tmp" entry.

       --print-rpath
              Prints the DT_RUNPATH or DT_RPATH for an executable or library.

       --force-rpath
              Forces the use of the obsolete DT_RPATH in the file instead of DT_RUNPATH. By default DT_RPATH is converted to DT_RUNPATH.

       --add-needed LIBRARY
              Adds a declared dependency on a dynamic library (DT_NEEDED).  This option can be given multiple times.

       --replace-needed LIB_ORIG LIB_NEW
              Replaces a declared dependency on a dynamic library with another one (DT_NEEDED).  This option can be given multiple times.

       --remove-needed LIBRARY
              Removes a declared dependency on LIBRARY (DT_NEEDED entry). This option can be given multiple times.

       --print-needed
              Prints all DT_NEEDED entries of the executable.

       --no-default-lib
              Marks the object so that the search for dependencies of this object will ignore any default library search paths.

       --no-sort
              Do not sort program headers or section headers.  This is useful when debugging patchelf, because it makes it easier to read diffs of the output of "readelf -a".

       --add-debug-tag
              Adds DT_DEBUG tag to the .dynamic section if not yet present in an ELF object. A shared library (-shared) by default does not receive DT_DEBUG tag.  This means that when  a  shared  library
              has an entry point (so that it can be run as an executable), the debugger does not connect to it correctly and symbols are not resolved.

       --print-execstack
              Prints the state of the executable flag of the GNU_STACK program header, if present.

       --clear-execstack
              Clears the executable flag of the GNU_STACK program header, or adds a new header.

       --set-execstack
              Sets the executable flag of the GNU_STACK program header, or adds a new header.

       --rename-dynamic-symbols NAME_MAP_FILE
              Renames dynamic symbols. The name map file should contain lines with the old and the new name separated by spaces like this:

              old_name new_name

              Symbol names do not contain version specifier that are also shown in the output of the nm -D command from binutils. So instead of the name write@GLIBC_2.2.5 it is just write.

       --output FILE
              Set the output file name.  If not specified, the input will be modified in place.

       --debug
              Prints details of the changes made to the input file.

       --version
              Shows the version of patchelf.

EXAMPLES
       To use the contents on an external file as a parameter:

              $ patchelf a.out --add-rpath @/tmp/generated-rpath.bin

       To change the RPATH of a binary. Note that $ORIGIN is a special symbol used by the loader, so must be quoted.

              patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN/../lib64' a.out
