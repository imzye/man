NAME
       Assemblytics - detect and analyze structural variants from a genome assembly

SYNOPSIS
       Assemblytics delta output_prefix unique_length_required min_size max_size

DESCRIPTION
       Assemblytics incorporates a unique anchor filtering approach to increase robustness to repetitive elements, and identifies six classes of variants based on their distinct alignment signatures.  Assem‐
       blytics can be applied both to comparing aberrant genomes, such as human cancers, to a reference, or to identify differences between related species.

EXAMPLES
       Generate the delta file with nucmer(1):

           nucmer -maxmatch -l 100 -c 500 REFERENCE.fa ASSEMBLY.fa -prefix OUT

       Then run the program:

           Assemblytics OUT.delta OUT 10000 50 10000
