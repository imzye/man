NAME
       xscreensaver-systemd - lock the screen when the machine suspends.

SYNOPSIS
       xscreensaver-systemd

DESCRIPTION
       The xscreensaver-systemd program is a helper program to integrate xscreensaver with systemd(1).  When run from ~/.xsession or equivalent, this will:

       1: Lock the screen before the system goes to sleep (using xscreensaver-command -suspend).

       2: Ensure the XScreenSaver password dialog is shown after the system is resumed (using xscreensaver-command -deactivate).

       This is implemented using inhibitor locks; sd-bus(3) is used for DBUS communication.

BUGS
       Uses libsystemd.
