NAME
       quasselclient — GUI of the Quassel IRC client, client only

SYNPOSIS
       quasselclient [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Quassel  IRC  is  a  modern,  cross-platform,  distributed IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core -- much like the popular combination of
       screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical.

       quasselclient connects to and manages a running quasselcore and will not work on its own. For a standalone IRC client experience, use the quassel monolithic program.
