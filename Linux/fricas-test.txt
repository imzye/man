NAME
       fricas-test - run the Fricas regression testsuite

SYNOPSIS
       fricas-test [ suitenames ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       fricas-test  is  a simple script provided by the Debian Fricas package to allow the user to run the regression test suite or portions thereof on their system after installation.  The full test re‐
       sults performed at build time can be found in /usr/share/doc/fricas-test/test_results.gz.  There is currently no facility for trapping unexpected errors.

       The optional arguments refer to the .input filename stems found in /usr/share/fricas/input.  Supplying no arguments will run the entire suite.
