SYNOPSIS
       emptty [-v] [--version] [-d] [--daemon] [-c PATH] [--config PATH] [-i] [--ignore-config] [-t TTY] [--tty TTY] [-u defaultUser] [--default-user defaultUser] [-a [session]] [--autologin [session]]

DESCRIPTION
       emptty Simple CLI Display Manager, that allows one to select DE/WM after login, use predefined config or allows autologin, if selected user is part of nopasswdlogin group.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Display the version of the program.

       -d, --daemon
              Starts emptty as daemon, that does not require agetty.

       -c, --config PATH
              Loads configuration from specified path.

       -i, --ignore-config
              Skips loading of configuration from file, loads only argument configuration.

       -t, --tty TTY
              Overrides loaded configuration by setting defined TTY. May be specified as a number (e.g. "7") or a TTY name (e.g. "tty7").

       -u, --default-user defaultUser
              Overrides loaded configuration by setting defined defaultUser.

       -a, --autologin [session]
              Overrides loaded configuration by enabling autologin. If session is defined, it overrides autologin session.

       DEFAULT_SESSION
              Preselected desktop session, if user does not use `emptty` file. Has lower priority than AUTOLOGIN_SESSION

       DEFAULT_SESSION_ENV
              Optional environment of preselected desktop session, if user does not use `emptty` file. Possible values are "xorg" and "wayland".

       AUTOLOGIN
              Enables Autologin, if DEFAULT_USER is defined. Possible values are "true" or "false". Default value is false.

CUSTOM MOTD
       Optional file stored by default as /etc/emptty/motd. Could be overridden.

       Custom file, that prints your own MOTD. Reading this file supports colors (e.g.  \x1b[31m or \033[32m )

USER CONFIG
       Optional file stored as ${HOME}/.config/emptty or ${HOME}/.emptty

       Configuration file stored as ${HOME}/.config/emptty has higher priority on loading.

       Name   Optional name to be used as Session Name.

       Exec   Defines command to start Desktop Environment/Window Manager. This value does not need to be defined, if user config is presented as shell script (with shebang at  the  start  and  execution
              permissions).

       Environment
              Selects, which environment should be defined for following command. Possible values are "xorg" and "wayland", "xorg" is default.

       Lang   Defines locale for logged user, has higher priority than LANG from global configuration

       Selection
              Requires  selection  of  desktop, basically turns emptty file into .xinitrc for Xorg and Wayland. In this case Exec is skipped. Possible values are "false" for never using selection, "true"
              for always showing selection or "auto" for showing selection or first option autoselect, if there is no other desktop. Default value is false.

       LoginShell
              Defines custom shell to be used to start the session. This allows starting the session with non-interactive shell e.g. "/bin/bash --login"

       DesktopNames
              Value passed into XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP variable.

USER EXIT SCRIPT
       Optional script file stored as ${HOME}/.config/emptty-exit, that is handled as shell script and is started, when session is going to end. Script is started even if emptty is being terminated.  The
       default timeout to finish script is 3 seconds, but it is configurable from the script itself.

       Timeout
              Optional custom timeout for script to finish its run, number represents seconds. Default is 3.

CUSTOM SESSIONS
       Optional folders for custom sessions, that could be available system-wide (in case of /etc/emptty/custom-sessions/) or user-specific (in case of  ${HOME}/.config/emptty-custom-sessions/),  but  do
       not have .desktop file stored on standard paths for Xorg or Wayland sessions. Expected suffix of each file is ".desktop".

       Name   Defines name of Desktop Environment/Window Manager.

       Exec   Defines command to start Desktop Environment/Window Manager. It could contain multiple arguments same as in *.desktop files.

       Environment
              Selects, which environment should be defined for following command. Possible values are "xorg" and "wayland", "xorg" is default.

       DesktopNames
              Value passed into XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP variable.

       NoDisplay/Hidden
              Boolean value, that controls visibility of desktop session.

LAST SESSION
       The last user selection of session is stored into ~/.cache/emptty/last-session

LOGGING
       As it is mentioned in configuration, there are three options to handle logging of emptty. The logs contains not just logs from emptty, but also from Xorg (if used) and user's WM/DE.  Described log
       location could differ according configuration LOGGING_FILE , that is stored in /etc/emptty/conf

       default
              This option provides simple solution, when current instance of emptty logs into /var/log/emptty/[TTY_NUMBER].log and the previous version is stored as /var/log/emptty/[TTY_NUMBER].log.old

              NOTE: Current instance always move previous log into old file, if emptty crashes and is started again, previous log is in /var/log/emptty/[TTY_NUMBER].log.old

       appending
              This  option  provides  functionality that logs everything into /var/log/emptty/[TTY_NUMBER].log and does not handle log rotation by itself. It leaves the option for user to handle it them‐
              selves (e.g. with logrotate).

              NOTE: Appending without roration could cause large log file, be sure that log file is rotated.

       disabled
              This option points all log into /dev/null , so no log is available.

              NOTE: If any issue starts to appear and you want to report it, ensure you do not use this option.

COLORS
       Please, be aware that LIGHT_ colors could be unavailable as background color.

       BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, PURPLE, CYAN, WHITE
