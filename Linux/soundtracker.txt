NAME
       soundtracker - a tracker for gnome that supports .xm files

SYNOPSIS
       soundtracker

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly soundtracker.

       This  manual  page  was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has some documentation in /usr/share/doc/soundtracker which
       will be more uptodate than this man page.

       soundtracker is a program that allows one to arrange many sound samples into a tune, comprising of multiple `tracks' which are mixed together, typically in software.

       keyboard):

SEE ALSO
       If you want to know more about tracking in general, http://www.united-trackers.org/ has a lot of resources.

       Also see the SoundTracker homepage, http://www.soundtracker.org/

       SoundTracker still needs detailed documentation. If you want to help out with this, you should become familiar with DocBook or similar SGML tools first.
