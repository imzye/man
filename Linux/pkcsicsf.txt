NAME
       pkcsicsf - configuration utility for the ICSF token

SYNOPSIS
       pkcsicsf  [-h] [-l|-a token name] [-b BINDDN] [-c client-cert-file] [-C
       CA-cert-file] [-k privatekey] [-m mechanism] [-u URI]

DESCRIPTION
       The pkcsicsf utility lists available ICSF tokens and allows user to add
       one specific ICSF token to opencryptoki.

       The  ICSF  token  must  be added first to opencryptoki. This creates an
       entry in the opencryptoki.conf file for the ICSF token. It also creates
        a token_name.conf configuration file in  the  same  directory  as  the
       opencryptoki.conf  file,  containing  ICSF  specific information.  This
       information is read by the ICSF token.

       The ICSF token must bind and authenticate to an LDAP server.  The  sup‐
       ported  authentication  mechanisms  are  simple and sasl.  One of these
       mechanisms must be entered when listing the available  ICSF  tokens  or
       when  adding an ICSF token. Opencryptoki currently supports adding only
       one ICSF token.

       The system admin can either allow the ldap calls  to  utilize  existing
       ldap  configs, such as ldap.conf or .ldaprc for bind and authentication
       information or set the bind and authentication information within open‐
       cryptoki  by  using this utility and its options.  The information will
       then be placed in the token_name.conf file  to  be  used  in  the  ldap
       calls.  When using simple authentication, the user will be prompted for
       the racf password when listing or adding a token.

OPTIONS
       -a token name
                 add the specified ICSF token to opencryptoki.

       -b BINDND the distinguish name to bind when using simple authentication

       -c client-cert-file
                 the client certificate file when using SASL authentication

       -C CA-cert-file

       -h        show usage information

       -k privatekey
                 the client private key file when using SASL authentication

       -m mechanism
                 the authentication mechanism to use when binding to the  LDAP
                 server (this should be either simple or sasl)

       -l        list available ICSF tokens

       -h        show usage information
