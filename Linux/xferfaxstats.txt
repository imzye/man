NAME
       xferfaxstats - summarize HylaFAX transmission accounting

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/xferfaxstats [ options ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       xferfaxstats  is  a  command  script that prints a summary of the HylaFAX accounting statistics for transmitted jobs.  The statistics can be sorted using one of several keys: the sender's account name
       (default), the job tag (useful when used for accounting purposes), the remote party's CSI, the called phone number, the output device used for the call, the communication speed, and the  communication
       data format.  Statistics are read from the file /var/spool/hylafax/log/xferfaxlog in the spooling area, unless filenames are specified on the command line.

       The following table is an example of the output from xferfaxstats (using the default sort key):

       The  first  column  column shows the sort key value used (the sender's identity here, but otherwise the destination phone number, remote CSI, etc.).  The Pages column is the total number of good pages
       transmitted.  The time column shows the total amount of time spent transmitting.  The Pg/min column displays the average transfer rate.  The Errs column indicates  how  many  errors  were  encountered
       while  transmitting  facsimile.   (Note  that this statistic does not include problems encountered while placing a call; e.g.  busy signals.)  The TypRate column displays the most common communication
       speed with which facsimile were transmitted.  The TypData column shows the most common data format in which facsimile data were transmitted.

       Account names other than ``root'' and ``guest'' can be automatically mapped to a canonical format in which the host name is removed and identical addresses in the same domain are merged together (i.e.
       for  NIS  environments).   For  example,  ``sam@flake.asd.sgi.com'' and ``sam@foobar.asd.sgi.com'' are both mapped to ``sam@asd.sgi.com'' with the associated statistics accumulated.  Identical account
       names in different domains generate a warning; e.g. ``loki@wpd.sgi.com'' and ``loki@corp.sgi.com''.  The above mapping is done only if the -map option is specified, by default account  names  are  not
       altered.

OPTIONS
       -age days   Show information only for the facsimile transmitted in the last specified number of days.

       -csi*       Sort output by the remote party's CSI.

       -dest*      Sort output by the phone number called.

       -dev*       Sort output by the output device (i.e. modem) used.

       -format     Sort output by the negotiated data format.

       -job*       Sort output by client-specified job tag identifiers.

       -nomap      Do  not perform the account name mapping by which statistics for the ``root'' and ``guest'' accounts are merged and leading hostname part of domain names are stripped.  This is the default
                   behavior.

       -map        Perform the account name mapping by which statistics for the ``root'' and ``guest'' accounts are merged and leading hostname part of domain names are stripped.

       -send*      Sort output by sender's account name (default).

       -since time Show information only for the facsimile transmitted since the specified time; where time is of the form ``MM/DD/YY HH:MM'' (the date(1) format string %D %H:%M).

       -end time   Show information only for the facsimile transmitted before the specified time; where time is of the same form as since.

       -speed      Sort output by the signalling rate.

DIAGNOSTICS
       ``Warning, address clash, "%s" and "%s".''  During address mapping two mapped addresses were found for the same account name.

       ``Warning, weird user address/name "%s".''  During address mapping an address was encountered that multiple ``@'' symbols in it.

NOTES
       The sender field does not necessarily represent the submitter's actual identity.  For example, it reflects the value given by the sendfax(8) ``-f'' option.  Be cautious that this field is not utilized
       for auditing if the fax user base is not trusted.

FILES
       /var/spool/hylafax    spooling area
       log/xferfaxlog        default file from which to read statistics
