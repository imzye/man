NAME
       gadap-config - Return metainformation about installed libraries

SYNOPSIS
       gadap-config [--help]  [--cc] [--cxx ] [--cflags] [--libs] [--prefix] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       The  gadap-config program is used to retrieve information about the GADAP library on the system. On Debian it is deprecated in favour of using pkg-config gadap as the latter can be used for multi‐
       ple libraries.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --version
              Displays the version of pkg-config and terminates.

       --help Displays a help message and terminates.

       --cflags
              This prints pre-processor and compile flags required to compile the packages on the command line, including flags for all their dependencies.  gadap-config exits with a nonzero code  if  it
              can't find metadata for one or more of the packages on the command line.

       --libs This option is identical to "--cflags", only it prints the link flags.

       --cc   This option lists the C compiler that should be used for compatability.

       -cxx   This option lists the C++ compiler that should be used for compatability.

       --prefix
              This option prints the value of the prefix variable, giving the location at which the library was installed.
