NAME
       asmon - A system resource monitor dockapp for Afterstep and WindowMaker

SYNOPSIS
       asmon [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Asmon is a dockable applet for X11 that monitors system resources. It is designed for the WindowMaker Dock or Afterstep Wharf but should work with others as well. It displays CPU usage, load aver‐
       age, memory utilization, pages and swaps.

       The upper most section of the applet displays CPU usage on the left, while numerically representing load average on the right.

       The middle bar shows memory utilization divided by ticks into shared, buffers, and cached respectively, with the number of megabytes used represented numerically to the right.

       The lower bar displays information about swap, graphically on the left, numerically on the right.

       At  bottom  left  are  four LEDs, top to bottom, left to right they are: pages in, pages out, swap in and swap out. The remainder of the bottom row is dedicated to a graphical bar representing the
       amount of memory that the X server is using with the numerical representation to the right, (optionally this section can be used to display uptime).

OPTIONS
       -display <display>
               Specify an alternate X display; see X(1).

       -e <command>
               Execute <command> on mouseclick.

       -u      Display uptime rather then X memory usage.

       -v      Show version information and exit.

       -h      Show summary of options.
