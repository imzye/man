NAME
       members - outputs members of a group

SYNOPSIS
       members groupname

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the members commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.

       members is a program that sends a space-separated list of secondary member names to its standard output.

OPTIONS
       The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -a, --all
              Show all group members on one line. This is the default.

       -p, --primary
              Show only primary group members.

       -s, --secondary
              Show only secondary group members.

       -t, --two-lines
              Send two lines to standard output. First line is primary members, second line is secondary members. NOTE: This always displays two lines, even if there are no members at all.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 (i.e. "success") if the group was found, and 1 (i.e., "failure") if the group was not found.

       Technically, the exit status hinges on the output of getgrnam(3) as follows: if getgrnam(3) returns a null pointer, the exit status is 1, and 0 otherwise.

BUGS
       I don't know of any! If you find one, please let me know!
