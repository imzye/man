NAME
       Test::Image::GD - A module for testing images using GD

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::More plan => 1;
         use Test::Image::GD;

         cmp_image('test.gif', 'control.gif', '... these images should match');

         # or

         my $test = GD::Image->new('test.gif');
         my $control = GD::Image->new('control.gif');
         cmp_image($test, $control, '... these images should match');

         # some other test functions ...

         size_ok('camel.gif', [ 100, 350 ], '... the image is 100 x 350");

         height_ok('test.gif', 200, '... the image has a height of 200');
         width_ok('test.gif', 200, '... the image has a width of 200');

DESCRIPTION
       This module is meant to be used for testing custom graphics, it attempts to "visually" compare the images, this means it ignores invisible differences like color palettes and metadata. It also
       provides some extra functions to check the size of the image.

FUNCTIONS
       cmp_image ($got, $expected, $message)
           This function will tell you whether the two images will look different, ignoring differences in the order of colors in the color palette and other invisible changes.

           Both $got and $expected can be either instances of "GD::Image" or either a file handle or a file path (both are valid parameters to the "GD::Image" constructor).

       size_ok ($got, [ $width, $height ], ?$message)
           This function will check if an image is a certain size.

           As with the "cmp_image" function, the $got parameter can be either an instance of "GD::Image" or a file handle or a file path (all are valid parameters to the "GD::Image" constructor).

       height_ok ($got, $height, ?$message)
           This function will check if an image is a certain height.

           As with the "cmp_image" function, the $got parameter can be either an instance of "GD::Image" or a file handle or a file path (all are valid parameters to the "GD::Image" constructor).

       width_ok ($got, $width, ?$message)
           This function will check if an image is a certain width.

           As with the "cmp_image" function, the $got parameter can be either an instance of "GD::Image" or a file handle or a file path (all are valid parameters to the "GD::Image" constructor).

TO DO
       Add more functions
           This  module  currently  serves  a  very basic need of mine, however, I am sure as I start writing more tests against images I will find a need for other testing functions. Any suggestions are
           welcome.

BUGS
       None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it.

CODE COVERAGE
       I use Devel::Cover to test the code coverage of my tests, below is the Devel::Cover report on this module test suite.
