NAME
       numdiff - compare similar files with numeric fields

DESCRIPTION
       Usage: numdiff -h|--help|-v|--version   or

       numdiff  [-s  IFS][-D  DELIMS][-a  THRVAL[:RANGE|:RANGE1:RANGE2]][-r  THRVAL[:RANGE|:RANGE1:RANGE2]][-2][-F  NUM][-#  NUM][-P][-N][-I][-c  CURRNAME][-d C1C2][-t C1C2][-g N1N2][-p C1C2][-n C1C2][-e
       C1C2][-i C1C2][-X 1:RANGE][-X 2:RANGE][-E][-U][-b][-V][-O[NUM]][--raw][-q][-S][-z 1:RANGE][-z 2:RANGE][-Z 1:RANGE][-Z 2:RANGE][-m][-H][-f[NUM]][-T][-B][-l PATH][-o PATH] FILE1 FILE2

       Compare putatively similar files line by line and field by field, ignoring small numeric differences or/and different numeric formats.

       RANGE, RANGE1 and RANGE2 stay for a positive integer value or for a range of integer values, like 1-, 3-5 or -7.  The two arguments after the options are the names of the files  to  compare.   The
       complete paths of the files should be given, a directory name is not accepted.  The given paths cannot refer to the same file but one of them can be "-", which refers to stdin.

       Exit status: 1 if files differ, 0 if they are equal, -1 (255) in case of error

       -s, --separators=IFS

              Specify  the set of characters to use as delimiters while splitting the input lines into fields (The default set of delimiters is space, tab and newline).  If IFS is prefixed with 1: or 2:,
              use the given delimiter set only for the lines from the first or the second file respectively

       -D, --delimiters=DELIMS

              Specify the set of strings to use as delimiters while splitting the input lines into fields (The default set of delimiters is space, tab and newline).  If DELIMS is prefixed with 1: or  2:,
              use the given delimiter set only for the lines from the first or the second file respectively

       -a, --absolute-tolerance=THRVAL[:RANGE|:RANGE1:RANGE2]

              Set  to  THRVAL  the maximum absolute difference permitted before two numeric fields are regarded as different (The default value is zero).  If a RANGE is given, use the specified threshold
              only when comparing fields whose positions lie in RANGE.  If both RANGE1 and RANGE2 are given and have the same length, then use the specified threshold when comparing a field of FILE1  ly‐
              ing in RANGE1 with the corresponding field of FILE2 in RANGE2

       -r, --relative-tolerance=THRVAL[:RANGE|:RANGE1:RANGE2]

              Set  to  THRVAL  the maximum relative difference permitted before two numeric fields are regarded as different (The default value is zero).  If a RANGE is given, use the specified threshold
              only when comparing fields whose positions lie in RANGE.  If both RANGE1 and RANGE2 are given and have the same length, then use the specified threshold when comparing a field of FILE1  ly‐
              ing in RANGE1 with the corresponding field of FILE2 in RANGE2

       -2, --strict

              Consider two numerical values as equal only if both absolute and relative difference do not exceed the respective tolerance threshold

       -F, --formula=NUM

              Use  the  formula  indicated  by NUM to compute the relative errors.  If 'NUM' is 0 use the classic formula.  If 'NUM' is 1 compute the relative errors by considering the values in FILE1 as
              sample values.  If 'NUM' is 2 compute the relative errors by considering the values in FILE2 as sample values.

       -#, --digits=NUM

              Set to NUM the number of digits in the significands used in multiple precision arithmetic

       -P, --positive-differences

              Ignore all differences due to numeric fields of the second file that are less than the corresponding numeric fields in the first file

       -N, --negative-differences

              Ignore all differences due to numeric fields of the second file that are greater than the corresponding numeric fields in the first file

       -I, --ignore-case

              Ignore changes in case while doing literal comparisons

       -c, --currency=CURRNAME

              Set to CURRNAME the currency name for the two files to compare.  CURRNAME must be prefixed with 1: or 2: to specify the currency name only for the first or the second file

       -d, --decimal-point=C1C2

              Specify the characters representing the decimal point in the two files to compare

       -t, --thousands-separator=C1C2

              Specify the characters representing the thousands separator in the two files to compare

       -g, --group-length=N1N2

              Specify the number of digits forming each group of thousands in the two files to compare

       -p, --plus-prefix=C1C2

              Specify the (optional) prefixes for positive values used in the two files to compare

       -n, --minus-prefix=C1C2

              Specify the prefixes for negative values used in the two files to compare

       -e, --exponent-letter=C1C2

              Specify the exponent letters used in the two files to compare

       -i, --imaginary-unit=C1C2

              Specify the characters representing the imaginary unit in the two files to compare

       -X, --exclude=1:RANGE

              Select the fields of the first file that have to be ignored

       -X, --exclude=2:RANGE

              Select the fields of the second file that have to be ignored

       -E, --essential

              While printing the differences between the two compared files show only the numerical ones

       -U, --dummy

              While printing the differences between the two compared files neglect all the numerical ones (dummy mode)

       -b, --brief

              Suppress all messages concerning the differences discovered in the structures of the two files

       -V, --verbose

              For every couple of lines which differ in at least one field print an header to show how these lines appear in the two compared files

       -O, --overview[=NUM]

              Display a side by side difference listing of the two files showing which lines are present only in one file, which lines are present in both files but with one or more differing fields, and
              which lines are identical.  If 'NUM' is zero or is not specified, output at most 130 columns per line.  If 'NUM' is a positive number, output at most 'NUM' columns per line.  If 'NUM' is  a
              negative number, do not output common lines and display at most -'NUM' columns per line.

              tive number, output at most 'NUM' columns per line.  If 'NUM' is a negative number, do not output common lines and display at most -'NUM' columns per line.
