NAME
       ntptime - read and set kernel time variables

SYNOPSIS
       ntptime [-chr] [-e est_error] [-f frequency] [-j]
               [-m max_error] [-o offset] [-s status]
               [-t time_constant]

DESCRIPTION
       Checks the kernel configuration for the NTP user interface syscalls ntp_gettime() and ntp_adjtime(). If present, the current timekeeping data are displayed. If not, a disappointment is displayed. See
       the kernel page file in the HTML documentation in distribution for further details.

       A similar display can be obtained using the ntpq program and kerninfo command.

       This program is useful only with kernels featuring the ntp_adjtime(2) system call or local equivalent, as described in the A <kern.html> Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping"  page,

OPTIONS
       -c
           Display the execution time of ntptime itself.

       -e est_error
           Specify estimated error, in microseconds.

       -f frequency
           Specify frequency offset, in parts per million.

       -h
           Display help information.

       -j
           Report in JSON rather than plain text.

       -m max_error
           Specify max possible errors, in microseconds.

       -o offset
           Specify clock offset, in microseconds.

       -r
           Display Unix and NTP times in raw format.

       -s status
           Specify clock status. Better know what you are doing.

       -t time_constant
           Specify time constant, an integer in the range 0-10.

       -V
           Print the version string and exit.

BUGS
       The format for modes and status in the JSON report is less than ideal.

EXIT STATUS
       One of the following exit values will be returned:

       0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
           Successful program execution.

       1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
           The operation failed or the command invocation was not valid.
