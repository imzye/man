NAME
       MooX::Struct::Util - extensions for MooX::Struct that would have been overkill to include

LAZY DEFAULTS
       Sugar for lazily defaulted attributes. The following two are effectively the same.

        use MooX::Struct WebPage1 => [
           user_agent => [
              lazy     => 1,
              default  => sub { LWP::UserAgent->new },
           ],
        ];

        use MooX::Struct::Util qw(lazy_default);
        use MooX::Struct WebPage2 => [
           user_agent => lazy_default { LWP::UserAgent->new },
        ];
