NAME
       mrtg-apache - Returns the number of hits to a Apache web site

SYNOPSIS
       mrtg-apache <host name> [-p port] [-m multiplier]

DESCRIPTION
       mrtg-apache uses the server-info capability (mod_info) of Apache to determine the number of hits to a web server. The output is written in a form useful as input for the mrtg utility.

       <host name> is the name of the Apache host to contact.

       -p is the port number to use. Default is 80.

       -m is the multiplier to be used in the output. For example, with a multiplier of 100, if Apache returns 20 accesses, the output will be 2000.
