NAME
       flow-merge - Merge flow files.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-merge [ -aghm ]  [ -b big|little ]  [ -C comment ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -o filename ]  [ -z z_level ]  [ file|directory... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  flow-merge utility processes files and/or directories of files in the flow-tools format. The resulting merged data set is written to the standard output or file specified by -o. If file is a sin‐
       gle dash (`-') or absent, flow-merge will read from the standard input. Unlike flow-cat, flow-merge interleaves flow records preserving the relative chronological order.

OPTIONS
       -a     Do not ignore filenames that begin with tmp.

       -b big|little
              Byte order of output.

       -C Comment
              Add a comment.

       -d debug_level
              Enable debugging.

       -g     Sort file list by capture start time before processing.

       -h     Display help.

       -m     Disable the use of mmap().

       -p     Preload headers. Use to preserve meta information such as lost flows.

       -o file
              Write to file instead of the standard out.

       -z z_level
              Configure compression level to  z_level. 0 is disabled (no compression), 9 is highest compression.

       file|directory...
              Process the files and/or directory.

EXAMPLES
       Merge all flow files begining with ft-v05.2001-05.01, use flow-print to display the results.

       flow-merge ft-v05.2001-05-01.* | flow-print
