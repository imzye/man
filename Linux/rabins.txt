NAME
       rabins - process argus(8) data within specified bins.

SYNOPSIS
       rabins [-B secs] -M splitmode [options]] [raoptions] [-- filter-expres‐
       sion]

DESCRIPTION
       Rabins reads argus data from an argus-data source, and adjusts the data
       so that it is aligned to a set of bins, or slots, that are based on ei‐
       ther time, input size, or count.  The resulting output is split,  modi‐
       fied,  and  optionally  aggregated  so  that  the data fits to the con‐
       straints of the specified bins.  rabins is designed to be a combination
       of rasplit and racluster, acting on multiple contexts of argus data.

       The  principal function of rabins is to align input data to a series of
       bins, and then process the data within the context of each  bin.   This
       is the basis for real-time stream block processing.  Time series stream
       block processing is cricital for flow data graphing, comparing, analyz‐
       ing, and correlation.  Fixed load stream block processing, based on the
       number of argus data records ('count'),  or  a  fixed  volume  of  data
       ('size')  allows  for  control  of resources in processing.  While load
       based options are very useful, they are rather esoteric.  See  the  on‐
       line examples and rasplit.1 for examples of using these modes of opera‐
       tion.

Time Series Bins
       Time series bin'ing is specified using the -M time option.   Time  bins
       are  specified by the size and granularity of the time bin.  The granu‐
       larity, 's'econds, 'm'inutes, 'h'ours, 'd'ays, 'w'eeks,  'M'onths,  and
       'y'ears,  dictates  where  the bin boundaries lie.  To ensure that 0.5d
       and 12h start on the same point in time, second, minute, hour, and  day
       based bins start at midnight, Jan 1st of the year of processing.  Week,
       month and year bins all start on natural time boundaries, for  the  pe‐
       riod.

       rabins provides a separate processing context for each bin, so that ag‐
       gregation and sorting occur only within the context of  each  time  pe‐
       riod.   Records  are  placed into bins based on load or time.  For load
       based bins, input records are processed in received order and  are  not
       modified.  When  using  time  based  bins, records are placed into bins
       based on the starting time of the record.   By  default,  records  that
       span  a  time  boundary are split into as many records as needed to fit
       the record into appropriate bin sizes, using  the  algorithms  used  by
       rasplit.1.   Metrics are distributed uniformly within all the appropri‐
       ate bins. The result is a series of data and/or fragments that are time
       aligned, appropriate for time seried analysis, and visualization.

       When  a  record is split to conform to a time series bin, the resulting
       starting and ending timestamps may or may not coincide with  the  time‐
       stamps of the bins themselves. For some applications, this treatment is
       critical to the analytics that are working on the resulting data,  such
       as transaction duration, and flow traffic burst behavior.  However, for
       other analytics, like average load, and rate  analysis  and  reporting,
       the  timestamps need to be modified so that they reflect the time range
       of the actual time bin boundaries.  Rabins supports the  optional  hard
       option  to  specify  that  timestamps should conform to bin boundaries.
       One of the results of this  is  that  all  durations  in  the  reported
       records  will  be  the  bin duration.  This is extremely important when
       processing certain time series metrics, like load.

Load Based Bins
       Load based bin'ing is specified using the -M size or -M count  options.
       Load  bins  are  used to constrain the resource used in bin processing.
       So much load is input, aggregation is performed on the input load,  and
       when  a  threshold  is reached, the entire aggregation cache is dumped,
       reinitiallized, and reused.  These can be used effectively  to  provide
       realtime data reduction, but within a fixed amount of memory.

Output Processing
       rabins  has  two basic modes of output, the default holds all output in
       main memory until EOF is encountered on input, where each sorted bin is
       written  out.  The  second output mode, has rabins writing out the con‐
       tents of individual sorted bins, periodically based on a holding  time,
       specified  using  the  -B secs option.  The secs value should be chosen
       such that rabins will have seen all the appropriate incoming  data  for
       that time period.  This is determined by the ARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL
       used by the collection of argus data sources in the input data  stream,
       as  well  as  any time drift that may exist amoung argus data processin
       elements.  When there is good time sync, and  with  an  ARGUS_FLOW_STA‐
       TUS_INTERVAL  of  5  seconds,  appropriate secs values are between 5-15
       seconds.

       The output of rabins when using the -B secs option, is  appropriate  to
       drive  a  number of processing elements, such as near real-time visual‐
       izations and alarm and reporting.

Output Stream
       Like all ra.1 client programs, the output of rabins.1 is an argus  data
       stream,  that  can be written as binary data to a file or standard out‐
       put, or can be printed.  rabins supports all the output functions  pro‐
       vided by rasplit.1.

       The  output  files  name consists of a prefix, which is specified using
       the -w ra option, and for all modes except time mode, a  suffix,  which
       is created for each resulting file.  If no prefix is provided, then ra‐
       bins will use 'x' as the default prefix.  The suffix that  is  used  is
       determined  by the mode of operation.  When rabins is using the default
       count mode or the size mode, the suffix is a  group  of  letters  'aa',
       'ab', and so on, such that concatenating the output files in sorted or‐
       der by file name produces the original input file.  If rabins will need
       to  create  more  output  files  than are allowed by the default suffix
       strategy, more letters will be added, in order to accomodate the needed
       files.

       When  rabins is spliting based on time, rabins uses a default extension
       of %Y.%m.%d.%h.%m.%s.  This default can be overrided by  adding  a  '%'
       extension to the name provided using the -w option.

       When standard out is specified, using -w -, rabins will output a single
       argus-stream with START and STOP argus management records inserted  ap‐
       propriately  to  indicate  where the output is split.  See argus(8) for
       more information on output stream formats.

       When rabins is spliting on output record count (the default), the  num‐
       ber  of records is specified as an ordinal counter, the default is 1000
       records.  When rabins is spliting based  on  the  maximum  output  file
       size,  the  size  is specified as bytes.  The scale of the bytes can be
       specified by appending 'b', 'k' and 'm' to the number provided.

       When rabins is spliting base on time, the time period is specified with
       the  option,  and  can be any period based in seconds (s), minutes (m),
       hours (h), days (d), weeks (w), months (M) or years (y).   Rabins  will
       create  and  modify  records  as  required  to split on prescribed time
       boundaries.  If any record spans a time boundary, the record  is  split
       and the metrics are adjusted using a uniform distribution model to dis‐
       tribute the statistics between the two records.

       See rasplit.1 for specifics.

RABINS SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       rabins, like all ra based clients, supports a number of ra options  in‐
       cluding  remote  data access, reading from multiple files and filtering
       of input argus records through a terminating filter expression.  Rabins
       also  provides all the functions of racluster.1 and rasplit.1, for pro‐
       cessing and outputing data.  rabins specific options are:

       -B secs
            Holding time in seconds before closing a  bin  and  outputing  its
            contents.

       -M splitmode
            Supported spliting modes are:

              time <n[smhdwMy]>
                   bin  records  into  time slots of n size.  This is used for
                   time series analytics, especially  graphing.   Records,  by
                   default are split, so that their timestamps do not span the
                   time range specified.  Metrics  are  uniformly  distributed
                   among the resulting records.

              count <n[kmb]>
                   bin  records  into  chunks  based on the number of records.
                   This is used for archive management and parallel processing
                   analytics,  to  limit  the size of data processing to fixed
                   numbers of records.

              size <n[kmb]>
                   bin records into chunks based on the number of total bytes.
                   This is used for archive management and parallel processing
                   analytics, to limit the size of data  processing  to  fixed
                   byte limitations.

       -M modes
            Supported processing modes are:
              hard split on hard time boundaries.  Each flow records start and
                   stop times will be the time boundary times.  The default is
                   to  use  the  original  start  and stop timestamps from the
                   records that make up the resulting aggregation.
              nomodify
                   Do not split the record when including it into a time  bin.
                   This  allows  a  time bin to represent times outside of its
                   defintion.  This option should not be used with the  'hard'
                   option, as you will modify metrics and semantics.
       -m aggregation object
            Supported aggregation objects are:
              none           use a null flow key.
              srcid          argus source identifier.
              smac           source mac(ether) addr.
              dmac           destination mac(ether) addr.
              soui           oui portion of the source mac(ether) addr.
              doui           oui portion of the destination mac(ether) addr.
              smpls          source mpls label.
              dmpls          destination label addr.
              svlan          source vlan label.
              dvlan          destination vlan addr.
              saddr/[l|m]    source IP addr/[cidr len | m.a.s.k].
              daddr/[l|m]    destination IP addr/[cidr len | m.a.s.k].
              matrix/l       sorted src and dst IP addr/cidr len.
              proto          transaction protocol.
              sport          source port number. Implies use of 'proto'.
              dport          destination port number. Implies use of 'proto'.
              stos           source TOS byte value.
              dtos           destination TOS byte value.
              sttl           src -> dst TTL value.
              dttl           dst -> src TTL value.
              stcpb          src -> dst TCP base sequence number.
              dtcpb          dst -> src TCP base sequence number.
              inode[/l|m]]   intermediate  node  IP addr/[cidr len | m.a.s.k],
                             source of ICMP mapped events.
              sco            source ARIN country code, if present.
              dco            destination ARIN country code, if present.
              sas            source node origin AS number, if available.
              das            destination node origin AS number, if available.
              ias            intermediate node origin AS number, if available.

       -P sort field
            Rabins can sort its output based on a  sort  field  specification.
            Because  the  -m option is used for aggregation fields, -P is used
            to specify the print priority order.  See rasort(1) for  the  list
            of sortable fields.

       -w filename
            Rabins  supports  an  extended  -w  option  that allows for output
            record contents to be inserted into the output  filename.   Speci‐
            fied using '$' (dollar) notation, any printable field can be used.
            Care should be taken to honor any shell escape  requirements  when
            specifying  on the command line.  See ra(1) for the list of print‐
            able fields.

            Another extended  feature,  when  using  time  mode,  rabins  will
            process  the  supplied  filename  using  strftime(3), so that time
            fields can be inserted into the resulting output filename.

INVOCATION
       This invocation aggregates inputfile based on  10  minute  time  bound‐
       aries.   Input  is  split  to fit within a 10 minute time boundary, and
       within those boundaries, argus records are aggregated.   The  resulting
       output its streamed to a single file.

          rabins -r * -M time 10m -w outputfile

       This  next  invocation  aggregates  inputfiles  based  on 5 minute time
       boundaries, and the output is written to  5  minute  files.   Input  is
       split  such that all records conform to hard 10 minute time boundaries,
       and within those boundaries, argus  records  are  aggregated,  in  this
       case, based on IP address matrix.
       The  resulting  output its streamed to files that are named relative to
       the records output content, a prefix of /matrix/%Y/%m/%d/argus. and the
       suffixes %H.%M.%S.

          rabins -r * -M hard time 5m -m matrix -w "/matrix/%Y/%m/%d/argus.%H.%M.%S"

       This next invocation aggregates input.stream based on matrix/24 into 10
       second time boundaries, holds the data for an additional 5 seconds  af‐
       ter  the  time boundary has passed, and then prints the complete sorted
       contents of each bin to standard output.  The output is printed  at  10
       second intervals, and the output is the content of the previous  10 sec
       time bin.  This example is meant to provide, every 10 seconds, the sum‐
       mary  of all Class C subnet activity seen.  It is intended to run inde‐
       finately printing out aggregated summary records.  By modifying the ag‐
       gregation  model, using the "-f racluster.conf" option, you can achieve
       a great deal of data reduction with a lot of semantic reporting.

       This next invocation reads IP argus(8) data  from  inputfile  and  pro‐
       cesses, the argus(8) data stream based on input byte size of no greater
       than 1 Megabyte.  The resulting output stream is written  to  a  single
       argus.out data file.

       This  invocation  reads  IP argus(8) data from inputfile and aggregates
       the argus(8) data stream based on input file size of no greater than 1K
       flows.   The  resulting output stream is printed to the screen as stan‐
       dard argus records.
