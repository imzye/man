NAME
       carmen2simplemap - Convert robotic datasets between CARMEN and simplemap formats

SYNOPSIS
       carmen2simplemap  [-z <0: none, 1-9: min-max>] -i carmen.log -o
                    map.simplemap [-q] [-w] [--] [--version] [-h]

       carmen2simplemap --help

DESCRIPTION
       carmen2simplemap is a command-line application to convert a CARMEN robotic dataset (with corrected poses already in it) into the "simplemap" file format, which can be then used to build metric maps
       (points, occupancy grids, etc.).

       Arguments:

          -z <0: none, 1-9: min-max>,  --compress-level <0: none, 1-9: min-max>
            Output GZ-compress level (optional)

          -i <carmen.log>,  --input <carmen.log>
            (required)  Input dataset (required) (*.log)

          -o <map.simplemap>,  --output <map.simplemap>
            (required)  Output file (*.simplemap)

          -q,  --quiet
            Terse output

          -w,  --overwrite
            Force overwrite target file without prompting.

          --,  --ignore_rest
            Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

          --version
            Displays version information and exits.

          -h,  --help
            Displays usage information and exits.
