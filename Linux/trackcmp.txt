NAME
       trackcmp - compares one or more audio tracks for equivalence

SYNOPSIS
       trackcmp [OPTIONS] <track 1> <track 2>

DESCRIPTION
       trackcmp  takes  two audio tracks and compares their PCM data. If they are exactly the same, it prints no output and returns 0. If not, a message is displayed and 1 is returned. trackcmp may also take
       two directories as arguments. In that case, any audio files in both directories are compared as per a single file. Track and album numbers are used to determine which file should be compared to which.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show a list of options and exit

       -j, --joint=PROCESSES
              The maximum number of tracks to compare at one time. If one has multiple CPUs or CPU cores, allowing trackcmp(1) to use all of them simultaneously can greatly increase comparison speed.

       -S, --no-summary
              suppress summary output

       -V, --verbose=VERBOSITY
              The level of output to display. Choose between 'normal', 'quiet' and 'debug.
