NAME
       nmzmail - a tool to use the namazu2 search engine from within mutt

SYNOPSIS
       nmzmail [ -b <base> ] [ -r <result> ] -i <maildir1> <maildir2> ...

        -or-

       nmzmail [ -b <base> ] [ -r <result> ] [ -n <limit> ]

DESCRIPTION
       nmzmail  is  a  program that uses the namazu2 search engine (http://www.namazu.org) from within the mail client mutt to search and index mail stored in maildir folders.  Based on the result of the
       namazu query, nmzmail generates a maildir folder containing symbolic links to the mail matching the query.  A simple mutt macro makes it very easy to use nmzmail from within  mutt,  and  a  simple
       crontab entry always keeps your mail indexed by namazu.

       Add the following macro to your muttrc file:

       macro generic S "<shell-escape>nmzmail<return><esc>c~/.nmzmail/result<return>" "Search via nmzmail"

       Run mutt and hit "S" and enter your query when prompted.

       You can manually update your index periodically or via a cronjob with:

       nmzmail -i <maildir1> <maildir2>  ...

OPTIONS
       -i     This tells nmzmail to index your email.

       -b FILE
              Base.  Where nmzmail builds its index.  By default it is in $HOME/.nmzmail.

       -r FILE
              Result.  Similar to -b, this lets you specify where the results are to be built. By default it is within $HOME/.nmzmail.

       -n NUM Limit.   When  making a query, nmzmail can be used directly from the command line instead of from within mutt.  When the -n option is invoked, the number of results returned from your query
              will be limited to whatever integer you specify for NUM.
