NAME
       PulseView - Qt-based LA/scope/MSO GUI for sigrok

SYNOPSIS
       pulseview [OPTIONS] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       PulseView is a cross-platform Qt-based GUI for the sigrok software suite for test and measurement equipment such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, MSOs, and more.

OPTIONS
       PulseView has very few command line options, as most configuration elements are available from the GUI itself.

       If the optional FILE argument is supplied, PulseView tries to open the specified file. It has to be in the "libsigrok session" format (.sr) unless -I is used to specify the input file format.

       -l, --loglevel
              Set  the  libsigrok  and  libsigrokdecode  loglevel.  At  the  moment PulseView doesn't support setting the two loglevels independently. The higher the number, the more debug output will be
              printed. Valid loglevels are:

              0   None
              1   Error
              2   Warnings
              3   Informational
              4   Debug
              5   Spew

       -h, -?, --help
              Show a help text and exit.

       -V, --version
              Show version information and exit.

       -d, --driver <drivername>
              Specify the capture device to connect to. If the --driver option is not supplied, PulseView attempts to re-connect to the most recently used device, or auto-detect available devices.

       -D, --dont-scan
              Usually PulseView automatically scans all drivers to find suitable devices during program startup. This option disables the auto-scan.  Users can either specify the --driver option to  pick
              a device at startup, or interactively scan for devices after PulseView has finished starting up.

       -i, --input-file <filename>
              Load input from a file. If the --input-format option is not supplied, PulseView attempts to load the file as a sigrok session file.

       -I, --input-format <format>
              Specifies the format of the input file to be loaded.

       -s, --settings <filename>
              Load PulseView session setup to use with the input file. The setup file must be in the "PulseView session setup" format (.pvs).

       -c, --clean
              Prevents  the  previously  used sessions to be restored from settings storage.  This is useful if you want only a single session with the file given on the command line instead of restoring
              all previously used sessions as well.
