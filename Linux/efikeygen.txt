SYNOPSIS
       efikeygen <[--ca | -C] [--self-sign | -S] | [--signer=nickname]>
              [--token=token | -t token]
              [--nickname=nickname | -n nickname]
              [--common-name=common name | -c common name]
              [--url=url | -u url]
              [--serial=serial | -s serial]

DESCRIPTION
       efikeygen is a command line tool for generating keys  and  certificates
       to be used with pesign.  These are standard X.509 certificates, and can
       potentially be generated with any certificate creation tool.  efikeygen
       simply  sets  generates  keys with sensible options set for a key to be
       used for PE image signing.

OPTIONS
       --ca   The certificate being generated is for a CA.

       --self-sign
              The generated certificate is to be self signed.

       --signer=nickname
              Nickname of certificate to be used to sign  the  generated  cer‐
              tificate.

       --token=token
              Use the specified NSS token's certificate database.

       --nickname=nickname
              The nickname to use for the generated certificate.

       --common-name=common-name
              The  X.509  Common  Name  for  the  generated certificate.  This
              should be in rfc2253 syntax, i.e. "CN=John  Doe,OU=editing,O=New
              York Times,L=New York,ST=NY,C=US"

       --url=url
              Informational url regarding objects signed with this key.

       --serial=serial number
              Serial  number  for use with this key.  A certificate is identi‐
              fied by its signer and its serial number,  so it's best  not  to
              ever  re-use  this value with the same signer.  By default, this
              value will be generated using /dev/urandom .  It is  not  recom‐
              mended to use this option to override that.
