NAME
       SOAPaligner/soap2 - Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package aligner

SYNOPSIS
       soap reference.index short_reads.fast[a|q] alignment.out [options]

DESCRIPTION
       SOAPaligner/soap2 is a member of the SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package). It is an updated version of SOAP software for short oligonucleotide alignment. The new program features in super
       fast and accurate alignment for huge amounts of short reads generated by Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer. Compared to soap v1, it is one order of magnitude faster. It require only 2 minutes align‐
       ing one million single-end reads onto the human reference genome. Another remarkable improvement of SOAPaligner is that it now supports a wide range of the read length.

       SOAPaligner  benefitted  in time and space efficiency by a revolution in the basic data structures and algorithms used.The core algorithms and the indexing data structures (2way-BWT) are developed
       by the algorithms research group of the Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong (T.W. Lam, Alan Tam, Simon Wong, Edward Wu and S.M. Yiu).

COMMAND AND OPTIONS
       soap -D <in.fasta.index> -a <query.file.a> [-b <query.file.b>] -o <alignment.output> [-2 <unpaired.output>] [options]

       OPTIONS:

              -D STR Prefix name for reference index [*.index]. See APPENDIX How to build the reference index

              -a STR Query file, for SE reads alignment or one end of PE reads

              -b STR Query b file, one end of PE reads

              -o STR Output file for alignment results

              -2 STR Output file contains mapped but unpaired reads when do PE alignment

              -u STR Output file for unmapped reads, [none]

              -m INT Minimal insert size INT allowed for PE, [400]

              -x INT Maximal insert size INT allowed for PE, [600]

              -n INT Filter low quality reads containing more INT bp Ns, [5]

              -t     Output reads id instead reads name, [none]

              -r INT How to report repeat hits, 0=none; 1=random one; 2=all, [1]

              -R     RF alignment for long insert size(>= 2k bps) PE data, [none] FR alignment

              -l INT For long reads with high error rate at 3'-end, those can't align whole length, then first align 5' INT bp subsequence as a seed, [256] use whole length of the read

              -s INT minimal alignment length (for soft clip)

              -v INT Totally allowed mismatches in one read, when use subsequence as a seed, [5]

              -g INT Allow gap size in one read, [0]

              -M INT Match mode for each read or the seed part of read, which shouldn't contain more than 2 mismatches, [4]

                     0: exact match only

                     1: 1 mismatch match only

                     2: 2 mismatch match only

                     4: find the best hits
              -p INT Multithreads, n threads, [1]

OUTPUT FORMAT
       SOAP2 output format contains following column information:

       1. reads name / reads ID (if -t is available)

       2. reads sequence (if read align to reverse strand, here is the reverse sequence of original read)

       3. quality sequence (if input is fasta reads, the column will be all 'h', and the sequence is backward if reads mapping reverse )

       4.

APPENDIX
       Before use soap2 to do alignment, the reference index must be generated by 2bwt-builder.

              2bwt-builder <reference.fasta>

              NOTE: 1. the reference input should only be FASTA format; 2. the program wil auto generate the index files in the directory where the fasta file is located, so  confirm  the  permission  at
              first.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  datastructure  is  imcompatible  with  32bit, so it can't be migrated on any 32bit platforms.  Due to using the MMX instruction to opitimize parts of code, the current version can only run on
       x86_64 platform.  We will provide a universal version for most of the 64bit platform later.

       HARDWARE REQUIREMENT
              1.8Gb RAM (for a genome as large as human's)

              2.at least 8Gb hard disk to store index (for a genome as large as human's)

       SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
              Linux x86_64
