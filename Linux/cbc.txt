DESCRIPTION
       cbc is a utility for communicating with a Couchbase cluster.

       cbc should be invoked with the command name first and then a series of command options appropriate for the specific command. cbc help will always show the full list of available commands.

OPTIONS
       Options may be read either from the command line, or from a configuration file (see cbcrc(4)):

       The following common options may be applied to most of the commands

       -U, --spec=SPEC
              A  string  describing the cluster to connect to. The string is in a URI-like syntax, and may also contain other options. See the EXAMPLES section for information. Typically such a URI will look
              like couchbase://host1,host2,host3/bucket.

              The default for this option is couchbase://localhost/default

       -u, --username=USERNAME
              Specify the username for the bucket. Since Couchbase 5.x this is mandatory switch, and it must specify the name of the user exisiting on cluster (read more at  "Security/Authorization"  section
              of the server manual). For older servers this field should be either left empty or set to the name of the bucket itself.

       -P, --password=PASSWORD:

       -P -, --password=-
              Specify  the  password  for  the bucket. As for servers before 5.x this was only needed if the bucket is protected with a password. For cluster version after 5.x, the password is mandatory, and
              should match the selected account (read more at "Security/Authorization" section of the server manual).

              Specifying the - as the password indicates that the program should prompt for the password. You may also specify the password on the commandline, directly, but is insecure as command line argu‐
              ments are visible via commands such as ps.

       -T, --timings
              Dump command timings at the end of execution. This will display a histogram showing the latencies for the commands executed.

       -v, --verbose
              Specify more information to standard error about what the client is doing. You may specify this option multiple times for increased output detail.

       -D, --cparam=OPTION=VALUE
              Provide additional client options. Acceptable options can also be placed in the connection string, however this option is provided as a convenience. This option may be specified multiple times,
              each time specifying a key=value pair (for example, -Doperation_timeout=10 -Dconfig_cache=/foo/bar/baz). See ADDITIONAL OPTIONS for more information

       -y, --compress
              Enable compressing of documents. When the library is compiled with compression support, this option will enable Snappy compression for outgoing data. Incoming compressed data handled  automati‐
              cally  regardless of this option. Note, that because the compression support have to be negotiated with the server, first packets might be sent uncompressed even when this switch was specified.
              This is because the library might queue data commands before socket connection has been established, and the library will negotiate compression feature. If it is known that all  server  support
              compression repeating the switch (like -yy) will force compression for all outgoing mutations, even scheduled before establishing connection.

       --truststorepath=PATH
              The  path to the server´s SSL certificate. This is typically required for SSL connectivity unless the certificate has already been added to the OpenSSL installation on the system (only applica‐
              ble with couchbases:// scheme)

       --certpath=PATH
              The path to the server´s SSL certificate. This is typically required for SSL connectivity unless the certificate has already been added to the OpenSSL installation on the system (only  applica‐
              ble  with  couchbases://  scheme).  This  also  should contain client certificate when certificate authentication used, and in this case other public certificates could be extracted into trust‐
              storepath chain.

       --keypath=PATH
              The path to the client SSL private key. This is typically required for SSL client certificate authentication. The certificate itself have to go first in chain specified by certpath (only appli‐
              cable with couchbases:// scheme)

       --dump Dump verbose internal state after operations are done.

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
       The  following  options  may  be included in the connection string (via the -U option) as URI-style query params (e.g. couchbase://host/bucket?option1=value1&option2=value2) or as individual key=value
       pairs passed to the -D switch (e.g. -Doption1=value1 -Doption2=value). The -D will internally build the connection string, and is provided as a convenience for options to be easily passed on the  com‐
       mand-line

       •   operation_timeout=SECONDS: Specify the operation timeout in seconds. This is the time the client will wait for an operation to complete before timing it out. The default is 2.5

       •   config_cache=PATH:  Enables the client to make use of a file based configuration cache rather than connecting for the bootstrap operation. If the file does not exist, the client will first connect
           to the cluster and then cache the bootstrap information in the file.

       •   truststorepath=PATH: The path to the server´s SSL certificate. This is typically required for SSL connectivity unless the certificate has already been added to the OpenSSL installation on the sys‐
           tem (only applicable with couchbases:// scheme)

       •   certpath=PATH:  The  path  to  the server´s SSL certificate. This is typically required for SSL connectivity unless the certificate has already been added to the OpenSSL installation on the system
           (only applicable with couchbases:// scheme). This also should contain client certificate when certificate authentication used, and in this case other public certificates could  be  extracted  into
           truststorepath chain.

       •   keypath=PATH:  The  path to the client SSL private key. This is typically required for SSL client certificate authentication. The certificate itself have to go first in chain specified by certpath
           (only applicable with couchbases:// scheme)

       •   ipv6=allow: Enable IPv6.

       •   ssl=no_verify: Temporarily disable certificate verification for SSL (only applicable with couchbases:// scheme). This should only be used for quickly debugging SSL functionality.

       •   sasl_mech_force=MECHANISM: Force a specific SASL mechanism to be used when performing the initial connection. This should only need to be modified for debugging purposes. The  currently  supported
           mechanisms are PLAIN and CRAM-MD5

       •   bootstrap_on=<both,http,cccp>:  Specify the bootstrap protocol the client should use when attempting to connect to the cluster. Options are: cccp: Bootstrap using the Memcached protocol (supported
           on clusters 2.5 and greater); http: Bootstrap using the HTTP REST protocol (supported on any cluster version); and both: First attempt bootstrap over the Memcached protocol, and use the HTTP  pro‐
           tocol if Memcached bootstrap fails. The default is both

       •   enable_tracing=true/false: Activate/deactivate end-to-end tracing.

       •   tracing_orphaned_queue_flush_interval=SECONDS:  Flush  interval for orphaned spans queue in default tracer. This is the time the tracer will wait between repeated attempts to flush most recent or‐
           phaned spans. Default value is 10 seconds.

       •   tracing_orphaned_queue_size=NUMBER: Size of orphaned spans queue in default tracer. Queues in default tracer has fixed size, and it will remove information about older spans, when the  limit  will
           be reached before flushing time. Default value is 128.

       •   tracing_threshold_queue_flush_interval=SECONDS:  Flush interval for spans with total time over threshold in default tracer. This is the time the tracer will wait between repeated attempts to flush
           threshold queue. Default value is 10 seconds.

       •   tracing_threshold_queue_size=NUMBER: Size of threshold queue in default tracer. Queues in default tracer has fixed size, and it will remove information about older spans, when the  limit  will  be
           reached before flushing time. Default value is 128.

       •   tracing_threshold_kv=SECONDS: Minimum time for the tracing span of KV service to be considered by threshold tracer. Default value is 0.5 seconds.

       •   tracing_threshold_query=SECONDS: Minimum time for the tracing span of QUERY service to be considered by threshold tracer. Default value is 1 second.

       •   tracing_threshold_view=SECONDS: Minimum time for the tracing span of VIEW service to be considered by threshold tracer. Default value is 1 second.

       •   tracing_threshold_search=SECONDS: Minimum time for the tracing span of SEARCH service to be considered by threshold tracer. Default value is 1 second.

       •   tracing_threshold_analytics=SECONDS: Minimum time for the tracing span of ANALYTICS service to be considered by threshold tracer. Default value is 1 second.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are supported by cbc. Unless otherwise specified, each command supports all of the options above.

   cat
       Write the value of keys to standard output.

       This command requires that at least one key may be passed to it, but may accept multiple keys. The keys should be specified as positional arguments after the command.

       In addition to the options in the OPTIONS section, the following options are supported:

       r, --replica=all|INDEX
              Read  the  value  from  a  replica  server.  The value for this option can either be the string all which will cause the client to request the value from each replica, or INDEX where INDEX is a
              0-based replica index.

       e, --expiry=EXPIRATION
              Specify that this operation should be a get-and-touch operation in which the key´s expiry time is updated along with retrieving the item.

   create
   cp
       Create a new item in the cluster, or update the value of an existing item. By default this command will read the value from standard input unless the --value option is specified.

       The cp command functions the same, except it operates on a list of files. Each file is stored in the cluster under the name specified on the command line.

       In addition to the options in the OPTIONS section, the following options are supported:

       -V, --value=VALUE
              The value to store in the cluster. If omitted, the value is read from standard input. This option is valid only for the create command.

       f, --flags=ITEMFLAGS
              A 32 bit unsigned integer to be stored alongside the value. This number is returned when the item is retrieved again. Other clients commonly use this value to determine the type of  item  being
              stored.

       e, --expiry=EXPIRATION
              The number of time in seconds from now at which the item should expire.

       M, --mode=upsert|insert|replace
              Specify the storage mode. Mode can be one of insert (store item if it does not yet exist), replace (only store item if key already exists), or upsert (unconditionally store item)

       d, --durability=LEVEL
              Specify durability level for mutation operations. Known values are: "none", "majority", "majority_and_persist_to_active", "persist_to_majority".

       p, --persist-to=NUMNODES
              Wait  until the item has been persisted to at least NUMNODES nodes´ disk. If NUMNODES is 1 then wait until only the master node has persisted the item for this key. You may not specify a number
              greater than the number of nodes actually in the cluster.

       r --replicate-to=NREPLICAS
              Wait until the item has been replicated to at least NREPLICAS replica nodes. The bucket must be configured with at least one replica, and at least NREPLICAS replica nodes must be online.

   observe
       Retrieve persistence and replication information for items.

       This command will print the status of each key to standard error.

       See the OPTIONS for accepted options

   incr
   decr
       These commands increment or decrement a counter item in the cluster. A counter is a value stored as an ASCII string which is readable as a number, thus for example 42.

       These commands will by default refuse to operate on an item which does not exist in the cluster.

       The incr and decr command differ with how they treat the --delta argument. The incr command will treat the value as a positive offset and increment the current value by the amount  specified,  whereas
       the decr command will treat the value as a negative offset and decrement the value by the amount specified.

       In addition to OPTIONS, the following options are supported:

       --initial=_DEFAULT_
              Set  the  initial value for the item if it does not exist in the cluster. The value should be an unsigned 64 bit integer. If this option is not specified and the item does not exist, the opera‐
              tion will fail. If the item does exist, this option is ignored.

       --delta=DELTA
              Set the absolute delta by which the value should change. If the command is incr then the value will be incremented by this amount. If the command is decr then the value will be  decremented  by
              this amount. The default value for this option is 1.

       -e, --expiry=EXPIRATION
              Set the expiration time for the key, in terms of seconds from now.

   hash
       Display mapping information for a key.

       This command diplays mapping information about a key. The mapping information indicates which vBucket the key is mapped to, and which server is currently the master node for the given vBucket.

       See the OPTIONS for accepted options

   lock
       Lock an item in the cluster.

       This will retrieve and lock an item in the cluster, making it inaccessible for modification until it is unlocked (see unlock).

       In addition to the common options (OPTIONS), this command accepts the following options:

       e, --expiry=LOCKTIME
              Specify the amount of time the lock should be held for. If not specified, it will default to the server side maximum of 15 seconds.

   unlock
       Unlock a previously locked item.

       This  command  accepts two mandatory positional arguments which are the key and CAS value. The CAS value should be specified as printed from the lock command (i.e. with the leading 0x hexadecimal pre‐
       fix).

       See the OPTIONS for accepted options

   rm
       Remove an item from the cluster.

       This command will remove an item from the cluster. If the item does not exist, the operation will fail.

       See the OPTIONS for accepted options

   stats
       Retrieve a list of cluster statistics. If positional arguments are passed to this command, only the statistics classified under those keys will be retrieved. See the server documentation  for  a  full
       list of possible statistics categories.

       This command will contact each server in the cluster and retrieve that node´s own set of statistics.

       The  statistics  are  printed to standard output in the form of SERVER STATISTIC VALUE where SERVER is the host:port representation of the node from which has provided this statistic, STATISTIC is the
       name of the current statistical key, and VALUE is the value for this statistic.

       See the OPTIONS for accepted options

   watch
       Retrieve a list of cluster statistics, select specified sub-keys and aggregate values across the cluster. Then continuously poll the stats and display the difference with the previous values.  If  the
       list of stat sub-keys not specified, the command will use cmd_total_ops, cmd_total_gets, cmd_total_sets.

       In addition to the options in the OPTIONS section, the following options are supported: * -n, --interval=VALUE: Update interval in seconds (default 1 second).

   keygen
       Output list of keys that equally distribute amongst every vbucket.

       In addition to the options in the OPTIONS section, the following options are supported: * --keys-per-vbucket=VALUE: Number of keys to generate per vBucket (default 1).

   write-config
       Write the configuration file based on arguments passed.

   strerror
       Decode library error code

   version
       Display information about the underlying version of libcouchbase to which the cbc binary is linked.

   verbosity
       Set  the memcached logging versbosity on the cluster. This affects how the memcached processes write their logs. This command accepts a single positional argument which is a string describing the ver‐
       bosity level to be set. The options are detail, debug info, and warning.

   ping
       Sends NOOP-like request to every service on each cluster node, and report time it took to response.

       --details
              Provide more details about status of the service.

       -t, --table
              Render results as a table.

   view
       Execute an HTTP request against the server´s view (CAPI) interface.

       The request may be one to create a design document, view a design document, or query a view.

       To create a design document, the definition of the document (in JSON) should be piped to the command on standard input.

       This command accepts one positional argument which is the path (relative to the bucket) to execute. Thus to query the brewery_beers view in the beer design document within the beer-sample  bucket  one
       would do: cbc view -U couchbase://localhost/beer-sample design/beer/view/brewery_beers

       In addition to the OPTIONS specified above, the following options are recognized:

       -X, --method=GET|PUT|POST|DELETE
              Specify  the  HTTP method to use for the specific request. The default method is GET to query a view. To delete an existing design document, specify DELETE, and to create a new design document,
              specify PUT.

   query
       Execute a N1QL Query. The cluster must have at least one query node enabled.

       The query itself is passed as a positional argument on the commandline. The query may contain named placeholders (in  the  format  of  $param),  whose  values  may  be  supplied  later  on  using  the
       --qarg=´$param=value´ syntax.

       It is recommended to place the statement in single quotes to avoid shell expansion.

       In addition to the OPTIONS specified above, the following options are recognized:

       -Q, --qopt=SETTING=VALUE
              Specify additional options controlling the execution of the query. This can be used for example, to set the scan_consistency of the query.

       -A, --qarg=PLACEHOLDER=VALUE
              Supply values for placeholders found in the query string. The placeholders must evaluate to valid JSON values.

       --prepare
              Prepare query before issuing. Default is FALSE.

       --analytics
              Perform query to analytics service. Default is FALSE.

   admin
       Execute  an administrative request against the management REST API. Note that in order to perform an administrative API you will need to provide administrative credentials to cbc admin. This means the
       username and password used to log into the administration console.

       This command accepts a single positional argument which is the REST API endpoint (i.e. HTTP path) to execute.

       If the request requires a body, it should be supplied via standard input

       In addition to the OPTIONS specified above, the following options are recognized:

       -X, --method=GET|PUT|POST|DELETE
              Specify the HTTP method to use for the specific request. The default method is GET.

   bucket-create
       Create a bucket in the cluster.

       This command will create a bucket with the name specified as the lone positional argument on the command line.

       As this is an administrative command, the --username and --password options should be supplied administrative credentials.

       In addition to the OPTIONS specified above, the following options are recognized:

       --bucket-type=couchbase|memcached
              Specify the type of bucket to create. A couchbase bucket has persistence to disk and replication. A memached bucket is in-memory only and does not replicate.

       --ram-quota=QUOTA
              Specify the maximum amount of memory the bucket should occupy (per node) in megabytes. If not specified, the default is 512.

       --bucket-password=PASSWORD
              Specify the password to secure this bucket. If passed, this password will be required by all clients attempting to connect to the bucket. If ommitted, this bucket may be accessible to  everyone
              for both read and write access.

       --num-replicas=REPLICAS
              Specify the amount of replicas the bucket should have. This will set the number of nodes each item will be replicated to. If not specified the default is 1.

   bucket-flush
       This command will flush the bucket with the name specified as the lone positional argument on the command line.

       This command does not require administrative level credentials, however it does require that flush be enabled for the bucket.

       See the OPTIONS for accepted options

   role-list
       List accessible RBAC user roles in the cluster.

       In addition to the OPTIONS specified above, the following options are recognized:

       -r, --raw
              Print unformatted server response in JSON form.

   user-list
       List users in the cluster.

       In addition to the OPTIONS specified above, the following options are recognized:

       -r, --raw
              Print unformatted server response in JSON form.

   user-upsert
       Create or update a user in the cluster. Takes user ID as an argument.

       In addition to the OPTIONS specified above, the following options are recognized:

       --domain=local|remote
              The domain, where user account defined. If not specified, the default is local.

       --full-name=FULL_NAME
              The user´s fullname. If not specified, the default is empty string.

       --role=ROLE
              The role associated with user (can be specified multiple times if needed).

       --user-password=PASSWORD
              The password for the user.

   user-delete
       Delete a user in the cluster. Takes user ID as an argument.

       In addition to the OPTIONS specified above, the following options are recognized:

       --domain=local|remote
              The domain, where user account defined. If not specified, the default is local.

   connstr
       This command will parse a connection string into its constituent parts and display them on the screen. The command takes a single positional argument which is the string to parse.

EXAMPLES
   CONNECTION EXAMPLES
       The following shows how to connect to various types of buckets. These examples all show how to retrieve the key key. See OPERATION EXAMPLES for more information on specific sub-commands.

       Connect to a bucket (a_bucket) on a cluster on a remote host (for servers version 5.x+). It uses account ´myname´ and asks password interactively:

           cbc cat key -U couchbase://192.168.33.101/a_bucket -u myname -P-

       Run against a password-less bucket (a_bucket) on a cluster on a remote host (for servers older than 5.x):

           cbc cat key -U couchbase://192.168.33.101/a_bucket

       Connect to an SSL cluster at secure.net. The certificate for the cluster is stored locally at /home/couchbase/couchbase_cert.pem:

           cbc cat key -U couchbases://secure.net/topsecret_bucket?certpath=/home/couchbase/couchbase_cert.pem

       Connect to an SSL cluster at secure.net, ignoring certificate verification. This is insecure but handy for testing:

           cbc cat key -U couchbases://secure.net/topsecret_bucket?ssl=no_verify

       Connect to a password protected bucket (protected) on a remote host (for servers older than 5.x):

           cbc cat key -U couchbase://remote.host.net/protected -P-
           Bucket password:

       Connect to a password protected bucket (for servers older than 5.x), specifying the password on the command line (INSECURE, but useful for testing dummy environments)

           cbc cat key -U couchbase://remote.host.net/protected -P t0ps3cr3t

       Connect to a bucket running on a cluster with a custom REST API port

           cbc cat key -U http://localhost:9000/default

       Connec to bucket running on a cluster with a custom memcached port

           cbc cat key -U couchbase://localhost:12000/default

       Connect  to  a memcached (http://memcached.org) cluster using the binary protocol. A vanilla memcached cluster is not the same as a memcached bucket residing within a couchbase cluster (use the normal
       couchbase:// scheme for that):

           cbc cat key -U memcached://host1,host2,host3,host4

       Connect to a cluster using the HTTP protocol for bootstrap, and set the operation timeout to 5 seconds

           cbc cat key -U couchbase://host/bucket -Dbootstrap_on=http -Doperation_timeout=5

   OPERATION EXAMPLES
       Store a file to the cluster:

           $ cbc cp mystuff.txt
           mystuff.txt         Stored. CAS=0xe15dbe22efc1e00

       Retrieve persistence/replication information about an item (note that Status is a set of bits):

           $ cbc observe mystuff.txt
           mystuff              [Master] Status=0x80, CAS=0x0

       Display mapping information about keys:

           $cbc hash foo bar baz
           foo: [vBucket=115, Index=3] Server: cbnode3:11210, CouchAPI: http://cbnode3:8092/default
           bar: [vBucket=767, Index=0] Server: cbnode1:11210, CouchAPI: http://cbnode1:8092/default
           baz: [vBucket=36, Index=2] Server: cbnode2:11210, CouchAPI: http://cbnode2:8092/default

       Create a bucket:

       Use cbc stats to determine the minimum and maximum timeouts for a lock operation:

           $ cbc stats | grep ep_getl
           localhost:11210 ep_getl_default_timeout 15
           localhost:11210 ep_getl_max_timeout 30
