NAME
       patcat - combine two GUS patches into one stereo extended GUS patch

SYNOPSIS
       patcat left.pat right.pat

DESCRIPTION
       Patcat  combines  two  ordinary monophonic GUS patches to make an extended GUS patch that has two channels.  The left channel is from the first of the two patch files that were combined, and the right
       channel is from the second.  The new extended GUS patch file that is created is named the same as the name of the left patch file but with "-stereo" appended.

       Two monophonic extended GUS patches can also be combined, provided their velocity layers match up.

OPTIONS
       There are no options.
