NAME
       WebAuth::Token::Id - WebAuth id tokens

SYNOPSIS
           my $token = WebAuth::Token::Id->new;
           $token->subject ('user');
           $token->auth ('webkdc');
           $token->creation (time);
           $token->expiration (time + 3600);
           print $token->encode ($keyring), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       A WebAuth id token, which identifies a user to a WebAuth Authentication Server.  This token is sent from the WebKDC to the WAS following a user
       authentication to communicate the authentication information.

CLASS METHODS
       new ()
           Create a new, empty WebAuth::Token::Id.  At least some attributes will have to be set using the accessor methods described below before the token can be
           used.

INSTANCE METHODS
       As with WebAuth module functions, failures are signaled by throwing WebAuth::Exception rather than by return status.

General Methods
       encode (KEYRING)
           Generate the encoded and encrypted form of this token using the provided KEYRING.  The encryption key used will be the one returned by the best_key()
           method of WebAuth::Keyring on that KEYRING.

Accessor Methods
       subject ([SUBJECT])
           Get or set the subject, which holds the authenticated identity of the user holding this token.  This is set for tokens of authenticator type "webkdc",
           but not for tokens of authenticator type "krb5".

       authz_subject ([SUBJECT])
           Get or set the authorization subject, which holds the asserted authorization identity of the user holding this token.  The authorization identity may not
           match the authenticated identity.  It represents a request to use the authorization identity instead of the authentication subject when applying ACLs or
           determining identity in the application.

       auth ([TYPE])
           Get or set the authentication type, which describes what type of authenticator is included in this token.  Currently will be one of the values "webkdc",
           indicating a bearer token, and "krb5", indicating that the token contains a Kerberos authenticator.

       auth_data ([DATA])
           Get or set the authentication data.  If the authenticator type is "krb5", this will hold a Kerberos authenticator such as is created by the make_auth()
           function of the WebAuth::Krb5 module.  It is raw binary data.

       initial_factors ([FACTORS])
           Get or set a comma-separated list of authentication factors used by the user during initial authentication (the single sign-on transaction).  For a list
           of possible factors and their meaning, see the WebAuth protocol specification.

       session_factors ([FACTORS])
           Get or set a comma-separated list of authentication factors used by the user to authenticate this session (this particular visit to this WebAuth
           Application Server).  For a list of possible factors and their meaning, see the WebAuth protocol specification.

       loa ([LOA])
           Get or set the level of assurance established for this user authentication.  This is a number whose values are site-defined but for which increasing
           numbers represent increasing assurance for the authentication.

       creation ([TIMESTAMP])
           Get or set the creation timestamp for this token in seconds since epoch.  If not set, the encoded token will have a creation time set to the time of
           encoding.

       expiration ([TIMESTAMP])
           Get or set the expiration timestamp for this token in seconds since epoch.
