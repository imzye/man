NAME
       libipmimonitoring - a library for IPMI system event and sensor monitoring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ipmi_monitoring.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The  libipmimonitoring  implements  a high level sensor and system event monitoring API. For system events, an iterator interface is provided that allows the user to iterate through system events,
       types, states, and more. For sensors, an iterator and callback interface is provided that allows the user to iterate through sensor values, types, units, states, and more.

       In order to improve efficiency, SDR data will be cached on the host.  By default it is cached in /var/cache/ipmimonitoringsdrcache.

       Interpretation rules for system events and sensors are guided by libfreeipmi(3)'s interpretation library. Configuration of the interpretation rules can be  configurd  via  the  configuration  file
       /etc/freeipmi//freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf.  and /etc/freeipmi//freeipmi_interpret_sensor.conf See freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf(5) and freeipmi_interpret_sensor.conf(5) for more information on con‐
       figuring sensor and system event interpretations.
