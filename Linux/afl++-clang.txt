NAME
       afl-clang-fast - afl-clang-fast++2.68c by <lszekeres@google.com> in PCGUARD mode

SYNOPSIS
       afl-clang-fast[++] [options]

OPTIONS
       This is a helper application for afl-fuzz. It serves as a drop-in replacement
       for clang, letting you recompile third-party code with the required runtime
       instrumentation. A common use pattern would be one of the following:

         CC=/usr/bin/afl-clang-fast ./configure
         CXX=/usr/bin/afl-clang-fast++ ./configure

       In contrast to the traditional afl-clang tool, this version is implemented as
       an LLVM pass and tends to offer improved performance with slow programs.

       Environment variables used:
       AFL_CC: path to the C compiler to use
       AFL_CXX: path to the C++ compiler to use
       AFL_DEBUG: enable developer debugging output
       AFL_DONT_OPTIMIZE: disable optimization instead of -O3
       AFL_HARDEN: adds code hardening to catch memory bugs
       AFL_INST_RATIO: percentage of branches to instrument
       AFL_LLVM_SKIP_NEVERZERO: do not skip zero on trace counters
       AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_COMPARES: enable cascaded comparisons
       AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_COMPARES_BITW: size limit (default 8)
       AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_SWITCHES: casc. comp. in 'switch'
        to cascaded comparisons
       AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_FLOATS: transform floating point comp. to cascaded comp.
       AFL_LLVM_LAF_TRANSFORM_COMPARES: transform library comparison function calls
       AFL_LLVM_LAF_ALL: enables all LAF splits/transforms
       AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT_ALLOW/AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT_DENY: enable instrumentallow/deny listing (selective instrumentation)
       AFL_NO_BUILTIN: compile for use with libtokencap.so
       AFL_PATH: path to instrumenting pass and runtime (afl-llvm-rt.*o)
       AFL_LLVM_DOCUMENT_IDS: document edge IDs given to which function (LTO only)
       AFL_QUIET: suppress verbose output
       AFL_USE_ASAN: activate address sanitizer
       AFL_USE_CFISAN: activate control flow sanitizer
       AFL_USE_MSAN: activate memory sanitizer
       AFL_USE_UBSAN: activate undefined behaviour sanitizer

       afl-clang-fast specific environment variables:
       AFL_LLVM_CMPLOG: log operands of comparisons (RedQueen mutator)
       AFL_LLVM_INSTRUMENT: set instrumentation mode: AFL, CFG (INSTRIM), PCGUARD [DEFAULT], LTO, CTX, NGRAM-2 ... NGRAM-16
        You can also use the old environment variables instead:
         AFL_LLVM_USE_TRACE_PC: use LLVM trace-pc-guard instrumentation [DEFAULT]
         AFL_LLVM_INSTRIM: use light weight instrumentation InsTrim
         AFL_LLVM_INSTRIM_LOOPHEAD: optimize loop tracing for speed (option to INSTRIM)
         AFL_LLVM_CTX: use context sensitive coverage
         AFL_LLVM_NGRAM_SIZE: use ngram prev_loc count coverage

       afl-clang-lto specific environment variables:
       AFL_LLVM_MAP_ADDR: use a fixed coverage map address (speed), e.g. 0x10000
       AFL_LLVM_DOCUMENT_IDS: write all edge IDs and the corresponding functions they are in into this file
       AFL_LLVM_LTO_DONTWRITEID: don't write the highest ID used to a global var
       AFL_LLVM_LTO_STARTID: from which ID to start counting from for a bb
       AFL_REAL_LD: use this lld linker instead of the compiled in path

       afl-clang-lto was built with linker target "" and LTO flags "-flto=full"
       If anything fails - be sure to read README.lto.md!

       afl-clang-fast was built for llvm 11.0.0 with the llvm binary path of "/usr/lib/llvm-11/bin".
