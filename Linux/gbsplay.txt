NAME
       gbsplayrc - Gameboy sound player configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       This manpage describes the configuration file format of gbsplay(1).

SYNTAX
       A configuration file is a text file that may contain options for gbsplay(1) as well as comments.

       Comments are introduced by a hash mark ("#").  A comment continues to the end of the line.

       Whitespace, including empty lines, is ignored.

       An option is set by giving the option name, followed by an equal sign ("=") and the option value.

   Option value types
       Option values can be of these types:

       Boolean
              An integer number in decimal.  0 is considered false, everything else is true.

       Endian A string to select the endianness:

              native native endian

              little little endian

              big    big endian

              For backwards compatibility you can also use just the first character of each option ("n", "l" or "b").

       Filter type
              A string to select the output high-pass filter:

              dmg    Gameboy Classic

              cgb    Gameboy Color

              off    no filter

       Integer
              An integer number in decimal.

       Loop mode
              A string to select the loop mode:

              none   no looping

              range  loop over selected subsongs

              single loop a single subsong

              See LOOP MODES in gbsplay(1) for details.

       Play mode
              A string to select the play mode:

              linear play subsongs in linear order

              random play subsongs in random order where every subsong can be played multiple times

              shuffle
                     play subsongs in random order where every subsong is played only once

       Plugin The name of an output plugin.  Run `gbsplay -o list' to get a list of all available output plugins.

OPTIONS
       endian = Endian
              Set the output endianness.

       fadeout = Integer
              Set the fadeout time in seconds.  Instead of cutting the subsong off hard, do a soft fadeout.

       filter_type = Filter type
              Set the output high-pass filter.

       loop = Boolean
              Set the loop mode to "range" when enabled.  Set the loop mode to "none" when disabled.  Deprecated in favor of the loop_mode option.

       loop_mode = Loop mode
              Set the desired loop mode.

       output_plugin = Plugin
              Set the sound output plugin.

       play_mode = Play mode
              Set the desired play mode.

       rate = Integer
              Set the samplerate in Hz.

       refresh_delay = Integer
              Set the refresh delay in milliseconds.  Larger values will lower CPU usage, but things as subsong changes, fadeouts, reactions to keypresses and the on-screen display will be delayed.

       silence_timeout = Integer
              Set the silence timeout in seconds.  When a subsong contains silence for the given time, the player will skip to the next subsong.

       subsong_gap = Integer
              Set the subsong gap in seconds.  Before playing the next subsong after the subsong timeout, subsong_gap seconds of silence will be played.

       subsong_timeout = Integer
              Set the subsong timeout in seconds.  When a subsong has been played for the given time, the player will skip to the next subsong.  A timeout of 0 seconds disables automatic subsong changes.

       verbosity = Integer
              Set the verbosity level (default: 3).  A value of 0 means no messages on stdout.

FILES
       /etc/gbsplayrc
              Default location of the global configuration file.

       ~/.gbsplayrc
              User configuration file.

BUGS
       If you encounter bugs, please report them via https://github.com/mmitch/gbsplay/issues

EXAMPLE
       A simple configuration file might look like this:

              # select NAS output plugin and play subsongs for at most 5 minutes
              output_plugin = nas
              subsong_timeout = 300
