NAME
       iox-roudi - Iceoryx shared memory management daemon

SYNOPSIS
       iox-roudi [-u ID] [-m MODE] [-l LEVEL] [-x COMPAT] [-k DELAY] [-c FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       iox-roudi is the shared memory management daemon that enables processes to participate in the local Iceoryx data exchange.

OPTIONS
       -u ID, --unique-roudi-id ID
              set the unique RouDi id.

       -m MODE, --monitoring-mode MODE
              set process alive monitoring mode to on (default) or off.

       -l LEVEL, --log-level LEVEL
              set the log level to one of off, fatal, error, warning, info, debug, or verbose.

       -x COMPAT, --compatibility COMPAT
              check the compatibility between runtime libraries and RouDi. Valid values are off, major, minor, patch, commitId, or buildDate.

       -k DELAY, --kill-delay DELAY
              set the delay in seconds until RouDi sends SIGKILL if a process did not respond to SIGTERM.

       -c FILE, --config-file FILE
              Load the configuration file FILE.  By default, RouDi will look for a valid configuration in /etc/iceoryx/roudi_config.toml and fall back to hard-coded settings otherwise.
