NAME
       fusiondirectory-insert-schema - insert schema needed by FusionDirectory into the ldap server

SYNOPSIS
       fusiondirectory-insert-schema [-y] [-n] [-c] [-o options] [path] [-h|-l|-i schema1 schema2|-m schema1 schema2|-e schema1 schema2]

DESCRIPTION
       This program will insert the schema needed by FusionDirectory into the ldap server, or the specified schemas

   Options
       -i    This option insert the given list of schemas instead of the default list

       -m    This option insert the given list of schemas, replacing already inserted versions of those schemas

       -e    This option empty the given list of schemas, removing attributes and objectClasses from those.  This is useful because you cannot delete a schema
             without restarting slapd.

       -l    This option list inserted schemas

       -n    This option will make generated ldifs file to not be deleted after execution. Might be useful to understand errors.

       -c    This option make the program continue even if an error occur

       -y    This option answer yes to all questions. The only question right now is the confirmation one when you ask to empty a schema.

       -o    This option allow you to specify specifics options to give to ldap commands such as ldapmodify, but beware that you will not be able to see things like
             password prompts as the output of these commands is piped.
