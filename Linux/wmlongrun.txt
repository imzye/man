NAME
       wmlongrun - A dockapp to monitor the LongRun(tm) status on Crusoe(tm) processors.

SYNOPSIS
       wmlongrun [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmlongrun command.

       WMLongRun is a program to monitor for LongRun(tm). It displays the current LongRun(tm) settings and status: the frequency, the LongRun(tm) flags (performance or economy), and the performance level
       (expressed as a percentile).

       It  is  a dockapp (dockable application) that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment. It has two user interfaces: an LCD look-alike user in‐
       terface and an LED-interface.  If you select the LCD-interfaces, the back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button over the application.
