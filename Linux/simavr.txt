SIMAVR(1)                                                                                      User Commands                                                                                      SIMAVR(1)

NAME
       simavr - lean and mean AVR simulator

SYNOPSIS
       simavr [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Execute  AVR  firmware,  produce  VCD waveform files and/or run a debugging session. Specify simulation parameters directly in the emulated code using .elf section or by passing command line argu‐
       ments.

       For more complex virtual circuitry prototyping and simulation see AVR simulator development examples and documentation.

OPTIONS
       FILE is an elf or ihex formatted executable firmware, assuming filename extension .hex for ihex files.

       --list-cores
              List all supported AVR cores and exit

       -m CORE, --mcu CORE
              Run simulation on CORE

       -f FREQ, --freq FREQ
              Set core speed in HZ

       -t, --trace
              Run full scale decoder trace

       -ti VECTOR
              Add traces for IRQ vector

       -g, --gdb
              Listen for gdb connection on port 1234

       -ff    Load next .hex file as flash

       -ee    Load next .hex file as eeprom

       -i INPUT, --input INPUT
              Read input signals from a .vcd file

       -v     Raise verbosity level (can be passed more than once)

       -h, --help
              Display usage message and exit

EXAMPLES
       AVR GDB DEBUGGING

       Run the AVR firmware simulation:

              simavr -g -m atmega328p -f 16000000 firmware.elf

       start avr-gdb and optionally enable tui for better source code readability:

               avr-gdb
               (gdb) tui enable

       load the elf formatted firmware and connect to the running simulation:

               (gdb) file firmware.elf
               (gdb) target remote :1234

       set a break point and go ahead, debug:

               (gdb) break main
               (gdb) continue
               (gdb) next
               (gdb) next
