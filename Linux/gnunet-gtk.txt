SYNOPSIS

       -c FILENAME, --config=FILENAME
              load config file (default: ~/.config/gnunet.conf)

       -s, --show-inactive
              show  peers  even  if  we are not connected to them, have no (valid, non-expired) addresses for the peer, thus only know pretty much only their public keys; this will essentially list peers
              that we historically at some point encountered, but have currently no way to contact and that might not be running at all.

       -v, --version
