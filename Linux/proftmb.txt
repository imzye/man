NAME
       proftmb - per-residue prediction of bacterial transmembrane beta barrels

SYNOPSIS
       proftmb [options]

DESCRIPTION
       proftmb predicts bacterial transmembrane beta barrels from sequence using profile fed Hidden Markov Models (HMM).

   Output format
       Self-annotating.  Letters of prediction: 'i' - inside cytoplasm, 'O' - outside cytoplasm, 'U' - up (on chain moving out of cytoplasm), 'D' - down (on chain moving into cytoplasm).

EXAMPLES
        proftmb @/usr/share/proftmb/options -q /usr/share/doc/proftmb/examples/example.Q -o /tmp/example

       The above produces 3 output files: /tmp/example_proftmb_tabular.txt, /tmp/example_proftmb_pretty.txt and /tmp/example_dat.txt.  Compare these to the examples in /usr/share/doc/proftmb/examples.
