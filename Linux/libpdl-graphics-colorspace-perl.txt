NAME
       PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace - colour-space conversions for PDL

SYNOPSIS
           use PDL::LiteF;
           use PDL::IO::Pic;
           use PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace;

           my $image_rgb = PDL->rpic('photo.jpg') if PDL->rpiccan('JPEG');

           # convert RGB value from [0,255] to [0,1]
           $image_rgb = $image_rgb->double / 255;

           my $image_xyz = $image_rgb->rgb_to_xyz( 'sRGB' );

       Or

           my $image_xyz = rgb_to_xyz( $image_rgb, 'sRGB' );

DESCRIPTION
       Does image color space conversions such as RGB to XYZ and Lab to LCH. Derived from Graphics::ColorObject (Izvorski & Reibenschuh, 2005) but since it's implemented in C and PDL, it runs *much*
       faster.

       Often the conversion will return out-of-gamut values. Retaining out-of-gamut values allows chained conversions to be lossless and reverse conversions to produce the original values. You can clip
       the values to be within-gamut if necessary. Please check the specific color space for the gamut range.

COLOR SPACES
   RGB
       An RGB color space is any additive color space based on the RGB color model. A particular RGB color space is defined by the three chromaticities of the red, green, and blue additive primaries, and
       can produce any chromaticity that is the triangle defined by those primary colors. The complete specification of an RGB color space also requires a white point chromaticity and a gamma correction
       curve.

       For more info on the RGB color space, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space>.

       This module expects and produces RGB values normalized to be in the range of [0,1]. If you have / need integer value between [0,255], divide or multiply the values by 255.

   CMYK
       CMYK refers to the four inks used in some color printing: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black). The CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking colors on a lighter, usually white,
       background. The ink reduces the light that would otherwise be reflected. Such a model is called subtractive because inks "subtract" brightness from white.

       In additive color models such as RGB, white is the "additive" combination of all primary colored lights, while black is the absence of light. In the CMYK model, it is the opposite: white is the
       natural color of the paper or other background, while black results from a full combination of colored inks. To save money on ink, and to produce deeper black tones, unsaturated and dark colors
       are produced by using black ink instead of the combination of cyan, magenta and yellow.

       For more info, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model>.

   HSL
       Hue, Saturation and Luminance (or brightness).

       The HSL color space defines colors more naturally: Hue specifies the base color, the other two values then let you specify the saturation of that color and how bright the color should be.

       Hue is specified here as degrees ranging from 0 to 360. There are 6 base colors:

           0    red
           60    yellow
           120    green
           180    cyan
           240    blue
           300    magenta
           360    red

       Saturation specifies the distance from the middle of the color wheel. So a saturation value of 0 (0%) means "center of the wheel", i.e. a grey value, whereas a saturation value of 1 (100%) means
       "at the border of the wheel", where the color is fully saturated.

       Luminance describes how "bright" the color is. 0 (0%) means 0 brightness and the color is black. 1 (100%) means maximum brightness and the color is white.

       For more info, see <http://www.chaospro.de/documentation/html/paletteeditor/colorspace_hsl.htm>.

   XYZ and xyY
       The CIE XYZ color space was derived the CIE RGB color space. XYZ are three hypothetical primaries. Y means brightness, Z is quasi-equal to blue stimulation, and X is a mix which looks like red
       sensitivity curve of cones.  All visible colors can be represented by using only positive values of X, Y, and Z. The main advantage of the CIE XYZ space (and any color space based on it) is that
       this space is completely device-independent.

       For more info, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space>.

   Lab
       A Lab color space is a color-opponent space with dimension L for lightness and a and b for the color-opponent dimensions, based on nonlinearly compressed CIE XYZ color space coordinates. It's
       derived from the "master" space CIE 1931 XYZ color space but is more perceptually uniform than XYZ. The Lab space is relative to the white point of the XYZ data they were converted from. Lab
       values do not define absolute colors unless the white point is also specified.

       For more info, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space>.

   LCH
       This is possibly a little easier to comprehend than the Lab colour space, with which it shares several features. It is more correctly known as  L*C*H*.  Essentially it is in the form of a sphere.
       There are three axes; L* and C* and H°.

       The L* axis represents Lightness. This is vertical; from 0, which has no lightness (i.e. absolute black), at the bottom; through 50 in the middle, to 100 which is maximum lightness (i.e. absolute
       white) at the top.

       The C* axis represents Chroma or "saturation". This ranges from 0 at the centre of the circle, which is completely unsaturated (i.e. a neutral grey, black or white) to 100 or more at the edge of
       the circle for very high Chroma (saturation) or "colour purity".

       If we take a horizontal slice through the centre, we see a coloured circle. Around the edge of the circle we see every possible saturated colour, or Hue. This circular axis is known as H° for Hue.
       The units are in the form of degrees° (or angles), ranging from 0 (red) through 90 (yellow), 180 (green), 270 (blue) and back to 0.

       For more info, see <http://www.colourphil.co.uk/lab_lch_colour_space.html>.

OPTIONS
       Some conversions require specifying the RGB space which includes gamma curve and white point definitions. Supported RGB spaces include (aliases in square brackets):

           Adobe RGB (1998) [Adobe]
           Apple RGB [Apple]
           BestRGB
           Beta RGB
           BruceRGB
           CIE
           ColorMatch
           DonRGB4
           ECI
           Ekta Space PS5
           NTSC [601] [CIE Rec 601]
           PAL/SECAM [PAL] [CIE ITU]
           ProPhoto
           SMPTE-C [SMPTE]
           WideGamut
           sRGB [709] [CIE Rec 709]
           lsRGB

       You can also add custom RGB space definitions via the function add_rgb_space.  Alternatively, as of 0.202 you can directly supply the function with a hash-ref in the same format.

CONVERSIONS
       Some conversions, if not already included as functions, can be achieved by chaining existing functions. For example, LCH to HSV conversion can be achieved by chaining lch_to_rgb and rgb_to_hsv:

           my $hsv = rgb_to_hsv( lch_to_rgb( $lch, 'sRGB' ), 'sRGB' );

       To generate a local diagram of what conversions are available between formats, using GraphViz, you can use this script:

         use blib;
         use PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace;
         print "digraph {\n";
         print join(' -> ', split /_to_/), "\n"
           for grep !/^_/ && /_to_/, @PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace::EXPORT_OK;
         print "}\n";
         # then:
         perl scriptname >d.dot; dot -Tsvg d.dot >d.svg; display d.svg

       (As of 0.202, this is everything to and from "rgb", plus "xyz" <-> "lab" <-> "lch")
