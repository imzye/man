NAME
       getmail_mbox - read a message from stdin and deliver to a named mboxrd-format mbox file with fcntl-style locking.

SYNOPSIS
       getmail_mbox [OPTION] PATH

DESCRIPTION
       Deliver  a  mail  message from standard input, to the mboxrd-format mbox file named PATH.  PATH must start with a dot or a slash and must not end with a slash.  fcntl-type locking is used; if your
       system requires another type of locking (such as flock or dotlock ), use an MDA configured for that style of locking instead.

       getmail_mbox uses the SENDER environment variable to construct a Return-Path: header field and the contents of the RECIPIENT environment variable to construct a Delivered-To: header field  at  the
       top of the message.  SENDER is also used in creating the mbox From_ line.

       --verbose, -v
              print a status message on success
