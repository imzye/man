NAME
       bbkeys - a general XWindow keygrabber

SYNOPSIS
       bbkeys [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       bbkeys  is  the keygrabber for the blackbox window manager. bbkeys han‐
       dles all keybindings and keyboard  shortcuts  for   blackbox.  It  uses
       blackbox's Image classes for rendering its look and feel so that bbkeys
       will render itself to match whatever blackbox  style  is  used.  It  is
       highly  configurable either via the bbconf GUI utility or the (now dep‐
       recated) bbkeysconf GUI utility or  by  hand-editting  bbkeys's  config
       file.

USAGE
       On startup, bbkeys reads $HOME/.bbkeysrc, which you can edit by hand or
       through bbconf or bbkeysconf. This is now configurable through  a  com‐
       mand-line switch as show in OPTIONS.
