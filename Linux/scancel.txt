NAME
       scancel - Used to signal jobs or job steps that are under the control of Slurm.

SYNOPSIS
       scancel [OPTIONS...] [job_id[_array_id][.step_id]] [job_id[_array_id][.step_id]...]

DESCRIPTION
       scancel  is  used to signal or cancel jobs, job arrays or job steps.  An arbitrary number of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job specification filters or a space separated list of specific job
       and/or job step IDs.  If the job ID of a job array is specified with an array ID value then only that job array element will be cancelled.  If the job ID of a job array is specified without  an  array
       ID value then all job array elements will be cancelled.  While a heterogeneous job is in pending state, only the entire job can be cancelled rather than its individual components.  A request to cancel
       an individual component of a heterogeneous job not in pending state will return an error.  After the job has begun execution, the individual component can be cancelled.  A job or job step can only  be
       signaled by the owner of that job or user root.  If an attempt is made by an unauthorized user to signal a job or job step, an error message will be printed and the job will not be signaled.

OPTIONS
       -A, --account=account
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs under this charge account.

       -b, --batch
              By default, signals other than SIGKILL are not sent to the batch step (the shell script). With this option scancel signals only the batch step, but not any other steps.  This is useful when the
              shell script has to trap the signal and take some application defined action.  Note that most shells cannot handle signals while a command is running (child process  of  the  batch  step),  the
              shell  use  to  wait until the command ends to then handle the signal. Children of the batch step are not signaled with this option, use -f, --full instead.  NOTE: If used with -f, --full, this
              option ignored.  NOTE: This option is not applicable if step_id is specified.  NOTE: The shell itself may exit upon receipt of many signals.  You may  avoid  this  by  explicitly  trap  signals
              within the shell script (e.g. "trap <arg> <signals>"). See the shell documentation for details.

       --ctld Send  the job signal request to the slurmctld daemon rather than directly to the slurmd daemons. This increases overhead, but offers better fault tolerance.  This is the default behavior on ar‐
              chitectures using front end nodes (e.g.  Cray ALPS computers) or when the --clusters option is used.

       -f, --full
              By default, signals other than SIGKILL are not sent to the batch step (the shell script). With this option scancel signals also the batch script and its children processes.  Most shells  cannot
              handle  signals  while  a command is running (child process of the batch step), the shell use to wait until the command ends to then handle the signal. Unlike -b, --batch, children of the batch
              step are also signaled with this option.  NOTE: srun steps are also children of the batch step, so steps are also signaled with this option.

       --help Print a help message describing all scancel options.

       -H, --hurry
              Do not stage out any burst buffer data.

       -i, --interactive
              Interactive mode. Confirm each job_id.step_id before performing the cancel operation.

       -M, --clusters=<string>
              Cluster to issue commands to. Implies --ctld.  Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.

       -n, --jobname=job_name, --name=job_name
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this job name.

       -p, --partition=partition_name
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs in this partition.

       -q, --qos=qos
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this quality of service.

       -Q, --quiet
              Do not report an error if the specified job is already completed.  This option is incompatible with the --verbose option.

       -R, --reservation=reservation_name
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this reservation name.

       --sibling=cluster_name
              Remove an active sibling job from a federated job.

       -s, --signal=signal_name
              The name or number of the signal to send.  If this option is not used the specified job or step will be terminated. Note. If this option is used the signal is sent directly to the slurmd  where
              the job is running bypassing the slurmctld thus the job state will not change even if the signal is delivered to it. Use the scontrol command if you want the job state change be known to slurm‐
              ctld.

       -t, --state=job_state_name
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs in this state. job_state_name may have a value of either "PENDING", "RUNNING" or "SUSPENDED".

       -u, --user=user_name
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs owned by this user.

       --usage
              Print a brief help message listing the scancel options.

       -v, --verbose
              Print additional logging. Multiple v's increase logging detail.  This option is incompatible with the --quiet option.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of the scancel command.

       -w, --nodelist=host1,host2,...
              Cancel any jobs using any of the given hosts.  The list may be specified as a comma-separated list of hosts, a range of hosts (host[1-5,7,...] for example), or a filename. The host list will be
              assumed to be a filename only if it contains a "/" character.

       --wckey=wckey
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs using this workload characterization key.

       ARGUMENTS

       job_id The Slurm job ID to be signaled.

       step_id
              The step ID of the job step to be signaled.  If not specified, the operation is performed at the level of a job.

              If neither --batch nor --signal are used, the entire job will be terminated.

              When --batch is used, the batch shell processes will be signaled.  The child processes of the shell will not be signaled by Slurm, but the shell may forward the signal.

              When --batch is not used but --signal is used, then all job steps will be signaled, but the batch script itself will not be signaled.

PERFORMANCE
       Executing  scancel  sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from scancel or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmctld daemon come in at once, it
       can result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run scancel or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to scancel to the  mini‐
       mum necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Some  scancel  options  may  be  set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.  (Note: Command line options will always override
       these settings.)

       SCANCEL_ACCOUNT     -A, --account=account

       SCANCEL_BATCH       -b, --batch

       SCANCEL_CTLD        --ctld

       SCANCEL_FULL        -f, --full

       SCANCEL_HURRY       -H, --hurry

       SCANCEL_INTERACTIVE -i, --interactive

       SCANCEL_NAME        -n, --name=job_name

       SCANCEL_PARTITION   -p, --partition=partition_name

       SCANCEL_QOS         -q, --qos=qos

       SCANCEL_STATE       -t, --state=job_state_name

       SCANCEL_USER        -u, --user=user_name

       SCANCEL_VERBOSE     -v, --verbose

       SCANCEL_WCKEY       --wckey=wckey

       SLURM_CONF          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       SLURM_CLUSTERS      -M, --clusters

NOTES
       If multiple filters are supplied (e.g. --partition and --name) only the jobs satisfying all of the filtering options will be signaled.

       Cancelling a job step will not result in the job being terminated.  The job must be cancelled to release a resource allocation.

       To cancel a job, invoke scancel without --signal option.  This will send first a SIGCONT to all steps to eventually wake them up followed by a SIGTERM, then wait the KillWait duration defined  in  the
       slurm.conf file and finally if they have not terminated send a SIGKILL.  This gives time for the running job/step(s) to clean up.

       If a signal value of "KILL" is sent to an entire job, this will cancel the active job steps but not cancel the job itself.

       On  Cray systems, all signals except SIGCHLD, SIGCONT, SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, SIGURG, or SIGWINCH cause the ALPS reservation to be released.  The job however will not be terminated except
       in the case of SIGKILL and may then be used for post processing.

AUTHORIZATION
       When using SlurmDBD, users who have an AdminLevel defined (Operator or Admin) and users who are account coordinators are given the authority to invoke scancel on other users jobs.

EXAMPLES
       Send SIGTERM to steps 1 and 3 of job 1234:

              $ scancel --signal=TERM 1234.1 1234.3

       Cancel job 1234 along with all of its steps:

              $ scancel 1234

       Send SIGKILL to all steps of job 1235, but do not cancel the job itself:

              $ scancel --signal=KILL 1235

       Send SIGUSR1 to the batch shell processes of job 1236:

              $ scancel --signal=USR1 --batch 1236

       Cancel all pending jobs belonging to user "bob" in partition "debug":

              $ scancel --state=PENDING --user=bob --partition=debug

       Cancel only array ID 4 of job array 1237

              $ scancel 1237_4
