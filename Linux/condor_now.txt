CONDOR_NOW(1)                                                                                   HTCondor Manual                                                                                   CONDOR_NOW(1)

NAME
       condor_now - HTCondor Manual

       Start a job now.

SYNOPSIS
       condor_now -help

       condor_now [-name] [-debug] now-job vacate-job

DESCRIPTION
       condor_now tries to run the now-job now. The vacate-job is immediately vacated; after it terminates, if the schedd still has the claim to the vacated job's slot - and it usually will - the schedd will
       immediately start the now-job on that slot.

       You must specify each job using both the cluster and proc IDs.

OPTIONS
          -help  Print a usage reminder.

          -debug Print debugging output. Control the verbosity with the environment variables _CONDOR_TOOL_DEBUG, as usual.

          -name **
                 Specify the scheduler('s name) and (optionally) the pool to find it in.

GENERAL REMARKS
       The now-job and the vacated-job must have the same owner; if you are not the queue super-user, you must own both jobs. The jobs must be on the same schedd, and both jobs must be in  the  vanilla  uni‐
       verse. The now-job must be idle and the vacated-job must be running.

EXAMPLES
       To begin running job 17.3 as soon as possible using job 4.2's slot:

          condor_now 17.3 4.2

       To try to figure out why that doesn't work for the 'magic' scheduler in the 'gandalf' pool, set the environment variable _CONDOR_TOOL_DEBUG to 'D_FULLDEBUG' and then:

          condor_now -debug -schedd magic -pool gandalf 17.3 4.2

EXIT STATUS
       condor_now  will  exit  with  a status value of 0 (zero) if the schedd accepts its request to vacate the vacate-job and start the now-job in its place. It does not wait for the now-job to have started
       running.
