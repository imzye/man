NAME
       brotli-rs - A brotli compressor and decompressor.

SYNOPSIS
       brotli-rs [FLAGS]

DESCRIPTION
       A  brotli  compressor  and decompressor that with an interface avoiding the rust stdlib.  This makes it suitable for embedded devices and kernels. It is designed with a pluggable allocator so that
       the standard lib's allocator may be employed. All included code is safe.

FLAGS
       -catable, --catable
              Enable concatable mode, so that the generated data can be added to block generated with --apendable

       -nothreadpool, --nothreadpool
              Disables the work thread pool

       -appendable, --appendable
              Enables apendable mode, so that the datastream can be extended with more data from the --catable mode

       -magic, --magic
              Enables magic number as the first bytes, so that a brotli compressed stream can be easily detected

       -customdictionary=[FILE]
              Reads a custom dictionare from file

       -utf8  Forces the utf8 context mode in the compression

       -lsb   Forces the lsb context mode in the compression

       -signed
              Forces the signed context mode in the compression

       -efficient

       -9.5x, -q9.5x
              Sets quality = 11

       -q9.5y Sets quality = 12

       -l[NUMBER]
              Sets the input block size

       -j[NUMBER]
