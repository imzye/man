NAME

SYNOPSIS
       gapd [-h HOST|-a|-l|-u] [-p PORT] [-t [MODE]] [--infolevel[-scscp|-master] LEVEL] [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       GAP Daemon - GAP SCSCP server daemon

OPTIONS
       -h HOST
              Start at host HOST: HOST may be given as machine name with or without domain or as 'localhost' (see option -l for that purpose).

       -a     Set server address to the one given by hostname(1).

       -l     Start at localhost: reject incoming any connection from the outside.

       -u     Start in `universal' mode: accept all incoming connections.

       -p PORT

       -t MODE
              Redirect  the  server  session output according to the following MODEs: MODE=no sink the output to `/dev/null' (default behaviour); MODE=log redirect the output to `/var/log/gapd/gapd.log';
              MODE=yes redirect the output to a temporary file, which name is displayed (and printed to `/var/log/gapd/gapd.log' for granted users); the implicit mode is MODE=yes for backward compatibil‐
              ity.
