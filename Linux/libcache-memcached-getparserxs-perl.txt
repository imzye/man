NAME
       Cache::Memcached::GetParserXS - GetParser implementation in XS for use with Cache::Memcached

SYNOPSIS
         use Cache::Memcached::GetParserXS;
         use Cache::Memcached;

         # Everything else is the same as Cache::Memcached has documented it.
         # Seriously.

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the same function as Cache::Memcached::GetParser, except it's written in C/XS. Initial benchmarks have shown it to be possibly twice as fast as the original perl version.
