NAME
       convert4chan - is a utility for converting pairs of stereo impulse response files to to a single 'True Stereo' 4-channel files.
       ir.lv2 - LV2 IR reverb plugin supports these so-called 'True Stereo' impulses.

USAGE
       convert4chan /path/to/impulses/directory

       or

       cd /path/to/impulses/directory and run convert4chan

DESCRIPTION
       convert4chan  is  not  itself  a generally useful program, but just a utility with very limited scope, Error checking is limited; you are not supposed to run
       convert4chan on your / .

       You can use it to convert a full directory tree of stereo impulse response files with similar names that end with L.wav and R.wav to  'True  Stereo'  format,
       while your original files in directory stay untouched and can be later used as impulses as well.

       ´True  Stereo'  impulses  are four channel impulses that describe a full convolution matrix (the four channels contain, in order, the convolution paths L->L,
       L->R, R->L, R->R).

       convert4chan searching for stereo files named:

       root/somewhere/somethingL.wav
       root/somewhere/somethingR.wav

       and convert them to:

       root/somewhere/something4.wav

       convert4chan supports filenames ending in .wav by design, but it is possible that in future will supports other audio formats too (It could all audio formats
       supported by libsndfile in theory.)
