DESCRIPTION
       Select, insert, or copy Unicode characters like emoji using rofi.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Prints brief usage information.

       --version
              show program’s version number and exit

       --action, -a
              Possible values: type, copy, clipboard, unicode, copy-unicode, print

              Choose what to do with the selected characters: Directly type them with the “Typer”, copy them to the clipboard using the “Clipboarder”, or insert them indirectly using  the  clipboard.   “uni‐
              code” will type the unicode codepoints of the chosen characters, “copy-unicode” will copy it.  “print” just outputs them on stdout.

       --skin-tone=skin-tone, -s skin-tone
              Possible values: neutral, light, medium-light, moderate, dark brown, black, ask

              Decide on a skin-tone for all supported emojis.  If not set (or set to “ask”), you will be asked for each one

       --files=FILE [FILE ...], -f FILE [FILE ...]
              Read characters from this file instead, one entry per line

       --prompt PROMPT, -r PROMPT
              Set rofimoji’s prompt

       --selector-args SELECTOR-ARGS
              A string of arguments to give to the selector.

       --max-recent MAX-RECENT
              Show at most this number of recently used characters (cannot be larger than 10)

       --no-frecency
              Don’t show frequently used characters at the start.

       --clipboarder CLIPBOARDER
              Possible values: xsel, xclip, wl-copy

              Choose the application to access the clipboard with manually.

       --typer TYPER
              Possible values: xdotool, wtype

              Choose the application to type with manually.

       --selector SELECTOR
              Possible values: rofi, wofi

              Choose the selector application manually.  Usually rofi, but for Wayland, you may want wofi.  # KEYBINDINGS

CONFIGURATION
       Args that start with “--” (eg.  --version) can also be set in a config file.

       Config  file  syntax  allows: key=value, flag=true, stuff=[a,b,c] (for details, see syntax at https://github.com/fdw/rofimoji#example-config-file).  If an arg is specified in more than one place, then
       commandline values override values from the config file.
