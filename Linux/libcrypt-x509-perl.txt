NAME
       Crypt::X509 - Parse a X.509 certificate

SYNOPSIS
        use Crypt::X509;

        $decoded = Crypt::X509->new( cert => $cert );

        $subject_email = $decoded->subject_email;
        print "do not use after: ".gmtime($decoded->not_after)." GMT\n";

REQUIRES
       Convert::ASN1

DESCRIPTION
       Crypt::X509 parses X.509 certificates. Methods are provided for accessing most certificate elements.

       It is based on the generic ASN.1 module by Graham Barr, on the x509decode example by Norbert Klasen and contributions on the perl-ldap-dev-Mailinglist by Chriss Ridd.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new ( OPTIONS )
       Creates and returns a parsed X.509 certificate hash, containing the parsed contents. The data is organised as specified in RFC 2459.  By default only the first ASN.1 Layer is decoded. Nested
       decoding is done automagically through the data access methods.

       cert => $certificate
           A variable containing the DER formatted certificate to be parsed (eg. as stored in "usercertificate;binary" attribute in an LDAP-directory).

         use Crypt::X509;
         use Data::Dumper;

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);

         print Dumper($decoded);

METHODS
   error
       Returns the last error from parsing, "undef" when no error occured.  This error is updated on deeper parsing with the data access methods.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         if ($decoded->error) {
           warn "Error on parsing Certificate:".$decoded->error;
         }

DATA ACCESS METHODS
       You can access all parsed data directly from the returned hash. For convenience the following methods have been implemented to give quick access to the most-used certificate attributes.

   version
       Returns the certificate's version as an integer.  NOTE that version is defined as an Integer where 0 = v1, 1 = v2, and 2 = v3.

   version_string
       Returns the certificate's version as a string value.

   serial
       returns the serial number (integer or Math::BigInt Object, that gets automagic evaluated in scalar context) from the certificate

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         print "Certificate has serial number:".$decoded->serial."\n";

   not_before
       returns the GMT-timestamp of the certificate's beginning date of validity.  If the Certificate holds this Entry in utcTime, it is guaranteed by the RFC to been correct.

       As  utcTime is limited to 32-bit values (like unix-timestamps) newer certificates hold the timesamps as "generalTime"-entries. The contents of "generalTime"-entries are not well defined in the RFC
       and are returned by this module unmodified, if no utcTime-entry is found.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         if ($decoded->notBefore < time()) {
           warn "Certificate: not yet valid!";
         }

   not_after
       returns the GMT-timestamp of the certificate's ending date of validity.  If the Certificate holds this Entry in utcTime, it is guaranteed by the RFC to been correct.

       As utcTime is limited to 32-bit values (like unix-timestamps) newer certificates hold the timesamps as "generalTime"-entries. The contents of "generalTime"-entries are not well defined in the  RFC
       and are returned by this module unmodified, if no utcTime-entry is found.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         print "Certificate expires on ".gmtime($decoded->not_after)." GMT\n";

   signature
       Return's the certificate's signature in binary DER format.

   pubkey
       Returns the certificate's public key in binary DER format.

   pubkey_size
       Returns the certificate's public key size.

   pubkey_algorithm
       Returns the algorithm as OID string which the public key was created with.

   PubKeyAlg
       returns the subject public key encryption algorithm (e.g. 'RSA') as string.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         print "Certificate public key is encrypted with:".$decoded->PubKeyAlg."\n";

         Example Output: Certificate public key is encrypted with: RSA

   pubkey_components
       If this certificate contains an RSA key, this function returns a hashref { modulus => $m, exponent => $e) from that key; each value in the hash will be an integer scalar or a Math::BigInt object.

       For other pubkey types, it returns undef (implementations welcome!).

   sig_algorithm
       Returns the certificate's signature algorithm as OID string

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         print "Certificate signature is encrypted with:".$decoded->sig_algorithm."\n";>

         Example Output: Certificate signature is encrypted with: 1.2.840.113549.1.1.5

   SigEncAlg
       returns the signature encryption algorithm (e.g. 'RSA') as string.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         print "Certificate signature is encrypted with:".$decoded->SigEncAlg."\n";

         Example Output: Certificate signature is encrypted with: RSA

   SigHashAlg
       returns the signature hashing algorithm (e.g. 'SHA1') as string.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         print "Certificate signature is hashed with:".$decoded->SigHashAlg."\n";

         Example Output: Certificate signature is encrypted with: SHA1

   Subject
       returns  a  pointer  to  an array of strings containing subject nameparts of the certificate. Attributenames for the most common Attributes are translated from the OID-Numbers, unknown numbers are
       output verbatim.

       If the extension is marked critical, this is also reported.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new(cert => $cert);
         print "Allowed usages for this Certificate are:\n".join("\n",@{$decoded->KeyUsage})."\n";

         Example Output:

       codeSigning, emailProtection, timeStamping, OCSPSigning

       If the extension is marked critical, this is also reported.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new($cert);
         print "ExtKeyUsage extension of this Certificates is: ", join(", ", @{$decoded->ExtKeyUsage}), "\n";

         Example Output: ExtKeyUsage extension of this Certificates is: critical, serverAuth

   SubjectAltName

       DNS-Names for server certificates.

       It also pre-pends the field type (ie rfc822Name) to the returned value.

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new($cert);
         print "E-Mail or Hostnames in this Certificates is/are:", join(", ", @{$decoded->SubjectAltName}), "\n";

         Example Output: E-Mail or Hostnames in this Certificates is/are: rfc822Name=user@server.com

   DecodedSubjectAltNames
       Returns a pointer to an array of strings containing all the alternative subject name extensions.

       Each such extension is represented as a decoded ASN.1 value, i.e. a pointer to a list of pointers to objects, each object having a single key with the type of the  alternative  name  and  a  value
       specific to that type.

       Example return value:

         [
           [
             {
               'directoryName' => {
                 'rdnSequence' => [
                   [
                     {

                       'type' => '2.5.4.3'
                     }
                   ]
                 ]
               }
             },
             {
               'dNSName' => 'example.com'

         $decoded= Crypt::X509->new($cert);
         print "Certificate was authorised by:".join(',',@{$decoded->authorityCertIssuer})."\n";
