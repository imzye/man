SYNOPSIS
       opendkim-gengraphs [options]

DESCRIPTION
       opendkim-gengraphs collates data accumulated by the OpenDKIM statistics feature into an HTML report including graphs about the daily behaviour of specific domains of interest.

       Requires access to gnuplot(1).

       --dbname=name
              Requests a connection to the database called name.  The default is "opendkim".

       --dbpasswd=password
              Attempts to authenticate to the database server using the specified password.  The default is "opendkim".

       --domain={ domain | file }
              Adds  the  named  domain, or domains extracted from the named file, to the set of domains for which a graph should be generated.  Strings that start with "/" or "./" are assumed to be files
              from which domain naems should be read.

       --nocircles
              Prevents the script from requesting circles in graphs to show point magnitude (also known as a bubble graph) for installations that have versions of gnuplot(1) that don't support it.
