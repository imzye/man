NAME
       wmtv - dockable video4linux TV player for WindowMaker.

SYNOPSIS
       wmtv [--exe program]

DESCRIPTION
       wmtv is a dockable video4linux TV player. It supports channel presets, PAL/Secam/NTSC, fine tuning, full screen display, ...

OPTIONS
       -c, --device
              Specifies the video4linux device to use.

       -d, --display
              Specifies the X server to contact.

       -e, --exe
              Launch an external TV player when the screen is double clicked. It is possible to pass some parameters to this external application with % codes.

USAGE
       This sections describes how to use the application in docked state. See below for fullscreen mode usage.

       Button map:
           [ < ] [ > ] [ 0 ]
            <1>   <2>   <3>

       There are 3 modes of operation on this applications. You can cycle through the 3 modes by clicking on the right most button <3>.

       The 3 modes are described below:

            On mode
            Clicking  on  the rightmost button <3> for the first time (after the start of WMTV) will turn the TV on. While in this mode, the left <1> and right <2> buttons change to preset channels which
            has been defined in your config file. Use the left button to move down one channel and the right button to move up one channel.

            Tune mode
            Clicking again on button <3> after On mode will change WMTV into tune mode. Left-clicking on the left <1> or right <2> button performs a channel scan. Scanning stops when there  is  a  strong
            signal  strength.  Right-clicking on the left <1> or right <2> button fine tunes the current channel. After tuning, clicking on button <3> saves the fine tuning to your config file and brings
            you back into "On mode".

            Off mode
            Holding down button <3> for about 3 seconds from any of the two modes described above turns the TV off.

       Right-clicking the TV screen mutes/unmutes the audio.

       Double left-clicking the TV screen launches the application specified with --exe. If --exe was not specified, then the built-in full-screen mode is used instead. Double middle-clicking will always
       invoke the built-in full screen mode.

FULL SCREEN MODE
       To exit full screen mode, click.

       Keyboard functions
         Up     - Change to next preset channel.
         Down   - Change to previous preset channel.
         Right  - Increase volume. (If supported by the v4l device.)
         Left   - Decrease volume. (If supported.)
         Escape - Leave full screen mode.
         m      - mute/unmute.

EXTERNAL APPLICATION
       It is possible to pass some parameters to the external application through % codes:
         %% is replaced by a single %.
         %n is replaced by the name of the current channel.
         %# is replaced by the number of the current channel.
         %f is replaced by the current frequency in MHz.
       The behavior of other % codes is undefined and subject to change.

       Example: wmtv -e 'xawtv "%n"'

         or
         SE11    LAST CHANNEL    # channel SE11 called "LAST CHANNEL"

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. It is widely based on the README provided with the program.
