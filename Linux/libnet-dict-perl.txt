NAME
       tkdict - a perl client for accessing network dictionary servers

SYNOPSIS
       tkdict [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       tkdict is a Perl/Tk client for the Dictionary server protocol (DICT), which is used to query natural dictionaries hosted on a remote machine.

       At the moment it's not very user oriented, since I've just been creating an interface to the protocol.

       There is more information available in the Help menu when running tkdict.

OPTIONS
       -h server or -host server
           The hostname for the DICT server.

       -p port or -port port
           Specify the port for connections (default is 2628, from RFC 2229).

       -c string or -client string
           Specify the CLIENT identification string sent to the DICT server.

       -help
           Display a short help message including command-line options.

       -doc
           Display the full documentation for tkdict.

       -version
           Display the version of tkdict

       -verbose
           Display verbose information as tkdict runs.

       -debug
           Display debugging information as tkdict runs.  Useful mainly for developers.

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       •   tkdict doesn't know how to handle firewalls.

       •   The authentication aspects of RFC 2229 aren't currently supported.

       •   See the ToDo page under the Help menu.
