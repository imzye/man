NAME
     rabbitmqctl — tool for managing RabbitMQ nodes

SYNOPSIS
     rabbitmqctl [-q] [-s] [-l] [-n node] [-t timeout] command [command_options]

DESCRIPTION
     RabbitMQ is an open source multi-protocol messaging broker.

     rabbitmqctl is the main command line tool for managing a RabbitMQ server node, together with rabbitmq-diagnostics , rabbitmq-upgrade , and others.

     It performs all actions by connecting to the target RabbitMQ node on a dedicated CLI tool communication port and authenticating using a shared secret (known as the cookie file).

     Diagnostic information is displayed if connection failed, the target node was not running, or rabbitmqctl could not authenticate to the target node successfully.  To learn more, see the RabbitMQ CLI
     Tools guide: https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html and RabbitMQ Networking guide: https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html

OPTIONS
     -n node
             Default node is "rabbit@target-hostname", where target-hostname is the local host.  On a host named "myserver.example.com", the node name will usually be "rabbit@myserver" (unless
             RABBITMQ_NODENAME has been overridden).  The output of "hostname -s" is usually the correct suffix to use after the "@" sign.  See rabbitmq-server(8) for details of configuring a RabbitMQ node.

     -q, --quiet
             Quiet output mode is selected.  Informational messages are reduced when quiet mode is in effect.

     -s, --silent
             Silent output mode is selected.  Informational messages are reduced and table headers are suppressed when silent mode is in effect.

     --no-table-headers
             Do not output headers for tabular data.

     --dry-run
             Do not run the command.  Only print information message.

     -t timeout, --timeout timeout
             Operation timeout in seconds.  Not all commands support timeouts.  Default is infinity.

     -l, --longnames
             Must be specified when the cluster is configured to use long (FQDN) node names.  To learn more, see the RabbitMQ Clustering guide: https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html

     --erlang-cookie cookie
             Shared secret to use to authenticate to the target node.  Prefer using a local file or the RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE environment variable instead of specifying this option on the command line.  To
             learn more, see the RabbitMQ CLI Tools guide: https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html

COMMANDS
     help [-l] [command_name]

             Prints usage for all available commands.

             -l, --list-commands
                     List command usages only, without parameter explanation.

             command_name
                     Prints usage for the specified command.

     version

             Displays CLI tools version

   Nodes
     await_startup

             Waits for the RabbitMQ application to start on the target node

             For example, to wait for the RabbitMQ application to start:

                   rabbitmqctl await_startup

     reset

             Returns a RabbitMQ node to its virgin state.

             Removes the node from any cluster it belongs to, removes all data from the management database, such as configured users and vhosts, and deletes all persistent messages.

             For reset and force_reset to succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been stopped, e.g. with stop_app.

             For example, to reset the RabbitMQ node:

                   rabbitmqctl reset

     rotate_logs

             Instructs the RabbitMQ node to perform internal log rotation.

             Log rotation is performed according to the logging settings specified in the configuration file.  The rotation operation is asynchronous, there is no guarantee that it has completed when this
             command returns.

             Note that there is no need to call this command in case of external log rotation (e.g. from logrotate(8)).

             For example, to initial log rotation:

                   rabbitmqctl rotate_logs

     shutdown

             Shuts down the node, both RabbitMQ and its runtime.  The command is blocking and will return after the runtime process exits.  If RabbitMQ fails to stop, it will return a non-zero exit code.
             This command infers the OS PID of the target node and therefore can only be used to shut down nodes running on the same host (or broadly speaking, in the same operating system, e.g. in the same
             VM or container)

             Unlike the stop command, the shutdown command:

             •   does not require a pid_file to wait for the runtime process to exit

             •   returns a non-zero exit code if RabbitMQ node is not running

             For example, this will shut down a locally running RabbitMQ node with default node name:

                   rabbitmqctl shutdown

     start_app

             Starts the RabbitMQ application.

             This command is typically run after performing other management actions that required the RabbitMQ application to be stopped, e.g. reset.

             For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to start the RabbitMQ application:

                   rabbitmqctl start_app

     stop [pid_file]

             Stops the Erlang node on which RabbitMQ is running.  To restart the node follow the instructions for "Running the Server" in the installation guide: https://rabbitmq.com/download.html

             If a pid_file is specified, also waits for the process specified there to terminate.  See the description of the wait command for details on this file.

             For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to terminate:

                   rabbitmqctl stop

     stop_app

             Stops the RabbitMQ application, leaving the runtime (Erlang VM) running.

             This command is typically run prior to performing other management actions that require the RabbitMQ application to be stopped, e.g. reset.

             For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to stop the RabbitMQ application:

                   rabbitmqctl stop_app

     wait pid_file, wait --pid pid

             Waits for the RabbitMQ application to start.

             This command will wait for the RabbitMQ application to start at the node.  It will wait for the pid file to be created if pidfile is specified, then for a process with a pid specified in the pid
             file or the --pid argument, and then for the RabbitMQ application to start in that process.  It will fail if the process terminates without starting the RabbitMQ application.

             If the specified pidfile is not created or erlang node is not started within --timeout the command will fail.  Default timeout is 10 seconds.

             A suitable pid file is created by the rabbitmq-server(8) script.  By default this is located in the Mnesia directory.  Modify the RABBITMQ_PID_FILE environment variable to change the location.

             For example, this command will return when the RabbitMQ node has started up:

                   rabbitmqctl wait /var/run/rabbitmq/pid

   Cluster management
     await_online_nodes count

             Waits for count nodes to join the cluster

             For example, to wait for two RabbitMQ nodes to start:

                   rabbitmqctl await_online_nodes 2

     change_cluster_node_type type

             Changes the type of the cluster node.

             The type must be one of the following:
             •   disc
             •   ram

             The node must be stopped for this operation to succeed, and when turning a node into a RAM node the node must not be the only disc node in the cluster.

             For example, this command will turn a RAM node into a disc node:

                   rabbitmqctl change_cluster_node_type disc

     cluster_status

             Displays all the nodes in the cluster grouped by node type, together with the currently running nodes.

             For example, this command displays the nodes in the cluster:

                   rabbitmqctl cluster_status

     force_boot

             Ensures that the node will start next time, even if it was not the last to shut down.

             Normally when you shut down a RabbitMQ cluster altogether, the first node you restart should be the last one to go down, since it may have seen things happen that other nodes did not.  But some‐
             times that's not possible: for instance if the entire cluster loses power then all nodes may think they were not the last to shut down.

             In such a case you can invoke force_boot while the node is down.  This will tell the node to unconditionally start next time you ask it to.  If any changes happened to the cluster after this
             node shut down, they will be lost.

             If the last node to go down is permanently lost then you should use forget_cluster_node --offline in preference to this command, as it will ensure that mirrored queues which had their leader
             replica on the lost node get promoted.

             For example, this will force the node not to wait for other nodes next time it is started:

                   rabbitmqctl force_boot

     force_reset

             Forcefully returns a RabbitMQ node to its virgin state.

             The force_reset command differs from reset in that it resets the node unconditionally, regardless of the current management database state and cluster configuration.  It should only be used as a
             last resort if the database or cluster configuration has been corrupted.

             For reset and force_reset to succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been stopped, e.g. with stop_app.

             For example, to reset the RabbitMQ node:

                   rabbitmqctl force_reset

     forget_cluster_node [--offline]

             --offline
                     Enables node removal from an offline node.  This is only useful in the situation where all the nodes are offline and the last node to go down cannot be brought online, thus preventing
                     the whole cluster from starting.  It should not be used in any other circumstances since it can lead to inconsistencies.

             Removes a cluster node remotely.  The node that is being removed must be offline, while the node we are removing from must be online, except when using the --offline flag.

             When using the --offline flag , rabbitmqctl will not attempt to connect to a node as normal; instead it will temporarily become the node in order to make the change.  This is useful if the node
             cannot be started normally.  In this case the node will become the canonical source for cluster metadata (e.g. which queues exist), even if it was not before.  Therefore you should use this com‐
             mand on the latest node to shut down if at all possible.

             For example, this command will remove the node "rabbit@stringer" from the node "hare@mcnulty":

                   rabbitmqctl -n hare@mcnulty forget_cluster_node rabbit@stringer

     join_cluster seed-node [--ram]

             seed-node
                     Existing cluster member (seed node) to cluster with.

             --ram   If provided, the node will join the cluster as a RAM node.  RAM node use is discouraged. Use only if you understand why exactly you need to use them.

             Instructs the node to become a member of the cluster that the specified node is in.  Before clustering, the node is reset, so be careful when using this command.  For this command to succeed the
             RabbitMQ application must have been stopped, e.g. with stop_app.

             Cluster nodes can be of two types: disc or RAM.  Disc nodes replicate data in RAM and on disc, thus providing redundancy in the event of node failure and recovery from global events such as
             power failure across all nodes.  RAM nodes replicate data in RAM only (with the exception of queue contents, which can reside on disc if the queue is persistent or too big to fit in memory) and
             are mainly used for scalability.  RAM nodes are more performant only when managing resources (e.g. adding/removing queues, exchanges, or bindings).  A cluster must always have at least one disc
             node, and usually should have more than one.

             The node will be a disc node by default.  If you wish to create a RAM node, provide the --ram flag.

             After executing the join_cluster command, whenever the RabbitMQ application is started on the current node it will attempt to connect to the nodes that were in the cluster when the node went
             down.

             To leave a cluster, reset the node.  You can also remove nodes remotely with the forget_cluster_node command.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ node to join the cluster that "hare@elena" is part of, as a ram node:

                   rabbitmqctl join_cluster hare@elena --ram

     rename_cluster_node oldnode1 newnode1 [oldnode2 newnode2 ...]

             Supports renaming of cluster nodes in the local database.

             This subcommand causes rabbitmqctl to temporarily become the node in order to make the change.  The local cluster node must therefore be completely stopped; other nodes can be online or offline.

             This subcommand takes an even number of arguments, in pairs representing the old and new names for nodes.  You must specify the old and new names for this node and for any other nodes that are
             stopped and being renamed at the same time.

             It is possible to stop all nodes and rename them all simultaneously (in which case old and new names for all nodes must be given to every node) or stop and rename nodes one at a time (in which
             case each node only needs to be told how its own name is changing).

             For example, this command will rename the node "rabbit@misshelpful" to the node "rabbit@cordelia"

                   rabbitmqctl rename_cluster_node rabbit@misshelpful rabbit@cordelia

             Note that this command only changes the local database.  It may also be necessary to rename the local database directories, and to configure the new node name.  For example:

             1.   Stop the node:

                        rabbitmqctl stop rabbit@misshelpful

             2.   Rename the node in the local database:

                        rabbitmqctl rename_cluster_node rabbit@misshelpful rabbit@cordelia

             3.   Rename the local database directories (note, you do not need to do this if you have set the RABBITMQ_MNESIA_DIR environment variable):

                        mv \
                          /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\@misshelpful \
                          /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\@cordelia
                        mv \
                          /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\@misshelpful-rename \
                          /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\@cordelia-rename
                        mv \
                          /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\@misshelpful-plugins-expand \
                          /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\@cordelia-plugins-expand

             4.   If node name is configured e.g. using /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf it has also be updated there.

             5.   Start the node when ready

     update_cluster_nodes clusternode

             clusternode
                     The node to consult for up-to-date information.

             Instructs an already clustered node to contact clusternode to cluster when booting up.  This is different from join_cluster since it does not join any cluster - it checks that the node is al‐
             ready in a cluster with clusternode.

             The need for this command is motivated by the fact that clusters can change while a node is offline.  Consider a situation where node rabbit@A and rabbit@B are clustered.  rabbit@A goes down,
             rabbit@C clusters with rabbit@B, and then rabbit@B leaves the cluster.  When rabbit@A starts back up, it'll try to contact rabbit@B, but this will fail since rabbit@B is not in the cluster any‐
             more.  The following command will rename node rabbit@B to rabbit@C on node rabbitA

                   update_cluster_nodes -n rabbit@A rabbit@B rabbit@C

             To learn more, see the RabbitMQ Clustering guide: https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html

   Replication
     sync_queue [-p vhost] queue

             queue   The name of the queue to synchronise.

             Instructs a mirrored queue with unsynchronised mirrors (follower replicas) to synchronise them.  The queue will block while synchronisation takes place (all publishers to and consumers using the
             queue will block or temporarily see no activity).  This command can only be used with mirrored queues.  To learn more, see the RabbitMQ Mirroring guide: https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html

             Note that queues with unsynchronised replicas and active consumers will become synchronised eventually (assuming that consumers make progress).  This command is primarily useful for queues which
             do not have active consumers.

     cancel_sync_queue [-p vhost] queue

             queue   The name of the queue to cancel synchronisation for.

             Instructs a synchronising mirrored queue to stop synchronising itself.

   User Management
     Note that all user management commands rabbitmqctl only can manage users in the internal RabbitMQ database.  Users from any alternative authentication backends such as LDAP cannot be inspected or man‐
     aged with those commands.  rabbitmqctl.

     add_user username password

             username
                     The name of the user to create.

             password
                     The password the created user will use to log in to the broker.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to create a (non-administrative) user named "janeway" with (initial) password "changeit":

                   rabbitmqctl add_user janeway changeit

     authenticate_user username password

             username
                     The name of the user.

             password
                     The password of the user.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to authenticate the user named "janeway" with password "verifyit":

                   rabbitmqctl authenticate_user janeway verifyit

     change_password username newpassword

             username
                     The name of the user whose password is to be changed.

             newpassword
                     The new password for the user.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to change the password for the user named "janeway" to "newpass":

                   rabbitmqctl change_password janeway newpass

     clear_password username

             username
                     The name of the user whose password is to be cleared.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to clear the password for the user named "janeway":

                   rabbitmqctl clear_password janeway

             This user now cannot log in with a password (but may be able to through e.g. SASL EXTERNAL if configured).

     delete_user username

             username
                     The name of the user to delete.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to delete the user named "janeway":

                   rabbitmqctl delete_user janeway

     list_users

             Lists users.  Each result row will contain the user name followed by a list of the tags set for that user.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all users:

                   rabbitmqctl list_users

     set_user_tags username [tag ...]

             username
                     The name of the user whose tags are to be set.

             tag     Zero, one or more tags to set.  Any existing tags will be removed.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to ensure the user named "janeway" is an administrator:

                   rabbitmqctl set_user_tags janeway administrator

             This has no effect when the user authenticates using a messaging protocol, but can be used to permit the user to manage users, virtual hosts and permissions when the user logs in via some other
             means (for example with the management plugin).

             This command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to remove any tags from the user named "janeway":

                   rabbitmqctl set_user_tags janeway

   Access control
     clear_permissions [-p vhost] username

             vhost   The name of the virtual host to which to deny the user access, defaulting to "/".

             username
                     The name of the user to deny access to the specified virtual host.

             Sets user permissions.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to deny the user named "janeway" access to the virtual host called "my-vhost":

                   rabbitmqctl clear_permissions -p my-vhost janeway

     clear_topic_permissions [-p vhost] username [exchange]

             vhost   The name of the virtual host to which to clear the topic permissions, defaulting to "/".

             username
                     The name of the user to clear topic permissions to the specified virtual host.

             exchange
                     The name of the topic exchange to clear topic permissions, defaulting to all the topic exchanges the given user has topic permissions for.

             Clear user topic permissions.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to remove topic permissions for user named "janeway" for the topic exchange "amq.topic" in the virtual host called "my-vhost":

                   rabbitmqctl clear_topic_permissions -p my-vhost janeway amq.topic

     list_permissions [-p vhost]

             vhost   The name of the virtual host for which to list the users that have been granted access to it, and their permissions.  Defaults to "/".

             Lists permissions in a virtual host.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all the users which have been granted access to the virtual host called "my-vhost", and the permissions they have for operations
             on resources in that virtual host.  Note that an empty string means no permissions granted:

                   rabbitmqctl list_permissions -p my-vhost

     list_topic_permissions [-p vhost]

             vhost   The name of the virtual host for which to list the users topic permissions.  Defaults to "/".

             Lists topic permissions in a virtual host.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all the users which have been granted topic permissions in the virtual host called "my-vhost:"

                   rabbitmqctl list_topic_permissions -p my-vhost

     list_user_permissions username

             username
                     The name of the user for which to list the permissions.

             Lists user permissions.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all the virtual hosts to which the user named "janeway" has been granted access, and the permissions the user has for operations
             on resources in these virtual hosts:

                   rabbitmqctl list_user_permissions janeway

     list_user_topic_permissions username

             username
                     The name of the user for which to list the topic permissions.

             Lists user topic permissions.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all the virtual hosts to which the user named "janeway" has been granted access, and the topic permissions the user has in these
             virtual hosts:

                   rabbitmqctl list_user_topic_permissions janeway

     list_vhosts [vhostinfoitem ...]

             Lists virtual hosts.

             The vhostinfoitem parameter is used to indicate which virtual host information items to include in the results.  The column order in the results will match the order of the parameters.
             vhostinfoitem can take any value from the list that follows:

             name    The name of the virtual host with non-ASCII characters escaped as in C.

             tracing
                     Whether tracing is enabled for this virtual host.

             If no vhostinfoitem are specified then the vhost name is displayed.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all virtual hosts:

                   rabbitmqctl list_vhosts name tracing

     set_permissions [-p vhost] user conf write read

             vhost   The name of the virtual host to which to grant the user access, defaulting to "/".

             user    The name of the user to grant access to the specified virtual host.

             conf    A regular expression matching resource names for which the user is granted configure permissions.

             write   A regular expression matching resource names for which the user is granted write permissions.

             read    A regular expression matching resource names for which the user is granted read permissions.

             Sets user permissions.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to grant the user named "janeway" access to the virtual host called "my-vhost", with configure permissions on all resources whose names
             starts with "janeway-", and write and read permissions on all resources:

                   rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p my-vhost janeway "^janeway-.*" ".*" ".*"

     set_topic_permissions [-p vhost] user exchange write read

             vhost   The name of the virtual host to which to grant the user access, defaulting to "/".

             user    The name of the user the permissions apply to in the target virtual host.

             exchange
                     The name of the topic exchange the authorisation check will be applied to.

             write   A regular expression matching the routing key of the published message.

             read    A regular expression matching the routing key of the consumed message.

             Sets user topic permissions.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to let the user named "janeway" publish and consume messages going through the "amp.topic" exchange of the "my-vhost" virtual host with a
             routing key starting with "janeway-":

                   rabbitmqctl set_topic_permissions -p my-vhost janeway amq.topic "^janeway-.*" "^janeway-.*"

             Topic permissions support variable expansion for the following variables: username, vhost, and client_id. Note that client_id is expanded only when using MQTT.  The previous example could be
             made more generic by using "^{username}-.*":

                   rabbitmqctl set_topic_permissions -p my-vhost janeway amq.topic "^{username}-.*" "^{username}-.*"

   Monitoring, observability and health checks
     environment

             Displays the name and value of each variable in the application environment for each running application.

     list_bindings [-p vhost] [bindinginfoitem ...]

             destination_kind
                     The kind of the destination of messages to which the binding is attached.  With non-ASCII characters escaped as in C.

             routing_key
                     The binding's routing key, with non-ASCII characters escaped as in C.

             arguments
                     The binding's arguments.

             If no bindinginfoitem are specified then all above items are displayed.

             For example, this command displays the exchange name and queue name of the bindings in the virtual host named "my-vhost"

                     Queues which are located on cluster nodes that are currently down will be shown with a status of "down" (and most other queueinfoitem will be unavailable).

             If no queueinfoitem are specified then queue name and depth are displayed.

             For example, this command displays the depth and number of consumers for each queue of the virtual host named "my-vhost"

                   rabbitmqctl list_queues -p my-vhost messages consumers

     list_unresponsive_queues [--local] [--queue-timeout milliseconds] [column ...] [--no-table-headers]

             Tests queues to respond within timeout. Lists those which did not respond

             For example, this command lists only those unresponsive queues whose leader replica is hosted on the target node.
                   rabbitmqctl list_unresponsive_queues --local name

     ping

             Checks that the node OS process is up, registered with EPMD and CLI tools can authenticate with it

             Example:
                   rabbitmqctl ping -n rabbit@hostname

     report

             Generate a server status report containing a concatenation of all server status information for support purposes.  The output should be redirected to a file when accompanying a support request.

             For example, this command creates a server report which may be attached to a support request email:

                   rabbitmqctl report > server_report.txt

     schema_info [--no-table-headers] [column ...]

             Lists schema database tables and their properties

             For example, this command lists the table names and their active replicas:

                   rabbitmqctl schema_info name active_replicas

     status

             Displays broker status information such as the running applications on the current Erlang node, RabbitMQ and Erlang versions, OS name, memory and file descriptor statistics.  (See the
             cluster_status command to find out which nodes are clustered and running.)

             For example, this command displays information about the RabbitMQ broker:

                   rabbitmqctl status

   Runtime Parameters and Policies
     Certain features of RabbitMQ (such as the Federation plugin) are controlled by dynamic, cluster-wide parameters. There are 2 kinds of parameters: parameters scoped to a virtual host and global parame‐
     ters.  Each vhost-scoped parameter consists of a component name, a name and a value.  The component name and name are strings, and the value is a valid JSON document.  A global parameter consists of a
     name and value.  The name is a string and the value is an arbitrary Erlang data structure.  Parameters can be set, cleared and listed.  In general you should refer to the documentation for the feature
     in question to see how to set parameters.

     Policies is a feature built on top of runtime parameters.  Policies are used to control and modify the behaviour of queues and exchanges on a cluster-wide basis.  Policies apply within a given vhost,
     and consist of a name, pattern, definition and an optional priority.  Policies can be set, cleared and listed.

     clear_global_parameter name

             Clears a global runtime parameter.  This is similar to clear_parameter but the key-value pair isn't tied to a virtual host.

             name    The name of the global runtime parameter being cleared.

             For example, this command clears the global runtime parameter "mqtt_default_vhosts":

                   rabbitmqctl clear_global_parameter mqtt_default_vhosts

     clear_parameter [-p vhost] component_name key

             Clears a parameter.

             component_name
                     The name of the component for which the parameter is being cleared.

             name    The name of the parameter being cleared.

             For example, this command clears the parameter "node01" for the "federation-upstream" component in the default virtual host:

                   rabbitmqctl clear_parameter federation-upstream node01

     list_global_parameters

             Lists all global runtime parameters.  This is similar to list_parameters but the global runtime parameters are not tied to any virtual host.

             For example, this command lists all global parameters:

                   rabbitmqctl list_global_parameters

     list_parameters [-p vhost]

             Lists all parameters for a virtual host.

             For example, this command lists all parameters in the default virtual host:

                   rabbitmqctl list_parameters

     set_global_parameter name value

             Sets a global runtime parameter.  This is similar to set_parameter but the key-value pair isn't tied to a virtual host.

             name    The name of the global runtime parameter being set.

             value   The value for the global runtime parameter, as a JSON term.  In most shells you are very likely to need to quote this.

             For example, this command sets the global runtime parameter "mqtt_default_vhosts" to the JSON term {"O=client,CN=guest":"/"}:

                   rabbitmqctl set_global_parameter mqtt_default_vhosts '{"O=client,CN=guest":"/"}'

     set_parameter [-p vhost] component_name name value

             Sets a parameter.

             component_name
                     The name of the component for which the parameter is being set.

             name    The name of the parameter being set.

             value   The value for the parameter, as a JSON term.  In most shells you are very likely to need to quote this.

             For example, this command sets the parameter "node01" for the "federation-upstream" component in the default virtual host to the following JSON "guest":

                   rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation-upstream node01 '{"uri":"amqp://user:password@server/%2F","ack-mode":"on-publish"}'

     list_policies [-p vhost]

             Lists all policies for a virtual host.

             For example, this command lists all policies in the default virtual host:

                   rabbitmqctl list_policies

     set_operator_policy [-p vhost] [--priority priority] [--apply-to apply-to] name pattern definition

             Sets an operator policy that overrides a subset of arguments in user policies.  Arguments are identical to those of set_policy.

             Supported arguments are:
             •   expires
             •   message-ttl
             •   max-length
             •   max-length-bytes

     set_policy [-p vhost] [--priority priority] [--apply-to apply-to] name pattern definition

             Sets a policy.

             name    The name of the policy.

             pattern
                     The regular expression, which when matches on a given resources causes the policy to apply.

             definition
                     The definition of the policy, as a JSON term.  In most shells you are very likely to need to quote this.

             priority
                     The priority of the policy as an integer.  Higher numbers indicate greater precedence.  The default is 0.

             apply-to
                     Which types of object this policy should apply to.  Possible values are:
                     •   queues
                     •   exchanges
                     •   all
                     The default is all ..

             For example, this command sets the policy "federate-me" in the default virtual host so that built-in exchanges are federated:

                   rabbitmqctl set_policy federate-me ^amq. '{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}'

     clear_policy [-p vhost] name

             Clears a policy.

             name    The name of the policy being cleared.

             For example, this command clears the "federate-me" policy in the default virtual host:

                   rabbitmqctl clear_policy federate-me

     clear_operator_policy [-p vhost] name

             Clears an operator policy.  Arguments are identical to those of clear_policy.

     list_operator_policies [-p vhost]

             Lists operator policy overrides for a virtual host.  Arguments are identical to those of list_policies.

   Virtual hosts
     Note that rabbitmqctl manages the RabbitMQ internal user database.  Permissions for users from any alternative authorisation backend will not be visible to rabbitmqctl.

     add_vhost vhost

             vhost   The name of the virtual host entry to create.

             Creates a virtual host.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to create a new virtual host called "test":

                   rabbitmqctl add_vhost test

     clear_vhost_limits [-p vhost]

             Clears virtual host limits.

             For example, this command clears vhost limits in vhost "qa_env":

                   rabbitmqctl clear_vhost_limits -p qa_env

     delete_vhost vhost

             vhost   The name of the virtual host entry to delete.

             Deletes a virtual host.

             Deleting a virtual host deletes all its exchanges, queues, bindings, user permissions, parameters and policies.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to delete the virtual host called "test":

                   rabbitmqctl delete_vhost a-vhost

     list_vhost_limits [-p vhost] [--global] [--no-table-headers]

             Displays configured virtual host limits.

             --global
                     Show limits for all vhosts.  Suppresses the -p parameter.

     restart_vhost vhost

             vhost   The name of the virtual host entry to restart.

             Restarts a failed vhost data stores and queues.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to restart a virtual host called "test":

                   rabbitmqctl restart_vhost test

     set_vhost_limits [-p vhost] definition

             Sets virtual host limits.

             definition
                     The definition of the limits, as a JSON term.  In most shells you are very likely to need to quote this.

                     Recognised limits are:
                     •   max-connections
                     •   max-queues

                     Use a negative value to specify "no limit".

             For example, this command limits the max number of concurrent connections in vhost "qa_env" to 64:

                   rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p qa_env '{"max-connections": 64}'

             This command limits the max number of queues in vhost "qa_env" to 256:

                   rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p qa_env '{"max-queues": 256}'

             This command clears the max number of connections limit in vhost "qa_env":

                   rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p qa_env '{"max-connections": -1}'

             This command disables client connections in vhost "qa_env":

                   rabbitmqctl set_vhost_limits -p qa_env '{"max-connections": 0}'

     trace_off [-p vhost]

             vhost   The name of the virtual host for which to stop tracing.

             Stops tracing.

     trace_on [-p vhost]

             vhost   The name of the virtual host for which to start tracing.

             Starts tracing.  Note that the trace state is not persistent; it will revert to being off if the node is restarted.

   Configuration
     decode value passphrase [--cipher cipher] [--hash hash] [--iterations iterations]

             value passphrase
                     Value to decrypt (as produced by the encode command) and passphrase.

                     For example:

                           rabbitmqctl decode '{encrypted, <<"...">>}' mypassphrase

             --cipher cipher --hash hash --iterations iterations
                     Options to specify the decryption settings.  They can be used independently.

                     For example:

                           rabbitmqctl decode --cipher blowfish_cfb64 --hash sha256 --iterations 10000 '{encrypted,<<"...">>} mypassphrase

     encode value passphrase [--cipher cipher] [--hash hash] [--iterations iterations]

             value passphrase
                     Value to encrypt and passphrase.

                     For example:

                           rabbitmqctl encode '<<"guest">>' mypassphrase

             --cipher cipher --hash hash --iterations iterations
                     Options to specify the encryption settings.  They can be used independently.

                     For example:

                           rabbitmqctl encode --cipher blowfish_cfb64 --hash sha256 --iterations 10000 '<<"guest">>' mypassphrase

     set_cluster_name name

             Sets the cluster name to name.  The cluster name is announced to clients on connection, and used by the federation and shovel plugins to record where a message has been.  The cluster name is by
             default derived from the hostname of the first node in the cluster, but can be changed.

             For example, this sets the cluster name to "london":

                   rabbitmqctl set_cluster_name london

     set_disk_free_limit disk_limit

             disk_limit
                     Lower bound limit as an integer in bytes or a string with memory unit symbols (see vm_memory_high_watermark), e.g. 512M or 1G.  Once free disk space reaches the limit, a disk alarm will
                     be set.

     set_disk_free_limit mem_relative fraction

             fraction
                     Limit relative to the total amount available RAM as a non-negative floating point number.  Values lower than 1.0 can be dangerous and should be used carefully.

     set_log_level [log_level]

             Sets log level in the running node

             Supported type values are:
             •   debug
             •   info
             •   warning
             •   error
             •   none

             Example:
                   rabbitmqctl set_log_level debug

     set_vm_memory_high_watermark fraction

             fraction
                     The new memory threshold fraction at which flow control is triggered, as a floating point number greater than or equal to 0.

     set_vm_memory_high_watermark [absolute] memory_limit

             memory_limit
                     The new memory limit at which flow control is triggered, expressed in bytes as an integer number greater than or equal to 0 or as a string with memory unit symbol(e.g. 512M or 1G).
                     Available unit symbols are:

                     k, kiB  kibibytes (2^10 bytes)

                     M, MiB  mebibytes (2^20 bytes)

                     G, GiB  gibibytes (2^30 bytes)

                     kB      kilobytes (10^3 bytes)

                     MB      megabytes (10^6 bytes)

                     GB      gigabytes (10^9 bytes)

   Feature flags
     enable_feature_flag feature_flag

             Enables a feature flag on the target node.

             Example:
                   rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag quorum_queue

             You can also enable all feature flags by specifying "all":
                   rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag all

     list_feature_flags [column ...]

             Lists feature flags

             Supported column values are:
             •   name
             •   state
             •   stability
             •   provided_by
             •   desc
             •   doc_url

             Example:
                   rabbitmqctl list_feature_flags name state

   Connection Operations
     close_all_connections [-p vhost] [--global] [--per-connection-delay delay] [--limit limit] explanation

             -p vhost
                     The name of the virtual host for which connections should be closed.  Ignored when --global is specified.

             --global
                     If connections should be close for all vhosts.  Overrides -p

             --per-connection-delay delay
                     Time in milliseconds to wait after each connection closing.

             --limit limit
                     Number of connection to close.  Only works per vhost.  Ignored when --global is specified.

             explanation
                     Explanation string.

             Instructs the broker to close all connections for the specified vhost or entire RabbitMQ node.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to close 10 connections on "qa_env" vhost, passing the explanation "Please close":

                   rabbitmqctl close_all_connections -p qa_env --limit 10 'Please close'

             This command instructs broker to close all connections to the node:

                   rabbitmqctl close_all_connections --global

     close_connection connectionpid explanation

             connectionpid
                     Id of the Erlang process associated with the connection to close.

             explanation
                     Explanation string.

             Instructs the broker to close the connection associated with the Erlang process id connectionpid (see also the list_connections command), passing the explanation string to the connected client
             as part of the AMQP connection shutdown protocol.

             For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to close the connection associated with the Erlang process id "<rabbit@tanto.4262.0>", passing the explanation "go away" to the connected
             client:

                   rabbitmqctl close_connection "<rabbit@tanto.4262.0>" "go away"

   Misc
     eval expression

             Evaluates an Erlang expression on the target node

           Queue Operations

                     queue_name
                             The name of the queue to delete.

                     --if-empty
                             Delete the queue if it is empty (has no messages ready for delivery)

                     --if-unused
                             Delete the queue only if it has no consumers

                     Deletes a queue.

             purge_queue [-p vhost] queue

                     queue   The name of the queue to purge.

                     Purges a queue (removes all messages in it).

PLUGIN COMMANDS
     RabbitMQ plugins can extend rabbitmqctl tool to add new commands when enabled.  Currently available commands can be found in rabbitmqctl help output.  Following commands are added by RabbitMQ plugins,
     available in default distribution:

   Shovel plugin
     shovel_status
             Prints a list of configured Shovels

     delete_shovel [-p vhost] name
             Instructs the RabbitMQ node to delete the configured shovel by name.

   Federation plugin
     federation_status [--only-down]
             Prints a list of federation links.

             --only-down
                     Only list federation links which are not running.

     restart_federation_link link_id
             Instructs the RabbitMQ node to restart the federation link with specified link_id.

   AMQP 1.0 plugin
     list_amqp10_connections [amqp10_connectioninfoitem ...]
             Similar to the list_connections command, but returns fields which make sense for AMQP-1.0 connections.  amqp10_connectioninfoitem parameter is used to indicate which connection information items
             to include in the results.  The column order in the results will match the order of the parameters.  amqp10_connectioninfoitem can take any value from the list that follows:

             pid     Id of the Erlang process associated with the connection.

             auth_mechanism
                     SASL authentication mechanism used, such as "PLAIN".

             host    Server hostname obtained via reverse DNS, or its IP address if reverse DNS failed or was disabled.

             frame_max
                     Maximum frame size (bytes).

             timeout
                     Connection timeout / negotiated heartbeat interval, in seconds.

             user    Username associated with the connection.
