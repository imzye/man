NAME
       plzip - reduces the size of files

SYNOPSIS
       plzip [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       Plzip is a massively parallel (multi-threaded) implementation of lzip. Plzip uses the compression library lzlib.

       Lzip  is  a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip uses a simplified form of LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm) designed to achieve complete
       interoperability between implementations. The maximum dictionary size is 512 MiB so that any lzip file can be decompressed on 32-bit machines. Lzip provides accurate and robust 3-factor  integrity
       checking.  'lzip  -0' compresses about as fast as gzip, while 'lzip -9' compresses most files more than bzip2. Decompression speed is intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip provides better data
       recovery capabilities than gzip and bzip2. Lzip has been designed, written, and tested with great care to replace gzip and bzip2 as general-purpose compressed format for Unix-like systems.

       Plzip can compress/decompress large files on multiprocessor machines much faster than lzip, at the cost of a slightly reduced compression ratio (0.4 to 2 percent  larger  compressed  files).  Note
       that  the  number  of  usable threads is limited by file size; on files larger than a few GB plzip can use hundreds of processors, but on files smaller than 1 MiB plzip is no faster than lzip (not
       even at compression level -0).  The number of threads defaults to the number of processors.

       -n, --threads=<n>
              set number of (de)compression threads [2]

       -o, --output=<file>
              write to <file>, keep input files

       -q, --quiet
              suppress all messages

       -s, --dictionary-size=<bytes>
              set dictionary size limit in bytes [8 MiB]

       -t, --test
              test compressed file integrity

       -v, --verbose
              be verbose (a 2nd -v gives more)

       -0 .. -9
              set compression level [default 6]

       --fast alias for -0

       --best alias for -9

       --loose-trailing
              allow trailing data seeming corrupt header

       --in-slots=<n>
              number of 1 MiB input packets buffered [4]

       --out-slots=<n>
              number of 1 MiB output packets buffered [64]

       --check-lib
              compare version of lzlib.h with liblz.{a,so}

       If no file names are given, or if a file is '-', plzip compresses or decompresses from standard input to standard output.  Numbers may be followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000, Ki = KiB =
       2^10 = 1024, M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...  Dictionary sizes 12 to 29 are interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12 to 2^29 bytes.

       The bidimensional parameter space of LZMA can't be mapped to a linear scale optimal for all files. If your files are large, very repetitive, etc, you may need to use the options  --dictionary-size
       and --match-length directly to achieve optimal performance.

       To extract all the files from archive 'foo.tar.lz', use the commands 'tar -xf foo.tar.lz' or 'plzip -cd foo.tar.lz | tar -xf -'.

       Exit  status:  0  for  a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file not found, invalid command-line options, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or invalid input file, 3 for an internal
       consistency error (e.g., bug) which caused plzip to panic.
