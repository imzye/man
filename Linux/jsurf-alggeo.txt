NAME
       jsurf-alggeo - Java based renderer for real SURFaces (ALGebraic GEOmetry dedicated tool)

DESCRIPTION
       usage: jsurf-alggeo [options...] {jsurf_input|-} [png_output|-]

       jsurf-alggeo  is  a renderer for real algebraic surfaces.  jsurf-alggeo translates its own language script files (generally with extension '.jsurf') into Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files; PNG
       is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.  If the output filename is not specified, the output is placed in a file of the same basename with a '.png'  extension  in
       the  current  working  directory.  Either the input filename or the output filename can be '-' to request reading from stdin or writing to stdout, respectively. Whenever the Graphic Unit Interface
       (GUI) is available, the gui option takes precedence over the output options, otherwise it is ignored. That is, whenever the gui option is present (and available), the output is displayed in a win‐
       dow rather than written to a PNG file.

       --gui  display rendering (overrides output options)

       --help display this help text and exit

       -o,--output <arg>
              output PNG into this file (overrode by the 2nd argument if present)

       -q,--quality <arg>
              quality of the rendering: 0 (low), 1 (medium, default), 2 (high), 3 (extreme)

       -s,--size <arg>
              image width and height (default: 512)

       --version
              print program version and exit
