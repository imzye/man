NAME
       ocamlify - create an OCaml file including other files.

SYNOPSIS
       ocamlify [options] option-file

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  allows  to copy files inside OCaml code.  It uses a first file that describes the other files that must be included and the type of OCaml variable it should create.  It can also de‐
       scribe dependencies to other files, in order to generate .depends files for make.

       For example, we can create a file test.mlify with this content:

             VarString oasissys_ml "OASISSys.ml"
             VarStringList readme_template_mkd "MANUAL-template.mkd"

       We then translate it using the program:

             $> ocamlify --output test.ml test.mlify

       And we get a file test.ml containing two OCaml variables: oasissys_ml, which is a string, and readme_template_mkd which is a string list (one string per line).

OPTIONS
       --var-string-list varname file
              Include file as a list of string, each string representing a line (without trailing EOL character)

       --var-string varname file
              Include file as a string.

       --output file
              Output file, default to standard output
