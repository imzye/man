AMLABEL(8)              System Administration Commands              AMLABEL(8)

NAME
       amlabel - label an Amanda tape

SYNOPSIS
       amlabel [--barcode barcode] [--meta meta-label] [--pool pool]
               [--storage storage] [--assign] [-f] [--version]
               [-o configoption...] config [label] [slot slot]

DESCRIPTION
       This command applies a label to an Amanda volume, erasing the volume in
       the process.

       Amanda uses labels to identify volumes: amdump(8) and amflush(8) verify
       the label before writing to make sure the proper volume is loaded, and
       the recovery programs use the label to ensure they are reading the data
       they expect.

       If no [slot] and no [barcode] is given, then amlabel labels the tape in
       the current slot of the default changer. If a slot is given, it labels
       the volume in that slot. If a barcode is given, it labels the volume
       with that barcode.  Label may be any string that does not contain
       whitespace and that matches the labelstr (see amanda.conf(5)).

       If [label] is not given, an autolabel is generated, see autolabel in
       amanda.conf(5).

       If [--assign] is given, the label is interpretad as an expression and
       the barcode, meta-label, pool, storage and config are assigned to all
       labels matching the expression, the volumes are not labelled. The
       labels must already be in the tapelist file.

       This command also appends the new volume to the tapelist(5) file, so
       that they will be used in the order they are labeled (depending on the
       taperscan in use — see amanda-taperscan(7)).

       As a precaution, amlabel will not write a label if the volume already
       contains an active label or if the label specified is on an active
       tape. The [-f] (force) flag bypasses these verifications.

OPTIONS
       --barcode barcode
           With [--assign], assign the barcode to the label. Without
           [--assign], label the volume with that barcode.

       --meta meta-label
           Assign the meta label to the label after labeling the volume.

       --pool pool
           Assign the pool to the label after labeling the volume.

       --storage storage
           Assign the storage to the label, it can only be used with --assign,
           you can't assign a storage to a new labelled volume.

       --assign
           Assign the barcode or meta-label to the label without labeling the
           volume. The label must already be in the tapelist file.

       -f
           Force the label operation; see above

       --version
           Output version information

       -o configoption
           See the "CONFIGURATION OVERRIDE" section in amanda(8).

EXAMPLE
       Write an Amanda label with the string "DMP000" on the current volume:
       % amlabel daily DMP000

       Label the tape in slot 3 of the changer with the label "DMP003":
       % amlabel daily DMP003 slot 3

MESSAGES
       Label 'label' doesn't match labelstr 'labelstr'
           The given label does not match the configured labelstr. Even with
           -f, this is an error.

       Label 'label' already on a volume
           The given label is already on another volume in the tapelist, and
           Amanda will not write it to this volume unless forced.

       Found label 'label', but it is not from configuration config.
           The label amlabel found on the volume does not match this
           configuration's labelstr, so it is probably part of a different
           Amanda configuration. Amanda will not overwrite the label unless it
           is forced.

       Volume with label 'label' contains data from this configuration.
           The label amlabel found on the volume still has valid data on it
           and Amanda will not overwrite it unless forced. Note that this does
           not distinguish between active and inactive volumes.
