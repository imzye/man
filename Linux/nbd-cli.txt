       gluster create <VOLUME/FILEPATH> [prealloc] <size SIZE> [host RUNNER_HOST]
              Create FILEPATH in the VOLUME, prealloc is false as default, and the SIZE is valid with B, K(iB), M(iB), G(iB), T(iB), P(iB), E(iB), Z(iB), Y(iB), RUNNER_HOST will be 'localhost' as default

       gluster delete <VOLUME/FILEPATH> [host RUNNER_HOST]
              Delete FILEPATH from the VOLUME, RUNNER_HOST will be 'localhost' as default

       gluster map <VOLUME/FILEPATH> [nbd-device] [timeout TIME] [readonly] [host RUNNER_HOST]
              Map FILEPATH to the nbd device, as default the timeout 0, none readonly, RUNNER_HOST will be 'localhost' as default

       gluster unmap <nbd-device|VOLUME/FILEPATH> [host RUNNER_HOST]
              Unmap the nbd device or VOLUME/FILEPATH, RUNNER_HOST will be 'localhost' as default

       gluster list [inuse|free|create|dead|live|all] [host RUNNER_HOST]
              List the inuseded|free NBD devices or the backstores which are in created state or which the connections are in dead|live state, 'all' as default. 'create' means the backstores are just created
              or unmapped. 'dead' means the socket connection is lost, which mainly dues to the nbd-runner service was restart without unmapping. 'live' means everything is okay for both mapping  and  socket
