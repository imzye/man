GNOME-SSH-ASKPASS(1)                                                                       General Commands Manual                                                                     GNOME-SSH-ASKPASS(1)

NAME
       gnome-ssh-askpass — prompts a user for a passphrase using GNOME

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-ssh-askpass [message ...]

DESCRIPTION
       gnome-ssh-askpass  is  a  GNOME-based  passphrase  dialog  for  use with OpenSSH.  It is intended to be called by the ssh-add(1) program and not invoked directly.  It allows ssh-add(1) to obtain a
       passphrase from a user, even if not connected to a terminal (assuming that an X display is available).  This happens automatically in the case where ssh-add(1) is invoked from one's ~/.xsession or
       as one of the GNOME startup programs, for example.

       In order to be called automatically by ssh-add(1), the SSH_ASKPASS environment variable should be set to point to the location of gnome-ssh-askpass, or gnome-ssh-askpass  should  be  installed  as
       /usr/bin/ssh-askpass.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are recognized:

       GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_BG_COLOR      Text area background color, specified as hexadecimal RGB or RRGGBB, optionally prefixed by “#” or “0x”.

       GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_FG_COLOR      Text area foreground color, specified as hexadecimal RGB or RRGGBB, optionally prefixed by “#” or “0x”.

       GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_GRAB_POINTER  If set, causes gnome-ssh-askpass to grab the mouse pointer before asking for a passphrase.

       GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_GRAB_SERVER   If set, causes gnome-ssh-askpass to grab the X server before asking for a passphrase.

       SSH_ASKPASS_PROMPT              If set to confirm, show a yes-or-no prompt, defaulting to yes.  If set to none, show a prompt with only a close button.  Otherwise, show an OK-or-cancel prompt, de‐
                                       faulting to OK.  This environment variable is typically set by ssh-add(1), and should not normally be set manually.

       Regardless of whether either GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_GRAB_POINTER or GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_GRAB_SERVER is set, gnome-ssh-askpass will grab the keyboard.
