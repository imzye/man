NAME
          HTML::TagTree - An HTML generator via a tree of 'tag' objects.

SYNOPSIS
          use HTML::TagTree;

          my $html = HTML::TagTree->new('html');   # Define the top of the tree of objects.
          my $head = $html->head();                # Put a 'head' branch on the tree.
          my $body = $html->body();                # Put a 'body' branch on the tree
          $head->title("This is the Title of Gary's Page, the opening title...");
          $head->meta('', 'name=author CONTENT="Dan DeBrito"');
          $body->div->h1('Hello Dolly');           # Example of method chaining to create
                                                   # a long branch.
          my $table = $body->table('', 'width=100% border=1');
          my $row1 = $table->tr();
          $row1->td('cell a');
          $row1->td('cell b');
          $table->tr->td('This is a new row with new cell');
          $table->tr->td('This is a another new row with new data');

          # Print to STDOUT the actual HTML representation of the tree
          $html->print_html();

          # Put HTML into a scalar variable
          my $html_source = $html->get_html_text();

          # Force destruction of object tree
          $html->release();

DESCRIPTION
             HTLM::TagTrees allows easy building of a tree objects where
             each object represents: 1) a tag 2) its value and 3) any
             tag attributes. Valid HTML is build of the tree via a method call.

FEATURES
          Smart quoting of tag parameters:
          Doing something like this:
             $body->div('','id=nav onclick="alert(\"Hello World\"');
          the HTML module will render HTML that looks like:
             <div id="nav" onclick='alert("Hello World")' \>

          Reduce whitespace in your HTML rendering by turning
          on the no_whitespace_flag.
          my $no_whitespace_html_text = $html->get_html_text('',1);

          # Or..
          my $indent_level = 0;
          my $no_whitespace_flag = 1;
          print $html_obj->get_html_text($indent_level, $no_whitespace_flag);

INITIALIZATION
             HTML::TagTree->new(tag_name,[value],[attributes])
                Returns a TagTree object

METHODS
             Every HTML tag type is an object method.
             $obj->tag_name(content,attributes);
                Returns:
                   object for valid creation
                   undef if tag_name is not a valid name;
                Arguments:
                   content:
                      Untagged data that goes in between open and close tag. eg
                         <b>content</b>
                      Content my be a Perl scalar, a ref to a scalar,
                      or ref to a subroutine. Dereferencing occurs at the
                      time of HTML rendering (via print_html()
                      or get_html_text() methods).
                   attributes:
                      Attributes of this HTML tag.
                      Attributes argument may be a Perl scalar, a ref to a scalar,
                      or a ref to a subroutine. Dereferencing occurs at the
                      time of HTML rendering.
                      Example of attributes:
                         'id=first_name name=fn class=str_cl'
             get_html_text(indent_level, no_whitespace_flag)
                Returns valid HTML representation of tag tree starting at the object.
                Arguments:
                   indent_level:
                      Starting amount of indentation. Typically leave undef or 0.
                   no_whitespace_flag:
                      Set to '1' to prevent insertion of linefeeds and whitespace padding
                      for legibility.
             print_html()
                Prints the valid HTML to STDOUT
             release()
                Destroys all children objects so no objects reference
                this object (and it can be destroyed when it goes out of scope).
             set_valid_tags( tag_names )
                Clears and sets what the valid tag names are for which
                objects can be created.

FUNCTIONS
             HTML::TagTree::get_http_header();
                Returns the generic HTTP header:
                   "Content-type: text/html\nStatus: 200  OK\n\n";

ABSTRACT
             The philosophy of HTML::TagTree is to let you create
             one region of code with lots of business logic
             for rendering many possible resulting HTML files/output.
             This differs from the approach of using business logic code
             to decide which HTML template (of many) to render.
             So rather than maintaining many HTML templates, you
             maintain a Perl file that does all possible customizations
             of HTML generation.

             This module strives to minimize typing. Object treeing is
             just a simple method call, eg:
                $body->h1->b->i('This is a bold, italic heading');

             HTML::TagTree removes the worries of making simple HTML syntax
             errors such as no matching closing tag for an open tag.
