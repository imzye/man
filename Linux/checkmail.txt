NAME
       checkmail - plays a sound file when the user receives mail

SYNOPSIS
       checkmail

DESCRIPTION
       The  checkmail program checks the status of the user's mail drop.  If new mail is waiting, checkmail runs playbucket to play a sound and returns an exit status of 0.  If mail has been cleared, an exit
       status of 2 is returned.  If there has been no change, an exit status of 1 is returned.

       The checkmail program is intended to be used with the checkCommand resource of xbiff.  To set this resource, add the following line to your .Xdefaults file:

                 xbiff*checkCommand: checkmail

FILES
       /usr/spool/mail/$USER         the user's mail drop

       $HOME/.mailstat               holds the previous mail drop size

       $HOME/.mailsound              audio file to play when there's new mail
