NAME
       mrest - Web::MREST server startup script

SYNOPSIS
       Possible invocations (any options after "--" are parsed by Plack::Runner: basically, they can be anything accepted by "plackup":

           $ mrest --distro My-Distro --module My::Module
           $ mrest -d My::Distro -m My::Module
           $ mrest --distro My-Distro --module My::Module --sitedir /etc/my-module
           $ mrest -d My::Distro -m My::Module -s /etc/my-module
           $ mrest -- --server Starman
           $ mrest --help

DESCRIPTION
       Run this script from the bash prompt to start the server.

PASSING OPTIONS TO PLACK
       This script starts the server by instantiates a Plack::Runner object and calling its "run" method. Before doing that, it calls the "parse_options" method with @ARGV as its argument. However, the
       script does so after parsing its own options. Options intended to be parsed by Plack::Runner should be placed at the end of the command line, preceded by "--".

DEBUGGING OPTIONS
       You can include an "--early-debug" option on the command line, with the name of a file in which Web::MREST will capture "early" log messages -- i.e. all log messages generated before the
       "official" MREST log file (i.e. the one defined in the site parameters) is known.
