NAME
       checkinstall —       Track installation of local software, and produce a binary manageable with your package management software.

SYNOPSIS
       checkinstall [options]  [install command]

DESCRIPTION
       checkinstall is a program that monitors an installation procedure (such as make install, install.sh ), and creates a standard package for your distribution (currently deb, rpm and tgz packages are
       supported) that you can install through your distribution's package management system (dpkg, rpm or installpkg).

       Note that for most useful actions, checkinstall must be run as root.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ('-').  A summary of options is included below.

       All the options that toggle a switch default to activate the option.  To force activation or deactivation, call them with '=yes' or '=no'. As an example, to disable stripping use --strip=no.
