NAME
       speedometer - measure and display the rate of data across a network connection

SYNOPSIS
          speedometer [options] tap [[-c] tap] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Monitor network traffic or speed/progress of a file transfer. At least one tap option (-f, -rx, -tx) must be entered. Option -c starts a new column, otherwise taps are piled vertically.

       Note: before you use the program, start generating traffic by transferring files in/out e.g. with scp(1) in the network you're measuring.

OPTIONS
       -b  Use old blocky display instead of smoothed display even when UTF-8 encoding is detected.

       -f filename [size]
           Display download speed with progress bar. This option must be used if directly following another file tap without an expected size specified.

       -i interval
           Interval in seconds. Examples: 5 or 0.25". Default is 1.

       -p  Use plain-text display (one tap only).

       -rx iface
           Display bytes received on network interface.

       -tx iface
           Display bytes transmitted on network interface.

       -z  Report zero size on files that don't exist instead of waiting for them to be created

       EXAMPLES

       How long it will take for my 38MB transfer to finish?

           speedometer favorite_episode.rm $(( 38 * 1024 * 1024 ))

       How quickly is another transfer going?

           speedometer dl/big.avi

       How fast is this LAN?

           host-a$ cat /dev/zero | nc -l -p 12345
           host-b$ nc host-a 12345 > /dev/null
           host-b$ speedometer -rx eth0

       How fast is the upstream on this ADSL line?

           speedometer -tx ppp0

       How fast can I write data to my filesystem? (with at least 1GB free)

           dd bs=1000000 count=1000 if=/dev/zero of=bigfile &
           speedometer bigfile
