NAME
       cyr_deny - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       deny users access to Cyrus services

SYNOPSIS
       cyr_deny [ -C config-file ] [ -s services ] [ -m message ] user
       cyr_deny [ -C config-file ] -a user
       cyr_deny [ -C config-file ] -l

DESCRIPTION
       cyr_deny  is  used  to  deny individual users access to Cyrus services.
       The first synopsis denies user user access to Cyrus services, the  sec‐
       ond synopsis allows access again.  cyr_deny works by adding an entry to
       the Cyrus user_deny.db database; the third synopsis lists  the  entries
       in  the database.  The service names to be matched are those as used in
       cyrus.conf(5).

       cyr_deny reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)  file
       unless specified otherwise by -C.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -a user
              Allow access to all services for user  user  (remove  any  entry
              from the deny database).

       -s services
              Deny  access  only to the given services, which is a comma-sepa‐
              rated list of wildcard patterns.  The default is "*"  which  de‐
              nies access to all services.

       -m message
              Provide  a  message which is sent to the user to explain why ac‐
              cess is being denied.  A default message  is  used  if  none  is
              specified.

       -l     List the entries in the deny database.
