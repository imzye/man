NAME
       statsvn - SVN repository statistic analysis tool

SYNOPSIS
       svn log --xml -v path/to/repos > svn-logfile.xml

       statsvn [options] svn-logfile path/to/repos

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the statsvn command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       statsvn  is a program that retrieves information from a SVN repository and generates various tables and charts describing the project development, e.g. timeline for the lines of code, contribution
       of each developer, etc.

       The current version of statsvn generates a static suite of HTML documents containing tables and chart images.  statsvn is opens source software, released under the terms oft the LGPL.  statsvn  is
       based on statcvs(1) (hence the striking similarity between their interfaces and manual pages) and uses JFreeChart to generate charts.

       svn-log-file
              path to the output of svn log --xml -v for the given repository.  IMPORTANT NOTE: do not forget the -v option, else statsvn will crash !!!

       path/to/repos
              path to a checkout of the repository.

OPTIONS
       These  programs  follow  the usual command line syntax, with long options starting with one dash ("-").  A list of common options is included below.  For more up-to-date information, see statsvn's
       website.

   General Options
       -output-dir <directory>
              Specify an output directory. The reports will be generated in this directory. The directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

       -include <include-pattern-list>

       -exclude <exclude-pattern-list>
              Specify filters to exclude files from the analysis. A file will be ignored if it doesn't match any of the patterns in include-pattern-list, or if it matches any pattern in  exclude-pattern-
              list.

              The patterns are lists of Apache Ant-style wildcard patterns, separated by colons or semicolons. The wildcards are:

                      * '?' matches a single character
                      * '*' matches zero or more characters
                      * '**' matches zero or more directories

              For example, src/**/*.java matches all java files in the src directory or its subdirectories. Note that *.java only matches java files in the root directory, because '*' does not match sub‐
              directories.

              One more example:

              -include **/*.c:**/*.h -exclude legacy/**

              This matches all .c and .h files anywhere in the directory tree except those in the legacy directory and its subdirectories.

              For more information on Ant's wildcard syntax, see the Patternset section of the Ant manual.

              If not specified, all files will be included and no files will be excluded.

              Note: Unix users must put the patterns in quotes, or the shell will interfere with the wildcards.

       -cache-dir <directory>
              Specify  a cache directory for information retrieved from the Subversion server (e.g. line counts). The data will be saved in this directory. The directory will be created if it doesn't ex‐
              ist. By default, the current user directory is used.

       -username <subversion_username>

              Specify a username to use when connecting to the Subversion server.

       -password <subversion_username>
              Specify a password to use when connecting to the Subversion server.

       -tags <tags-regularexpression>

              Includes information about Subverison tags into the reports. Only tags matching the regular expression are included. To include all tags, add -tags '.*' to the command line.

              Note:  Unix users must put the expression in quotes, or the shell will interfere with the wildcards.

              Note:  Tags are determined by looking at your repository's /tags directory. To be able to use this feature, you must generate the log file from the root of your repository, so that the  log
              contains information from both the /tags and the /trunk. The checked out version does not have to contain the tags directory.

       -tags-dir <directory>

              Specifies the root directory from which the tags regular expression is evaluated. The default -tags-dir is /tags/

       -no-developer <login-name>
              Excludes  a  Subversion  account  name  from all developer reports. This is useful to reduce noise from administrative and other non-developer accounts. Multiple accounts can be excluded by
              adding the option to the command line once for each account.

   Report Options
       -xdoc  Generate Maven XDoc instead of HTML. This allows Maven and Maven 2 to integrate the reports when it  generates  the  projects  Maven  site.  Reports  could  be  placed,  for  example,  into
              src/site/statsvn.

       -xml   Generate XML instead of HTML.

       -css <stylesheet>
              Optional  (default varies for html or xdoc). Specify a Cascading Style Sheet for the report. This can be a HTTP URL or a local file. A URL will simply be linked in every page of the report.
              A local file will be copied into the report directory.

       -notes <notes-file>
              The contents of the specified file will be included at the top of the report's index page. The file should contain a valid block-level HTML fragment, for example:

                  <p>
                    These are development statistics for the
                    <a href="http://www.statsvn.org">StatSVN</a>
                    project, created by StatSVN itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    This report was generated by an unreleased
                    development version of StatSVN. It might
                    contain features not yet found in the
                    official release.
                  </p>

       -title <title>
              Specifies a display title to be used in the reports. The name of the Subversion module will be used as default if no title is specified.

       -config-file <path-to-properties-file>
              Allows one to replace the source control username with more information such as real name, website, email and avatar icon. See this file for an example.

       -charset <charSet>
              Specifies the charset to use in HTML or XDOC output. ISO-8859-1 will be used as default if no charset is specified.

       -disable-twitter-button
              if present, exclude the Twitter "Tweet This" buttons from the output.

   Options for Integration with External Tools
       -bugzilla
              Specify the URL of a root of a Bugzilla installation. Will replace 'Bug ###' in commit logs with a link to the appropriate bug. (New in StatSVN)

       -chora <chora-url>
              Specify the URL of a Chora installation for the module. This must be the URL of the page for the module's root directory. StatSVN will create links to Chora for directories, files and revi‐
              sions.

       -viewvc <viewvc-url>
              Specify the URL of a ViewVC installation for the module. This must be the URL of the page for the module's root directory. StatSVN will create links to ViewVC for directories, files and re‐
              visions.

       -mantis <mantis-url>
              Specify the root URL of a Mantis bug tracker installation. In commit messages, this will turn “Bug ####” into a link to the appropriate bug.

       -trac <trac-url>
              Specify the root URL of a Trac installation. In commit messages, this will turn “Bug ####” into a link to the appropriate bug.

   Miscellaneous Options
       -debug Output lots of additional progress information.

       -verbose
              Output additional progress information.

       -version
              Output the version of StatSVN.

       -dump  Will output the repository content on console and stop

       -concurrency-threshold <millisec>
              Switch to concurrent svn diff if the first call takes more than the threshold (in milliseconds) (default: 4000)

       -threads <int>
              How many threads for svn diff (default: 25)

       -anonymize
              Anonymizes committer names.

IMPORTANT NOTES
       Unlike its cousin statcvs(1), statsvn can work on distant repositories. Please note however, that statsvn needs to download many diffs from the repository, so it is often more network-efficient to
       simply rsync(1) the repository to a local host and run it on the local copy.

       To compensate for that, however, diffs are cached in the $HOME/.statsvn directory.

       Do not forget the -v option to svn diff !

       Finally, note that the default value for the number of concurrent svn(1) processes might be too much for the target host. If you get weird error messages about unreachable hosts and similar  prob‐
       lems, try taking down the -threads parameter.

JAVA-WRAPPERS NOTE
       This program is a shell script wrapper based on java-wrappers(7).  You therefore benefit from several features; please see the java-wrappers(7) manual page for more information about them.
