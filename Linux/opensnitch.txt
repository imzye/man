NAME
       opensnitchd - GNU/Linux interactive firewall application

SYNOPSIS
       opensnitchd [-rules-path path] [-cpu-profile path] [-debug] [-error] [-warning] [-important] [-log-file path]... [-mem-profile path]... [-no-live-reload] [-process-monitor-method name]... [-queue-
                   num num]... [-ui-socket path]... [-version] [-workers num]...

DESCRIPTION
       opensnitchd  is  the OpenSnitch agent that intercepts outbound connections, and send them to the server. The server can be a GUI, a TUI, or a headless component to just log the network activity (a
       SIEM for example).  By default it'll allow all connections, creating temporal rules for you so you can review them later.

OPTIONS
       -rules-path path
              Specifies where the rules will be written to. Default "rules".

       -cpu-profile path
              A file path where the CPU data for later use will be written.

       -debug Set LogLevel to DEBUG.

       -warning
              Set LogLevel to WARNING.

       -important
              Set LogLevel to IMPORTANT.

       -log-file path
              A file path where the logs will be written to. This path can be a device file, like /dev/stdout to print logs to standard output.

       -mem-profile path
              A file path where the memory data will be written once the daemon exits.

       -no-live-reload
              By default daemon's rules and configuration is reloaded whenever it changes.  This option disables this feature.

       -process-monitor-method method
              Force process monitor method, overriding what is defined in the configuration.  Valid methods: ebpf, audit, proc

       -queue-num num
              Force to use this netfilter queue num. The default queue number is 0, but if it's already used by other software, you can set another queue number here.

       -ui-socket path
              Force to use this socket path, instead of the one defined in the configuration.  The path format is unix:///path/to/socket.sock or ip:port ("127.0.0.1:50051")
              ( https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md )

       -version
              Prints out daemon version.

       -workers num
              Change maximum number of workers to process outbound connections.  By default 16 workers are launched, but if it's not enough increase this number.

FILES
       /etc/opensnitchd/rules/
              Default daemon directory rules.
       /etc/opensnitchd/default-config.json
              Default daemon configuration.
       /etc/opensnitchd/system-fw.json
              Configuration of system firewall rules (iptables/nftables).

              Firewall rules defined here bypasses OpenSnitch interception. Use it to allow VPNs or other services.

DIAGNOSTICS
       OpenSnitch needs at least one firewall rule to intercept outbound connections:

       iptables -t mangle -L OUTPUT | grep NFQUEUE
              NFQUEUE all -- anywhere anywhere ctstate NEW,RELATED NFQUEUE num 0 bypass

       If you suspect that OpenSnitch blocks an application and doesn't prompt you to allow or deny it, using the GUI enable the option [x] Debug invalid connections under Preferences -> Nodes.   Or  set
       the configuration option InterceptUnknown to true.

       Tip: You can also add rules to the file /etc/opensnitchd/system-fw.json, to allow network services without being intercepted by the daemon.

       Another way of debugging errors is by launching the daemon from the command line:

       1.  Set LogLevel to DEBUG under Preferences -> Nodes (or LogLevel to 0 in the configuration)
       2.  Stop the daemon: systemctl stop opensnitch
       3.  Launch it from cli: /usr/bin/opensnitchd -rules-path /etc/opensnitchd/rules/
