NAME
       uml_mconsole — attach to the management console of a user-mode Linux kernel

SYNOPSIS
       uml_mconsole [socket]  [command ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the uml_mconsole command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       uml_mconsole  is a program to connect to the management console of a user-mode Linux kernel.  The UML management console is a low-level interface to the kernel, somewhat like the i386 SysRq interface.
       Since there is a full-blown operating system under UML, there is much greater flexibility possible than with the SysRq mechanism.

OPTIONS
       socket    The pathname of the socket to which to connect.  This is printed when UML boots, for example:

       mconsole initialized on /tmp/umlNJ32yL/mconsole

                 In this example, you would start uml_mconsole like this:

       uml_mconsole umlNJ32yL

       command   Any of the commands listed in the “COMMANDS” section.

COMMANDS
       version   Prints the UML version number.

       halt      Shuts down the UML system immediately, without syncing disks or cleanly shutting down swap space.

       reboot    Reboots the UML system immediately, without syncing disks or cleanly shutting down swap space.

       log string
                 Cause UML to log string to the kernel log.

       cad       Invokes the Control-Alt-Delete handler.

       sysrq letter
                 Performs the SysRq action controlled by letter.

       stop      Pauses UML.  UML will do nothing until the 'go' command is issued.

       go        Resumes execution after a 'stop' command.

       config device
                 Adds a new device to the virtual machine, or queries the configuration of an existing device.  It takes one argument, which is either the device to add, with the same syntax  as  the  kernel
                 command line, or the name of an existing device.  For example:

       (mconsole)
       config ubd3=root_fs_debian22
       OK

       (mconsole)
       config ubd3
       OK root_fs_debian22

       remove    Deletes a device from the virtual machine.  Its argument is the name of the device to be removed.  In the case of the ubd driver, the removed block device must not be mounted, swapped on, or
                 otherwise open, and in the case of the network driver, the device must be down.

       (mconsole)
       remove ubd3
       OK
