USAGE
       Keys:

       Movement
              Arrow, Num key / Joystick

       Boost  [Z][X][L-Ctrl][L-Alt] / Trigger 1-4

       Pause  [P]

       Quit   [ESC]

       Control your ship and gather golds. The ship accelerates while holding the boost button.A boost power runs out about 1.5 seconds, so you have to push the boost button again to maintain the speed.

       The gauge at the right-down corner is the power gauge. The power increases when you take a gold at high speed. When the power gauge becomes full, your ship becomes invincible for a  while.  Attack
       enemies and earn the bonus score.

       The ship is destroyed when you touch the enemy. When you gather a given number of golds, you can go to the next stage. If the timer at the right-up corner runs out, you also lose the ship.

       When all ships are destroyed, the game is over. The ship extends 20,000 and every 50,000 points. If your score is over 100,000, you can continue the game.
