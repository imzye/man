NAME
       arch-chroot - enhanced chroot command

SYNOPSIS
       arch-chroot [options] chroot-dir [command]

DESCRIPTION
       arch-chroot wraps the chroot(1) command while ensuring that important functionality is available, e.g. mounting /dev/, /proc and other API filesystems, or exposing resolv.conf(5) to the chroot.

       If command is unspecified, arch-chroot will launch /bin/bash.

           Note
           The target chroot-dir should be a mountpoint. This ensures that tools such as pacman(8) or findmnt(8) have an accurate hierarchy of the mounted filesystems within the chroot. If your chroot target
           is not a mountpoint, you can bind mount the directory on itself to make it a mountpoint, i.e.:

           mount --bind /your/chroot /your/chroot

OPTIONS
       -u <user>[:group]
           Specify non-root user and optional group to use.

       -h
           Output syntax and command line options.

SEE ALSO
       pacman(8)
