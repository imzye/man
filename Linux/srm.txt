NAME
       srm - securely remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       srm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       srm  removes each specified file by overwriting, renaming, and truncating it before unlinking.  This prevents other people from undeleting or recovering any information about the file from the command
       line.  By default srm uses the simple mode to overwrite the file's contents.  You can choose a different overwrite mode with --dod, --doe, --openbsd, --rcmp, --gutmann.  If you specify more  than  one
       mode option, the last option is used.

       You  can  use srm to overwrite block devices.  The device node is not removed after overwriting.  This feature is available on Linux.  Files with multiple hard links will be unlinked but not overwrit‐
       ten.

       srm, like every program that uses the getopt function to parse its arguments, lets you use the -- option to indicate that all following arguments are non-options.  To remove a file called `-f' in  the
       current directory, you could type either
              rm -- -f
       or
              rm ./-f

OPTIONS
       -d, --directory
              ignored (for compatibility with rm(1))

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files, never prompt

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before any removal

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove the contents of directories recursively

       -x, --one-file-system
              when removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argument.  (Not supported on Windows)

       -s, --simple
              Overwrite the file with a single pass of 0x00 bytes.  This is the default mode.

       -P, --openbsd
              OpenBSD compatible rm.  Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte 0xFF, then 0x00, and then 0xFF again, before they are deleted.

       -D, --dod
              US Dod compliant 7-pass overwrite.

       -E, --doe
              US DoE compliant 3-pass overwrite.  Twice with a random pattern, finally with the bytes "DoE".  See http://cio.energy.gov/CS-11_Clearing_and_Media_Sanitization_Guidance.pdf for details.

       -G, --gutmann
              Use the 35-pass Gutmann method.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method for details.

       -C, --rcmp
              Royal   Canadian   Mounted  Police  compliant  3-pass  overwrite.   First  pass  writes  0x00  bytes.   Second  pass  writes  0xFF  bytes.   Third  pass  writes  "RCMP".   See  https://www.cse-
              cst.gc.ca/en/node/270/html/10572 for details.

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done.  Specify this option multiple times to increase verbosity.

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit.

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit.

SIGNALS
       SIGINFO, SIGUSR2
              show current write position and filename handled.

ENTIRE HARD DISKS
       srm can write to block devices on Linux.  You can use srm to securely delete an entire hard disk, however you should only do this for classic magnetic drives.  The modern solid state disks (SSD)  have
       a faster and better way to erase all contents, Secure Erase.  For a Linux operating system see https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase

NOTES
       srm can not remove write protected files owned by another user, regardless of the permissions on the directory containing the file.

       Development and discussion of srm is carried out at https://sourceforge.net/projects/srm/ which is also accessible via http://srm.sourceforge.net/.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_remanence for
       a general discussion about overwriting data.
