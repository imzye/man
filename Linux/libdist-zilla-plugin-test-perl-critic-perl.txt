NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Perl::Critic - Tests to check your code against best practices

VERSION
       version 3.005

SYNOPSIS
       In your dist.ini:

           [Test::Perl::Critic]
           critic_config = perlcritic.rc ; default / relative to project root

DESCRIPTION
       This will provide a xt/author/critic.t file for use during the "test" and "release" calls of "dzil". To use this, make the changes to dist.ini above and run one of the following:

           dzil test
           dzil release

       During these runs, xt/author/critic.t will use Test::Perl::Critic to run Perl::Critic against your code and by report findings.

OPTIONS
   filename
       The file name of the test to generate. Defaults to xt/author/critic.t.

   critic_config
       This plugin accepts the "critic_config" option, which s Specifies your own config file for Perl::Critic. It defaults to "perlcritic.rc", relative to the project root. If the file does not exist,
       Perl::Critic will use its defaults.

       The option can also be configured using the "profile" alias.

   verbose
       If configured, overrides the "-verbose" option to Perl::Critic.

   files
       If specified, will be used as the list of files to check. If neither "files" "finder" is specified, Test::Perl::Critic's default behavior of checking all files will be used.

   finder
       Can be specified to use a file finder to select the files to check, rather than checking all files.
