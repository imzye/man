NAME
       Net::INET6Glue - Make common modules IPv6 ready by hotpatching

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::INET6Glue; # include all glue
        use LWP;
        use Net::SMTP;
        use Net::FTP;
        ..

DESCRIPTION
       Net::INET6Glue is a collection of modules to make common modules IPv6 ready by hotpatching them.

       Unfortunatly the current state of IPv6 support in perl is that no IPv6 support is in the core and that a lot of important modules (like Net::FTP, Net::SMTP, LWP,...) do not support IPv6 even if
       the modules for IPv6 sockets like Socket6, IO::Socket::IP or IO::Socket::INET6 are available.

       This module tries to mitigate this by hotpatching.  Currently the following submodules are available:

       Net::INET6Glue::INET_is_INET6
           Makes  IO::Socket::INET  behave  like  IO::Socket::IP  (with  fallback to like IO::Socket::INET6), especially make it capable to create IPv6 sockets.  This makes LWP, Net::SMTP and others IPv6
           capable.

       Net::INET6Glue::FTP
           Hotpatches Net::FTP to support EPRT and EPSV commands which are needed to deal with FTP over IPv6. Also loads Net::INET6Glue::INET_is_INET6.
