NAME
       rsparms - Configure the Rose interface.

SYNOPSIS
       rsparms -nodes add|del address[/mask] port neigh [digis...]

       rsparms -nodes list

       rsparms -call <callsign>|none

       rsparms -version

DESCRIPTION
       This  program is used to manipulate the routing tables of the Rose net‐
       work layer. To set up a new route to a Rose node in the routing  tables
       you  must use the nodes option. All of the parameters are needed to add
       the node. It is probably best to illustrate with an example:

            rsparms -nodes add 2080192303 144 F1OAT-11

       This creates a new route to a distant node with the address  2080192303
       and  the  packets  for that node should be sent on AX.25 port 144 to my
       immediate neighbour F1OAT-11 without going through any digipeaters. For
       example to set up the same node but via a digipeater I would use:

            rsparms -nodes add 2080192303 144 F1OAT-11 F6PRA-9

       It  is  also possible to remove a route to a distant node with the same
       command except that the “add” is replaced by a “del”. The other parame‐
       ters  must  also  be  present. If the node has no other routes then the
       node will be deleted, and the neighbour node that  the  connections  go
       via may also be deleted if no other node route uses it.

       You may list the configured Rose routes using the following syntax:

            rsparms -nodes list

       This program may also be used to set up a common AX.25 level 2 callsign
       that will be used for the ROSE node. By  default  no  special  level  2
       callsign is set, but setting it will replace any existing level 2 call‐
       sign and register another one. Setting the callsign to “none” will  re‐
       move the level 2 callsign. For example:

            rsparms -call VK2KTJ-10

       would set the callsign used by Rose internode traffic to VK2KTJ-10.
