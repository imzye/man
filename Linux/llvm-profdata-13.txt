MERGE
   SYNOPSIS
       llvm-profdata merge [options] [filename…]

   DESCRIPTION
       llvm-profdata merge takes several profile data files generated by PGO instrumentation and merges them together into a single indexed profile data file.

       By  default  profile data is merged without modification. This means that the relative importance of each input file is proportional to the number of samples
       or counts it contains. In general, the input from a longer training run will be interpreted as relatively more important than a shorter run. Depending on the
       nature of the training runs it may be useful to adjust the weight given to each input file by using the -weighted-input option.

       Profiles passed in via -weighted-input, -input-files, or via positional arguments are processed once for each time they are seen.

   OPTIONS
       -help  Print a summary of command line options.

       -output=output, -o=output
              Specify the output file name.  Output cannot be - as the resulting indexed profile data can’t be written to standard output.

       -weighted-input=weight,filename
              Specify  an input file name along with a weight. The profile counts of the supplied filename will be scaled (multiplied) by the supplied weight, where
              weight is a decimal integer >= 1.  Input files specified without using this option are assigned a default weight of 1. Examples are shown below.

       -input-files=path, -f=path
              Specify a file which contains a list of files to merge. The entries in this file are newline-separated. Lines starting with ‘#’ are  skipped.  Entries
              may be of the form <filename> or <weight>,<filename>.

       -remapping-file=path, -r=path
              Specify  a  file  which contains a remapping from symbol names in the input profile to the symbol names that should be used in the output profile. The
              file should consist of lines of the form <input-symbol> <output-symbol>.  Blank lines and lines starting with # are skipped.

              The llvm-cxxmap tool can be used to generate the symbol remapping file.

       -instr (default)
              Specify that the input profile is an instrumentation-based profile.

       -sample
              Specify that the input profile is a sample-based profile.

              The format of the generated file can be generated in one of three ways:

              -binary (default)

              Emit the profile using a binary encoding. For instrumentation-based profile the output format is the indexed binary format.

              -extbinary

              Emit the profile using an extensible binary encoding. This option can only be used with sample-based profile. The extensible binary  encoding  can  be
              more compact with compression enabled and can be loaded faster than the default binary encoding.

              -text

              Emit  the  profile  in  text mode. This option can also be used with both sample-based and instrumentation-based profile. When this option is used the
              profile will be dumped in the text format that is parsable by the profile reader.

              -gcc

              Emit the profile using GCC’s gcov format (Not yet supported).

       -sparse[=true|false]
              Do not emit function records with 0 execution count. Can only be used in conjunction with -instr. Defaults to false, since it can inhibit compiler op‐
              timization during PGO.

       -num-threads=N, -j=N
              Use N threads to perform profile merging. When N=0, llvm-profdata auto-detects an appropriate number of threads to use. This is the default.

       -failure-mode=[any|all]
              Set the failure mode. There are two options: ‘any’ causes the merge command to fail if any profiles are invalid, and ‘all’ causes the merge command to
              fail only if all profiles are invalid. If ‘all’ is set, information from any invalid profiles is excluded from the final merged product.  The  default
              failure mode is ‘any’.

       -prof-sym-list=path
              Specify a file which contains a list of symbols to generate profile symbol list in the profile. This option can only be used with sample-based profile
              in extbinary format. The entries in this file are newline-separated.

       -compress-all-sections=[true|false]
              Compress all sections when writing the profile. This option can only be used with sample-based profile in extbinary format.

       -use-md5=[true|false]
              Use MD5 to represent string in name table when writing the profile.  This option can only be used with sample-based profile in extbinary format.

       -gen-partial-profile=[true|false]
              Mark the profile to be a partial profile which only provides partial profile coverage for the optimized target. This option can only be used with sam‐
              ple-based profile in extbinary format.

       -supplement-instr-with-sample=path_to_sample_profile
              Supplement an instrumentation profile with sample profile. The sample profile is the input of the flag. Output will be in instrumentation format (only
              works with -instr).

       -zero-counter-threshold=threshold_float_number
              For the function which is cold in instr profile but hot in sample profile, if the ratio of the number of zero counters divided by the the total number
              of counters is above the threshold, the profile of the function will be regarded as being harmful for performance and will be dropped.

       -instr-prof-cold-threshold=threshold_int_number
              User specified cold threshold for instr profile which will override the cold threshold got from profile summary.

       -suppl-min-size-threshold=threshold_int_number
              If  the  size  of  a function is smaller than the threshold, assume it can be inlined by PGO early inliner and it will not be adjusted based on sample
              profile.

   EXAMPLES
   Basic Usage
       Merge three profiles:

          llvm-profdata merge foo.profdata bar.profdata baz.profdata -output merged.profdata

   Weighted Input
       The input file foo.profdata is especially important, multiply its counts by 10:

          llvm-profdata merge -weighted-input=10,foo.profdata bar.profdata baz.profdata -output merged.profdata

       Exactly equivalent to the previous invocation (explicit form; useful for programmatic invocation):

          llvm-profdata merge -weighted-input=10,foo.profdata -weighted-input=1,bar.profdata -weighted-input=1,baz.profdata -output merged.profdata

SHOW
   SYNOPSIS
       llvm-profdata show [options] [filename]

   DESCRIPTION
       llvm-profdata show takes a profile data file and displays the information about the profile counters for this file and for any of the specified function(s).

       If filename is omitted or is -, then llvm-profdata show reads its input from standard input.

   OPTIONS
       -all-functions
              Print details for every function.

       -counts
              Print the counter values for the displayed functions.

       -function=string
              Print details for a function if the function’s name contains the given string.

       -help  Print a summary of command line options.

       -output=output, -o=output
              Specify the output file name.  If output is - or it isn’t specified, then the output is sent to standard output.

       -instr (default)
              Specify that the input profile is an instrumentation-based profile.

       -text  Instruct the profile dumper to show profile counts in the text format of the instrumentation-based profile data representation. By default,  the  pro‐
              file information is dumped in a more human readable form (also in text) with annotations.

       -topn=n
              Instruct  the  profile dumper to show the top n functions with the hottest basic blocks in the summary section. By default, the topn functions are not
              dumped.

       -sample
              Specify that the input profile is a sample-based profile.

       -memop-sizes
              Show the profiled sizes of the memory intrinsic calls for shown functions.

       -value-cutoff=n
              Show only those functions whose max count values are greater or equal to n.  By default, the value-cutoff is set to 0.

       -list-below-cutoff
              Only output names of functions whose max count value are below the cutoff value.

       -showcs
              Only show context sensitive profile counts. The default is to filter all context sensitive profile counts.

       -show-prof-sym-list=[true|false]
              Show profile symbol list if it exists in the profile. This option is only meaningful for sample-based profile in extbinary format.

       -show-sec-info-only=[true|false]
              Show basic information about each section in the profile. This option is only meaningful for sample-based profile in extbinary format.

OVERLAP
   SYNOPSIS
       llvm-profdata overlap [options] [base profile file] [test profile file]

   DESCRIPTION
       llvm-profdata overlap takes two profile data files and displays the overlap of counter distribution between the whole files and between any of the  specified
       functions.

       In  this  command,  overlap  is defined as follows: Suppose base profile file has the following counts: {c1_1, c1_2, …, c1_n, c1_u_1, c2_u_2, …, c2_u_s}, and
       test profile file has {c2_1, c2_2, …, c2_n, c2_v_1, c2_v_2, …, c2_v_t}.  Here c{1|2}_i (i = 1 .. n) are matched counters and c1_u_i (i = 1 .. s)  and  c2_v_i
       (i  =  1  ..  v) are unmatched counters (or counters only existing in) base profile file and test profile file, respectively.  Let sum_1 = c1_1 + c1_2 +  … +
       c1_n +  c1_u_1 + c2_u_2 + … + c2_u_s, and sum_2 = c2_1 + c2_2 + … + c2_n +  c2_v_1  +  c2_v_2  +  …  +  c2_v_t.   overlap  =  min(c1_1/sum_1,  c2_1/sum_2)  +
       min(c1_2/sum_1, c2_2/sum_2) + … + min(c1_n/sum_1, c2_n/sum_2).

       The result overlap distribution is a percentage number, ranging from 0.0% to 100.0%, where 0.0% means there is no overlap and 100.0% means a perfect overlap.

       Here is an example, if base profile file has counts of {400, 600}, and test profile file has matched counts of {60000, 40000}. The overlap is 80%.

   OPTIONS
       -function=string
              Print details for a function if the function’s name contains the given string.

       -help  Print a summary of command line options.

       -o=output or -o output
              Specify the output file name.  If output is - or it isn’t specified, then the output is sent to standard output.

       -value-cutoff=n
              Show only those functions whose max count values are greater or equal to n.  By default, the value-cutoff is set to max of unsigned long long.

       -cs    Only show overlap for the context sensitive profile counts. The default is to show non-context sensitive profile counts.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-profdata returns 1 if the command is omitted or is invalid, if it cannot read input files, or if there is a mismatch between their data.
