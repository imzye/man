NAME
       Data::Validate::IP - IPv4 and IPv6 validation methods

VERSION
       version 0.31

SYNOPSIS
         use Data::Validate::IP qw(is_ipv4 is_ipv6);

         my $suspect = '1.2.3.4';
         if (is_ipv4($suspect)) {
             print "Looks like an IPv4 address";
         }
         else {
             print "Not an IPv4 address\n";
         }

         $suspect = '::1234';
         if (is_ipv6($suspect)) {
             print "Looks like an IPv6 address";
         }
         else {
             print "Not an IPv6 address\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a number IP address validation subs that both validate and untaint their input. This includes both basic validation ("is_ipv4()" and "is_ipv6()") and special cases like
       checking whether an address belongs to a specific network or whether an address is public or private (reserved).

USAGE AND SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS
       It's important to understand that if "is_ipv4($ip)", "is_ipv6($ip)", or "is_ip($ip)" return false, then all other validation functions for that IP address family will also return false. So for
       example, if "is_ipv4($ip)" returns false, then "is_private_ipv4($ip)" and "is_public_ipv4($ip)" will both also return false.

       This means that simply calling "is_private_ipv4($ip)" by itself is not sufficient if you are dealing with untrusted input. You should always check "is_ipv4($ip)" as well. This applies as well when
       using IPv6 functions or generic functions like "is_private_ip($ip)".

       There are security implications to this around certain oddly formed addresses.  Notably, an address like "010.0.0.1" is technically valid, but the operating system will treat "010" as an octal
       number. That means that "010.0.0.1" is equivalent to "8.0.0.1", not "10.0.0.1".

       However, this module's "is_ipv4($ip)" and "is_ip($ip)" functions will return false for addresses like "010.0.0.1" which have octal components. And of course that means that it also returns false
       for "is_private_ipv4($ip)" and "is_public_ipv4($ip)".

FUNCTIONS
       All of the functions below are exported by default.

       All functions return an untainted value if the test passes and undef if it fails. In theory, this means that you should always check for a defined status explicitly but in practice there are no
       valid IP addresses where the string form evaluates to false in Perl.

       Note that none of these functions actually attempt to test whether the given IP address is routable from your device; they are purely semantic checks.

   is_ipv4($ip), is_ipv6($ip), is_ip($ip)
       These functions simply check whether the address is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   is_innet_ipv4($ip, $network)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the given IPv4 network.  The $network argument can either be a string in CIDR notation like "15.0.15.0/24" or a NetAddr::IP object.

       This subroutine used to accept many more forms of network specifications (anything Net::Netmask accepts) but this has been deprecated.

   is_unroutable_ipv4($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to any of several special use IPv4 networks - "0.0.0.0/8", "100.64.0.0/10", "192.0.0.0/29", "198.18.0.0/15", "240.0.0.0/4" - as defined by RFC
       5735 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>, RFC 6333 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6333>, and RFC 6958 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>.

       Arguably, these should be broken down further but this subroutine will always exist for backwards compatibility.

   is_private_ipv4($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to any of the private IPv4 networks - "10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16" - as defined by RFC 5735
       <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>.

   is_loopback_ipv4($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv4 loopback network - "127.0.0.0/8" - as defined by RFC 5735 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>.

   is_linklocal_ipv4($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv4 link local network - "169.254.0.0/16" - as defined by RFC 5735 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>.

   is_testnet_ipv4($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to any of the IPv4 TEST-NET networks for use in documentation and example code - "192.0.2.0/24", "198.51.100.0/24", and "203.0.113.0/24" - as
       defined by RFC 5735 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>.

   is_anycast_ipv4($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the 6to4 relay anycast network - "192.88.99.0/24" - as defined by RFC 5735 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>.

   is_multicast_ipv4($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv4 multicast network - "224.0.0.0/4" - as defined by RFC 5735 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>.

   is_loopback_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address is the IPv6 loopback address - "::1/128" - as defined by RFC 4291 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291>.

   is_ipv4_mapped_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 IPv4-mapped address network - "::ffff:0:0/96" - as defined by RFC 4291 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291>.

   is_discard_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 discard prefix network - "100::/64" - as defined by RFC 6666 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6666>.

   is_special_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 special network - "2001::/23" - as defined by RFC 2928 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2928>.

   is_teredo_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 TEREDO network - "2001::/32" - as defined by RFC 4380 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4380>.

       Note that this network is a subnet of the larger special network at "2001::/23".

   is_orchid_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 ORCHID network - "2001::/32" - as defined by RFC 4380 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4380>.

       Note that this network is a subnet of the larger special network at "2001::/23".

       This network is currently scheduled to be returned to the special pool in March of 2014 unless the IETF extends its use. If that happens this subroutine will continue to exist but will always
       return false.

   is_documentation_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 documentation network - "2001:DB8::/32" - as defined by RFC 3849 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3849>.

   is_unspecified_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 unspecified network - "::0/128" - as defined by RFC 4291 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291>.. Note that the address in this subnet
       is neither private nor public.

   is_private_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 private network - "FC00::/7" - as defined by RFC 4193 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193>.

   is_linklocal_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 link-local unicast network - "FE80::/10" - as defined by RFC 4291 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291>.

   is_multicast_ipv6($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv6 multicast network - "FF00::/8" - as defined by RFC 4291 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291>.

   is_public_ipv4($ip), is_public_ipv6($ip), is_public_ip($ip)
       These subroutines check whether the given IP address belongs to any of the special case networks defined previously. Note that this is not simply the opposite of checking "is_private_ipv4()" or
       "is_private_ipv6()". The private networks are a subset of all the special case networks.

   is_linklocal_ip($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv4 or IPv6 link-local unicast network.

   is_loopback_ip($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address is the IPv4 or IPv6 loopback address.

   is_multicast_ip($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv4 or IPv6 multicast network.

   is_private_ip($ip)
       This subroutine checks whether the address belongs to the IPv4 or IPv6 private network.

OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
       This module can also be used as a class. You can call "Data::Validate::IP->new()" to get an object and then call any of the validation subroutines as methods on that object. This is somewhat
       pointless since the object will never contain any state but this interface is kept for backwards compatibility.
