NAME
       varnetload - tool to create reproducible network traffic

SYNOPSIS
       varnetload [-d delay] [-t time to run] [-u url]

DESCRIPTION
       varnetload is a simple python script to create reproducible sustained network traffic.

       In order to use it effectively, you need to have an HTTP server present in your local LAN where you can put files. Upload a large HTML (or any other kind of file) to the HTTP server. Use the -u option
       of the script to point to that URL. Play with the delay option to vary the load put on your network.

       delay  Sets delay between individual downloads in milliseconds. Default value is 1000. But you my find values range from 0 to 500 more useful.

       time to run
              Sets total run time in seconds. Default value is 60.

       url    Sets downloaded resource. Default is http://myhost.mydomain/index.html.
