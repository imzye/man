DESCRIPTION
       This binary is used to send all kinds of mail to  mlmmj  managed  mail‐
       inglists, but can potentially be used standalone for sending mails.

       The  only  option  that  is not self explanatory is the -l list control
       option:

              '1' means 'send a single mail'

              This is used together with -F and -T to send  one  mail  to  one
              recipient.

              '2' means 'mail to moderators'

              Used for sending mails to the moderators of a list.

              '3' means 'resend failed list mail'

              '4' means 'send to file with recipients'

              '5' means 'bounceprobe'

              '6' means 'single listmail to single recipient'

BUGS
       This manual page is very scarce documentation of the mlmmj-send binary.
       The reason for this is that it's really not supposed to be used by  any
       human, but only supposed to be invoked from other mlmmj binaries. So in
       case more documentation is needed, please read the source.
