NAME
       pilot-install-datebook - Installs one or more new datebook entries onto your Palm handheld.

SECTION
       pilot-link: Userland conduits

SYNOPSIS
        pilot-install-datebook [-p|--port <port>] [--version] [-?|--help] [-q|--quiet] [--usage] [-r|--read  file]

DESCRIPTION
        pilot-install-datebook allows the user to create one or more datebook entries from one or more source files.

       The format of the source file contains one datebook entry per line, containing four tab separated fields. The fields are start date/time, end date/time, alarm settings, and the description of datebook
       entry. This program doesn't yet support repeated entries. The date and time must be in format understood by parsedate.y. At the very least, the following two formats are understood:

       August 11, 1997 0800 GMT+300

       1997/08/11 08:22:33 GMT+300

       If either one of the date and time fields is empty, the entry is installed without time. If the alarm field is empty, the entry is installed without setting any alarms. The  alarm  field  can  contain
       numbers followed by "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), or "d" (days).

OPTIONS

BUGS
   Known Bugs
       If no timezone is given, pilot-install-datebook will assume the time is in GMT and it will convert it to localtime. If you don't want to create timezone entries for all begin and end times, set the TZ
       environment variable to GMT before running this program.
