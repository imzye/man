NAME
       cxl_new - Create a new library context object that acts as a handle for all library operations

SYNOPSIS
           #include <cxl/libcxl.h>

           int cxl_new(struct cxl_ctx **ctx);

DESCRIPTION
       Instantiates a new library context, and stores an opaque pointer in ctx. The context is freed by linklibcxl:cxl_unref[3], i.e. cxl_new(3) implies an internal linklibcxl:cxl_ref[3].

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, and a negative errno on failure. Possible error codes are:

       •   -ENOMEM

       •   -ENXIO

EXAMPLE
       See example usage in test/libcxl.c
