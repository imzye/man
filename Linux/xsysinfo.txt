NAME
       xsysinfo - Display Linux kernel parameters in graphical form

SYNOPSIS
       xsysinfo [-help] [-update n] [-[no]title] [-[no]labels] [-[no]loadavg] [-[no]load] [-[no]mem] [-[no]swap] [-[no]smp]

DESCRIPTION
       Xsysinfo  is an X application to display some Linux kernel parameters in graphical form. It is like a mix of top, free and xload with the difference that the values are shown in form of a horizon‐
       tal bar. The displayed values are: CPU load average, CPU load, memory and swap sizes (details see below).

OPTIONS
       -update n
              Set update rate to n milli-seconds

       -title Show title string

       -notitle
              Don't show title string

       -labels
              Show gauge labels

       -nolabels
              Don't show gauge labels

       -loadavg
              Show CPU load average value

       -noloadavg
              Don't show CPU load average value

       -load  Show CPU load value

       -noload
              Don't show CPU load value

       -smp   Show separate SMP loads

       -nosmp Don't show separate SMP loads.

       -mem   Show memory info

       -nomem Don't show memory info

       -swap  Show swap info

       -noswap
              Don't show swap info

       -help  Display options

DISPLAY
       Xsysinfo display the following values:

       CPU load average
              CPU load average between 0.000-8.000. The gauge's bar is subdivided into segments, where one segment represents a load value of 1.0. The bar's full length is automatically scaled, depending
              on the displayed value.

       CPU load
              percentage CPU load time to CPU idle time subdivided in three segments: user load, system load and nice load. On an SMP system the -smp option replaces the single total load  meter  with  a
              separate meter for each processor.

       Memory The  memory  gauge's bar is subdivided into two segments with the amount of physical memory, which is used by processes on the left and physical memory used for the page and buffer cache on
              the right. The length of the whole bar, which is the sum of these two values, shows the amount of physical memory currently used by the system.

       Swap   The percentage of swap space used by the system to total amount of swap space.
