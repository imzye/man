NAME
       slowmoUI - create slow-motion videos from your footage

SYNOPSIS
       slowmoUI

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the slowmoUI commands.

       slowmoUI  is  a  program  that creates slow-motion videos from your footage.  It does not simply make your videos play at 0.01 x speed. You can smoothly slow
       down and speed up your footage, optionally with motion blur.

       How does slow motion work? slowmoVideo tries to find out where pixels move in the video (this information is called Optical Flow), and then uses this  infor‐
       mation to calculate the additional frames.

       Videos  in  any format supported by ffmpeg can be loaded. Image sequences can also be loaded, so, if you did a timelapse with too few frames, slowmoVideo may
       help as well.  slowmoVideo does not work with a constant slowdown factor but with curves that allow arbitrary time accelereation/deceleration/reversal.   Mo‐
       tion blur can be added, as much as you want.
