NAME
       lrs-setupnash2 - convert payoff matrices into nash input

SYNOPSIS
       lrs-setupnash2 INPUT OUTPUT1 OUTPUT2

DESCRIPTION
       This program reads an input file containing two payoff matrices in this form:
              m n
              A matrix        (m by n rationals )
              B matrix        (m by n rationals )

       It outputs two files that are used as input to lrsnash(1).  This program builds the polytope form: Bx<=1, x>=0; Ay<=1, y>=0.  The matrices should have positive entries.

EXIT STATUS
       One for success, zero if an error is encountered.
