NAME
       sup-dump - dumps message state from Sup index

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

              Print version and exit

       -h, --help
              Show help message

EXAMPLES
       Dump message state and store in file

              sup-dump > filename

       Dump message state and compress output to store in file

              sup-dump | bzip2 > filename.bz2
