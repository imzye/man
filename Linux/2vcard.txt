NAME
       2vcard - convert addressbooks to VCARD format

SYNOPSIS
       2vcard [ -F | -f | -h | -v  ] [ -i FILE ] [ -o FILE ]

DESCRIPTION
       2vcard  is  a  little perl script to convert an addressbook to the popular VCARD file format.  Currently, 2vcard can convert addressbooks and alias files from the following formats: abook, eudora,
       juno, ldif, mutt, mh and pine.

       The VCARD format is used by gnomecard, for example, which, in turn is used by the balsa email client.

USAGE
       Per default, 2vcard reads from stdin and writes to stdout. Alternatively, the input- and output-files can be specified as command-line options.

OPTIONS
       A summary of the options supported by 2vcard is included below.

       -F     print a list of the currently supported formats

       -f format
              convert from format [ default: mutt ]

       -h     Show summary of options and exit.

       -i FILE
              Read input from FILE.

       -o FILE
              Write output to FILE.

       -v     Show version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
       In a pipe:
              tr '^M' '\n' < EudoraNicknames | 2vcard -f eudora > out

       Alone: 2vcard -i ~/.aliases -o ~/.addbook.grcd
