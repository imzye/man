DESCRIPTION
       Waypipe is a proxy for Wayland clients, with the aim of supporting behavior like ssh -X.

       Prefixing  an ssh ... command to become waypipe ssh ... will automatically run waypipe both locally and remotely, and modify the ssh command to set up forwarding between the two instances of wayp‐
       ipe. The remote instance will act like a Wayland compositor, letting Wayland applications that are run remotely be displayed locally.

       When run as waypipe client, it will open a socket (by default at /tmp/waypipe-client.sock) and will connect to the local Wayland compositor and forward all Wayland applications which  were  linked
       to it over the socket by a matching waypipe server instance.

       When  run as waypipe server, it will run the command that follows in its command line invocation, set up its own Wayland compositor socket, and try to connect to its matching waypipe client socket
       (by default /tmp/waypipe-server.sock) and try to forward all the Wayland clients that connect to fake compositor socket to the matching waypipe client.

       The waypipe recon mode is used to reconnect a waypipe server instance which has had a control pipe (option --control) set. The new socket path should indicate a Unix socket whose  connections  are
       forwarded to the waypipe client that the waypipe server was initially connected to.

       The waypipe bench mode can be used to estimate, given a specific connection bandwidth in MB/sec, which compression options produce the lowest latency. It tests two synthetic images, one made to be
       roughly as compressible as images containing text, and one made to be roughly as compressible as images containing pictures.

OPTIONS
       -c C, --compress C
           Select  the  compression method applied to data transfers. Options are none (for high-bandwidth networks), lz4 (intermediate), zstd (slow connection). The default compression is lz4.† The com‐
           pression level can be chosen by appending = followed by a number. For example, if C is zstd=7, waypipe will use level 7 Zstd compression.

           † Unless waypipe is built without LZ4 support, in which case the default compression will be none.

       -d, --debug
           Print debug log messages.

       -h, --help
           Show help message and quit.

       -n, --no-gpu
           Block protocols like wayland-drm and linux-dmabuf which require access to e.g. render nodes.

       -o, --oneshot
           Only permit a single connection, and exit when it is closed.

       -s S, --socket S
           Use S as the path for the Unix socket. The default socket path for server mode is /tmp/waypipe-server.sock; for client mode, it is /tmp/waypipe-client.sock; and in ssh mode, S gives the prefix
           used by both the client and the server for their socket paths. The default prefix in ssh mode is /tmp/waypipe.

           When vsock is enabled use S to specify a CID and a port number.

       --version
           Briefly describe Waypipe's version and the features it was built with, then quit. Possible features: LZ4 compression support, ZSTD compression support, ability to transfer DMABUFs, video  com‐
           pression support, VAAPI hardware video de/encoding support.

       --allow-tiled
           By  default,  waypipe  filters  out all advertised DMABUF formats which have format layout modifiers, as CPU access to these formats may be very slow. Setting this flag disables the filtering.
           Since tiled images often permit faster GPU operations, most OpenGL applications will select tiling modifiers when they are available.

       --control C
           For server or ssh mode, provide the path to the "control pipe" that will be created the the server. Writing (with waypipe recon C T, or 'echo -n T > C') a new socket path  to  this  pipe  will
           make  the  server instance replace all running connections with connections to the new Unix socket. The new socket should ultimately forward data to the same waypipe client that the server was
           connected to before.

       --display D
           For server or ssh mode, provide WAYLAND_DISPLAY and let waypipe configure its Wayland display socket to have a matching path. (If D is not an absolute path, the socket will be created  in  the
           folder given by the environment variable XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.)

       --drm-node R
           Specify the path R to the drm device that this instance of waypipe should use and (in server mode) notify connecting applications about.

       --remote-node R
           In ssh mode, specify the path R to the drm device that the remote instance of waypipe (running in server mode) should use.

       --remote-bin R
           In ssh mode, specify the path R to the waypipe binary on the remote computer, or its name if it is available in PATH. It defaults to waypipe if this option isn’t passed.

       --login-shell
           Only for server mode; if no command is being run, open a login shell.

       --threads T
           Set  the  number  of total threads (including the main thread) which a waypipe instance will create. These threads will be used to parallelize compression operations. This flag is passed on to
           waypipe server when given to waypipe ssh. The flag also controls the thread count for waypipe bench. The default behavior (choosable by setting T to 0) is to use half as many  threads  as  the
           computer has hardware threads available.

       --title-prefix P
           Prepend P to any window titles specified using the XDG shell protocol. In ssh mode, the prefix is applied only on the client side.

       --unlink-socket
           Only for server mode; on shutdown, unlink the Unix socket that waypipe connects to.

       --video[=V]
           Compress  specific  DMABUF  formats  using  a lossy video codec. Opaque, 10-bit, and multiplanar formats, among others, are not supported. V is a comma separated list of options to control the
           video encoding. Using the --video flag without setting any options is equivalent to using the default setting of: --video=sw,bpf=120000,h264. Later options supersede earlier ones.

           sw
               Use software encoding and decoding.

           hw
               Use hardware (VAAPI) encoding and decoding, if available. This can be finicky and may only work with specific window buffer formats and sizes.

           h264
               Use H.264 encoded video.

           vp9
               Use VP9 encoded video.

           bpf=B
               Set the target bit rate of the video encoder, in units of bits per frame. B can  be  written  as  an  integer  or  with  exponential  notation;  thus  --video=bpf=7.5e5  is  equivalent  to
               --video=bpf=750000.

       --hwvideo
           Deprecated option, equivalent to --video=hw .

       --vsock
           Use  vsock instead of unix sockets. This is used when waypipe is running in virtual machines. With this option enabled specify a CID and a port number in S. CID is only used in the server mode
           and can be omitted when connecting from a guest virtual machine to host.

       --secctx S
           Enable the Wayland security context protocol (client or ssh modes). Specify an application ID S that will be attached to the security context.

EXAMPLE
       The following waypipe ssh subcommand will attempt to run weston-flower on the server exserv, displaying the result on the local system.

                waypipe ssh user@exserv weston-flower

       One can obtain similar behavior by explicitly running waypipe and ssh:

                waypipe --socket /tmp/socket-client client  &
                ssh -R /tmp/socket-server:/tmp/socket-client user@exserv \
                     waypipe --socket /tmp/socket-server server -- weston-flower
                kill %1

       Waypipe may be run locally without an SSH connection by specifying matching socket paths. For example:

                waypipe --socket /tmp/waypipe.sock client &
                waypipe --socket /tmp/waypipe.sock server weston-simple-dmabuf-egl
                kill %1
                rm /tmp/waypipe.sock

       Using transports other than SSH is a bit more complicated. A recipe with ncat to connect to remote from computer local:

               $ waypipe --socket /tmp/waypipe-remote.sock client &
               $ ncat --ssl -lk 12345 --sh-exec 'ncat -U /tmp/waypipe-remote.sock' &
               $ ssh user@remote

               > ncat -lkU /tmp/waypipe-local.sock --sh-exec 'ncat --ssl local 12345' &
               > waypipe --display wayland-local \
                           --socket /tmp/waypipe-local.sock server -- sleep inf &
               > WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-local application

       Given a certificate file, socat can also provide an encrypted connection (remove 'verify=0' to check certificates):

               $ waypipe --socket /tmp/waypipe-remote.sock client &
               $ socat openssl-listen:12345,reuseaddr,cert=certificate.pem,verify=0,fork \
                   unix-connect:/tmp/waypipe-remote.sock
               $ ssh user@remote

               > socat unix-listen:/tmp/waypipe-local.sock,reuseaddr,fork \
                   openssl-connect:local:12345,verify=0 &
               > waypipe --socket /tmp/waypipe-local.sock server -- application

       Many applications require specific environment variables to use Wayland instead of X11. If ssh isn't configured to support loading ~/.ssh/environment, or to allow specific variables to be set with
       AcceptEnv/SetEnv, one can run waypipe ssh without a command (and thereby open a login shell), or use env to set the needed variables each time:

                 waypipe ssh user@host env XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland dolphin

       In some cases, one may wish to set environment variables for the waypipe server process itself; the above trick with env will not do this, because the env  process  will  be  a  child  of  waypipe
       server,  not  the other way around. Instead, one can use ~/.ssh/environment, or use the --remote-bin option to change the remote Waypipe instance to a shell script that sets the environment before
       running the actual waypipe program.

       Waypipe has support for reconnecting a waypipe client and a waypipe server instance when whatever was used to transfer data between their sockets fails. For this to work,  waypipe  must  still  be
       running  on  both sides of the connection. As the waypipe ssh wrapper will automatically close both the waypipe client and the waypipe server when the connection fails, the client and server modes
       must be run seprately. For example, to persistently forward applications running on server rserv to a local Wayland compositor running on lserv, one would first set up a waypipe client instance on
       lserv,

                waypipe -s /tmp/waypipe.sock client &

       and on server rserv, establish socket forwarding and run the server

                ssh -fN -L /tmp/waypipe-lserv.sock:/tmp/waypipe.sock user@lserv
                waypipe -s /tmp/waypipe-lserv.sock --control /tmp/ctrl-lserv.pipe \
                     --display wayland-lserv server -- sleep inf &

       then set WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-lserv and run the desired applications. When the ssh forwarding breaks, on rserv, reconnect with

                ssh -fN -L /tmp/waypipe-lserv-2.sock:/tmp/waypipe.sock user@lserv
                waypipe recon /tmp/ctrl-lserv.pipe /tmp/waypipe-lserv-2.sock

   Running waypipe in virtual machines
       When running waypipe in virtual machines on the same host it is possible to use vsock for efficient inter-vm communication. The following scenarios are supported:

       •   Running applications on host from guest.

                host> waypipe --vsock -s 1234 client
                guest> waypipe --vsock -s 1234 server weston-terminal

       •   Running applications in a guest virtual machine from host.

                guest> waypipe --vsock -s 1234 client
                host> waypipe --vsock -s 3:1234 server weston-terminal

       In this example waypipe server connects to a virtual machine with CID 3 on port 1234.

       •   Running applications in a guest virtual machine from other guest virtual machines. When running both client and server in virtual machines it is possble to enable the VMADDR_FLAG_TO_HOST  flag
           for sibling communication by prefixing the CID with an s:

                guest> waypipe --vsock -s 1234 client
                guest> waypipe --vsock -s s3:1234 server weston-terminal

       In this case all packets will be routed to host where they can be forwarded to another virtual machine with a vhost-device-vsock device or some other utility.

ENVIRONMENT
       When running as a server, by default WAYLAND_DISPLAY will be set for the invoked process.

       If  the  --oneshot  flag  is set, waypipe will instead set WAYLAND_SOCKET and inherit an already connected socketpair file descriptor to the invoked (child) process. Some programs open and close a
       Wayland connection repeatedly as part of their initialization, and will not work correctly with this flag.

EXIT STATUS
       waypipe ssh will exit with the exit status code from the remote command, or with return code 1 if there has been an error.

SECURITY
       Waypipe does not provide any strong security guarantees, and connecting to untrusted servers is not recommended. It does not filter which Wayland protocols the compositor makes  available  to  the
       client  (with  a  few  exceptions for protocols that require file descriptors which Waypipe cannot yet handle). For example, if a Wayland compositor gives all its clients access to a screenshot or
       lock-screen protocol, then proxied clients run under Waypipe can also make screenshots or lock the screen.

       In general, applications are not well tested against malicious compositors, and compositors are not well tested against malicious clients. Waypipe can connect the two, and may blindly forward  de‐
       nial-of-service and other attacks.

       Waypipe itself is written in C and links to compression, graphics, and video libraries; both it and these libraries may have security bugs. Some risk can be avoided by building Waypipe with DMABUF
       support turned off, or running Waypipe with the --no-gpu flag so that it does not expose graphics libraries.

       waypipe ssh has no explicit protections against timing attacks; an observer to the resulting network traffic may, by studying the size and timing of packets, learn information about the user's in‐
       teraction with a Wayland client proxied through waypipe ssh. For example: a lack of activity suggests the user is not currently using the application, while an intermittant stream of messages from
       the compositor to the client may indicate mouse movement (or maybe something else: the contents of the messages are protected by ssh.)

       The memory used by Waypipe processes may, at a given time, include Wayland messages encoding user input, and the contents of current and recent frames drawn for application windows. Swap should be
       encrypted to prevent this data from being leaked to disk.

BUGS
       File bug reports at: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe/

       Some  programs (gnome-terminal, firefox, kate, among others) have special mechanisms to ensure that only one process is running at a time. Starting those programs under Waypipe while they are run‐
       ning under a different Wayland compositor may silently open a window or tab in the original instance of the program. Such programs may have a command line argument to create a new instance.
