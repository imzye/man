CSV(1)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               CSV(1)

NAME
       csv - process CSV files from the command line

SYNOPSIS
         # On the command line:

         csv 1 2 -1 < report.csv

         # Reads the first two fields, as well as the last one, from "report.csv".
         # Data is cleaned up and emitted as CSV.

         csv --fields Revenue,Q1,Q2 < report.csv   # or "-f" for short

         # First line of the input (from file "report.csv") is considered as
         # header line; the fields are emitted in the order "Revenue", "Q1",
         # and "Q2". Data is cleaned up and emitted as CSV.

         csv --input report.csv --to_tsv

         # Converts the whole report to TSV (tab-separated values).

DESCRIPTION
       CSV (comma-separated value) files are the lowest common denominator of
       structured data interchange formats. For such a humble file format, it
       is pretty difficult to get right: embedded quote marks and linebreaks,
       slipshod delimiters, and no One True Validity Test make CSV data found
       in the wild hard to parse correctly. Text::CSV_XS provides flexible and
       performant access to CSV files from Perl, but is cumbersome to use in
       one-liners and the command line.

       csv is intended to make commandline processing of CSV files as easy as
       plain text is meant to be on Unix. Internally, it holds two Text::CSV
       objects (for input and for output), which have reasonable defaults but
       which you can reconfigure to suit your needs. Then you can extract just
       the fields you want, change the delimiter, clean up the data etc.

       In the simplest usage, csv filters stdio and takes a list of integers.
       These are 1-based column numbers to select from the input CSV stream.
       Negative numbers are counted from the line end. Without any column
       list, csv selects all columns (this is still useful to normalize
       quoting style etc.).

   Command line options
       The following options are passed to Text::CSV. When preceded by the
       prefix "output_", the destination is affected. Otherwise these options
       affect both input and output.

       --quote_char
       --escape_char
       --sep_char
       --eol
       --always_quote
       --binary
       --keep_meta_info
       --allow_loose_quotes
       --allow_loose_escapes
       --allow_whitespace
       --verbatim

       NOTE: binary is set to 1 by default in csv. The other options have
       their Text::CSV defaults.

       The following additional options are available:

       --input, -i
       --output, -o
           Filenames for input and output. "-" means stdio. Useful to trigger
           TSV mode ("--from_tsv" and "--to_tsv").

       --columns, -c
           Column numbers may be specified using this option.

       --fields, -f
           When this option is specified, the first line of the input file is
           considered as a header line. This option takes a comma-separated
           list of column-names from the first line.

           For convenience, this option also accepts a comma-separated list of
           column numbers as well. Multiple --fields options are allowed, and
           both column names and numbers can be mixed together.

       --from_tsv, --from-tsv
       --to_tsv, --to-tsv
           Use tabs instead of commas as the delimiter. When csv has the input
           or output filenames available, this is inferred when they end with
           ".tsv".  To disable this dwimmery, you may say "--to_tsv=0" and
           "--from_tsv=0".
