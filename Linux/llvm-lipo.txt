NAME
       llvm-lipo - LLVM tool for manipulating universal binaries

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-lipo [filenames...] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-lipo can create universal binaries from Mach-O files, extract reg‐
       ular object files from universal  binaries,  and  display  architecture
       information about both universal and regular files.

COMMANDS
       llvm-lipo supports the following mutually exclusive commands:

       -help, -h
              Display usage information and exit.

       -version
              Display the version of this program.

       -verify_arch <architecture 1> [<architecture 2> ...]
              Take  a single input file and verify the specified architectures
              are present in the file.  If so then exit with  a  status  of  0
              else exit with a status of 1.

       -archs Take  a  single input file and display the architectures present
              in the file.  Each architecture is separated by a single  white‐
              space.      Unknown     architectures     are    displayed    as
              unknown(CPUtype,CPUsubtype).

       -info  Take at least one input file and  display  the  descriptions  of
              each  file.  The descriptions include the filename and architec‐
              ture types separated  by  whitespace.   Universal  binaries  are
              grouped  together  first, followed by thin files.  Architectures
              in the fat file: <filename> are: <architectures>  Non-fat  file:
              <filename> is architecture: <architecture>

       -thin  Take a single universal binary input file and the thin flag fol‐
              lowed by an architecture type.  Require the output  flag  to  be
              specified,  and  output a thin binary of the specified architec‐
              ture.

       -create
              Take at least one input file and require the output flag  to  be
              specified.  Output a universal binary combining the input files.

       -replace
              Take a single universal binary input file and require the output
              flag to be specified.  The replace flag is followed by an archi‐
              tecture  type, and a thin input file.  Output a universal binary
              with the specified architecture slice in  the  universal  binary
              input replaced with the contents of the thin input file.

       -segalign
              Additional  flag  that can be specified with create and replace.
              The segalign flag is followed by an architecture  type,  and  an
              alignment.   The  alignment  is  a  hexadecimal number that is a
              power of 2.  Output a file in which the slice with the specified
              architecture has the specified alignment.
