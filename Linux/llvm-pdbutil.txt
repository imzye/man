SYNOPSIS
       llvm-pdbutil [subcommand] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Display  types, symbols, CodeView records, and other information from a
       PDB file, as well as manipulate and create PDB files.  llvm-pdbutil  is
       normally  used  by FileCheck-based tests to test LLVM's PDB reading and
       writing functionality, but can also be used for general PDB file inves‐
       tigation and forensics, or as a replacement for cvdump.

SUBCOMMANDS
       llvm-pdbutil  is  separated into several subcommands each tailored to a
       different purpose.  A brief summary of each command follows, with  more
       detail in the sections that follow.

          · pretty  -  Dump symbol and type information in a format that tries
            to look as much like the original source code as possible.

          · dump - Dump low level types and  structures  from  the  PDB  file,
            including CodeView records, hash tables, PDB streams, etc.

          · bytes  -  Dump  data  from the PDB file's streams, records, types,
            symbols, etc as raw bytes.

          · yaml2pdb - Given a yaml description of a PDB file, produce a valid
            PDB file that matches that description.

          · pdb2yaml  -  For  a  given PDB file, produce a YAML description of
            some or all of the file in a  way  that  the  PDB  can  be  recon‐
            structed.

          · merge  - Given two PDBs, produce a third PDB that is the result of
            merging the two input PDBs.

   pretty
       IMPORTANT:
          The pretty subcommand is built on the Windows DIA SDK, and  as  such
          is not supported on non-Windows platforms.

       USAGE: llvm-pdbutil pretty [options] <input PDB file>

   Summary
       The pretty subcommand displays a very high level representation of your
       program's debug info.  Since it is built on the Windows DIA  SDK  which
       is the standard API that Windows tools and debuggers query debug infor‐
       mation, it presents a more authoritative view  of  how  a  debugger  is
       going  to  interpret  your debug information than a mode which displays
       low-level CodeView records.

   Options
   Filtering and Sorting Options
       NOTE:
          exclude filters take priority over include filters.  So if a  filter
          matches both an include and an exclude rule, then it is excluded.

       -exclude-compilands=<string>
              When dumping compilands, compiland source-file contributions, or
              per-compiland symbols, this  option  instructs  llvm-pdbutil  to
              omit any compilands that match the specified regular expression.

       -exclude-symbols=<string>
              When  dumping  global,  public,  or  per-compiland symbols, this
              option instructs llvm-pdbutil to omit any symbols that match the
              specified regular expression.

       -exclude-types=<string>
              When  dumping  types, this option instructs llvm-pdbutil to omit
              any types that match the specified regular expression.

       -include-compilands=<string>
              When dumping compilands, compiland source-file contributions, or
              per-compiland  symbols,  limit  the initial search to only those
              compilands that match the specified regular expression.

       -include-symbols=<string>
              When dumping global, public, or per-compiland symbols, limit the
              initial  search  to  only those symbols that match the specified
              regular expression.

       -include-types=<string>
              When dumping types, limit the initial search to only those types
              that match the specified regular expression.

       -min-class-padding=<uint>
              Only  display  types  that have at least the specified amount of
              alignment padding, accounting for padding in  base  classes  and
              aggregate field members.

       -min-class-padding-imm=<uint>
              Only  display  types  that have at least the specified amount of
              alignment padding, ignoring padding in base classes  and  aggre‐
              gate field members.

       -min-type-size=<uint>
              Only display types T where sizeof(T) is greater than or equal to
              the specified amount.

              Don't show compiler generated types and symbols

       -no-enum-definitions
              When dumping an enum, don't show the full enum (e.g.  the  indi‐
              vidual enumerator values).

   dump
       USAGE: llvm-pdbutil dump [options] <input PDB file>

   Summary
       The  dump subcommand displays low level information about the structure
       of a PDB file.  It is used heavily by  LLVM's  testing  infrastructure,
       but  can  also  be used for PDB forensics.  It serves a role similar to
       that of Microsoft's cvdump tool.

       NOTE:
          The dump subcommand exposes internal details of the file format.  As
          such,  the  reader  should  be familiar with /PDB/index before using
          this command.

   Options
   MSF Container Options
       -streams
              dump a summary of all of the streams in the PDB file.

       -stream-blocks
              In conjunction with -streams,  add  information  to  the  output
              about what blocks the specified stream occupies.

       -summary
              Dump MSF and PDB header information.

   Module & File Options
       -modi=<uint>
              For  all  options  that dump information from each module/compi‐
              land, limit to the specified module.

       -files Dump the source files that contribute to each displayed module.

       -il    Dump inlinee  line  information  (DEBUG_S_INLINEELINES  CodeView
              subsection)

       -l     Dump line information (DEBUG_S_LINES CodeView subsection)

       -modules
              Dump compiland information

       -xme   Dump  cross  module  exports (DEBUG_S_CROSSSCOPEEXPORTS CodeView
              subsection)

       -xmi   Dump cross module  imports  (DEBUG_S_CROSSSCOPEIMPORTS  CodeView
              subsection)

   Symbol Options
       -globals
              dump global symbol records

       -global-extras
              dump  additional  information  about  the  globals, such as hash
              buckets and hash values.

       -publics
              dump public symbol records

       -public-extras
              dump additional information about  the  publics,  such  as  hash
              buckets and hash values.

       -symbols
              dump symbols (functions, variables, etc) for each module dumped.

       -sym-data
              For  each  symbol  record  dumped  as  a  result of the -symbols
              option, display the full bytes of the record in binary as well.

   Type Record Options
       -types Dump CodeView type records from TPI stream

       -type-extras
              Dump additional information from the TPI stream, such as  hashes
              and the type index offsets array.

       -type-data
              For  each  type  record  dumped,  display  the full bytes of the
              record in binary as well.

       -type-index=<uint>
              Only dump types with the specified type index.

       -ids   Dump CodeView type records from IPI stream.

       -id-extras
              Dump additional information from the IPI stream, such as  hashes
              and the type index offsets array.

       -id-data
              For  each ID record dumped, display the full bytes of the record
              in binary as well.

       -id-index=<uint>
              only dump ID records with the specified hexadecimal type index.

       -dependents
              When used in conjunction with -type-index  or  -id-index,  dumps
              the  entire  dependency graph for the specified index instead of
              just the single record with the specified index.   For  example,
              if  type  index 0x4000 is a function whose return type has index
              0x3000, and you specify -dependents=0x4000, then this would dump
              both records (as well as any other dependents in the tree).

   Miscellaneous Options
       -all   Implies most other options.

       -section-contribs
              Dump section contributions.

       -section-headers
              Dump image section headers.

       -section-map
              Dump section map.

       -string-table
              Dump PDB string table.

   bytes
       USAGE: llvm-pdbutil bytes [options] <input PDB file>

   Summary
       Like  the  dump  subcommand,  the  bytes  subcommand displays low level
       information about the structure of a PDB file, but it is used for  even
       deeper  forensics.   The bytes subcommand finds various structures in a
       PDB file based on the command line options specified, and dumps them in
       hex.  Someone working on support for emitting PDBs would use this heav‐
       ily, for example, to compare one PDB  against  another  PDB  to  ensure
       byte-for-byte  compatibility.   It  is not enough to simply compare the
       bytes of an entire file, or an entire  stream  because  it's  perfectly
       fine for the same structure to exist at different locations in two dif‐
       ferent PDBs, and "finding" the structure is half the battle.

   Options
   MSF File Options
       -block-range=<start[-end]>
              Dump binary data from specified range of MSF file blocks.

       -byte-range=<start[-end]>
              Dump binary data from specified range of bytes in the file.

       -fpm   Dump the MSF free page map.

       -stream-data=<string>
              Dump  binary  data  from  the  specified  streams.   Format   is
              SN[:Start][@Size].   For  example,  -stream-data=7:3@12 dumps 12
              bytes from stream 7, starting at offset 3 in the stream.

   PDB Stream Options
       -name-map
              Dump bytes of PDB Name Map

   DBI Stream Options
       -ec    Dump the edit and continue map substream of the DBI stream.

       -files Dump the file info substream of the DBI stream.

       -modi  Dump the modi substream of the DBI stream.

       -sc    Dump section contributions substream of the DBI stream.

       -sm    Dump the section map from the DBI stream.

   Module Options
       -mod=<uint>
              Limit all options in  this  category  to  the  specified  module
              index.   By  default,  options  in this category will dump bytes
              from all modules.

       -chunks
              Dump the bytes of each module's C13 debug subsection.

       -split-chunks
              When specified with -chunks, split the C13 debug subsection into
              a  separate  chunk for each subsection type, and dump them sepa‐
              rately.

       -syms  Dump the symbol record substream from each module.

   Type Record Options
       -id=<uint>
              Dump the record from the IPI stream with the given type index.

       -type=<uint>
              Dump the record from the TPI stream with the given type index.

   pdb2yaml
       USAGE: llvm-pdbutil pdb2yaml [options] <input PDB file>

   Summary
   Options
   yaml2pdb
       USAGE: llvm-pdbutil yaml2pdb [options] <input YAML file>

   Summary
       Generate a PDB file from a YAML description.  The YAML  syntax  is  not
       described  here.   Instead,  use  llvm-pdbutil pdb2yaml and examine the
       output for an example starting point.

   Options
       -pdb=<file-name>

       Write the resulting PDB to the specified file.

   merge
       USAGE: llvm-pdbutil merge [options] <input PDB file 1> <input PDB  file
       2>

   Summary
       Merge two PDB files into a single file.

   Options
