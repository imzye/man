NAME
       exe_update - Modify windows executable files

SYNOPSIS
       exe_update [ --gui | --console ] [ --icon iconfile ]
                     [ --manifest manifestfile ]
                     [ --info key=value;... ] exefile

DESCRIPTION
       This program rewrites PE headers in a Windows executable file.  It can change whether the executable runs with a console window, as well as setting the icons, manifest and version information
       associated with it.  In general, a PE file must have an existing resource section or you cannot add icons, manifests or version info. However, on Win32 platforms a new resource section will be
       created if none exists.

OPTIONS
       Options are available in a short form and a long form.  For example, the three lines below are all equivalent:

           % exe_update -i new.ico input.exe
           % exe_update --icon new.ico input.exe
           % exe_update --icon=new.ico input.exe

       -c, --console
           Set the executable to always display a console window.

       -g, --gui
           Set the executable so it does not have a console window.

       -i, --icon=FILE
           Specify an icon file (in .ico, .exe or .dll format) for the executable.

       -m, --manifest=FILE
           Specify a manifest file in .xml format for the executable.

       -N, --info=KEY=VAL
           Attach version information for the executable.  The name/value pair is joined by "=".  You may specify "-N" multiple times, or use ";" to link several pairs.

           These special "KEY" names are recognized:

               Comments        CompanyName     FileDescription FileVersion
               InternalName    LegalCopyright  LegalTrademarks OriginalFilename
               ProductName     ProductVersion

       -A, --manifestargs=KEY=VAL
           As  an  alternative  to  specifying a manifest file, specify manifest attributes.  The name/value pair is joined by "=".  You may specify "-A" multiple times, or use ";" to link several pairs.
           This option may be preferable to using a manifest file as these attributes will be combined with any existing manifest that may be in the executable.

           These special "KEY" names are recognized:

               ExecutionLevel  UIAccess     ExecName   Description
               CommonControls  Version

           The CommonControls key is a simple boolean value to indicate that the Common Controls Version 6.0.0.0 dependency should be added to the manifest.

           e.g

           --manifestargs="ExecutionLevel=requireAdministrator;ExecName=My.App;CommonControls=1" --manifestargs="Version=1.3.6.7895;UIAccess=false"
