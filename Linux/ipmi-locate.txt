NAME
       IPMI - IPMI probing utility

SYNOPSIS
       ipmi-locate [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       Ipmi-locate  probes  and  displays  information  about  a BMC device, such as device addresses or IPMI version support.  Ipmi-locate is sometimes used to determine if IPMI can be found on your system.
       Users are cautioned though, the failure to discover IPMI via Ipmi-locate is not sufficient to disprove that IPMI exists on your system. Your system may not  publish  such  information  or  may  expect
       clients to communicate at default locations.
