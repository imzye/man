NAME
       ogminfo - Print information about streams in OGG/OGM files

SYNOPSIS
       ogminfo [options] inname

DESCRIPTION
       This program lists all streams contained in an OGM including information about the codecs used.

       inname Use 'inname' as the source.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose and show each OGG packet. See the section 'VERBOSITY LEVELS' for details.

       -s, --summary
              Will  print  a  short  summary  for each stream including the total size in bytes, the bitrate, the number of packets/frames and the length in seconds. This requires the parsing of the complete
              file.

       -h, --help
              Show usage information.

       -V, --version
              Show version information.

VERBOSITY LEVELS
       The -v option can be used to increase ogminfo's verbosity level and print more information about the current file.

       level 0
              will print only the streams it finds and their types.

       level 1
              will also print each stream's header and comment packets' contents.  These two modes will not process the whole file (as opposed to all other modes) if the comment packets are placed correctly.

       level 2
              will print a line for each OGG packet it encounters containing the stream the packet belongs to, the payload size, the packet's granulepos, the packet's number, its start time, its end time and
              several  flags.  The  flags  may include 'sync_ok' or 'OUT_OF_SYNC' which indicates whether the packet's placement in the file is correct according to its granulepos.  Other flags are 'IS_SYNC‐
              POINT' or 'EOS'.
              level 2 and above automatically imply --summary.

       level 3
              also prints a line whenever a new OGG page was read completely along with the page's exact position in the file it was read from.

       level 4
              will dump the complete stream_header structure found in the header packet for any non-Vorbis stream.

       The levels 3 and 4 are intended for debugging purposes only.

NOTES
       What works:

       *      OGM with Vorbis audio, 'normal' video (like DivX etc.), audio streams (PCM, MP3 etc.), text streams (subtitles).

       What not works:

       *      Headers created by older OggDS (DirectShow) filter versions are not supported (and probably never will be).
