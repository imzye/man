NAME
       lcp2_mlehash - generate a hash of a TXT MLE binary file and print it to STDOUT as text.

SYNOPSIS
       lcp2_mlehash [--create] [--cmdline cmdline] [--alg hashalg] [--help] [--verbose] mle-file

DESCRIPTION
       lcp2_mlehash  is used to generate a hash of the portion of an executable file that contains the Intel(R) TXT measured launched environment (MLE).  In the MLE binary file, the portion of the file to be
       used as the MLE is specified in the MLE header structure.  If verbose mode is not used, the output is suitable for use as the mle-file to the lcp2_crtpolelt command.

OPTIONS
       mle-file
              File name of the MLE binary.  If it is a gzip file then it will be un-ziped before hashing.

       --create
              Create a hash.

       --cmdline cmdline
              Specify quote-delimited command line. It is important to specify the command line that is used when launching the MLE or the hash will not match what is calculated by SINIT.

       --alg hashalg
              Specify the hash algorithm to use. Supported values are sha1, sha256, sha384 and sha512.

       --help Print out the help message.

       --verbose
              Verbose mode, display progress indications.

EXAMPLES
       lcp2_mlehash --create --cmdline "logging=memory,serial,vga" --alg sha1 /boot/tboot.gz > mle-hash
