NAME
       statcvs - CVS Repository statistic analysis tool, written in Java

SYNOPSIS
       cvs log > cvs-logfile.log

       statcvs [ options ] path/to/cvs-logfile.log path/to/checkout

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the statcvs command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       statcvs  is a program that retrieves information from a CVS repository and generates various tables and charts describing the project development, e.g. timeline for the lines of code, contribution
       of each developer etc.
       The current version of StatCvs generates a static suite of HTML documents containing tables and chart images.  StatCvs is opens source software, released under the terms oft the LGPL.
       StatCvs uses JFreeChart to generate charts.

       cvs-logfile.log
              path to the cvs logfile of the module.  Important note: statcvs will fail if the log file was not produced with cvs from within the checkout. It however does not matter if the file  is  not
              in the directory you're running statcvs from.

       path/to/checkout
              path to the directory of the checked out module
