NAME
       tca_correct - Calculate transverse chromatic aberration

SYNOPSIS
       tca_correct [options] inputfile

       <inputfile> is the base name of 4 image files:

       <inputfile>
           Colour file to compute TCA parameters

       red_<inputfile>
           Red channel of <inputfile>

       green_<inputfile>
           Green channel of <inputfile>

       blue_<inputfile>
           Blue channel of <inputfile>

       The channel images must be colour images with 3 identical channels.  If any of -R, -G, or -B is given, this file name is used instead of the derived name.

       Output: commandline arguments for fulla

DESCRIPTION
       Generates fulla command-line parameters for correction of transverse chromatic aberration (TCA) from sample photos. Ideal sample photos would have a lot of contrast over the entire image area, little
       saturated colour and no blown highlights.

OPTIONS
       -h  Display help

       -l  input file is PTO file instead of image

       -m method
           optimization method (0 normal, 1 newfit)

       -o optvars
           string of variables to optimize ("abcvde")

       -r  Reset values (this will zero a,b,c,d,e params and set v to 10) makes sense only with -l option

       -s <scale>
           Scale for corner detection

       -n <number>
           number of points per grid cell (default: 10)

       -g <number>
           divide image in <number>x<number> grid cells (default: 10)

       -t num
           Remove all control points with an error higher than num pixels (default: 1.5)

       -v  Verbose

       --save-into-database
           Saves the tca data into Hugin lens database

       -w filename
           write PTO file

       -R <r>
           Use this file as red channel

       -G <g>
           Use this file as green channel

       -B <b>
           Use this file as blue channel
