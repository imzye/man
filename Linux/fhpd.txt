NAME
       fhpd - a command line debugger

SYNOPSIS
       fhpd [options] {program arg ...  | pid... |
            core-file [ core-executable ]... }

DESCRIPTION
       fhpd is a command line oriented debugger implemented using the frysk(7)
       framework with a command set loosely based on the High Performance
       Debugger Forum's Version 1 standard.

   Standard Frysk Options
       -exe
           The full path of the executable to read.

       -noexe
           Do not attempt to read the corresponding executable when loading a
           core file.

       -sysroot directory
           The system root directory under which all executables, libraries,
           and source are located.

       -debug class=level...
           Set internal debug-tracing of the specified Java class to level
           (level can be NONE, INFO, WARNING, FINE, and FINEST). If the level
           is absent, FINE is assumed; if the class is absent, the global
           level is set.
