NAME
       xye - puzzle game

DESCRIPTION
       Xye  is a puzzle game in which the objective is to help a character that looks like a green circle to get all the gems in the room. This is, of course, not as easy as it sounds, Xye must solve all
       sorts of puzzles while at the same time avoiding all sorts of traps and beasts.

       Xye is similar to other puzzle games like sokoban or boulderdash, yet it also includes some arcade elements.

       Xye is a derivative of a classic windows game called Kye, which is the base of the gameplay experience and visual elements. Xye is able to play level files that were made for Kye and  Sokoban.  It
       is also able to play custom .xye files, a richer level format that allows the new objects and features, you can make these levels by hand or by using the built-in editor that comes with the game.

       Thanks to the SDL library, Xye is cross platform software, and there are versions available for Linux and windows, there are also ports for FreeBSD and it should be possible to compile it in other
       platforms as well.
