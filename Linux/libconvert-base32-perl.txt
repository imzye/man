NAME
       Convert::Base32 - Encoding and decoding of base32 strings

SYNOPSIS
         use Convert::Base32;

         $encoded = encode_base32("\x3a\x27\x0f\x93");
         $decoded = decode_base32($encoded);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions to convert string from / to Base32 encoding, specified in RACE internet-draft. The Base32 encoding is designed to encode non-ASCII characters in DNS-compatible host
       name parts.

       See http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idn-race-03 for more details.

FUNCTIONS
       Following functions are provided; like "MIME::Base64", they are in @EXPORT array. See Exporter for details.

       encode_base32($str)
           Encode data by calling the encode_base32() function. This function takes a string of bytes to encode and returns the encoded base32 string.

       decode_base32($str)
           Decode a base32 string by calling the decode_base32() function. This function takes a string to decode and returns the decoded string.

           This function might throw the exceptions such as "Data contains non-base32 characters", "Length of data invalid" and "Padding bits at the end of output buffer are not all zero".

           decode_base32 differs from the specification in that upper case letters are treated as their lower case equivalent rather than producing an error.
