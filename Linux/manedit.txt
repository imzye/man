NAME
       manedit - UNIX Manual Page IDE

SYNTAX
       manedit [section] [manual_page] [options] [GUI_options]

DESCRIPTION
       ManEdit is an integrated UNIX manual page development environment (IDE) using the GIMP Tool Kit (GTK).

       Editing  of  UNIX  manual  pages  is  done using ManEdit's Editor, which edits UNIX manual pages using a simplified version of the XML format, eliminating the need for the user to use the more complex
       GROFF/TROFF format (native UNIX manual page format).

       The UNIX manual page that you are editing can then be viewed at any time using ManEdit's Viewer by going to View->Preview.

       To start learning how to create and edit UNIX manual pages using ManEdit, run manedit and go to Help->Tutorial.

       The [section] specifies the section number from 1 to 8 (used only with the --viewer option).

       The [manual_page] specifies the path to the manual page file to open at startup or the name of the manual page when using the --viewer option.

       -f     Same as --config.

       --viewer
              Specifies to start up with the Viewer.

       --help Prints the help screen and exits.

       --version

       # manedit &

       To run this program and load a manual page at startup, type:

       # manedit [manual_page] &

       You can run it as a viewer by specifying the --viewer option so that it starts up with a viewer instead of an editor window:

       # manedit --viewer [manual_page] &
