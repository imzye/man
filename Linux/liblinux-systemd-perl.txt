Linux::Systemd::Journal::Write(3pm)                                                 User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                 Linux::Systemd::Journal::Write(3pm)

NAME
       Linux::Systemd::Journal::Write - XS wrapper around sd-journal

VERSION
       version 1.201600

SYNOPSIS
         use Linux::Systemd::Journal::Write;

         my $jnl = Linux::Systemd::Journal::Write->new;

         # basic log messages
         $jnl->print('flarg');          # with default log level
         $jnl->print('Hello world', 4); # WARN level

         # add abitrary data to the log entry
         my %hash = (DAY_ONE => 'Monday', DAY_TWO => 'Tuesday', DAY_THREE => 'Wednesday');
         $jnl->send('Here is a message', \%hash); # add abitrary data to the log entry

         # will log "Failed to open file: No such file or directory" and ERRNO=2
         open my $fh, '<', 'nosuchfile'
           or $jnl->perror('Failed to open file');

DESCRIPTION
   Log Levels
       The log levels use by "journald" and by "priority" are the same as those use by "syslog", so instead of using numeric priorities you can

         use Sys::Syslog ':macros';

       giving you access to the "LOG_*" "level constants"

ATTRIBUTES
   "app_id"
       Will be used to set "SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER". Defaults to basename($0);

   "priority"
       Default log priority. See "Log Levels"

   "caller_details"
       Boolean controlling whether to log the "CODE_FILE", "CODE_LINE", and "CODE_FUNC" of the caller.

       Optional. Defaults to "true";

       See also systemd.journal-fields(7)

   "caller_level"
       If this module is not being used directly, but through some proxy module for instance, "caller_level" is used to determine the number of frames to look back through.

       Optional. Defaults to 0;

METHODS
   "print($msg, $pri?)"
       $msg should be either a string. $pri is optional, and defaults to $self->priority

   "send($msg_or_data, $data?)"
       If there is one arg, it may be a simple string to log. Or, it could be a hashref
        or an arrayref. In this case, one of the keys sent MUST be 'message'.

       If there are two args, the first must be the string to use as a message, the second a hashref or arrayref. In this case, a key called message should not be set.

       Finally, "send" can also be called with an array of key => values, one of which must be message.

       Keys will be uppercased.

   perror($msg)
       Logs the string of the current set "errno", prefixed with $msg.

           At some point between me writing this module and getting around to releasing it, another module was released to write the journal.
