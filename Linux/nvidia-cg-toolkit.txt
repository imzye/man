NAME
       cgfxcat - dump a Cg effect or program file to standard out

SYNOPSIS
       cgfxcat.exe [-gl] [-effect] [-program] [-object] [-profile profile] [-entry entry] file

DESCRIPTION
       cgfxcat loads an effect or program file and calls every query operation available in the core runtime on the resulting Cg object.  The values returned by the queries are written to standard out.

       The source code for cgfxcat is found under examples/Tools/cgfxcat.

OPTIONS
       file
           The effect or program file to be processed.  cgfxcat can handle effect files, program files, or precompiled program files.

           Files  with  a  .cgfx  or  .fx extension will be loaded using cgCreateEffectFromFile.  Files with a .cg or .hlsl extension will be loaded using cgCreateProgramFromFile.  Any other extension is
           passed to cgGetProfile and if a valid CGprofile is found the file is loaded using cgCreateProgramFromFile with the program_type  set  to  CG_OBJECT.   You  can  override  these  built-in  file
           extension mappings with the -effect, -program, or <-object> options.

       -effect
           Treat file as an effect file, ignoring its extension.

       -program
           Treat file as a program file, ignoring its extension.

       -object
           Treat file as an precompiled program file, ignoring its extension.

       -profile profile
           Use the CGprofile returned by cgGetProfile for profile as the profile argument of cgCreateProgramFromFile when compiling file.

       -entry entry
           Use entry as the entry argument of cgCreateProgramFromFile when compiling file.

       -gl Register states with cgGLRegisterStates rather than using the generic state code built into cgfxcat.
