NAME
       iceccd - Icecream daemon

SYNOPSIS
       iceccd [-b env-basedir] [--cache-limit MB] [-d] [-l log-file] [-m max-processes] [-N hostname] [-n node-name] [--nice level] [--no-remote] [-s scheduler-host] [-u user] [-v[v[v]]]

DESCRIPTION
       The Icecream daemon has to run on all nodes being part of the Icecream compile cluster. It receives compile jobs and executes them in a chroot environment. The compile clients send their compile envi‐
       ronment the first time they send a job to a particular daemon, so that the environment of the daemon does not have to match the one of the client.

       The daemon also has to run on clients sending compile jobs to the Icecream network. If a node should be able to send compile jobs, but never receive any, start the daemon with the option -m 0.

       All Icecream daemons need to have contact to the Icecream scheduler which controls the distribution of data between compile nodes. Normally the daemon will automatically find the right  scheduler.  If
       this is not the case you can explicitly specify the name of the Icecream network and the host running the scheduler.

OPTIONS
       -b, --env-basedir env-basedir
              Base directory for storing compile environments sent to the daemon by the compile clients.

       --cache-limit MB
              Maximum size in Mega Bytes of cache used to store compile environments of compile clients.

       -d, --daemonize
              Detach daemon from shell.

       -h, --help
              Print help message and exit.

       -l, --log-file log-file
              Name of file where log output is written to.

       -m, --max-processes max-processes
              Maximum number of compile jobs started in parallel on machine running the daemon.

       -N hostname
              The name of the icecream host on the network.

       -n, --name, --netname net-name
              The name of the icecream network the daemon should connect to.  There has to be a scheduler running for the network under the same network name.

       --nice level
              The level of niceness to use. Default is 5.

       --no-remote
              Prevents jobs from other nodes being scheduled on this one.

       -s, --scheduler-host scheduler-host
              Name of host running the scheduler for the network the daemon should connect to. This option might help if the scheduler cannot broadcast its presence to the clients due to firewall settings or
              similar reasons, when this is enabled scheduler should use --persistent-client-connection.

       -u, --user-uid user
              Specify the system user used by the daemon, which must be different than ‘root’. If not specified, the daemon defaults to the ‘icecc’ system user if available, or ‘nobody’ if not.

       -v, -vv, -vvv
              Control verbosity of daemon. The more v the more verbose.
