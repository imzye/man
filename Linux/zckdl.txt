NAME
     zckdl — download a zchunk file

SYNOPSIS
     zckdl [--fail-no-ranges] [-q | --quiet] [-s file | --source=file] [-v | --verbose] url
     zckdl -? | --help | --usage | --version

DESCRIPTION
     The zckdl utility attempts to download a zchunk file in an optimized way, taking into consideration the chunked structure.

     The zckdl utility accepts the following optional arguments:

     --fail-no-ranges
             If the server does not support ranges, fail instead of downloading the whole file.

     -q | --quiet
             Quiet operation; only display warning and error messages.  If specified twice, only display error messages.

     -s | --source
             Specify the file to use as a source with the premise that most of the chunks in the downloaded file will be the same.

     -v, --verbose
             Verbose operation; display some diagnostic output.

     -?, --help
             Display program usage information and exit.

     --usage
             Display brief program usage information and exit.

     --version
             Display program version information and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     The zckdl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Download a zchunk file that is hopefully not much different from the previous version:

           zckdl -s doc1.txt.zck https://example.com/doc2.txt.zck
