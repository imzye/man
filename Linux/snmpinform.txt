NAME
       snmptrap, snmpinform - sends an SNMP notification to a manager

SYNOPSIS
       snmptrap -v 1 [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT enterprise-oid agent generic-trap specific-trap uptime [OID TYPE VALUE]...

       snmptrap -v [2c|3] [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ci] AGENT uptime trap-oid [OID TYPE VALUE]...

       snmpinform -v [2c|3] [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT uptime trap-oid [OID TYPE VALUE]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmptrap  is  an  SNMP  application that uses the SNMP TRAP operation to send information to a network manager.  One or more object identifiers (OIDs) can be
       given as arguments on the command line.  A type and a value must accompany each object identifier.  Each variable name is given in the  format  specified  in
       variables(5).

       When  invoked as snmpinform, or when -Ci is added to the command line flags of snmptrap, it sends an INFORM-PDU, expecting a response from the trap receiver,
       retransmitting if required.  Otherwise it sends an TRAP-PDU or TRAP2-PDU.

       If any of the required version 1  parameters,  enterprise-oid,  agent,  and  uptime  are  specified  as  empty,  it  defaults  to  1.3.6.1.4.1.3.1.1  (enter‐
       prises.cmu.1.1), hostname, and host-uptime respectively.

       The TYPE is a single character, one of:
              i  INTEGER
              u  UNSIGNED
              c  COUNTER32
              s  STRING
              x  HEX STRING
              d  DECIMAL STRING
              n  NULLOBJ
              o  OBJID
              t  TIMETICKS
              a  IPADDRESS
              b  BITS
       which are handled in the same way as the snmpset command.

       The  AGENT argument is only embedded in SNMP TRAP PDUs but not in SNMP INFORM PDUs. If AGENT is not an empty string, it must be an IPv4 address. This limita‐
       tion comes from RFC 1157, in which the agent address field is defined as follows:

              agent-addr NetworkAddress, -- address of object generating trap

       From RFC 1155:

              NetworkAddress ::=
                  CHOICE {
                      internet IpAddress
                  }
              [ ... ]
              IpAddress ::=
                  [APPLICATION 0]          -- in network-byte order
                      IMPLICIT OCTET STRING (SIZE (4))

       An example of how to use snmptrap:

       snmptrap -v 1 -c public manager enterprises.spider test-hub 3 0 '' interfaces.iftable.ifentry.ifindex.1 i 1

       will send a generic linkUp trap to manager, for interface 1.

OPTIONS
       snmptrap takes the common options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page in addition to the -Ci option described above.  Note that snmptrap REQUIRES  an ar‐
       gument specifying the agent to query as described there.
