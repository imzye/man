NAME
       btrfsd - Btrfs maintenance daemon

SYNOPSIS

       btrfsd [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the btrfsd daemon.

       Btrfsd is a lightweight daemon that takes care of all Btrfs filesystems on a Linux system. It will:

       •   Check stats for errors and broadcast a warning if any were found, or send an email

       •   Perform scrub periodically if system is not on battery

       •   Run balance occasionally if not on battery power

       The daemon is explicitly designed to be run on any system, from a small notebook to a large storage server. Depending on the system, it should make the best possible decision for running
       maintenance jobs, but may also be tweaked by the user.

CONFIGURATION
       The daemon will run on its own, without any configuration, and monitor all Btrfs filesystems mounted on the system (or do nothing if none were found). However, the user may tweak some settings via
       its configuration file: /etc/btrfsd/settings.conf

       The configuration file is an Ini-style text file, with one section per Btrfs mount point. If no section for a mountpoint with settings was found, the values from the default section are used.

       Every *_interval maintenance action interval may contain an integer time value with a unit character behind it: h for hours, d for days and M for months. The special value never will prevent the
       action from being executed. Going below an hour for actions is not recommended, as btrfsd is only woken up hourly by the system to check for pending actions.

       Example:

           [default]
           mail_address=root

           stats_interval=1h
           scrub_interval=1M
           balance_interval=3M

           [/mnt/storage1]
           scrub_interval=2M
           balance_interval=never
