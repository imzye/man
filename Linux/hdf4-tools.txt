NAME
       hdfpack - compress an HDF file

SYNOPSIS

       hdfpack [-i|-b] [-d data-descriptors-per-block] [-t linked-blocks-per-table-entry] input-hdf-file output-hdf-file

DESCRIPTION
       hdfpack compresses all of the data in an HDF file and writes the compressed data to a second HDF file.

OPTIONS
       -b     Non-coalesced Blocks.  hdfpack will not coalesce linked-block elements.

       -i     Interactive Mode.  hdfpack will prompt for each linked-block element.

       -d num Write an output file with the specified number of data descriptors per block of data descriptors.

       -t num Write an output file with the specified number of linked blocks per table entry.

EXAMPLES
       To compress the data in the file named "aa.hdf" and store the compressed data in the file named "aa.cmp", use the following hdfpack command:

               hdfpack aa.hdf aa.cmp

       Suppose  a  file  named  "bb.hdf" contains data elements stored as sequences of linked blocks. The following hdfpack command compresses the file while leaving the linked-block elements intact, and
       writes the compressed data to a file named "bb.blk".

               hdfpack -b bb.hdf bb.blk
