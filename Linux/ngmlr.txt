NAME
       ngmlr - CoNvex Gap-cost alignMents for Long Reads

SYNOPSIS
       ngmlr [options] -r <reference> -q <reads> [-o <output>]

DESCRIPTION
       Ngmlr  is  a long-read mapper designed to sensitively align PacBilo or Oxford Nanopore to (large) reference genomes. It was designed to quickly and correctly align the reads, including those span‐
       ning (complex) structural variations. Ngmlr uses an SV aware k-mer search to find approximate mapping locations for a read and then a banded Smith- Waterman alignment algorithm to compute the  fi‐
       nal alignment. Ngmlr uses a convex gap cost model that penalizes gap extensions for longer gaps less than for shorter ones to compute precise alignments.
