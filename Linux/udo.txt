NAME
       udo - convert files from UDO into different formats

SYNOPSIS
       udo [-adDghHilmnpqrstvwWxy] source file
       udo [-adDghHilmnpqrstvwWxy] -o destination file source file

DESCRIPTION
       UDO converts files from the UDO format into Apple-QuickView, ASCII, HTML, Texinfo, Linuxdoc-SGML, Manualpage, Pure-C-Help, Rich Text Format, ST-Guide, LaTeX, Turbo Vision Help or Windows Help.

       Using  the  first method UDO prints the destination format to the standard output (STDOUT) and error messages to the standard error output (STDERR). Using the second method UDO writes the destina‐
       tion format to the destination file and error messages to a log file with the suffix .ul?.

       You have to pass single options to UDO : -al isn't the same as -a -l!

       The name of the source file has to be the last option.

       udo file.u

       udo --tex -o output.tex file.u

              Convert the source file `file.u' to LaTeX and write the output to the file named `output.tex'. Warnings, error messages and additional information will be written  to  the  log  file  named
              `output.ult'.

       udo -s -y -l -o ! file.u

              Convert the source file `file.u' to ST-Guide and write the output to `file.stg'. UDO won't save a log file or a file with syllabification patterns.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME   UDO looks for the file udo.ini in your home directory if

              UDOPATH doesn't exist.

       LANG   Sets the language UDO shall use for error messages if neither LC_ALL nor LC_MESSAGES exists.

       LC_ALL If this is set to `german' UDO prints German messages.  If this variable doesn't exist LC_MESSAGES it tested instead.

       LC_MESSAGES
              See LC_ALL If this variable doesn't exist, too,

              LANG is tested instead.

       UDOPATH
              UDO looks for the file udo.ini in the directory defined by this variable. If UDOPATH doesn't exist HOME is tested instead.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Everything was OK.

       >0     An error has appeared.
