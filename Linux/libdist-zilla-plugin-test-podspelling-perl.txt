NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PodSpelling - Author tests for POD spelling

VERSION
       version 2.007006

SYNOPSIS
       In "dist.ini":

           [Test::PodSpelling]

       or:

           [Test::PodSpelling]
           directory = docs
           wordlist = Pod::Wordlist
           spell_cmd = aspell list
           stopword = CPAN
           stopword = github
           stopword = stopwords
           stopword = wordlist

       If you're using "[ExtraTests]" it must come after "[Test::PodSpelling]", it's worth noting that this ships in the "[@Basic]" bundle so you may have to remove it from that first.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a plugin that runs at the gather files stage, providing the file:

         xt/author/pod-spell.t - a standard Test::Spelling test

       Test::Spelling will be added as a develop prerequisite.

ATTRIBUTES
   directories (or directory)
       Additional directories you wish to search for POD spell checking purposes.  "bin" and "lib" are set by default.

   wordlist
       The module name of a word list you wish to use that works with Test::Spelling.

       Defaults to Pod::Wordlist.

   spell_cmd
       If "spell_cmd" is set then "set_spell_cmd( your_spell_command );" is added to the test file to allow for custom spell check programs.

       Defaults to nothing.

   stopwords
       If stopwords is set then add_stopwords( <DATA> ) is added to the test file and the words are added after the "__DATA__" section.

       "stopword" or "stopwords" can appear multiple times, one word per line.

       Normally no stopwords are added by default, but author names appearing in "dist.ini" are automatically added as stopwords so you don't have to add them manually just because they might appear in
       the "AUTHORS" section of the generated POD document. The same goes for contributors listed under the 'x_contributors' field on your distributions META file.

METHODS
   add_stopword
       Called to add stopwords to the stopwords array. It is used to determine if automagically detected words are valid and print out debug logging for the process.
