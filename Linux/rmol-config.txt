       --version
        Print the currently installed version of RMOL on the standard output.

       --sampledir
        Show where the (CSV) sample files are located.

       --libs
        Print the linker flags that are necessary to link with the RMOL library.

       --cflags
        Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile with the RMOL library.

       --prefix
        Show the RMOL installation prefix.
