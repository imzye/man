NAME
       pxfw - Firmware flashing tool for Plextor CD/DVD devices

SYNOPSIS
       pxfw -l
       pxfw -d DEVICE [-if firmware.bin] [-u] [-f] [-v]
       pxfw -d DEVICE [-e] [-r] [-t] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       pxfw is the linux firmware flasher for Plextor CD and DVD drives.  Remove any disks before flashing.

FEATURES
       You can flash the firmware of these drives:
       Plextor Premium, Premium-2, PX-712, PX-716, PX-755 and PX-760.

DEVICE
       can be an IDE, SCSI, SATA, USB or FireWire connected optical drive. Not all SATA controller support all Plextor features.

       Linux:
       /dev/hdX: IDE device
       /dev/scdX: Linux 2.4: SATA, SCSI, USB device, or IDE device via ide-scsi emulation
       /dev/srX: Linux 2.6: IDE device via new ATA layer, SCSI or USB device

       OpenBSD/NetBSD:
       /dev/rcdX

       FreeBSD:
       /dev/cd: SCSI device
       /dev/acd: ATA device

       MacOS X:
       /dev/disk:

       win32:
       C:,D:,E:, ... X:,Y:,Z:

OPTIONS
       -l   scan busses for all available CD and DVD devices

       -if  select inputfile. Specify the firmware binary file, which should
            be written to DEVICE.

       -u   proceed update. When the firmware checksum test has succeeded,
            write firmware to DEVICE.

       -f   force flashing. Even if DEVICE is not recognized, or firmware.
            checksum has failed, firmware writing will be forced.
            Handle with care.

       -e   read EEPROM from DEVICE.

       -r   reboot the device.

       -t   test which opcodes are supported by the device.

       -v   debug.

EXAMPLES
       pxfw -d /dev/hdc -if 755_1.07.bin -u
       writes firmware file 755_1.07.bin into Master Drive on Secondary IDE-Port.

       pxfw -d /dev/sr3 -e -oe file.foo
       reades EEPROM from device /dev/sr3 and writes it to file.foo.
