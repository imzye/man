NAME
       lei-add-watch - watch for new messages and flag changes

SYNOPSIS
       lei add-watch [OPTIONS] LOCATION [LOCATION...]

DESCRIPTION
       Tell lei to watch "LOCATION" for new messages and flag changes.  Currently only Maildir locations are supported.

       WARNING: watches are not always reliable, occasional use of lei-index(1) and lei-refresh-mail-sync(1) is recommended if lei-daemon(8) crashes or needs to be
       restarted.  This will be improved in the future.
