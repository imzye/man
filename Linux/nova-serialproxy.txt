NAME
       nova-serialproxy - Server for the OpenStack Compute serial console proxy service.

SYNOPSIS
          nova-serialproxy [<options>...]

DESCRIPTION
       nova-serialproxy is a server daemon that serves the Nova Serial Websocket Proxy service, which provides a websocket proxy that is compatible with OpenStack Nova serial ports.

OPTIONS
       General options

       --config-dir DIR
              Path to a config directory to pull *.conf files from. This file set is sorted, so as to provide a predictable parse order if individual options are over-ridden. The set is parsed after
              the file(s) specified via previous --config-file, arguments hence over-ridden options in the directory take precedence.  This option must be set from the command-line.

       --config-file PATH
              Path to a config file to use. Multiple config files can be specified, with values in later files taking precedence. Defaults to None. This option must be set from the command-line.

       --debug, -d
              Set the logging level to DEBUG instead of the default INFO level.

       --log-config-append PATH, --log-config PATH, --log_config PATH
              The name of a logging configuration file. This file is appended to any existing logging configuration files.  For details about logging configuration files, see the Python logging mod‐
              ule  documentation.  Note that when logging configuration files are used then all logging configuration is set in the configuration file and other logging configuration options are ig‐
              nored (for example, log-date-format).

       --log-date-format DATE_FORMAT
              Defines the format string for %(asctime)s in log records. Default: None .  This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

       --log-dir LOG_DIR, --logdir LOG_DIR
              (Optional) The base directory used for relative log_file paths. This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

       --log-file PATH, --logfile PATH
              (Optional) Name of log file to send logging output to.  If no default is set, logging will go to stderr as defined by use_stderr. This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

       --nodebug
              The inverse of --debug.

       --nouse-journal
              The inverse of --use-journal.

       --nouse-json
              The inverse of --use-json.

       --nouse-syslog
              The inverse of --use-syslog.

       --nowatch-log-file
              The inverse of --watch-log-file.

       --syslog-log-facility SYSLOG_LOG_FACILITY
              Syslog facility to receive log lines. This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

       --use-journal
              Enable journald for logging. If running in a systemd environment you may wish to enable journal support.  Doing so will use the journal native protocol which includes structured  meta‐
              data in addition to log messages.This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

       --use-json
              Use JSON formatting for logging. This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

       --use-syslog
              Use syslog for logging. Existing syslog format is DEPRECATED and will be changed later to honor RFC5424.  This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

       --version
              Show program's version number and exit

       --watch-log-file
              Uses logging handler designed to watch file system.  When log file is moved or removed this handler will open a new log file with specified path instantaneously. It makes sense only if
              log_file option is specified and Linux platform is used. This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.

       Websockify options

       --cert CERT
              Path to SSL certificate file.

       --daemon
              Run as a background process.

       --key KEY
              SSL key file (if separate from cert).

       --nodaemon
              The inverse of --daemon.

       --nosource_is_ipv6
              The inverse of --source_is_ipv6.

       --nossl_only
              The inverse of --ssl_only.

       --record RECORD
              Filename  that  will  be used for storing websocket frames received and sent by a proxy service (like VNC, spice, serial) running on this host. If this is not set, no recording will be
              done.

       --source_is_ipv6
              Set to True if source host is addressed with IPv6.

       --ssl_only
              Disallow non-encrypted connections.

       --web WEB
              Path to directory with content which will be served by a web server.

       Serial options

       --serial_console-serialproxy_host SERIAL_CONSOLE_SERIALPROXY_HOST
              The IP address which is used by the nova-serialproxy service to listen for incoming requests.  The nova-serialproxy service listens on this IP address for incoming connection  requests
              to instances which expose serial console.

       --serial_console-serialproxy_port SERIAL_CONSOLE_SERIALPROXY_PORT
              The port number which is used by the nova-serialproxy service to listen for incoming requests. The nova-serialproxy service listens on this port number for incoming connection requests
              to instances which expose serial console.

       Debugger options

       --remote_debug-host REMOTE_DEBUG_HOST
              Debug  host  (IP  or name) to connect to. This command line parameter is used when you want to connect to a nova service via a debugger running on a different host. Note that using the
              remote debug option changes how Nova uses the eventlet library to support async IO. This could result in failures that do not occur under normal operation. Use at your own risk.

       --remote_debug-port REMOTE_DEBUG_PORT
              Debug port to connect to. This command line parameter allows you to specify the port you want to use to connect to a nova service via a debugger running on different  host.  Note  that
              using  the  remote  debug option changes how Nova uses the eventlet library to support async IO. This could result in failures that do not occur under normal operation. Use at your own
              risk.
