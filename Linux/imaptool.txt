NAME
       imaptool - tool for creating client-side image maps

SYNOPSIS
       imaptool <.gif|.jpeg file>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the imaptool command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       imaptool is a tool that helps in the creation of client-side image maps.

       For more information on client-side image maps refer see - http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions_3.html

       imaptool is pretty easy to use.

       Invoke  imaptool  on  a .gif or .jpeg image.  Click on 'Shape' and choose a shape (Available shapes - Rectangle, Circle and Polygon).  Click on the image and drag the mouse to enclose the required
       area.  The HTML tag for this client-side image map area is now in your X buffer.

       Once you have enclosed the required area, change to your favorite editor (running in another window) and click Button 2 to paste the client-side image map tag.
