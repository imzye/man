NAME
       gpu-pac - program and control compatible GPUs

SYNOPSIS
       gpu-pac [--help | --about]
       gpu-pac [--execute_pac] [--no_fan] [--force_write] [--debug] [--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
       gpu-pac  provides capability for Program and Control compatible GPUs with this utility.  By default, the commands to be written to a GPU are written to a bash file for the user to inspect and run.
       If you have confidence, the --execute_pac option can be used to execute and then delete the saved bash file.  Since the GPU device files are writable only by root, sudo is used to execute commands
       in the bash file, as a result, you will be prompted for credentials in the terminal where you executed gpu-pac. The --no_fan option can be used to eliminate  fan  details  from  the  utility.  The
       --force_write  option  can  be  used  to  force all configuration parameters to be written to the GPU.  The default behavior is to only write changes.  Finally, the --verbose option will result in
       informational messages to be displayed.

OPTIONS
        --about
              Will display details about gpu-pac.

        --execute_pac
              Will execute a bash file created with commands written to the driver files to modify the operating conditions of the selected GPU/GPUs.  The default behavior is  to  only  create  the  bash
              files for the user to execute.

        --no_fan
              Will exclude fan information from the display and will not include fans in writing or resetting GPU operating conditions.

        --force_write
              Will result in all parameters being writen to the selected GPU/GPUs instead of the default behavior of only writing changes.

        --verbose
              Display informational messages generated during execution.

        --debug
              Will output additional useful debug/troubleshooting details to a log file.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
       gpu-pac

       Will open a Gtk based user interface which will display current or default values for modifiable GPU operating parameters.  The interface supports entry of new values for all compatible GPUs.  The
       user can select to save or reset values for individual or all GPUs. It is suggested that gpu-mon be used to make sure the changes are made as expected.

       gpu-pac --execute_pac

       To  simplify  this  process,  the  --execute_pac  option can be specified to automate execution of the bash files.  A message in the user interface will indicate if credentials are required in the
       original terminal window.

       gpu-pac --force_write

       With this option, all parameters will be written to the bash file, even if they are unchanged.  This is useful in creating bash files used to put GPU's into a known state which is  convenient  for
       use in start up routines.

CONFIGURATION
       In  order  to  get maximum capability of these utilities, you should be running with a kernel that provides support of the GPUs you have installed.  If using AMD GPUs, installing the latest amdgpu
       driver package or the latest ROCm release, may provide additional capabilities. If you have Nvidia GPUs installed, nvidia-smi must also be installed in order for the utility reading of  the  cards
       to  be  possible.   Writing  to  GPUs  is  currently only possible for AMD GPUs, and only with compatible cards and with the AMD ppfeaturemask set to 0xfffd7fff. This can be accomplished by adding
       amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT value in /etc/default/grub and executing sudo update-grub.

FILES
       /usr/share/misc/pci.ids
              The system list of all known PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses).  It can be updated with the update-pciids command.

       /sys/class/drm/card*/device/pp_od_clk_voltage
              Special driver file for each AMD GPU required by some rickslab-gpu-utils.

       /etc/default/grub
              The grub defaults file where amdgpu.ppfeaturemask needs to be set.

BUGS
       Known to not work well with Fiji ProDuo cards and will issue warning messages for Fiji Nano cards.  The display of P-state masks is always the defaults, not the actual values.  Please  report  any
       additional bugs/issues at https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/gpu-utils
