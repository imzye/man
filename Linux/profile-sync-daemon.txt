NAME
       psd-overlay-helper - Script to use overlay file system for profile-sync-daemon.

DESCRIPTION
       Profile-sync-daemon  (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage browser profile/profiles in tmpfs and to periodically sync back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished by an in‐
       novative use of rsync to maintain synchronization between a tmpfs copy and media-bound backup of the browser profile/profiles. Additionally, psd features several crash recovery features.

       The psd-overlay-helper script is used internally to enable the usage of the overlay file system. It should not be called by the user directly.
