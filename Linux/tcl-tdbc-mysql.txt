DESCRIPTION
       The tdbc::mysql driver provides a database interface that conforms to Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl script to connect to a MySQL database.

       Connection  to  an MYSQL database is established by invoking tdbc::mysql::connection create, passing it the name to give the database handle and a set of -option-value pairs. The available options
       are enumerated under CONNECTION OPTIONS below.  As an alternative, tdbc::mysql::connection new may be used to create a database connection with an automatically assigned  name.  The  return  value
       from tdbc::mysql::connection new is the name that was chosen for the connection handle.

       The side effect of tdbc::mysql::connection create is to create a new database connection.. See tdbc::connection(3tcl) for the details of how to use the connection to manipulate a database.

CONNECTION OPTIONS
       The  tdbc::mysql::connection  create  object command supports the -encoding, -isolation, -readonly and -timeout options common to all TDBC drivers. The -encoding option will always fail unless the
       encoding is utf-8; the database connection always uses UTF-8 encoding to be able to transfer arbitrary Unicode characters. The -readonly option must be 0, because MySQL does  not  offer  read-only
       connections.

       In addition, the following options are recognized:

       -host hostname
              Connects  to  the  host  specified  by hostname. This option must be set on the initial creation of the connection; it cannot be changed after connecting. Default is to connect to the local
              host.

       -port number
              Connects to a MySQL server listening on the port specified by number.  This option may not be changed after connecting. It is used only when host is specified and is not localhost.

       -socket path
              Connects to a MySQL server listening on the Unix socket or named pipe specified by path . This option may not be changed after connecting.  It is used only when -host is not specified or is
              localhost.

       -user name
              Presents name as the user name to the MySQL server. Default is the current user ID.

       -passwd password

       -password password
              These two options are synonymous. They present the given password as the user's password to the MySQL server. Default is not to present a password.

       -database name

       -db name
              These two options are synonymous.  They present the given name as the name of the default database to use in MySQL queries. If not specified, the default database for the  current  user  is
              used.

       -interactive flag
              The  flag  value must be a Boolean value. If it is true (or any equivalent), the default timeout is set for an interactive user, otherwise, the default timeout is set for a batch user. This
              option is meaningful only on initial connection. When using the configure method on a MySQL connection use the -timeout option to set the timeout desired.

       -ssl_ca string

       -ssl_capath string

       -ssl_cert string

       -ssl_cipher string

       -ssl_key string
              These five options set the certificate authority, certificate authority search path, SSL certificate, transfer cipher, and SSL key to the given string arguments. These options may be speci‐
              fied only on initial connection to a database, not in the configure method of an existing connection. Default is not to use SSL.

EXAMPLES
              tdbc::mysql::connection -user joe -passwd sesame -db joes_database
       Connects to the MySQL server on the local host using the default connection method, presenting user ID 'joe' and password 'sesame'.  Uses 'joes_database' as the default database name.

ADDITIONAL CONNECTION METHODS
       In addition to the usual methods on the tdbc::connection(3tcl) object, connections to a MySQL database support one additional method:

       $connection evaldirect sqlStatement
              This method takes the given sqlStatement and interprets as MySQL native SQL code and evaluates it without preparing it. The statement may not contain variable substitutions. The result  set
              is  returned as a list of lists, with each sublist being the list of columns of a result row formatted as character strings. Note that the string formatting is done by MySQL and not by Tcl,
              so details like the appearance of floating point numbers may differ.  This command is not recommended for anything where the usual prepare or preparecall methods work correctly. It is  pro‐
              vided so that data management language statements that are not implemented in MySQL's prepared statement API, such as CREATE DATABASE or CREATE PROCEDURE, can be executed.
