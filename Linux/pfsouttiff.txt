NAME
       pfsoutppm, pfsouttiff, pfsoutrgbe, pfsoutexr - Write images or frames in one of the several formats

SYNOPSIS
       pfsoutppm (<file> [--srgb] [--frames <range>])  [<file>...]

       pfsouttiff (<file> [--srgb] [--frames <range>])  [<file>...]

       pfsoutrgbe (<file> [--frames <range>])  [<file>...]

       pfsoutexr (<file> [--frames <range>])  [<file>...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command can be used to write pfs frames piped to standard input in one of the several recognized formats. See the manual page of pfsinppm to get a list of available formats.

       To write images to standard output use a single dash '-' instead of filename.

       Each file name can contain a %d pattern, which is substituted with frame numbers. The pattern has the same syntax as C printf command. For example, you can use %04d to make the frame number four digit
       with proceedings zeros. You can select the frames using the following options (the options must be always given after the file name):

       --frames <range>
              Range is given in mathlab / octave format:

              startframe:step:endframe

              Frame numbers start with startframe (default 0), are increased by step (default 1) and stop at endframe You can skip one of those values, for example 1:100 for frames 1,2,...,100 and  0:2:  for
              frame 0,2,4,... up to the last file that exists.

       --srgb, -s
              Apply  the  sRGB  non-linearity (approximately 2.2 gamma) before writing a file. This can be used instead of using pfsgamma -g 2.2 to store the result of some tone-mapping operators. The option
              will compress contrast to make sure that tone values are properly shown on a display. It should be only used with linearized (not gamma corrected) images that are normalized to the 0-1 range.

       --bit-depth <val>, -b <val>
              Enforce bit-depth (per color channel). The allowed values are from 8 to 32. If not specified, the bit depth from the pfs stream ('BITDEPTH' tag) will be used instead. If the 'BITDEPTH'  tag  is
              missing, the ImageMagick default value will be used (usually 16). The bit depth of actually stored file may be lower of that specified, if the file format does not support higher bit depths.

EXAMPLES
        pfsin memorial.tiff | pfsoutrgbe memorial.hdr
              Converts from one HDR format to another

       pfsin test.jpg | pfsout test.png
              Convert from one image format to another.

        pfsin --linear test.jpg | pfsout --srgb test.png
              The same as above, but apply inverse gamma correction after reading an image (--linear) and then apply gamma correction before writing an image (--srgb).

BUGS
       Writing  TIFF  files  with  pfsouttiff seems to be broken, but pfsoutimgmagick can be used instead. pfsout will attempt to use pfsoutimgmagick and fall back to pfsouttiff if pfstools were not compiled
       with ImageMagick.
