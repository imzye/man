NAME
       fsm-lite - Frequency-based String Mining

SYNOPSIS
       fsm-lite -l <file> -t <file> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       A singe-core implementation of frequency-based substring mining used in bioinformatics to extract substrings that discriminate two (or more) datasets inside high-throughput sequencing data.

OPTIONS
   mandatory:
       -l,--list <file>
              Text file that lists all input files as whitespace-separated pairs

              <data-name> <data-filename>

              where <data-name> is unique identifier (without whitespace) and <data-filename> is full path to each input file.  Default data file format is FASTA (uncompressed).

       -t,--tmp <file>
              Store temporary index data

   optional:
       -m,--min <int>
              Minimum length to report (default 9)

       -M,--max <int>
              Maximum length to report (default 100)

       -f,--freq <int>
              Minimum frequency per input file to report (default 1)

       -s,--minsupp <int>
              Minimum number of input files with support to report (default 2)

       -S,--maxsupp <int>
              Maximum number of input files with support to report (default inf)

       -v,--verbose
              Verbose output
