NAME
       Hedgewars - a free turn based strategy game

SYNOPSIS
       hedgewars [OPTION...]  [CONNECTSTRING]

DESCRIPTION
       Each  player  controls  a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack
       and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such  as
       the "Rope" or "Parachute", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.
