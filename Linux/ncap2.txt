NAME
       ncap2 - netCDF Arithmetic Processor, Next Generation

SYNTAX
       ncap2  [-3]  [-4]  [-5]  [-6]  [-7] [-A] [--bfr sz_byt][-C][-c][-D dbg_lvl] [-d dim,[ min][,[ max]]] [-F] [--fl_fmt=fmt] [-f] [--glb att_name= att_val]] [-h] [--hdf] [--hdr_pad sz_byt][--hpss_try] [-l
       path] [--no_tmp_fl] [-O] [-o output-file] [-p path] [-R] [-r] [--ram_all] [-S script-file][-s script][-t thr_nbr][--uio][-v var[,...]]  [ input-file ] output-file

DESCRIPTION
       ncap2 supersedes and is backwards-compatible with ncap which is now deprecated.  Both operators arithmetically process netCDF files.  The primary ncap2 documentation is  currently  the  sample  script
       <http://nco.sf.net/ncap2.in> The remainder of this manpage is identical to the ncap manpage.

       The  processing  instructions  are  contained  either in the NCO script file fl.nco or in a sequence of command line arguments.  The options -s (or long options --spt or --script) are used for in-line
       scripts and -S (or long options --fl_spt or --script-file) are used to provide the filename where (usually multiple) scripting commands are pre-stored.  ncap2 was written to  perform  arbitrary  albe‐
       braic transformations of data and archive the results as easily as possible.  Missing values are treated correctly.  The results of the algebraic manipulations are called derived fields.

       Unlike  the  other  operators,  ncap2  does not accept a list of variables to be operated on as an argument to -v.  Rather, the -v switch takes no arguments and indicates that ncap2 should output only
       user-defined variables.  ncap2 does not accept or understand the -x switch.

EXAMPLES
       Compute the square of variable T
              ncap2 -s "T2=T*T" in.nc out.nc

       The full documentation for NCO is maintained as a Texinfo manual called the NCO Users Guide.  Because NCO is mathematical in nature, the documentation includes TeX-intensive portions not  viewable  on
       character-based  displays.   Hence  the  only  complete  and  authoritative  versions  of  the  NCO  Users Guide are the PDF (recommended), DVI, and Postscript versions at <http://nco.sf.net/nco.pdf>,
       <http://nco.sf.net/nco.dvi>, and <http://nco.sf.net/nco.ps>, respectively.  HTML and XML versions are available at <http://nco.sf.net/nco.html> and <http://nco.sf.net/nco.xml>, respectively.

       If the info and NCO programs are properly installed at your site, the command

              info nco

       should give you access to the complete manual, except for the TeX-intensive portions.
