NAME
       poa - align a set of sequences or alignments.

SYNOPSIS

       poa [OPTIONS] [MATRIXFILE]

       One of the -read_fasta, -read_msa, or -read_msa_list arguments must be used, since a sequence or alignment file is required.

DESCRIPTION
       POA is Partial Order Alignment, a fast program for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in bioinformatics. Its advantages are speed, scalability, sensitivity, and the superior ability to handle
       branching / indels in the alignment. Partial order alignment is an approach to MSA, which can be combined with existing methods such as progressive alignment. POA optimally aligns a pair of MSAs
       and which therefore can be applied directly to progressive alignment methods such as CLUSTAL. For large alignments, Progressive POA is 10 to 30 times faster than CLUSTALW.

EXAMPLES
       poa -read_fasta multidom.seq -clustal m.aln blosum80.mat

       On Debian systems, poa can be tested using the following command:

       poa -read_fasta /usr/share/doc/poa/examples/multidom.seq -clustal /dev/stdout -v /usr/share/poa/blosum80.mat

OPTIONS
   INPUT
       -read_fasta FILE
           Read in FASTA sequence file.

       -read_msa FILE
           Read in MSA alignment file.

       -read_msa2 FILE
           Read in second MSA file.

       -subset FILE
           Filter MSA to include list of seqs in file.

       -subset2 FILE
           Filter second MSA to include list of seqs in file.

       -remove FILE
           Filter MSA to include list of seqs in file.

       -remove2 FILE
           Filter second MSA to include list of seqs in file.

       -read_msa_list FILE
           Read an MSA from each filename listed in file.

       -tolower
           Force FASTA/MSA sequences to lowercase (nucleotides in our matrix files).

       -toupper
           Force FASTA/MSA sequences to UPPERCASE (amino acids in our matrix files).

   ALIGNMENT
       -do_global
           Do global alignment.

       -do_progressive
           Perform progressive alignment using a guide tree built by neighbor joining from a set of sequence-sequence similarity scores.

       -read_pairscores FILE
           Read tab-delimited file of similarity scores (If not provided, scores are constructed using pairwise sequence alignment.)

       -fuse_all
           Fuse identical letters on align rings.

   ANALYSIS
       -hb
           Perform heaviest bundling to generate consensi.

       -hbmin VALUE
           Include in heaviest bundle sequences with percent ID (as a fraction) >= VALUE.

   OUTPUT
       -pir FILE
           Write out MSA in PIR format.

       -clustal FILE
           Write out MSA in CLUSTAL format.

       -po FILE
           Write out MSA in PO format.

       -preserve_seqorder
           Write out MSA with sequences in their input order.

       -printmatrix LETTERS
           Print score matrix to stdout.

       -best
           Restrict MSA output to heaviest bundles (PIR only).

       -v
           Run in verbose mode (e.g. output gap penalties).
