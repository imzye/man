NAME
       wmbubble - system load monitor

SYNOPSIS
       wmbubble [options] [program1] [program2] [...] [programN]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmbubble command.

       wmbubble is a dockapp-style CPU, memory, swap and load average monitor.  Based on the GNOME BubbleMon applet, this program has been considerably improved.

       The higher the water level, the more memory is in use. The more profuse the bubbles, the higher the CPU usage. There is also a real-time CPU percentage display.

       When  the mouse is moved into the window, the display will change to show the load history, or, if either shift key is held, the current memory usage. If you press the right mouse button, the win‐
       dow will freeze in that state. You can unfreeze the display by pressing the right mouse button again.

       program1, program2, and so on are the programs to spawn when various buttons on the mouse are pressed while the pointer is over the dockapp. For the vast majority of users, there can be up to 9 of
       those buttons, and in order they are: the left(1), middle(2), and right(3) mouse buttons; up(4), down(5), left(6), and right(7) on the mouse wheels; and the backwards(8) and forwards(9) mouse but‐
       tons.

       Additionally, the right mouse button (program3) will only be executed if the graphs are disabled (otherwise that argument is ignored).
