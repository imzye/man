SYNOPSIS
       hubicfuse <mountpoint> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       hubicfuse provides access to hubiC storage via a mountpoint, using FUSE.

       hubicfuse accepts the following general options:

       -h, --help
              displays a help message

       -V, --version
              displays the version of hubicfuse

       -d     enables debug input (implies -f)

       -f     starts hubicfuse in the foreground

       -s     disables multi-threaded operation

       -o <option>
              adds an option; this may be repeated as many times as necessary (see fuse(8) for details of the available options)

CONFIGURATION
       hubicfuse needs some configuration settings to run; these can be provided as mount options or stored in the .hubicfuse file in the user's home directory. The required settings are:

       client_id
              the Hubic client identifier, which can be obtained from https://hubic.com/home/browser/developers/;

       client_secret
              the Hubic client secret, which can be obtained along with the identifier;

       refresh_token
              the authentication token, which can be obtained using the hubic_token script (in /usr/share/hubicfuse).

       The following optional settings are available:

       cache_timeout
              the number of seconds directories are kept in the cache (600 by default);

       verify_ssl
              true or false to enable or disable SSL certificate verification (enabled by default);

       segment_size
              the size to use when creating DLOs (1073741824 by default, i.e. 1GB);

       segment_above
              the file size at which to start using segments (2147483648 by default, i.e. 2GB);

       storage_url
              the storage URL for other tenants to view the container;

       container
              the public container to expose via the given storage_url;

              the directory to use for storing temporary files;

       get_extended_metadata
              true or false to enable or disable downloading file attributes (detailed time, owner, permissions; enabling this will result in reduced performance)

       curl_verbose
              true or false to enable or disable detailing debugging information on curl requests (this produces lots of output);

       curl_progress_state
              true or false to enable or disable progress information on curl requests (mostly useful for debugging);

       cache_statfs_timeout
              the number of seconds to cache requests to statfs (cloud statistics), 0 to disable;

       debug_level
              0, 1 or 2 to specify the level of debugging verbosity in conjunction with the -d command-line switch (0 selects minimal verbosity);

       enable_chmod
