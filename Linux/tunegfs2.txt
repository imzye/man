NAME
       tunegfs2 - View and manipulate gfs2 superblocks

SYNOPSIS
       tunegfs2 [OPTIONS] /dev/blockdevice

DESCRIPTION
       tunegfs2  allows viewing and manipulating the values contained in a GFS
       or GFS2 superblock. It is able to  modify  the  UUID  (on  GFS2  only),
       label, lockproto and locktable.

       The  values  in the GFS2 superblock are read only on mount. Any changes
       on a live filesystem will not take effect until the  next  time  it  is
       mounted.  Making  changes  on  a live filesystem is not recommended for
       this reason.

OPTIONS
       -h

              Prints out usage information for this command.

       -l

              List contents of the filesystem superblock. Includes the current
              values of the parameters that can be set by this program.

       -L <label>

              Change the filesystem label. Note that the GFS2 filesystem label
              is also the locktable name.

       -o [lockproto=<proto>] [locktable=<table>]

              Set mount options. Currently supported options include lockproto
              and locktable

       -U <uuid>

              Set the filesystem UUID

       -V

              Print out the information on the version of the tool.
