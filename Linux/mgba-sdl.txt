NAME
       mgba — Game Boy Advance emulator

SYNOPSIS
       mgba [-123456dfg] [-b biosfile] [-C option=value] [-c cheatfile] [-l loglevel] [-p patchfile] [-s n] [-t statefile] file

DESCRIPTION
       mgba is a Game Boy Advance emulator.  The options are as follows:

       -1      Scale the window 1×.

       -2      Scale the window 2×.

       -3      Scale the window 3×.

       -4      Scale the window 4×.

       -5      Scale the window 5×.

       -6      Scale the window 6×.

       -b biosfile, --bios biosfile
               Specify a BIOS file to use during boot.  If this flag is omitted, mgba will use the BIOS specified in the configuration file, or a high‐level emulated BIOS if none is specified.

       -C option=value, --config option=value
               Override the given config option with value.

       -c cheatfile, --cheats cheatfile
               Apply cheat codes from cheatfile.

       -d      Start emulating via the command‐line debugger.

       -f      Start the emulator full‐screen.

       -g      Start a gdb(1) session.  By default the session starts on port 2345.

       -l loglevel
               Log messages during emulation to stdout.  loglevel is a bitmask defining which types of messages to log:
               •   1 – fatal errors
               •   2 – errors
               •   4 – warnings
               •   8 – informative messages
               •   16 – debugging messages
               •   32 – stub messages for unimplemented features
               •   64 – in‐game errors
               The default is to log warnings, errors, fatal errors, and status messages.

       -p patchfile, --patch patchfile
               Specify a patch file in BPS, IPS, or UPS format.

       -s n, --frameskip n
               Skip every n frames.

       -t statefile, --savestate statefile
               Load initial game state from statefile.

CONTROLS
       The default controls are as follows:
       A              x
       B              z
       L              a
       R              s
       Start          ⟨Enter⟩
       Select         ⟨Backspace⟩
       Load state     F1–F9
       Save state     ⟨Shift⟩‐F1–F9
       Frame advance  ⟨Ctrl⟩‐n

DEBUGGER
       When mgba is run with the -d option, the command‐line debugger is enabled.  It supports the following commands:

       b[reak] address
       b[reak]/a address
       b[reak]/t address
         Set a breakpoint – ARM (‘/a’), Thumb (‘/t’), or the current CPU mode – at address.
       c[ontinue]
         Continue execution.
       d[elete] address
         Delete a breakpoint at address.
       dis[asm] [address [count]]
       dis[asm]/a [address [count]]
       dis[asm]/t [address [count]]
       dis[assemble] [address [count]]
       dis[assemble]/a [address [count]]
       dis[assemble]/t [address [count]]
         Disassemble  count instructions starting at address, as ARM (‘/a’), Thumb (‘/t’), or the current CPU mode.  If count is not specified, only disassemble the instruction at address.  If address is
         not specified, only disassemble the current address.
       h[elp]
         Print help.
       i[nfo]
       status
         Print the current contents of general‐purpose registers and the current program state register, and disassemble the current instruction.
       n[ext]
         Execute the next instruction.
       p[rint] value ...
       p[rint]/t value ...
       p[rint]/x value ...
         Print one or more values as binary (‘/t’), hexadecimal (‘/x’), or decimal.
       q[uit]
         Quit the emulator.
       reset
         Reset the emulation.
       r/1 address
       r/2 address
       r/4 address
         Read a byte (‘/1’), halfword (‘/2’), or word (‘/4’) from address.
       w[atch] address
         Set a watchpoint at address.
       w/1 address data
       w/2 address data
       w/4 address data
         Write data as a byte (‘/1’), halfword (‘/2’), or word (‘/4’) to address.
       w/r register data
         Write data as a word to register.
       x/1 address [count]
       x/2 address [count]
       x/4 address [count]
         Examine count bytes (‘/1’), halfwords (‘/2’), or words (‘/4’) from address.  If count is not specified, examine 16 bytes, 8 halfwords, or 4 words.

ENVIRONMENT
       XDG_CONFIG_HOME
               The location where mgba will look for the configuration directory.  If not set, ~/.config is used.

FILES
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mgba/config.ini
               Default mgba configuration file.
       portable.ini
               If this file exists in the current directory, mgba will read config.ini from the current directory instead of $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mgba.
