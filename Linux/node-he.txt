          [-h | --help]

DESCRIPTION
       he encodes/decodes HTML entities in strings just like a browser would.

OPTIONS
       --escape
       Take a string of text and escape it for use in text contexts in XML or HTML documents. Only the following characters are escaped: `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'`.

       --encode
       Take  a  string of text and encode any symbols that aren't printable ASCII symbols and that can be replaced with character references. For example, it would turn `©` into `&#xA9;`, but it wouldn't
       turn `+` into `&#x2B;` since there is no point in doing so. Additionally, it replaces any remaining non-ASCII symbols with a hexadecimal escape sequence (e.g. `&#x1D306;`).  The  return  value  of
       this function is always valid HTML.

       --encode --use-named-refs
       Enable the use of named character references (like `&copy;`) in the output. If compatibility with older browsers is a concern, don't use this option.

       --encode --everything
       Encode every symbol in the input string, even safe printable ASCII symbols.

       --encode --allow-unsafe
       Encode non-ASCII characters only. This leaves unsafe HTML/XML symbols like `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'` intact.

       --encode --decimal
       Use decimal digits rather than hexadecimal digits for encoded character references, e.g. output `&#169;` instead of `&#xA9;`.

       --decode
       Takes a string of HTML and decode any named and numerical character references in it using the algorithm described in the HTML spec.

       --decode --attribute
       Parse the input as if it was an HTML attribute value rather than a string in an HTML text content.

       --decode --strict
       Throw an error if an invalid character reference is encountered.

       -v, --version
       Print he's version.

       -h, --help
       Show the help screen.

EXIT STATUS
       The he utility exits with one of the following values:

       0     he did what it was instructed to do successfully; either it encoded/decoded the input and printed the result, or it printed the version or usage message.
       1     he encountered an error.

EXAMPLES
       he --escape '<script>alert(1)</script>'
       Print an escaped version of the given string that is safe for use in HTML text contexts, escaping only `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'`.

       he --decode '&copy;&#x1D306;'
       Print the decoded version of the given HTML string.

       echo '&copy;&#x1D306;' | he --decode
       Print the decoded version of the HTML string that gets piped in.
