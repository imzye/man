NAME
       claws-mail-attach-warner - missing attachments warning before sending

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-attach-warner package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-attach-warner is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       It's aimed at prevention of forgetting attachments, by warning the user if some attachment is mentioned in the mail text but no attached file is found in the composed mail.

       Mentions are found by simple regex matching, although some care is taken to avoid false positives. In the plugin configuration panel the user can define the expressions or words to be looked for
       in the message text.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named attachwarner.so, and press the
       “Open” button.
