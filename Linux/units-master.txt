NAME
       units-master - Graphic application to manage S.I. units-based quantities

SYNOPSIS

       units-master

DESCRIPTION
       units-master is a program that allows one to enter an expression of a physical or chemical quantity, for example 1.8 km/h or 3.2 µmol/L, and make a few operations with it: check the expression's
       syntax, perfom conversions, for example convert 1.8 km/h to meters per second, which yields 0.5 m/s, and render the expression to various formats: (plain) LaTeX, PNG and SVG.

       units-master is a front-end to the CLI program units-filter, which can be used for more fine-grained features.

KNOWN BUGS
       The program is currently limited to only work with units of the Internation System: no feet, no inches, ...
