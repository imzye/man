NAME
       sclangpipe_app - a wrapper to invoke sclang for scvim

SYNOPSIS
       sclangpipe_app [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the sclangpipe_app command.

       sclangpipe_app is a script that invokes the supercollider language (sclang) executable for use with scvim. Users do NOT normally need to invoke it, since it is called by the main scvim plugin when
       invoked by vim.
