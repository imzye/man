NAME
       eventf - connect (federate) two CORBA EventChannels

SYNOPSIS

       eventf from-channel-uri to-channel-uri

DESCRIPTION
       eventf establishes a connection between two event channels. The event channels must both already be in existence (perhaps created by the eventc command). If both event channels are implement‐
       ed by omniEvents, then the connection is persistent: it will be recreated if one or both of the channels is shut down and later restarted.

       The from- and to-channels must be specified as URIs. This may be an IOR, or a corbaloc::: or corbaname::: URI.

       Example: eventf corbaname::#from.channel corbaname::#to.channel

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       OMNIORB_CONFIG
              The location of the omniORB configuration file.
