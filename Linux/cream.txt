NAME
       cream - a set of macros that makes the VIM easier to use for beginners

SYNOPSIS
       cream [ any VIM options ]

DESCRIPTION
       cream  is  a set of macros for the popular VIM editor that makes it a lot more intuitive to beginners. Cream is useful for users who want to take advantage of the great VIM features but don't know
       how to control them (yet).

       Please note that due to limitation to text consoles/terminals cream can only run in X11.

OPTIONS
       You can provide any options from the VIM manpage. See there.
