NAME
       awsres - build resource files for Ada Web Server applications

SYNOPSIS
       awsres [-h] [-r unit] [-q] file...

DESCRIPTION
       The  Ada  Web Server is a library that allows you to embed a web server
       into your Ada application.  It provides not only HTTP  but  also  SOAP,
       WSDL and several other facilities.  Thus you can write full-fledged web
       applications.  awsres allows you to embed resources, such as  pictures,
       into your final executable, so that your executable is completely self-
       contained and does not need to read other files at run time.

       awsres works by creating Ada source files that  contain  the  data  for
       your  resources  as arrays of bytes.  You then compile these Ada source
       files into your executable.  At run time, the AWS library automatically
       loads the resources from the executable whenever available.

       awsres creates one parent Ada package named, by default, `res', and one
       child package for each of the files given on  the  command  line.   The
       package `res' registers each resource when your application starts.  To
       link `res' into your executable you simply add a `with res;'  statement
       in one of your source files.

EXAMPLE
       $ ls
       image.png
       $ awsres image.png

       creating image.png...
        -> registered

       $ ls
       res.adb  res.ads  res-image_png.ads  image.png
