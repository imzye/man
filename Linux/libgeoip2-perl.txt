NAME
       GeoIP2::Model::City - Model class for GeoIP2 Precision: City and GeoIP2 City

VERSION
       version 2.006002

SYNOPSIS
         use 5.008;

         use GeoIP2::WebService::Client;

         my $client = GeoIP2::WebService::Client->new(
             account_id  => 42,
             license_key => 'abcdef123456',
         );

         my $city = $client->city( ip => '24.24.24.24' );

         my $city_rec = $city->city();
         print $city_rec->name(), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides a model for the data returned by the GeoIP2 Precision: City web service and the GeoIP2 City database.

       The only difference between the City and Insights model classes is which fields in each record may be populated. See <http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services> for more details.

METHODS
       This class provides the following methods, each of which returns a record object.

   $city->city()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::City object representing city data for the requested IP address.

   $city->continent()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::Continent object representing continent data for the requested IP address.

   $city->country()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::Country object representing country data for the requested IP address. This record represents the country where MaxMind believes the IP is located.

   $city->location()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::Location object representing country data for the requested IP address.

   $city->maxmind()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::MaxMind object representing data about your MaxMind account.

   $city->postal()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::Postal object representing postal code data for the requested IP address.

   $city->registered_country()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::Country object representing the registered country data for the requested IP address. This record represents the country where the ISP has registered a given IP block and
       may differ from the user's country.

   $city->represented_country()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::RepresentedCountry object for the country represented by the requested IP address. The represented country may differ from the "country" for things like military bases.

   $city->subdivisions()
       Returns an array of GeoIP2::Record::Subdivision objects representing the country subdivisions for the requested IP address. The number and type of subdivisions varies by country, but a subdivision
       is typically a state, province, county, etc.

       Some countries have multiple levels of subdivisions. For instance, the subdivisions array for Oxford in the United Kingdom would have England as the first element and Oxfordshire as the second
       element. The subdivisions array for Minneapolis in the United States would have a single object for Minnesota.

       If the response did not contain any subdivisions, this method returns an empty list.

   $city->most_specific_subdivision()
       Returns a single GeoIP2::Record::Subdivision object representing the most specific subdivision returned.

       If the response did not contain any subdivisions, this method returns a GeoIP2::Record::Subdivision object with no values.

   $city->traits()
       Returns a GeoIP2::Record::Traits object representing the traits for the requested IP address.
