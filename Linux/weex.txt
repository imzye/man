NAME
       weex - fast WEb EXchanger non-interactive FTP and FTPS client

SYNOPSIS
       weex [ Options ] HOSTID [HOSTID...]

DESCRIPTION
       weex  is  a  utility  designed  to  automate the task of remotely maintaining a web page or other FTP or FTPS archive. With weex , the maintainer of a web site or archive that must be administered
       through FTP/FTPS interaction can largely ignore that process. The archive administrator simply creates a local directory that serves as an exact model for the offsite data. All  modifications  and
       direct  interaction  is  done  locally to this directory structure. When the administrator wishes to coordinate the data on the remote site with that of the local model directory, simply executing
       weex accomplishes this in the most bandwidth-efficient fashion by only transferring files that need updating. The program will create or remove files or directories as necessary to accurately  es‐
       tablish the local model on the remote server.

       The mandatory HOSTID argument is the user-defined name that represents a particular FTP account or configuration specified in the ~/.weexrc file. This file, the contents of which are described be‐
       low,  can  alternatively  be named ~/.weex/weexrc.  Multiple HOSTID arguments to a single weex command are supported to affect multiple archives or configurations in immediate succession. In addi‐
       tion, the actual HOSTID can be substituted with the number representing its relative sequential position in the ~/.weexrc file (the first HOSTID definition is 1, and so on).

OPTIONS
       Options at the command line take precedence over any specified in the configuration file.

       -d, --debug-config
              Outputs the configuration of each hosts.

       -D, --debug-ftplib
              Outputs messages from/to FTP server.

       -f, --force
              If the caching mechanism is inhibiting the uploading of files that should be transferred, this option will force the actual transfer to always occur.

       -h, --help
              Outputs a usage summary to stdout.

       -m, --monochrome
              The default mode generates a helpful color coding based on the operation being performed. This option suppresses that.

       -r, --rebuild-cache
              If cache file is broken, use this to rebuild it.

       -s, --silent
              The default mode outputs a helpful status message for each action taken, including file transfer progress meters.  This mode suppresses output.

       -t, --test
              Weex doesn't modify any remote files/directories.

       -V, --version
              Prints the version of the weex program.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Because this program is meant to be non-interactive, a properly set up configuration file is essential.  weex looks for this file either in ~/.weexrc or ~/.weex/weexrc.

       The general format of the configuration file is a bracketed section heading followed by parameters that define that section's configuration. This section name is what is provided to  weex  at  run
       time  to  indicate the FTP arrangement you wish to update. A parameter is only valid for the most recent section heading that preceded it. The exception to this is the [default] section which cre‐
       ates settings for unspecified parameters in every section. In the case of parameters that accept multiple values, the default section augments any specifically designated values.

       Lines that begin with the '#' character are safely ignored as comments.  Neither section names nor parameter variables are case sensitive in any way. Section names can not begin with numbers. Some
       parameters can be assigned multiple values. Where this is not possible, the last value is used. To quote special characters, use single quotes (') or double quotes ("). To quote a particular quote
       symbol, use the other quote. The general syntax format for the configuration file is:

       [hostid1]
               Parameter1 = Value
               # First method for multiple values
               Parameter2 = Value
               Parameter2 = Value
               ...

       [hostid2]
               Parameter1 = Value
               # Second method for multiple values
               Parameter2 = {
                      Value
                      Value
               }
               ...

       [default]
               Parameter = Value
               ...

       PARAMETER LIST

       These parameters are used to define the properties of a particular host configuration named in brackets. When specifying directory names, the trailing "/" is optional. Also, both files and  direc‐
       tories  (except SrcDir and DestDir) can be specified with shell wildcards.  When specifying files, if a file or file pattern is given without a path, it is assumed to be available when encountered
       in any directory.  If it is an explicitly specified path/file combination, the configuration is available in that directory.  Files/directories except `SrcDir' and `DestDir' can  be  specified  as
       both  absolute  path  and  relative  path. But you must specify `SrcDir' and `DestDir' as absolute path.  When you want to specify `/public_html/ignoreme.html' as relative path, you should specify
       `./ignoreme.html' rather than `ignoreme.html'.  When specifying binary states, you may use any of the following: True/False, Yes/No, T/F, 1/0. None are case sensitive.

       AsciiFile
              Filename patterns that will be transferred using ASCII mode. The default mode for files not specified in this way is IMAGE(BINARY) mode.

       AuthorizationName
              If you are using an FTP proxy server that requires challenge/response authorization with the nonstandard AUTHORIZE and RESPONSE commands, set this parameter to your authorization user  name
              (or number).  After logging in to the proxy, weex will prompt you with the challenge and read back a response.

       ChangePermission
              The access permissions of the files in the directories specified with ChangePermissionDir are changed to this parameter. The format is a three digit octal number.

       ChangePermissionDir
              Files in directories assigned to this parameter will have their access permissions changed after sending.  Specify local directories.

       ChdirAtConnection
              Set `true' to change remote current working directory to DestDir at connection.  If remote current working directory at connection is DestDir, weex runs faster a bit by setting this parame‐
              ter to `false'.  Default is `true'.

       ConvToLower
              If  set to `true', the filenames are converted to lower case before sending.  This feature allows interaction with FTP servers that do not support case sensitive filenames. If a naming con‐
              flict arises due to a lower case name already existing, an error occurs. Furthermore, the cache is totally unaware of original uppercase filenames.

       DestDir
              Destination directory on the remote FTP server where the mirrored information will be sent. This setting corresponds to the "pwd" command on traditional FTP clients.

       Force  If the caching mechanism is inhibiting the uploading of files that should be transferred, this option will force the actual transfer to always occur if set to `true'.

       FollowSymlinks
              Set `true' to follow symbolic links.  Default is `false'. Symbolic link of directory assumes a file whose size is 0 byte at default.

       FtpPassive
              When it is `false', weex uses port mode instead of passive mode.  If the FTP server doesn't support passive mode, specify `false'.  (It may make transfer slower) Default  is  `true'.   (See
              also FAQ)

       HostName
              Hostname to connect to. The "ftp://" protocol specifier is implied and shouldn't be used. An IP address is also valid and may save lookup time.

       IgnoreLocalDir
              This parameter contains one or more protected local directories that are completely ignored during the transfer process. This is useful if you want to have subdirectories that are part of a
              project but don't need to be in the final, online version (i.e., old versions).

       IgnoreLocalFile
              This parameter contains one or more protected local file specifiers that will be completely ignored during the transfer process.

       IgnoreRemoteDir
              This parameter contains one or more protected remote directories that are completely ignored during the transfer process. This is useful if you want to have other material on the remote FTP
              site that is not related to the specific project that weex is dealing with. This could include, for example, data administered through a different FTP client or process.

       IgnoreRemoteFile
              This parameter contains one or more protected remote file specifiers that will be completely ignored during the transfer process.

       KeepRemoteDir
              In their directories, files are not removed when they don't exist in the local directory.

       LogDetailLevel
              It specifis how detail level weex records a log at.  Connection and disconnection message and error messages are always recorded.  When weex finishes working correctly, it writes `Complete'
              previous disconnection message.  If 1 or less, records each connection.  If 2, records each directory.  If 3 or more, records each file manipulated Default is 1.

       LoginName
              Login name of the account on the FTP server.

       MaxRetryToSend
              When weex fails in sending a file, it retry to send the file.  The maximum times of retrying is this parameter.  Default is 8. Specify -1 to stop retrying.

       Monochrome
              The default mode generates a helpful color coding based on the operation being performed. A `true' setting suppresses that.

       NestSpaces
              An integer that controls the indent spacing of the output. The default is 4.  If you want to suppress it, specify -1. If you specify 0, weex uses 4. :-)

       OverwriteOK
              If the FTP server has trouble overwriting files, set this parameter to `false', and each file will be deleted before a new version is put in place.

       Password
              Plaintext  password  granting  access to the account. Note that this file uses no special facilities to safeguard passwords. Make sure that the file permissions of a configuration file con‐
              taining passwords are set conservatively. If they are not, a warning will be issued at execution.  If this parameter is not found, weex asks for it on the terminal.

       PreservePermissionDir
              The access permissions of the files in directories assigned to this parameter will be copied to remote.  Specify *local* directories.

       RecordLog
              When `true', weex create a log.

       RenameOK
              If this parameter is set to `true', each file is uploaded under the temporary name `weex.tmp', then renamed to its correct name only if the upload succeeds.  This avoids the  problem  of  a
              user  getting an incomplete file if he downloads from your Web site while you are uploading to it, and of incomplete files being uploaded if your FTP connection breaks while weex is running
              .  The default is `false' since some FTP servers might not support renaming.

       ShowHiddenFile
              Set `true' to get hidden files (starting with a dot) on FTP server which doesn't show hidden files by default.  Default is `false'.

       Silent The default mode outputs a helpful status message for each action taken, including file transfer progress meters. A `true' setting suppresses output.

       SrcDir Top of the source directory tree containing the local copy of the information to be mirrored. This setting corresponds to the "lcd" command on traditional FTP clients.

       UseSSL If set to `true' use FTPS instead of FTP. Explicit AUTH SSL is used to encrypt the FTP session.  If it is not supported by the server, weex exits.

       UseSSLVerify
              Verify the server certificate. Abort if the verification fails. Defaults to `true'.

       UseSSLcafile
              Path to the file containing CA certificates, for SSL certificate verification.  If not specified, defaults to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.

EXAMPLES
       Here is an example of what a typical .weexrc file might look like:

        #-=-=-=-=-=Sample Configuration file=-=-=-=-=-
        # My favorite FTP account...
        [Ninja]
        HostName = ftp.ninja-rights.org
        LoginName = chrisxed
        Password = '"mYsEcReT!"'
        SrcDir = /home/chrisxed/project/weex
        DestDir = /
        ASCIIfile = *.c
        IgnoreLocalDir = /home/chrisxed/project/weex/weex.devel
        IgnoreLocalDir = /home/chrisxed/project/weex/weex.old
        IgnoreLocalFile = notes2myself.txt
        IgnoreRemoteDir = /offsitearchive/

        # Another FTP account...
        [Veggie]
        HostName = ftp.vegetable-advocacy.com
        LoginNAME = waxedbean
        Password = "X'sBean"
        SrcDir = /home/chrisxed/project/legumes
        DestDir = /souppot/

        # Global configuration settings
        [default]
        AsciiFile = {
        *.htm
        *.html
        *.txt
        *.asc
        }
        IgnoreLocalFile = {
        *.bak
        *.tmp
        *.swp
        }

       With a configuration like this, executing:

       $ weex Ninja

       would cause the file system assigned to SrcDir to be completely mirrored on the remote server.  Executing:

       $ weex ninja veggie

       would cause the FTP update to occur for the "Ninja" configuration and then for the "Veggie" configuration. This could also be specified like this:

       $ weex 1 2

NOTES
       Timestamp Cache Facility

       weex implements a cache of file timestamps from Ver 1.6.0.  This makes updating much faster when you have a lot of files.  In addition, weex also caches directory structure and file names from Ver
       2.5.0.  So never slow transfer even if you have many directories and files.  If, however, you change the remote files with another FTP client or running weex is killed or weex is terminated by  an
       error,  the  cache  file will not be correct.  The simple solution to this problem is to remove the cache file (located in ~/.weex/weex.cache.HOSTNAME ) completely or to run weex with option --re‐
       build-cache.
