NAME
       simarrange - STL 2D plate packer with collision simulation

SYNOPSIS
       simarrange [-x WIDTH] [-y HEIGHT] [-c] [-m] [-s SPACING] [-r ROTSTEP] [-p POSSTEP] [-n PATH+N] [-o OUTDIR] [-d] [-j THREADS] [-q]

DESCRIPTION
       Simarrange  is  a  program  that simulates collisions between STL meshes in 2D in order to generate tightly packed sets of parts.  It takes a directory of STL files as input and outputs STL files with
       combined plates of parts.  The parts are assumed to be in the correct printable orientation already.

OPTIONS
       -x --width
            x dimension of build plate in mm, default 200, must be a positive integer

       -y --height
            y dimension of build plate in mm, default 200, must be a positive integer

       -c --circle
            build plate is circular, with diameter given by -x

       -m --middle
            place first part in the middle of the plate, and pack around it (slower)

       -s --spacing
            minimal spacing between parts, in mm, default 1, must be a positive integer

       -r --rotstep
            rotational granularity of search space in degrees, default 10 (reduce for tighter, slower packing)

       -p --posstep
            positional granularity of search space in mm, default 5 (reduce for tighter, slower packing)

       -n --repeat PATH+N
            add N copies of the file at PATH (or if path is a directory, of the files in that directory) to the plate job

       -o --outputdir
            output directory, default "."

       -d --dryrun
            only do a dry run, computing placement but not producing any output file

       -j --threads
            how many threads to use. Default is as many as possible, set to 1 for single-threaded operation

       -q --quiet
            output as little noise as possible on stdout

       -l --limit
            stop after this many plates are filled

EXAMPLES
       simarrange -x 200 -y 150 -o output input
            Convert all files from the directory "input" into plates of size 200x150mm and save to directory "output", creating it if necessary

       simarrange -x 179 -c input
            Convert all files from the directory "input" into circular plates of 170mm diameter and save to directory "output", creating it if necessary

       simarrange -s 10 input
            Convert all files from the directory "input" into plates of size 200x200mm with 10mm spacing between parts

       simarrange -m input
            Convert all files from the directory "input" into plates of size 200x200mm, packing from the middle

       simarrange -n input+10 -n input2+10
            Convert all files from the directories "input" and "input2" into plates of size 200x200mm, with 10 copies of each object

       simarrange -x60 -y60 -s3 blah -p 2
            Convert all files from the directory "blah" into plates of size 60x60mm with 3mm spacing between parts and 2mm search grid

       simarrange file1.stl file1.stl file2.stl file2.stl file2.stl file2.stl
            Place two copies of file1.stl and four copies of file2.stl into plates of size 200x200mm

       simarrange input file1.stl file1.stl file2.stl file2.stl file2.stl file2.stl
            Place all STL files in the directory "input" as well as two copies of file1.stl and four copies of file2.stl into plates of size 200x200mm
