NAME
       claws-mail-managesieve - manage scripts on Sieve-compliant servers

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-managesieve package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-managesieve is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin provides an interface for managing Sieve filters. These filters are used for filtering mail on mail servers, usually with an IMAP account.

       This plugin allows managing Sieve filters: creating, editing, deleting and checking their syntax.

       No facilities for script development are provided, so you need to know the Sieve language for creating or make non-trivial modifications to existing filters. See references below.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named managesieve.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

       Sieve must be enabled and configured on each account where you plan to use it. Go “Configuration” menu and open “Preferences for current account...” or “Edit accounts...” for configuring a
       different one.

       When account preferences are shown you can configure Sieve by opening the “Plugins/Sieve” page.

       Once some account is configured you can use “Manage Sieve Filters...”  dialog option from “Tools” menu.
