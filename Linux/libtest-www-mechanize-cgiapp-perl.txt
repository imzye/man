NAME
       Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp - Test::WWW::Mechanize for CGI::Application

SYNOPSIS
         # We're in a t/*.t test script...
         use Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp;

         my $mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp->new;

         # test a class that uses CGI::Application calling semantics.
         # (in this case we'll new up an instance of the app and call
         # its ->run() method)
         #
         $mech->app("My::WebApp");
         $mech->get_ok("?rm=my_run_mode&arg1=1&arg2=42");

         # test a class that uses CGI::Application::Dispatch
         # to locate the run_mode
         # (in this case we'll just call the ->dispatch() class method).
         #
         my $dispatched_mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp->new;
         $dispatched_mech->app("My::DispatchApp");
         $mech->get_ok("/WebApp/my_run_mode?arg1=1&arg2=42");

         # create an anonymous sub that this class will use to
         # handle the request.
         #
         # this could be useful if you need to do something novel
         # after creating an instance of your class (e.g. the
         # fiddle_with_stuff() below) or maybe you have a unique
         # way to get the app to run.
         #
         my $custom_mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp->new;
         $custom_mech->app(
            sub {
              require "My::WebApp";
              my $app = My::WebApp->new();
              $app->fiddle_with_stuff();
              $app->run();
            });
         $mech->get_ok("?rm=my_run_mode&arg1=1&arg2=42");

         # at this point you can play with all kinds of cool
         # Test::WWW::Mechanize testing methods.
         is($mech->ct, "text/html");
         $mech->title_is("Root", "On the root page");
         $mech->content_contains("This is the root page", "Correct content");
         $mech->follow_link_ok({text => 'Hello'}, "Click on Hello");
         # ... and all other Test::WWW::Mechanize methods

DESCRIPTION
       This package makes testing CGIApp based modules fast and easy.  It takes advantage of Test::WWW::Mechanize to provide functions for common web testing scenarios. For example:

         $mech->get_ok( $page );
         $mech->title_is( "Invoice Status",
                          "Make sure we're on the invoice page" );
         $mech->content_contains( "Andy Lester", "My name somewhere" );
         $mech->content_like( qr/(cpan|perl)\.org/,
                             "Link to perl.org or CPAN" );

       For applications that inherit from CGI::Application it will handle requests by creating a new instance of the class and calling its "run" method.  For applications that use
       CGI::Application::Dispatch it will call the "dispatch" class method.  If neither of these options are the right thing, you can set a reference to a sub that will be used to handle the request.

       This module supports cookies automatically.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
       Behaves like, and calls, Test::WWW::Mechanize's "new" method.  It optionally uses an "app" parameter (see below), any other parameters get passed to Test::WWW::Mechanize's constructor. Note that
       you can either pass the name of the CGI::Application into the constructor using the "app" parameter or set it later using the "app" method.

         use Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp;
         my $mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp->new;

         # or

         my $mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp->new(app => 'TestApp');

METHODS
   $mech->app($app_handler)
       This method provides a mechanism for informing Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp how it should go about executing your run_mode.  If you set it to the name of a class, then it will load the class and
       either create an instance and ->run() it (if it's CGI::Application based), invoke the ->dispatch() method if it's CGI::Application::Dispatch based, or call the supplied anonymous subroutine and
       let it do all of the heavy lifting.
