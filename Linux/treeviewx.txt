NAME
       TreeView_X - displays and prints phylogenetic trees

SYNOPSIS

       tv [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       tv is the program that starts the TreeView X GUI.

       TreeView X is an open source and multi-platform program to display phylogenetic trees. It can read and display NEXUS and Newick format tree files (such as those output by PAUP*, ClustalX,
       TREE-PUZZLE, and other programs). It allows one to order the branches of the trees, and to export the trees in SVG format.

       If started from the command line with filename as an argument, TreeView X will open the tree stored in filename.

SEE ALSO
       At present there is is no documentation for TreeView X. In the meantime please see the online documentation for TreeView (remember that TreeView X has only a subset of the features of TreeView).
