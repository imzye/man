NAME
       puzzle-diff - Compare pictures with libpuzzle

SYNOPSIS
       [-b <contrast barrier for cropping>] [-c] [-C <max cropping ratio>] [-e] [-E <similarity threshold>] [-h] [-H <max height>] [-l <lambdas>] [-n <noise cutoff>] [-p <p ratio>] [-t] [-W <max width>]
       <file 1> <file 2>

DESCRIPTION
       puzzle-diff compares two pictures and outputs the normalized distance.

       Try puzzle-diff -h for more info.

EXAMPLES
       Output distance between two images:

         $ puzzle-diff pic-a-0.jpg pics-a-1.jpg
         0.102286

       Compare two images, exit with 10 if they look the same, exit with 20 if they don't (may be useful for scripts):

         $ puzzle-diff -e pic-a-0.jpg pics-a-1.jpg
         $ echo $?
         10

       Compute distance, without cropping and with computing the average intensity of the whole blocks:

         $ puzzle-diff -p 1.0 -c pic-a-0.jpg pic-a-1.jpg
         0.0523151
