NAME
       pbmtomatrixorbital - convert a PBM image to a Matrix Orbital LCD image

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtomatrixorbital

       [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtomatrixorbital reads a PBM image as input and produces as output an
       image that can be uploaded to a Matrix Orbital LCD display.

       You can upload the image to the LCD via the serial port to which it  is
       connected  with  the  program  mo-upload.pl, which you can get from the
       package pbmtomatrixorbital.  Yes, the package is the same name as  this
       Netpbm  program,  and  it  contains  its own pbmtomatrixorbital program
       which is slightly different from this one because it is not part of the
       Netpbm package.

HISTORY
       pbmtomatrixorbital  was  added  to  Netpbm  in Release 10.18 (September
       2003).
