NAME
       primer3_core - Designs primers for PCR

SYNOPSIS
       primer3_core [-format_output] [-strict_tags] [< input_file]

DESCRIPTION
       primer3_core picks primers for PCR reactions, considering as criteria oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content and primer-dimer possibilities, PCR product size, positional constraints
       within the source sequence, and miscellaneous other constraints.

       By default, primer3_core accepts input and produces output in Boulder-io format, a pre-XML text-based input/output format for program-to-program data interchange format. The Boulder-io format and the
       commands that primer3_core understands are described in the README file, which on Debian systems can be found in /usr/share/doc/primer3/.

OPTIONS
       -format_output
           Prints a more user-oriented report for each sequence.

       -strict_tags
           primer3_core echoes and ignores any tags it does not recognize, unless the -strict_tags flag is set on the command line, in which case primer3_core prints an error in the PRIMER_ERROR output tag,
           and prints additional information on stdout; this option can be useful for debugging systems that incorporate primer.

       Note
       The old flag -2x_compat is no longer supported.

EXIT STATUS CODES
       •   0 on normal operation.

       •   -1 under the following conditions: illegal command-line arguments, unable to fflush stdout, unable to open (for writing and creating) a .for, .rev or .int file (probably due to a protection
           problem).

       •   -2 on out-of-memory.

       •   -3 empty input.

       •   -4 error in a "Global" input tag (message in PRIMER_ERROR).
