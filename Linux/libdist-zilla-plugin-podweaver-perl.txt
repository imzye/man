Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodWeaver(3pm)                                                 User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                 Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodWeaver(3pm)

NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodWeaver - weave your Pod together from configuration and Dist::Zilla

VERSION
       version 4.010

DESCRIPTION
       [PodWeaver] is the bridge between Dist::Zilla and Pod::Weaver.  It rips apart your kinda-Pod and reconstructs it as boring old real Pod.

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That
       is, if the most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

ATTRIBUTES
   finder
       [PodWeaver] is a Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser.  The FileFinder given for its "finder" attribute is used to decide which files to munge.  By default, it will munge:

       •   ":InstallModules"

       •   ":ExecFiles"

METHODS
   weaver
       This  method  returns the Pod::Weaver object to be used.  The current implementation builds a new weaver on each invocation, because one or two core Pod::Weaver plugins cannot be trusted to handle
       multiple documents per plugin instance.  In the future, when that is fixed, this may become an accessor of an attribute with a builder.  Until this is clearer,  use  caution  when  modifying  this
       method in subclasses.

CONFIGURATION
       If the "config_plugin" attribute is given, it will be treated like a Pod::Weaver section heading.  For example, @Default could be given.  It may be given multiple times.

       Otherwise, if a file matching "./weaver.*" exists, Pod::Weaver will be told to look for configuration in the current directory.

       Otherwise, it will use the default configuration.
