NAME
       ea_iid - Run IID tests for entropy assesment

SYNOPSIS
       ea_iid [-i|-c] [-a|-t] [-v] [-q] [-l <index>,<samples> ] <file_name> [bits_per_symbol]

DESCRIPTION
       Run IID tests for entropy assesment.

       <file_name>: Must be relative path to a binary file with at least 1 million entries (samples).

       [bits_per_symbol]: Must be between 1-8, inclusive. By default this value is inferred from the data.

       [-i|-c]: '-i' for initial entropy estimate, '-c' for conditioned sequential dataset entropy estimate. The initial entropy estimate is the default.

       [-a|-t]: '-a' produces the 'H_bitstring' assessment using all read bits, '-t' truncates the bitstring used to produce the `H_bitstring` assessment to 1000000 bits. Test all data by default.

              Note: When testing binary data, no `H_bitstring` assessment is produced, so the `-a` and `-t` options produce the same results for the initial assessment of binary data.

       -v: Optional verbosity flag for more output. Can be used multiple times.

       -q: Quiet mode, less output to screen. This will override any verbose flags.

       -l <index>,<samples>   Read the <index> substring of length <samples>.

              Samples are assumed to be packed into 8-bit values, where the least significant 'bits_per_symbol' bits constitute the symbol.

       -i: Initial Entropy Estimate (Section 3.1.3)

              Computes  the  initial  entropy  estimate  H_I as described in Section 3.1.3 (not accounting for H_submitter) using the entropy estimators specified in Section 6.3.  If 'bits_per_symbol' is
              greater than 1, the samples are also converted to bitstrings and assessed to create H_bitstring; for multi-bit symbols, two entropy estimates are computed: H_original and H_bitstring.   Re‐
              turns min(H_original, bits_per_symbol X H_bitstring). The initial entropy estimate H_I = min(H_submitter, H_original, bits_per_symbol X H_bitstring).

       -c: Conditioned Sequential Dataset Entropy Estimate (Section 3.1.5.2)

              Computes  the  entropy  estimate  per  bit  h'  for  the  conditioned  sequential dataset if the conditioning function is non-vetted. The samples are converted to a bitstring.  Returns h' =
              min(H_bitstring).

       -o: Set Output Type to JSON

              Changes the output format to JSON and sets the file location for the output file.

       --version: Prints tool version information
