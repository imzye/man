NAME
       fastddsgen - IDL source code generator

SYNOPSIS
       fastddsgen [options] FILE.idl [FILE.idl ...]

DESCRIPTION
       fastddsgen  is  a command line tool that generates eProsima Fast DDS source code using the data types defined in an IDL (Interface Definition Language) file. This generated source code can be used
       in any Fast DDS application in order to define the data type of a topic, which will later be used to publish or subscribe.

       To declare the structured data, the IDL format must be used. IDL is a specification language, made by OMG (Object Management Group), which describes an interface in a language independent  manner,
       allowing  communication between software components that do not share the same language. The eProsima Fast DDS-Gen tool reads the IDL files and parses a subset of the OMG IDL specification to gen‐
       erate source code for data serialization. This subset includes the data type descriptions included in Defining a data type via IDL. The rest of the file content is ignored.

OPTIONS
       -help shows the help information

       -version
              shows the current version of fastddsgen.

       -d DIR write generated files to DIR.

       -I DIR add DIR to the preprocessor include path.

       -t DIR use DIR as temporary directory

       -example PLATFORM
              generate an example to compile the generated files for a specific platform.

       -test  add a serialization test to the generated example code

       -language LANG
              select programming language (default: C++)

       -replace
              overwrite existing output files.

       -ppDisable
              disable the preprocessor.

       -ppPath CPP
              use CPP as preprocessor executable.

       -typeros2
              name generated types compliant to ROS 2 conventions.

       -typeobject
              generate TypeObject files for the IDL and modify the generated constructor to register the TypeObject representation into the type factory.

       -cs    apply case-sensitive matching to IDL grammar.
