NAME
       printcap — printer capability database

SYNOPSIS
       printcap

DESCRIPTION
       The  printcap  file is a simplified version of the termcap(5) database used to describe line printers.  The spooling system accesses the printcap file every time it is used, allowing dynamic addi‐
       tion and deletion of printers.  Each entry in the database is used to describe one printer.  This database may not be substituted for, as is possible for termcap(5), because it may allow  account‐
       ing to be bypassed.

       The default printer is normally “lp”, though the environment variable PRINTER may be used to override this.  Each spooling utility supports an option, -Pprinter, to allow explicit naming of a des‐
       tination printer.

       Refer to the 4.3 BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual for a complete discussion on how to set up the database for a given printer.

CAPABILITIES
       Refer to termcap(5) for a description of the file layout.

       xs    num   0              if lp is a tty, set local mode bits (tty(4))

       If the local line printer driver supports indentation, the daemon must understand how to invoke it.

FILTERS
       If  a  printer  is  specified  via lp (either local or remote), the lpd(8) daemon creates a pipeline of “filters” to process files for various printer types.  The pipeline is not set up for remote
       printers specified via rm unless the local host is the same as the remote printer host given.  The filters selected depend on the flags passed to lpr(1).  The pipeline set up is:

             p       pr | if regular text + pr(1)
             none    if      regular text
             c       cf      cifplot
             d       df      DVI (tex)
             g       gf      plot(3)
             n       nf      ditroff
             f       rf      Fortran
             t       tf      troff
             v       vf      raster image

       The if filter is invoked with arguments:

             if [-c] -wwidth -llength -iindent -n login -h host acct-file

       The -c flag is passed only if the -l flag (pass control characters literally) is specified to lpr(1).  width and length specify the page width and length (from pw and pl, respectively) in  charac‐
       ters.  The -n and -h parameters specify the login name and host name of the owner of the job, respectively.  The acct-file function is passed from the af printcap entry.

       If  no if is specified, of is used instead, with the distinction that of is opened only once, while if is opened for every individual job.  Thus, if is better suited to performing accounting.  The
       of is only given the width and length flags.

       All other filters are called as:

             filter -xwidth -ylength -n login -h host acct-file

       where width and length are represented in pixels, specified by the px and py entries, respectively.  All filters take stdin as the file, stdout as the printer, may log either to  stderr  or  using
       syslog(3), and must not ignore SIGINT.

LOGGING
       Error  messages generated by the line printer programs themselves are logged by syslog(3) using the LPR facility.  Messages printed on stderr of one of the filters are sent to the corresponding lf
       file.  The filters may, of course, use syslog(3) themselves.

       Error messages sent to the console have a carriage return and a line feed appended to them, rather than just a line feed.
