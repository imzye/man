NAME
       E3 - A mini text editor

SYNOPSIS
       e3[ws|em|pi|vi|ne] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       e3  is a complete mini application written fully in assembler, with a code size less than 10000 byte. There is a status & input line, where you can enter filenames, blocknames, find-texts and line
       numbers.  The editor commands are similarly the families of Wordstar-like or Emacs or Pico or vi or Nedit editors.  For online help press ESC:h in vi mode, else Alt-H.   This  man  page  describes
       Wordstar key bindings only.

       ^V     Toggle insert mode

       ^W     Scroll up

       ^X     Go down

       ^Y     Delete current line

       ^Z     Scroll down

UNDO OPERATION DETAILS
       e3  has an UNDO mode starting in v2.2. There is no predefined UNDO level count. You can expect to UNDO at least one last insert-, delete-, overwrite- or sed_pipe-operation, but in most cases there
       are lots of UNDO stages available. e3 has a fixed size undo buffer and will use an external helper file if some deleted data is bigger sized than the undo buffer.  This buffer is  organized  as  a
       ring, overwriting older UNDO information if necessary. So one never can say exactly how many UNDO operations are possible.  For using the UNDO press one of:

       ^U     in Wordstar mode

       ^QU    in Pico mode

       ^_     in Emacs mode

       u      in vi command mode

       ^U     in Nedit mode

BUILT IN CALCULATOR
       e3 has an arithmetic calculator built in for some simple arithmetic calculations inside your text. Place cursor at begin of the task i.e. something like:  -3.002*-(2--3)= and press one of:

       ^KN    in Wordstar mode

       ^QC    in Pico mode

       ^X^N   in Emacs mode

       #      in vi command mode

       ^K     in Nedit mode

       This will insert the result into text.  Use the values between -999999999999.999999 ... 999999999999.999999 with up to 6 decimal digits and the operators +-*/  and parenthesis ( ).  Also available
       are p for constant PI and r for accessing the result of last calculation

RUNTIME MODE SWITCHING
       You can switch to other editor mode by pressing one of:

       ^KM    in Wordstar mode

       ^QM    in Pico mode

       altX   in Emacs mode

       <ESC>; in vi command mode

       ^E     in Nedit mode

       e3 will set a prompt SET MODE . Now enter one of e3ws, e3em, e3pi, e3vi, e3ne for setting Wordstar-like or Emacs or Pico or vi or Nedit style.

OPTIONS
       e3 accepts a filename for text editing. Switch the editor mode depending of the binary name, one of e3ws, e3em, e3pi, e3vi, e3ne

FILES

       e3c    is a 'C' compiled executable for some other platforms, optional built, supporting WS key bindings only.

       e3arm  is a new experimental (alpha code quality) assembled executable for ARM Linux, optional built (identical e3, but no arithmetics and no UNDO available).

       e3.hlp help text file (for e3c only)

       e3.res error message text file (for e3c only)
