              specify directory where to place generated source code files

       -p <package>
              specify package name for generated source code files

       -s <classname>
              specify class name of server proxy stub

       -ser   tag generated XDR classes as serializable

       -bean  generate accessors for usage as bean, implies -ser

              do not create server proxy stub

       -parseonly
              parse x-file only but do not create source code files

       -verbose
              enable verbose output about what jrpcgen is doing

       -version
              print jrpcgen version and exit
