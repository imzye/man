NAME
       nullidentd - a bare minimum identd server

SYNOPSIS
       nullidentd [uid]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nullidentd command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       Nullidentd is intended to be a bare minimum identd server, suitable for a firewall or IP Masq/NAT gateway.

OPTIONS
       nullidentd takes only one optional argument, the username to answer with.  If this is omitted, nullidentd will reply with the username “foobar”.  If the username is RANDOM, a random string is gen‐
       erated.

USAGE
       nullidentd is typically invoked from inetd. The following is a typical inetd.conf example:
       auth stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/nullidentd nullidentd
