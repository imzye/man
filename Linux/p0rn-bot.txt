OVERVIEW
       p0rn-bot is a script that automates p0rn-proxy handling.  It starts with a given page and then follows all links recursivly.  All pages encountered are registered with p0rn-proxy either as thumnails
       sites or as galleries for download.

DESCRIPTION
       Be sure to have p0rn-proxy(1) running.  Then start p0rn-bot with the URL of a known thumbnail gallery page.  Now wait and see p0rn-bot do it's work.

       When p0rn-bot is finished, the pages are marked for download.  Run p0rn-download(1) to actually get them.

       Switches

       --depth depth ⎪ -d depth
            This sets how 'deep' links are being followed.  0 will only look at the given start URL, 1 will visit the start URL plus all sites that are linked on it and so forth...

            Default depth is 2.

       --help ⎪ -h
            This prints a short help text and exits.

       --proxy proxy ⎪ -P proxy
            This gives the address where the p0rn-proxy is running.  It is given in the form 'http://hostname:portnumber'.

            Default is to use 'http://localhost:8080' as this is the default port that p0rn-proxy listens to.

       --version ⎪ -V
            This prints the current version of japana and exits.
