NAME
       blockdomains - block list file format

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/blockdomains/acl/blocklist.acl

       ln -s ../acl/blocklist.acl /etc/blockdomains/blocked/

DESCRIPTION
       blockdomains uses one or more block list files which contain declaratios of the domains to block, one domain per line that starts with any number of whitespace characters followed by a period
       (".") before the domain to block. The blocking applies to the domain and all its sub domains.

           Anything not starting with a period (".") is a comment and leading whitespace is ignored. Block list domains start with optional whitespace and a period, followed by the domain name to block,
           optionally followed by a whitespace and a comment. Like the following:

       Example of block list

             .bad.domain.com -- domain name up to whitespace is blocked

           Blank lines are fine too; they treated as comments. The block list
           domains don't need to be column aligned. So, here is another:

           .another.domain.to.block
           End of block list example.
