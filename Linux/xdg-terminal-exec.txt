XDG-TERMINAL-EXEC(1)                                                                      General Commands Manual                                                                      XDG-TERMINAL-EXEC(1)

NAME
       xdg-terminal-exec - Default Terminal Execution Utility

SYNOPSIS
       xdg-terminal-exec [options] [--] [command [arguments ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       Shell-based implementation of the proposed Default Terminal Execution Specification. Launches preferred terminal emulator, with or without optionally supplied command.

       Terminal  emulators are selected among Desktop Entries that are installed on the system, or added by user according to XDG Desktop Entry Spec. Only valid Entries with TerminalEmulator category and
       X-TerminalArgExec= key set are considered (X-TerminalArgExec= key is not required in compat mode).

       Command execution argument is determined by Entry's X-TerminalArgExec= key, (assumed to be -e by default in compat mode). If an actual -e or matching execution argument is  given  on  the  command
       line, it will be silently discarded along with any unsupported dashed option given before unambiguous command.

       It is assumed that the emulator handles command line after the execution argument as is (preserved separate arguments).

OPTIONS
       Monolithic options starting with "--" are used to modify behavior of terminal (if supported by terminal and its entry):

       •   --app-id=app_id: set app-id (Wayland) or class (X11).
       •   --title=title: set tile of terminal.
       •   --dir=workdir: set workdir of terminal.
       •   --hold: instruct terminal to hold after command ends.

       Options for printing data instead of executing terminal:

       •   --print-id: print selected Desktop Entry ID. Action is appended delimited by ":".
       •   --print-path: print path to selected Desktop Entry. Action is appended delimited by ":".
       •   --print-content: print content of selected Desktop Entry. Conflicts with --print-cmd.
       •   --print-cmd[=printf_sequence]: print resulting command line, delimited by given printf sequence, "\n" by default. If sequence is "\n", output is also terminated with a newline.
       •   --print-delimiter=printf_sequence:  printf  sequenc  to be used as the delimiterprint between multiple requested statements, "\n" by default. If sequence is "\n", overall output is also termi‐
           nated with a newline (without duplication in case command output already terminated on a newline).

       Selected data is printed in order:

       •   id
       •   path
       •   content
       •   cmd

CONFIGURATION
       Preferred terminals are configured by listing them in config files named ${desktop}-xdg-terminals.list or xdg-terminals.list placed in XDG Config hierarchy.

       ${desktop} here is a lowercased string that is matched (case-insensitively) against items of ${XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP} (a colon-separated list of names for the current DE) in order of decreasing pri‐
       ority.

       The file is a simple newline-separated list. Empty lines and lines starting with "#" are ignored, dangling whitespaces are trimmed.

       Terminals are listed by their Desktop Entry ID:

           terminal.desktop

       Optionally with Action ID suffixed via ":":

           terminal.desktop:action

       Files are searched in XDG Config directories in the order of decreasing priority. In each directory, prefixed files are parsed first, in the  order  listed  in  ${XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP}.  Unprefixed
       files parsed last in each dir.

       The first listed, found, and valid Desktop Entry is used.

       Otherwise fallback to the first found and valid Desktop Entry is performed.

       Entries can be excluded from fallback by listing their ID prefixed with "-":

           -terminal.desktop

       Prefixing entry with "+" will prevent it from later exclusion (first encountered directive wins):

           +terminal.desktop

       Special directives understood by this implementation (the first encountered directive is used):

           /enable_cache, /disable_cache

       The cache feature allows storing selected terminal command line in ${XDG_CACHE_HOME} to bypass reading and parsing of configuration and Desktop Entries until changes are detected in the listing of
       Desktop Entry files or config files (enabled by default).

           /execarg_compat, /execarg_strict

       Compat mode (currently enabled by default) allows support for legacy [X-]ExecArg key and allows entries without execution argument, providing -e default.

           /execarg_default:entry.desktop:arg

       Customize defaults for execution arguments of specific terminal entries (only in compat mode).

FILES
       Default paths for configuration files (in order of decreasing priority):

       In ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}:
       •   ${HOME}/.config/${desktop}-xdg-terminals.list
       •   ${HOME}/.config/xdg-terminals.list

       In ${XDG_CONFIG_DIRS}:
       •   /etc/xdg/${desktop}-xdg-terminals.list
       •   /etc/xdg/xdg-terminals.list

       In ${XDG_DATA_DIRS}:
       •   /usr/share/xdg-terminal-exec/${desktop}-xdg-terminals.list
       •   /usr/share/xdg-terminal-exec/xdg-terminals.list

       Default directories for Desktop Entries (in order of decreasing priority):

       in ${XDG_DATA_HOME}:
       •   ${HOME}/.local/share/applications/

       in ${XDG_DATA_DIRS}:
       •   /usr/local/share/applications/
       •   /usr/share/applications/

       Cache file:
       •   ${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/xdg-terminal-exec

ENVIRONMENT
       XTE_CACHE_ENABLED (truthy or falsy value)
           Enable or disable cache feature.

       DEBUG (truthy or falsy value)
           Print debug info to stderr.
