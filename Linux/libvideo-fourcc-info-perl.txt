NAME
       Video::FourCC::Info - Perl module to retrieve information about FourCCs

VERSION
       Version 1.005 ($Id: Info.pm 10585 2009-12-22 02:50:06Z FREQUENCY@cpan.org $)

DESCRIPTION
       In order for video players to detect the algorithm required to decode a given video file, a four-byte sequence called a Four Character Code is written somewhere in the header of the file. This
       ensures that the detected codec format is independent of the file extension, which may be incorrect due to human error or for some other reason.

       This is similar to the four-byte "magic number" used by the UNIX file(1) command to roughly determine a file format.

       Most applications seem to treat this as a case insensitive code. As a result, internally, your given FourCC's will be silently converted to uppercase.

SYNOPSIS
         use Video::FourCC::Info;

         my $codec = Video::FourCC::Info->new('DIV3');

         printf "Codec description: %s\n", $codec->description;

COMPATIBILITY
       This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However, because it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be compatible with any version of Perl that supports
       its prerequisite modules.

       If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture, please contact the maintainer.

METHODS
   new
         Video::FourCC::Info->new( $fourcc )

       Creates a "Video::FourCC::Info" object, which provides information about the given Four Character Code. If the code does not exist in the database, it will return an error.

       Example code:

         my $codec = Video::FourCC::Info->new('DIV3');

       This method will return an appropriate Video::FourCC::Info object or throw an exception on error.

   describe
         Video::FourCC::Info->describe( $fourcc )

       This is really just a shortcut to grab the short description of a codec given a Four Character Code as input. Note that this is a class method, not an object method.

       Example code:

         my $codec_desc = Video::FourCC::Info->describe('DIV3');

       Internally, this method creates a temporary object and returns the description, destroying the object due to falling out of scope. If you already have a "Video::FourCC::Info" object, then the
       description accessor will provide better performance.

       Note, that just like "new", this class method may throw an exception if the Four Character Code does not exist in the database.

       Remember that this value could be "undef" if the information is unknown.

   description
         $codec->description( )

       This returns the short description of the codec. It may be "undef" if there is no description in the database.

       Example code:

         my $codec_desc = $codec->description;

       Remember that this value could be "undef" if the information is unknown.

   registered
         $codec->registered( )

       This returns the short description of the codec. It may be "undef" if there is no description in the database.

       If "DateTime" is installed, then this will be a DateTime object. Otherwise, it will simply be a string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd".

       Example code:

         my $registered = $codec->registered;

       Remember that this value could be "undef" if the information is unknown.

   owner
         $codec->owner( )

       This returns the name of the corporation or other entity that owns the FourCC. Generally, this seems to be an ad-hoc standard, so it's a listing of the first entity known to use the given FourCC.

       Example code:

         my $owner_name = $codec->owner;

       Remember that this value could be "undef" if the information is unknown.

   code
         $codec->code( )

       This returns the Four Character Code corresponding to the current "Video::FourCC::Info" object.

       Example code:

         my $fourcc = $codec->fourcc;
