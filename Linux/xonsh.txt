NAME
       xonsh - Pythonish, BASHwards looking shell

DESCRIPTION
       Xonsh  is a Python-ish shell language and command prompt. Unlike other shells, xonsh is based on Python, with additional syntax added that makes calling subprocess commands, manipulating the envi‐
       ronment, and dealing with the file system easy. Xonsh supports all normal Python constructs and a subset of those available in bash.

       usage: xonsh [-h] [-V] [-c COMMAND] [-i] [-l] [--rc RC [RC ...]] [--no-rc]

              [--no-env] [--no-script-cache] [--cache-everything] [-D ITEM] [-st SHELL_TYPE] [--timings] [script-file] ...

       xonsh

   positional arguments:
       script-file

       ~/.xonshrc

              Per-user static config file
