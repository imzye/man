NAME
       f2java - produce java source and java class from Fortran file

SYNOPSIS
       f2java file file Fortran file to transform

DESCRIPTION
       If you translate a Fortran file with "f2java test.f", it will produce one class file and one Java source file for each program unit.  We end up with several generated files: .java, .class.

       Before attempting to run the code, make sure that the org.netlib.util package (contained in f2jutil.jar) is in your CLASSPATH.
