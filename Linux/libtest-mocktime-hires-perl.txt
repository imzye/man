NAME
       Test::MockTime::HiRes - Replaces actual time with simulated high resolution time

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::MockTime::HiRes qw(mock_time);

           my $now = time;
           mock_time {
               time;    # == $now;

               sleep 3; # returns immediately

               time;    # == $now + 3;

               usleep $microsecond;
           } $now;

DESCRIPTION
       "Test::MockTime::HiRes" is a Time::HiRes compatible version of Test::MockTime.  You can wait milliseconds in simulated time.

       It also provides "mock_time" to restrict the effect of the simulation in a code block.
