NAME
       asylum - a surreal platform shooting game

SYNOPSIS
       asylum

DESCRIPTION
       Young Sigmund has a few problems.  To help him resolve his mental instability, you must enter the surreal world of his inner mind and shut down the malfunctioning brain cells.

HOW TO PLAY
       The  game revolves around shooting anything which moves, collecting anything which doesn't move, and, most importantly, finding your way to each of the eight pulsating neurons scattered throughout
       the immense map.  Use Z, X, ; and .  to move and Enter to fire, or remap the keys to something you like better.

       The one game feature which does merit explicit instruction is teleporting.  In the first level ("Ego") the teleporters look like candelabra.  To use a teleporter, stand in  its  centre  and  press
       "down" (that's .  with the default key settings).
