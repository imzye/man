   Writing:
              To add a new entry into your journal, simply write it on the command line:

              jrnl yesterday: I was walking and I found this big log.

              The date and the following colon ("yesterday:") are optional. If you leave them out, "now" will be used:

              jrnl Then I rolled the log over.

              Also, you can mark extra special entries ("star" them) with an asterisk:

              jrnl *And underneath was a tiny little stick.

              Please note that asterisks might be a special character in your shell, so you might have to escape them. When in doubt about escaping, put quotes around your entire entry:

              jrnl "saturday at 2am: *Then I was like 'That log had a child!'"
