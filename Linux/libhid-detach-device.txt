NAME
       libhid-detach-device - simple tool to take away control over a HID from the kernel HID driver's

SYNOPSIS
       libhid-detach-device dead:beef

DESCRIPTION
       libhid-detach-device removes the device identified by the ID string (as output by lsusb) from under the kernel HID driver's control. Subsequently, programmes using libhid can access the HID's descrip‐
       tors from user-space (and lsusb -vvv can give information about the HID usages).
