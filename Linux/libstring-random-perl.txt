NAME
       String::Random - Perl module to generate random strings based on a pattern

VERSION
       version 0.32

SYNOPSIS
           use String::Random;
           my $string_gen = String::Random->new;
           print $string_gen->randregex('\d\d\d'); # Prints 3 random digits
           # Prints 3 random printable characters
           print $string_gen->randpattern("...");

       or

           use String::Random qw(random_regex random_string);
           print random_regex('\d\d\d'); # Also prints 3 random digits
           print random_string("...");   # Also prints 3 random printable characters

DESCRIPTION
       This module makes it trivial to generate random strings.

       As an example, let's say you are writing a script that needs to generate a random password for a user.  The relevant code might look something like this:

           use String::Random;
           my $pass = String::Random->new;
           print "Your password is ", $pass->randpattern("CCcc!ccn"), "\n";

       This would output something like this:

         Your password is UDwp$tj5

       NOTE!!!: currently, "String::Random" defaults to Perl's built-in predictable random number generator so the passwords generated by it are insecure.  See the "rand_gen" option to "String::Random"
       constructor to specify a more secure random number generator.  There is no equivalent to this in the procedural interface, you must use the object-oriented interface to get this functionality.

       If you are more comfortable dealing with regular expressions, the following code would have a similar result:

         use String::Random;
         my $pass = String::Random->new;
         print "Your password is ",
             $pass->randregex('[A-Z]{2}[a-z]{2}.[a-z]{2}\d'), "\n";

   Patterns
       The pre-defined patterns (for use with "randpattern()" and "random_pattern()") are as follows:

         c        Any Latin lowercase character [a-z]
         C        Any Latin uppercase character [A-Z]
         n        Any digit [0-9]
         !        A punctuation character [~`!@$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\:;"'.<>?/#,]
         .        Any of the above
         s        A "salt" character [A-Za-z0-9./]
         b        Any binary data

       These can be modified, but if you need a different pattern it is better to create another pattern, possibly using one of the pre-defined as a base.  For example, if you wanted a pattern "A" that
       contained all upper and lower case letters ("[A-Za-z]"), the following would work:

         my $gen = String::Random->new;
         $gen->{'A'} = [ 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z' ];

       or

         my $gen = String::Random->new;
         $gen->{'A'} = [ @{$gen->{'C'}}, @{$gen->{'c'}} ];

       or

         my $gen = String::Random->new;
         $gen->set_pattern(A => [ 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z' ]);

       The random_string function, described below, has an alternative interface for adding patterns.

   Methods
       new
       new max => number
       new rand_gen => sub
               Create a new String::Random object.

               Optionally  a  parameter  "max"  can  be  included  to specify the maximum number of characters to return for "*" and other regular expression patterns that do not return a fixed number of
               characters.

               Optionally a parameter "rand_gen" can be included to specify a subroutine coderef for generating the random numbers used in this module. The coderef must  accept  one  argument  "max"  and
               return an integer between 0 and "max - 1".  The default rand_gen coderef is

                sub {
                    my ($max) = @_;
                    return int rand $max;
                }

       randpattern LIST
               The randpattern method returns a random string based on the concatenation of all the pattern strings in the list.

               It will return a list of random strings corresponding to the pattern strings when used in list context.

       randregex LIST
               The randregex method returns a random string that will match the regular expression passed in the list argument.

               Please  note  that  the  arguments  to  randregex  are not real regular expressions.  Only a small subset of regular expression syntax is actually supported.  So far, the following regular
               expression elements are supported:

                 \w    Alphanumeric + "_".
                 \d    Digits.
                 \W    Printable characters other than those in \w.
                 \D    Printable characters other than those in \d.
                 .     Printable characters.
                 []    Character classes.
                 {}    Repetition.
                 *     Same as {0,}.
                 ?     Same as {0,1}.
                 +     Same as {1,}.

               Regular expression support is still somewhat incomplete.  Currently special characters inside [] are not supported (with the exception of "-" to denote ranges of characters).   The  parser
               doesn't care for spaces in the "regular expression" either.

       get_pattern STRING
               Return a pattern given a name.

                 my $gen = String::Random->new;
                 $gen->get_pattern('C');

               (Added in version 0.32.)

       set_pattern STRING ARRAYREF
               Add or redefine a pattern given a name and a character set.

                 my $gen = String::Random->new;
                 $gen->set_pattern(A => [ 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z' ]);

               (Added in version 0.32.)

       from_pattern
               IGNORE! - for compatibility with an old version. DO NOT USE!

   Functions
       random_string PATTERN,LIST
       random_string PATTERN
               When called with a single scalar argument, random_string returns a random string using that scalar as a pattern.  Optionally, references to lists containing other patterns can be passed to
               the function.  Those lists will be used for 0 through 9 in the pattern (meaning the maximum number of lists that can be passed is 10).  For example, the following code:

                   print random_string("0101",
                                       ["a", "b", "c"],
                                       ["d", "e", "f"]), "\n";

               would print something like this:

                   cebd

       random_regex REGEX_IN_STRING
               Prints a string for the regular expression given as the string. See the synposis for example.
