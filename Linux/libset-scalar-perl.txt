Set::Scalar::Universe(3pm)                                                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                          Set::Scalar::Universe(3pm)

NAME
       Set::Scalar::Universe - universes for set members

SYNOPSIS
       Do not use directly.

DESCRIPTION
       There are only two guaranteed interfaces, both sort of indirect.

       The first one is accessing the universe of a set:

           $set->universe

       This contains the members of the universe

           $set->universe->members

       of the $set.

       The second supported interface is displaying set universes.

           print $set->universe, "\n";

       This will display the members of the set inside square brackets: [], as opposed to sets,  which have their members shown inside parentheses: ().
