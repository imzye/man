sesearch(1)         SETools: SELinux Policy Analysis Tools         sesearch(1)

NAME
       sesearch - SELinux policy query tool

SYNOPSIS
       sesearch [OPTIONS] [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION] [POLICY]

DESCRIPTION
       sesearch allows the user to search the rules in a SELinux policy.

POLICY
       A single file containing a binary policy. This file is usually named by
       version on Linux systems, for example, policy.30. This file is  usually
       named  sepolicy  on  Android  systems.   If no policy file is provided,
       sesearch will search for the policy running on the current  system.  If
       no policy can be found, sesearch will print an error message and exit.

EXPRESSIONS
       The  user  may  specify  an  expression  containing  values for a given
       field(s) in a rule.  If no expression is specified or if  none  of  the
       specified fields apply to a given rule type, all rules of that type are
       considered to match the expression.

   RBAC Rule Types
       --role_allow
              Find role allow rules.

       --role_trans
              Find role_transition rules.

   MLS Rule Types
       --range_trans
              Find range_transition rules.

   Rule Fields
       -s NAME, --source NAME
              Find rules with NAME as their source type/role.

       -t NAME, --target NAME
              Find rules with NAME as their target type/role.

       -D NAME, --default NAME
              Find rules with NAME as their default type/role/level.

       -c NAME, --class NAME
              Find rules with NAME as their object class.

       -p P1[,P2,...] --perm P1[,P2...]
              Find rules with at least one of the specified permissions.  Mul‐
              tiple permissions may be specified as a comma-separated list.

       -b BOOL[,B2,...], --bool BOOL[,B2,...]
              Find  conditional  rules  with the named Boolean in their condi‐
              tional expression.  Multiple Booleans  may  be  specified  as  a
              comma-separated  list.   This  option will include rules in both
              the true and false lists of the conditional.

   Search Options
       The following additional options modify how the search is performed.

       -ds    A   matching   rule   must    have    the    specified    source
              attribute/type/role explicitly, instead of matching by attribute
              contents.

       -dt    A   matching   rule   must    have    the    specified    target
              attribute/type/role explicitly, instead of matching by attribute
              contents.

       -eb    A matching rule must have all  specified  Booleans,  instead  of
              matching any of the specified Boolean.

       -ep    A  matching rule must have all specified permissions, instead of
              matching any of the specified permission.

       -rs    Use regular expression for matching the source type/role.

       -rt    Use regular expression for matching the target type/role.

       -rc    Use regular expression for matching the object class.

       -rd    Use regular expression for matching the default type/role.

       -rb    Use regular expression for matching Booleans.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help information and exit.

       --version
              Print version information and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Print additional informational messages.
