NAME
       MooseX::TraitFor::Meta::TypeConstraint::Mooish - Handle Moo-style constraints

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.001 of MooseX::TraitFor::Meta::TypeConstraint::Mooish - released March 12, 2015 as part of MooseX-Meta-TypeConstraint-Mooish.

SYNOPSIS
       This trait implements the functionality described in MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::Mooish, and you, dear reader, are encouraged to read about it over there.  Here we simply document the nuts and
       bolts.

DESCRIPTION
           # determining where this goes is left as an exercise for the reader
           with 'MooseX::TraitFor::Meta::TypeConstraint::Mooish';

ATTRIBUTES
   original_constraint
       The original constraint CodeRef is stashed away here.

   mooish
       If true, the constraint should be considered written in the style of Moo constraints; that is, if an exception is thrown the constraint is considered to have failed; otherwise it passes.  Return
       values are ignored.

       Default is true.

METHODS
   original_constraint()
       Reader for the "original_constraint" attribute; returns the original constraint as passed to new().

   has_original_constraint()
       Predicate for the "original_constraint" attribute.

   mooish()
       Reader for the "mooish" attribute.

   compile_type_constraint
       If "mooish" is true, we wrap the "original_constraint" in a sub that translates Moo behaviors (die on fail; otherwise success) to Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint expectations (false on fail; true on
       success).

       We stash the original constraint in "original_constraint" (surprise!), and set the constraint attribute to the wrapped constraint.

   create_child_type
       Subtypes created here are not mooish, unless an explicit "mooish =" 1> is passed.
