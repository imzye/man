SYNOPSIS

       #include <haveged/havege.h>
       H_PARAMS params = {0};
       h_status status;
       char     status_buf[512];

       if (NULL==havege_version(HAVEGE_PREP_VERSION)) exit(1);
       H_PTR handle = havege_create(&params);
       havege_status(handle, &status);
       havege_run(handle);
       rc = havege_rng(handle, handle->io_buf, handle->i_readSz/sizeof(H_UINT));
       havege_status_dump(handle, H_SD_TOPIC_BUILD, status_buf, sizeof(status_buf));
       havege_destroy(handle);

DESCRIPTION
       The  libhavege  library provides the haveged random number generator and it's associated tuning and testing facilities in a development sub-package. All haveged conditional build features are pre‐
       served and all haveged options not directly related to it's daemon or file system interfaces are available. This means that the same haveged tuning and testing components are present  in  the  li‐
       brary with the equivalent controls provided by the haveged command line.

API METHODS
       The  libhavege  library uses the opaque handle technique to manage it's required resources. Errors are returned in the "error" member of the handle. The havege_destroy() method should be called to
       dispose of any resources claimed by havege_create().

       H_PTR havege_create(H_PARAMS *params);

       Create an anchor. Most members of the H_PARAMS input to this call correspond closely to haveged command line options (see haveged(8) for details). The caller should check  for  a  non-null  return
       value with a error value of H_NOERR. Any non-null return should be disposed of by a call to havege_destroy() to free any resources. Possible error values: H_NOERR, H_NOTESTSPEC, H_NOBUF, H_NOTEST‐
       MEM, H_NOINIT

       void havege_destroy(H_PTR hptr);

       Free  all  allocated  anchor  resources.  If  the  multi-core  option  is used, this method should be called from a signal handler to prevent zombie processes. If called by the process that called
       haveged_create(), hptr will be freed when all child processes (if any) have terminated. If called by a child process, H_EXIT will be set and all children awakened to exit.

       int havege_rng(H_PTR hptr, H_UINT *buf, H_UINT sz);

       Read random bytes from an active anchor. The RNG must have been previously readied by a call to havege_run(). The read must take place within the allocated buffer, hptr->io_buf. The  range  speci‐
       fied  is the number of H_UINT to read. If the multi-core option is used, this buffer is memory mapped between collectors.  Possible error values: H_NOERR, H_NOTESRUN, H_NOPOST, H_NODONE, H_NORQST,
       H_NOCOMP, H_EXIT

       int havege_run(H_PTR hptr);

       Warm up the RNG and run the start-up tests. The operation succeeded if the error member of the handle is H_NOERR. A failed handle should be disposed of by a call to havege_destroy(). Possible  er‐
       ror values: H_NOERR, H_NOCOLLECT, H_NOWALK, H_NOTESTMEM, H_NOTASK, H_NOTESTTOT, H_NOWAIT, H_NOTIMER, and any havege_rng() error.

       void havege_status(H_PTR hptr, H_STATUS hsts);

       Fills in the h_status structure with read-only information collected from the package build, run-time tuning, and test components.

       int havege_status_dump(H_PTR hptr, H_SD_TOPIC topic, char *buf, size_t len);

       Calls havege_status() and formats standard presentations of havege status in the supplied buffer. The standard formats are:

              H_SD_TOPIC_BUILD

              ver: %s; arch: %s; vend: %s; build: (%s); collect: %dK

              H_SD_TOPIC_TUNE

              cpu: (%s); data: %dK (%s); inst: %dK (%s); idx: %d/%d; sz: %d/%d

              H_SD_TOPIC_TEST

              [tot tests(%s): A:%d/%d B: %d/%d;][continuous tests(%s): A:%d/%d B: %d/%d;][last entropy estimate %g]

              H_SD_TOPIC_SUM

              fills: %d, generated: %.4g %c bytes

       const char *havege_version(const char *version);

       Return/check  library  prep  version. The prep version is the package version used to build the library. A null argument returns the prep version unconditionally.  Using the definition of the prep
       string in havege.h as input returns the prep version if the header file is compatible with the library, or NULL if it is not. Intended to be called before attempting any initialization.

NOTES
       The sizes of the processor level 1 instruction and data caches are used to tune the HAVEGE algorithm for maximum sensitivity. If these sizes not specified, haveged will attempt  to  determine  the
       sizes dynamically from the Linux sysfs and/or cpuid instruction with a fallback to a compiled default if no better information is not available.

       The  haveged  RNG includes a run time test facility based upon the test suite defined in the AIS-31 specification from the The German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicher‐
       heit in der Informationstechnik). The test suite consists of 11 statistical tests packaged into two test suites ("A" and "B"). The tests can be run at initialization (a.k.a. a "tot" test), or con‐
       tinuously to monitor all output. Failure of a suite will abort operation unless the behavior is explicitly waived in the test setup options.

       Procedure A contains 6 test procedures designed to ensure statistically inconspicuous behavior. The first test, "test0", checks the disjointedness of 65k six-bit strings. The remainder of the pro‐
       cedure consists of 257 repetitions of the FIPS140-1 tests, "test1" through "test4", and an auto-correlation test, "test5". The fixed size of the Procedure A input makes  it  ideal  for  continuous
       use,  but the procedure is slow and resource intensive. In particular, test5 is several orders of magnitude slower than any other individual AIS test. As an alternative for those who cannot toler‐
       ate this load, procedure A variants A<n> are provided that execute all included tests but execute test5 only every 2^n repetitions. Even with this accommodation, procedure A is  much  slower  than
       procedure B.

       Procedure  B  contains 5 tests, "test6a", "test6b', "test7a", "test7b", and "test8". The first 4 tests verify the expected frequencies for samples 100,000 one-step, two-step, three-step, and four-
       step bit transitions. The last test provides an empirical entropy estimate of the input. The input required to complete these tests is variable, resulting in an ever-shifting  bit  alignment  that
       guards against buffering artifacts.

       Each  test  procedure  requires  more  than  1MB  of data. Test input is managed by a bit index into the collection buffer. An independent index manages where integer output is taken from the same
       buffer. A buffer fill is triggered when the output index indicates all data has been extracted from the buffer. Online testing takes place after the buffer has been refilled but before the  output
       index  update  allows  output  to  resume.  If any online test fails while processing the buffer, the buffer will be refilled and reprocessed until any retry is complete and the buffer contains no
       failed online tests or the online test procedure has failed and the RNG is considered broken.

       It is recommend to run both AIS test procedures at start-up to ensure the  RNG is properly initialized. If resources are in short supply, omitting procedure A will save memory and time, with  lit‐
       tle risk in circumstances where output is mixed with other sources in /dev/random or other csprng. Continuous testing is also recommended where the throughput penalty is acceptable. One recent as‐
       sessment of testing throughput costs is shown below.

              haveged -n0 -oc | pv > /dev/null        400MiB/s

              haveged -n0 -ocb | pv > /dev/null       70MiB/s

              haveged -n0 -oca8b | pv > /dev/null     13MiB/s

              haveged -n0 -oca8 | pv > /dev/null      8MiB/s

              haveged -n0 -oca | pv > /dev/null       100kiB/s

       Continuous testing also exposes another possible pitfall. Even an ideal RNG has a 10e-4 chance of failing either test procedure. The strict retry policy of AIS-31 is designed to guarantee an ideal
       RNG will "almost never" fail a test procedure. A single retry is mandated only to recover from a previous attempt that experienced a single individual test failure. The haveged implementation logs
       all  retries  and terminates on test procedure failures unless the procedure has been flagged as advisory by the "w" argument (see --onlinetest in haveged(8) ). Little evidence of the retry mecha‐
       nism is seen unless large data sets are processed. Procedure A is too slow to be practical in these situations, so procedure B has been the best studied. Retries are observed  at  the  approximate
       rate of 0.7-0.8 failures/GB, mostly in the test7 multi-step transition checks.

       The probability that procedureB will fail two times in a row (in which case the program will be terminated unless w option was specified) is 4e-7 which is expected to happen at an approximate rate
       of  once per 3,000 TB. When producing large amounts of data in order of TBs it's recommended to use -w option to make sure that program will not prematurely terminate because of a failed retry and
       carefully examine the stderr output for any problems.

EXAMPLE
       The following minimal program writes the contents of 16 collection buffers of random data to stdout with continuous testing.

       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <haveged/havege.h>
       int main(void)
       {
       H_PTR havege_state;
       H_PARAMS havege_parameters = {0};
       int i, rc;

       if (NULL==havege_version(HAVEGE_PREP_VERSION)) {
         fprintf(stderr, "Incompatible library %s\n", havege_version(NULL));
         return 1;
         }
       havege_parameters.testSpec="ta8bcb";
       havege_state = havege_create(&havege_parameters);
       rc = havege_state==NULL? H_NOHANDLE : havege_state->error;
       if (H_NOERR==rc) {
         if (0==havege_run(havege_state)) {
           H_UINT *buf = havege_state->io_buf;
           int size = havege_state->i_readSz /sizeof(H_UINT);
           char info[256];

           for(i=0;i<16;i++) {
               rc = havege_rng(havege_state, buf, size);
               if (rc != size) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "RNG read failed %d\n", havege_state->error);
                   break;
                   }
               rc = fwrite(buf, 1, size*sizeof(H_UINT), stdout);
               if ( rc < size ) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "Write failed\n");
                   break;
                   }
               }
           i = havege_status_dump(havege_state, H_SD_TOPIC_TEST, info, sizeof(info));
           info[i++] = '\n';
           havege_status_dump(havege_state, H_SD_TOPIC_SUM, info+i, sizeof(info)-i);
           fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", info);
           }
         else fprintf(stderr, "Initialize failed %d\n", havege_state->error);
         havege_destroy(havege_state);
         }
       else fprintf(stderr, "Create failed %d\n", rc);
       return rc;
       }

       Defaults are provided for all inputs to havege_create() as documented in havege.h. In this case for example, (16*4kb=65kb) will be written to stdout because the default size for i_readsz in 4kb.
