NAME
       fips-mode-setup - Check or enable the system FIPS mode.

SYNOPSIS
       fips-mode-setup [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       fips-mode-setup(8) is used to check and control the system FIPS mode.

       When enabling the system FIPS mode the command completes the installation of FIPS modules if needed by calling fips-finish-install and changes the system crypto policy to FIPS.

       Then the command modifies the boot loader configuration to add fips=1 and boot=<boot-device> options to the kernel command line.

       When disabling the system FIPS mode the system crypto policy is switched to DEFAULT and the kernel command line option fips=0 is set.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available in fips-mode-setup tool.

       •   --enable: Enables the system FIPS mode.

       •   --disable: Undo some of the FIPS-enablement steps (unsupported).

       •   --check: Checks the system FIPS mode status.

       •   --is-enabled: Checks the system FIPS mode status and returns failure error code if disabled (2) or inconsistent (1).

       •   --no-bootcfg: The tool will not attempt to change the boot loader configuration and it just prints the options that need to be added to the kernel command line.

FILES

           The kernel FIPS mode flag.
