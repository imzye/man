NAME
       IPC::Filter - filter data through an external process

SYNOPSIS
           use IPC::Filter qw(filter);

           $compressed_data = filter($data, "bzip2");

DESCRIPTION
       The "filter" function provided by this module passes data through an external command, thus providing filtering in non-pipeline situations.

FUNCTIONS
       filter(DATA, SHELL_COMMAND)
       filter(DATA, PROGRAM, ARGS ...)
           The  SHELL_COMMAND,  or  the PROGRAM with ARGS if more arguments are supplied, is executed as a separate process.  (The arguments other than DATA are ultimately passed to "exec"; see "exec" in
           perlfunc(1) for explanation of the choice between the two forms.)  The DATA (which must be either a simple string or a reference to a string) is supplied to the process on its standard  input,
           and the process's standard output is captured and returned (as a simple string).

           If  the  process  exits  with  a non-zero exit code or on a signal, the function will "die".  In the case of a non-zero exit code, the "die" message will duplicate the process's standard error
           output; in any other case, the error output is discarded.
