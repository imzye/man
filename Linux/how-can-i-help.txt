HOW-CAN-I-HELP(1)                                                                                                                                                                         HOW-CAN-I-HELP(1)

NAME
       how-can-i-help - show opportunities for contributing to Debian

SYNOPSIS
       how-can-i-help [-haoqs] [--help] [--all] [--old] [--quiet] [--show <type>...]

DESCRIPTION
       how-can-i-help hooks into APT to list opportunities for contributions to Debian (orphaned packages, bugs tagged newcomer) for packages installed locally, after each APT invocation. It can also be
       invoked directly, and then lists all opportunities for contribution (not just the new ones).

OPTIONS
       Options must come before the other command line arguments.

       -h, --help
           Show some help.

       -a, --all
           Show new opportunities for contribution to all available Debian packages.

       -o, --old
           Show opportunities that were already shown before (will also show the new ones).

       -q, --quiet
           Do not display header and footer.

       -j, --json
           Display output in JSON format.

       -p, --apt
           Always exit with code 0. By default run by apt hook to prevent apt failures.

       -s <type>..., --show <type>...
           Show only specific types of opportunities. Provided types have to be separated by commas.

       --download, --no-download
           Enable or disable updating the cache when it is present. The cache is updated by default and when it is missing.

       --installed-packages, --no-installed-packages
           Enable or disable showing opportunities for packages installed locally.

       --autorm-days <N>
           Only show autoremovals within the next N days.

PROXY SUPPORT
       how-can-i-help uses the HTTP_PROXY (or http_proxy) environment variable as HTTP proxy configuration.

RUNNING ON REGULAR BASIS
       You can run how-can-i-help in a cron job as a normal user so that you receive a mail when new things are reported. To receive only mails when new contributions are reported, use the -q flag.

       Crontab example:

           0 8 * * * how-can-i-help -q

DISPLAY OUTPUT IN JSON FORMAT
       how-can-i-help can be configured to provide machine readable JSON output. When running in this mode, only error messages and JSON output will be produced. If there are no packages that would be
       shown, no output will be produced. Elements in the JSON output are not sorted. All the other options can be used alongside the --json option.

       Simple example:

           how-can-i-help --json --show testing-autorm

EXIT CODES
       When run by apt hook, how-can-i-help will always exit with code 0, even if an error occurred. When how-can-i-help is called without --apt option, import and command line parsing errors will still
       exit with code 0, but all the other errors will return appropriate exit codes. Regardless of the --apt option, all error messages will be displayed normally.

SHOW ONLY SPECIFIC TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES
       how-can-i-help can be configured to show only specific types of opportunities. You only need to run it with --show option followed by a single space and then a list of types. Types have to be
       separated only by commas.

       Simple example:

           how-can-i-help --show newcomer,RFH

       Example showing newcomer opportunities (also the ones that were already shown before):

           how-can-i-help --old --show newcomer

       The following types can be used: wnpp, newcomer, help, no-testing, testing-autorm, rfs

       Specific WNPP types: O, RFA, RFH, ITA

       And special types: pseudo-package

IGNORE SELECTED TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES
       how-can-i-help can also ignore selected types of opportunities. These are listed in ~/.config/how-can-i-help/ignored separated by whitespaces or newlines.

       Allowed types: wnpp, newcomer, help, no-testing, testing-autorm, rfs

       Allowed WNPP types: O, RFA, RFH, ITA

       Allowed special types: pseudo-package

       Running with --show option will override "ignored types" configuration.

TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES
       The following acronyms are used to describe the supported types:

       wnpp Work-Needing and Prospective Packages.

       newcomer Bugs tagged with the newcomer tag. Those bugs were formerly tagged with the now deprecated gift tag.

       help Bugs tagged with the help tag.

       no-testing Packages removed from Debian testing.

       testing-autorm Packages going to be removed from Debian testing.

       rfs Request For Sponsorship.

       O Orphaned.

       RFA Request For Adoption.

       RFH Request For Help.

       ITA Intent To Adopt.

       pseudo-package Newcomer bugs affecting Debian infrastructure (general Debian services). Those pseudo-packages cannot be installed.

ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
       how-can-i-help can also monitor packages not installed locally. These are listed in ~/.config/how-can-i-help/packages separated by whitespaces or newlines.

       For example one can monitor all package from a server as follow:

           # ssh myserver dpkg-query -W -f \''${Package}\n'\' \
               >> ~/.config/how-can-i-help/packages
