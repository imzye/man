NAME
       wmppp - Graphically monitor the average PPP load

SYNOPSIS
       wmppp [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       wmppp.app  displays a dynamic representation of the load on the PPP line on a 64x64 miniwindow. It also starts and stops the connection and displays the time
       enlapsed since the it came up. The traffic on the interface is also monitored.

OPTIONS
       -display <display name>
              name of display to use

       -geometry +XPOS+YPOS
              initial window position

       -t     sets the on-line timer to display MM:SS instead of the default HH:MM.

       -u <update rate>
              sets the frequency, in seconds, for updates to the display.  Valid range is 1-10, default value is 5.

       -i <device>
              choose the net device (ppp1, ippp0, etc.) to monitor.  (Note that this feature is EXPERIMENTAL and should be used with caution.  Bug reports are  wel‐
              comed.)

       -speed <cmd>
              command to report connection speed

       -start <cmd>
              command to connect

       -stop <cmd>
              command to disconnect

       -ifdown <cmd>
              command to redial

       -stampfile <path>
              file used to calculate uptime

       -h     displays a command line summary

       -v     displays the version number.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file (see below) may contain any of the following key-value pairs. The format is key: value.  Note that these values will be overwritten by
       the corresponding command line options.

       start  The program that starts the connection

       stop   The program that stops the connection

       speed  This program reports the speed of the connection. This program should output <speed>, that is, a number is expected and not the whole

       ifdown This program is run if the line goes down, and the stop program hasn't been run. (Redial program)

       stampfile
              The modification time of this file is used to calculate the amount of time the connection has been up. Something like touch <stampfile> should be  run
              for this to work.

FILES
       /var/run/wmppp.ppp0
              this is the stamp file use to determine the amount of time enlapsed since the connection came up. This file should be managed by the ip-up and ip-down
              scripts. On Debian systems, /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00wmppp creates the file, and /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/00wmppp removes it.

       /etc/wmppprc
              System wide defaults

       $HOME/.wmppprc
              User defined settings

       /etc/wmppprc.fixed
              System wide fixed options, this overrides the user settings
