NAME
       autobuildrequires - Work out the BuildRequires of an RPM build
       automatically

SYNOPSIS
         auto-br-rpmbuild -ba foo.spec

         auto-br [build-command ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Autobuildrequires analyzes an RPM package build to find out what
       BuildRequires lines it needs.

       Instead of using "rpmbuild", use this command:

        auto-br-rpmbuild -ba foo.spec

       (all the usual rpmbuild flags are supported).  The command will build
       your package and then output a list of "BuildRequires" lines that it
       thinks your package needs.

       If your build command is more complex and/or doesn't use rpmbuild, then
       use:

        auto-br [build-command ...]

       For example:

        auto-br make

HOW IT WORKS
       The basic "magic" is a C "LD_PRELOAD" module,
       auto-buildrequires-preload.c, which intercepts some system calls to
       determine which files the build is looking at.  Those get logged to a
       simple text file.

       The Perl analysis script, auto-br-analyze.pl, runs afterwards on the
       logfile, and uses rpm to find out which packages those files belong to.
       Those are printed out as the list of BuildRequires.

       A shell script, auto-br, brings the whole thing together.

EXIT STATUS
       This program returns 0 if successful, or non-zero if there was an
       error.
