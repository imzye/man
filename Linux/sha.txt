NAME
       sha - file hashing utility

SYNOPSIS
       sha [-12345Vh] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       sha  is  a simple program that hashes files. It uses the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Secure Hash Algorithm.  It can use SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512, which generate respec‐
       tively, hashes of 160, 256, 384, or 512 bits.  sha can be used in scripts to do, for example, file integrity checking.

OPTIONS
       -1     Use SHA-1, which produces a 160-bit hash (40 hex digits).

       -2     Use SHA-256, which produces a 256-bit hash (64 hex digits).

       -3     Use SHA-384, which produces a 384-bit hash (96 hex digits).

       -5     Use SHA-512, which produces a 512-bit hash (128 hex digits).

       -V     Display version information.

       -h     Display help summary.

       file ...
              One or more files to hash. If no files are given, stdin is hashed.

       If neither -1, -2, -3, or -5 are given, then SHA-1 is used. (But see note about SHA_DEFAULT below.)

ENVIRONMENT
       SHA_DEFAULT
              The default hash algorithm to use. ``1'' denotes SHA-1, ``2'' denotes SHA-256, ``3'' denotes SHA-384, and ``5'' denotes SHA-512. Only the first character is significant. If not  defined,  SHA-1
              is the default.

                                                                                                August 19, 2001                                                                                          SHA(1)
