NAME
       Test::Regression - Test library that can be run in two modes; one to generate outputs and a second to compare against them

VERSION
       Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::Regression;

         ok_regression(sub {return "hello world"}, "t/out/hello_world.txt");

DESCRIPTION
       Using the various Test:: modules you can compare the output of a function against what you expect. However if the output is complex and changes from version to version, maintenance of the expected
       output could be costly. This module allows one to use the test code to generate the expected output, so that if the differences with model output are expected, one can easily refresh the model
       output.

EXPORT
       ok_regression

FUNCTIONS
   ok_regression
       This function requires two arguments: a CODE ref and a file path. The CODE ref is expected to return a SCALAR string which can be compared against previous runs. If the TEST_REGRESSION_GEN is set
       to a true value, then the CODE ref is run and the output written to the file. Otherwise the output of the file is compared against the contents of the file.  There is a third optional argument
       which is the test name.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   TEST_REGRESSION_GEN
       If the TEST_REGRESSION_GEN environment file is unset or false in a perl sense, then the named output files must exist and be readable and the test will run normally comparing the outputs of the
       CODE refs against the contents of those files. If the environment variable is true in a perl sense, then model output files will be overwritten with the output of the CODE ref.

BUGS
       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-test-regression at rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Test-Regression>.  I will be
       notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

   testing of STDERR
       The testing of stderr from this module is not as thorough as I would like.  Test::Builder::Tester allows turning off of stderr checking but not matching by regular expression. Handcrafted efforts
       currently fall foul of Test::Harness. Still it is I believe adequately tested in terms of coverage.

SUPPORT
       You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.
