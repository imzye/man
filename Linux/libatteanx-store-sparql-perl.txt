NAME
       Test::Attean::Store::SPARQL::Role::CreateStore - Create a SPARQL store for tests

SYNOPSIS
       Either:

         use Test::More;
         use Test::Roo;
         with 'Test::Attean::TripleStore', 'Test::Attean::Store::SPARQL::Role::CreateStore';
         run_me;
         done_testing;

       or:

         package TestCreateStore {
               use Moo;
               with 'Test::Attean::Store::SPARQL::Role::CreateStore';
         };
         my $triples = [
                                          triple(iri('http://example.org/bar'), iri('http://example.org/c'), iri('http://example.org/foo')),
                      # [...]
                                         ];

         my $test = TestCreateStore->new;
         my $store = $test->create_store(triples => $triples);

DESCRIPTION
       There are two ways of using this. The original idea is to use it to test a triple/quad that uses Test::Attean::TripleStore, like in the first example in the synopsis.

       It is also possible to utilize this role like in the second example to create a store for testing other parts of the code too. In that example, first wrap a class around the role, then create an
       arrayref of triples, which should be used to populate the store. Then, instantiate an object of the class, and call it's "create_store" method with the triples. Now, you have a proper store that
       can be used in tests.
