NAME
       ext_unix_group_acl - Squid UNIX Group ACL helper

SYNOPSIS
       ext_unix_group_acl [-d] [-g group ] [-g group  ...] [-p] [-s]

DESCRIPTION
       ext_unix_group_acl allows Squid to base access controls on users memberships in UNIX groups.

OPTIONS
       -d     Write debug info to stderr.  -g group Specifies a group name to match.

       -p     Also match the users primary group from /etc/passwd

       -s     Strip NT domain name component from user names (/ or \ separated)

CONFIGURATION
       This squid.conf example defines two Squid acls.  usergroup1 matches users in group1 , and usergroup2 matches users in group2 or group3
              external_acl_type unix_group %LOGIN /usr/local/squid/libexec/ext_unix_group_acl -p
              acl usergroup1 external unix_group group1
              acl usergroup2 external unix_group group2 group3

       By default up to 11 groups can be matched in one acl (including commandline specified groups). This limit is defined by MAX_GROUPS in the source code.

KNOWN ISSUES
       Does not understand GID aliased groups sometimes used to work around groups size limitations. If you are using GID aliased groups then you must specify each alias by name.
