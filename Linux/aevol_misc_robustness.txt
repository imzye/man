NAME
       aevol - an in silico experimental evolution platform

SYNOPSIS
       aevol_misc_robustness -h | --help
       aevol_misc_robustness -V | --version
       aevol_misc_robustness -g GENER [-n NBCHILDREN] [-i INDEX | -r RANK]

DESCRIPTION
       Aevol  is  a simulation platform that allows one to let populations of digital organisms evolve in different conditions and study experimentally the mechanisms responsible for the structuration of the
       genome and the transcriptome.

       aevol_misc_robustness
              computes the replication statistics of all the individuals of a given generation, like the proportion of neutral, beneficial, deleterious offsprings.  This  is  done  by  simulating  NBCHILDREN
              replications  for  each  individual (1000 replications by default), with its mutation, rearrangement and transfer rates. Depending on those rates and genome size, there can be several mutations
              per replication. Those global statistics are written in stat/robustness_GENER.out, with one line per individual in the specified generation.  The program also outputs  detailed  statistics  for
              one  of  the  individuals (the best one by default). The detailed statistics for this individual are written in stats/replication_GENER.out, with one line per simulated child of this particular
              individual.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              print help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -g, --gener GENER
              specify the generation number for which the robustness statistics are desired

       -n, --nb-children NBCHILDREN
              specify the number of reproductions to simulate for each individual

       -i, --index INDEX
              specify the index (ID in current generation) of the individual for whom detailed reproduction statistics are desired

       -r, --rank RANK
              specify the rank of the individual for whom detailed reproduction statistics are desired
