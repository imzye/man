NAME
     obrotamer — generate conformer/rotamer coordinates

SYNOPSIS
     obrotamer filename

DESCRIPTION
     The obrotamer tool can be used as part of a conformational search by generating random isomers based on rotating dihedral angles. These rotamers are not conformers -- that is, obrotamer does not perform
     geometry optimization after generating the rotamer structure. The obminimize tool can do geometry optimization using molecular mechanics.

EXAMPLES
           obrotamer baseconformer.sdf > rotamer1.sdf

     Generate a random rotational isomer of baseconformer.sdf and write it to rotamer1.sdf
