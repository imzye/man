NAME
       gst2ascii - Filter and output Atari program symbol table as ASCII

SYNOPSIS
       gst2ascii [options] <program>

DESCRIPTION
       gst2ascii  reads  (GNU-style  a.out  or traditional DRI/GST) symbol table from given Atari program and outputs it in the ASCII format understood by Hatari debugger and its profiler data post-processor
       (latter doesn't accept any other format).

       All symbol addresses output by the tool are TEXT relative, so when loading them in Hatari debugger, one needs to give just TEXT as offset for the 'symbols' command.

       There are some options for filtering the symbol table content, and the resulting ASCII output is easy to edit also by hand, in case other symbols (e.g. loop labels) need to  be  removed  from  it,  or
       missing function symbols need to be added to it.

OPTIONS
       -a     Filter absolute (= value, not address) symbols out from the output.

       -b     Filter BSS symbols out from the output.

       -d     Filter DATA symbols out from the output.

       -t     Filter TEXT symbols out from the output.

       -l     Filter local (.L*) symbols out.  Usually they're useless because they don't have names, just numbers.

       -o     Filter symbols for object files (*.o) out.

       -n     Sort symbol output by symbol name, not by their addresses.

NOTES
       If you have problems, try with 'nm -n <program>' instead (Atari or cross-compiler version). If nm works, but gst2ascii doesn't, please report a bug on it.

EXAMPLES
       Save 'program.prg' symbol table in ASCII format with local symbols filtered out:
            gst2ascii -l program.prg > program.sym

       Load generated ASCII symbols file in Hatari debugger:
            symbols program.sym TEXT DATA BSS
