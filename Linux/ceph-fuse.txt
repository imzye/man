NAME
       ceph-fuse - FUSE-based client for ceph

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-fuse [-n client.username] [ -m monaddr:port ] mountpoint [ fuse options ]

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-fuse  is  a FUSE ("Filesystem in USErspace") client for Ceph distributed file system. It will mount a ceph file system specified via the -m option or described by ceph.conf (see below) at the
       specific mount point. See Mount CephFS using FUSE for detailed information.

       The file system can be unmounted with:

          fusermount -u mountpoint

       or by sending SIGINT to the ceph-fuse process.

OPTIONS
       Any options not recognized by ceph-fuse will be passed on to libfuse.

       -o opt,[opt...]
              Mount options.

       -c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
              Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.

       -m monaddress[:port]
              Connect to specified monitor (instead of looking through ceph.conf).

       -n client.{cephx-username}
              Pass the name of CephX user whose secret key is be to used for mounting.

       --id <client-id>
              Pass the name of CephX user whose secret key is be to used for mounting.  --id takes just the ID of the client in contrast to -n. For example, --id 0 for using client.0.

       -k <path-to-keyring>
              Provide path to keyring; useful when it's absent in standard locations.

       --client_mountpoint/-r root_directory
              Use root_directory as the mounted root, rather than the full Ceph tree.

       -f     Foreground: do not daemonize after startup (run in foreground). Do not generate a pid file.

       -d     Run in foreground, send all log output to stderr and enable FUSE debugging (-o debug).

       -s     Disable multi-threaded operation.

       --client_fs
              Pass the name of Ceph FS to be mounted. Not passing this option mounts the default Ceph FS on the Ceph cluster.

AVAILABILITY
       ceph-fuse is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at https://docs.ceph.com for more information.
