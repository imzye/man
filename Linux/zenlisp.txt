NAME
          zl ‐ zenlisp interpreter

USAGE
          zl [‐L] [‐bgi] [‐n nodes] [image]

DESCRIPTION
          Zenlisp   is  an  interpreter  for  a  purely  symbolic  and
          applicative dialect  of  LISP.   It  may  be  considered  an
          implementation of pure LISP plus global definitions.

          The zl command starts the interpreter.

OPTIONS
          ‐b
              Batch  mode.  In  batch  mode,  no  greeting  message is
              printed, and the interpreter exists in case of an  error
              rather than returning to the read‐eval‐print loop.

          ‐g
              Verbose GC. Report number of free nodes after each GC.

          ‐i
              Init  mode. Init mode is used to build the initial image
              file.  No image is loaded.  Do not use this option.

          ‐n nodes
              Specify the size of the node pool. Larger pools  (up  to
              some  limit)  increase performance. The memory footprint
              of the zenlisp workspace is calculated as follows:

              nodes * (sizeof(int) * 2 + 1)

          ‐L
              Display the terms of use (license) and exit.

          If an image file name is  passed  to  the  zl  command,  the
          specified image is loaded instead of the default image.
