NAME
       password-gorilla — a password manager

SYNOPSIS
       password-gorilla

DESCRIPTION
       The  Password  Gorilla helps you manage your logins. It stores all your user names and passwords, along with login information and other notes, in a securely encrypted file. A single "master pass‐
       word" is used to protect the file. This way, you only need to remember the single master password, instead of the many logins that you use.

       If you want to log in to a service or Web site, the Password Gorilla copies your user name and password to the clipboard, so that you can easily paste it into your Web browser  or  other  applica‐
       tion. Because the password does not appear on the screen, Password Gorilla is safe to use in the presence of others.

       The  convenience  of  Password  Gorilla allows you to choose different, non-intuitive passwords for each service. An integrated random password generator can provide one-time passwords, tunable to
       various services' policies.

FILES
       The program creates a configuration file .gorillarc in the homedirectory of the user.
