DESCRIPTION
       cinnamon-settings runs the graphical user interface allowing to configure Cinnamon.

       It can also be used to run the graphical user interface allowing to configure a specific module, add applets to a panel, and manage xlets.

MODULE
       Specifying a module allows to configure it directly.
       The following modules are available. You can use name or synonym.
       The modules with * have a configuration interface with tabs. Each tab can be directly opened (see TAB section below).
       The modules with ** need root rights to open their configuration interface. So the only tab that will always be open is the first one.

PANEL
       PANEL is the panel on which the user want install some applets.  User desktop can have up to four panels.
       panel1 is the first panel (panel by default).
       panel2, panel3 and panel4 exist only if the user has created them.

UUID and INSTANCE
       The applets, desklets, extensions and themes are the xlets.

       Each xlet has an UUID (Universal Unique IDentifier). The structure of an UUID is xlet_name@author, except for themes.

       There are two kinds of xlets: System and Spices.

       System xlets are in /usr/share/cinnamon/applets/, /usr/share/cinnamon/desklets/ and /usr/share/themes/; their UUID ends with '@cinnamon.org' except for themes. There is no system extension.

       Spices are xlets offered by developers to the Cinnamon team, which evaluates and validates them. Complete description of these Spices can be found at https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/.
       The Spices installed by user are in ~/.local/share/cinnamon (for applets, desklets and extensions) and in ~/.themes.

       INSTANCE  argument is reserved to developers. When an applet or desklet has multiple instances, the configuration interface of each of them can be directly opened by this INSTANCE argument. Users have
       neither the possibility nor the need to know the value of INSTANCE.

SORT
       Possible choices are:
               - name or 0
               - score or 1 (default value)
               - date or 2
               - installed or 3
               - update or 4 (upgradable Spices first, then acts as date)

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -h, --help
              Print a help text describing the supported command-line options, and then exit.

       -s SORT, --sort=SORT
              Specific to the 'download' tab (see below) for applets, desklets, extensions and themes modules.

       -t TAB, --tab=TAB
              Select the tab to open in the settings. Possible choices are:
               - A number from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of available tabs.
               - The name of the tab (see list below).

EXAMPLES
       To open System Settings:
              $ cinnamon-settings

       To open the printer settings:
              $ cinnamon-settings printers

       To open the settings of an installed applet, desklet or extension:
              $ cinnamon-settings TYPE UUID
              Examples:
              $ cinnamon-settings applets SpicesUpdate@claudiux
              $ cinnamon-settings desklets photoframe@cinnamon.org
              $ cinnamon-settings extensions watermark@germanfr

       To add some applets on the second panel (if exists):
              $ cinnamon-settings applets panel2

       To open the download tab of the applets settings:
              $ cinnamon-settings applets --tab=download
              or
              $ cinnamon-settings applets -t 1

       To open the download tab of a type of Spices (applets, desklets, extensions, themes), sorting them by 'name', 'score', 'date', 'installed' or 'update', use the '--sort=' or '-s' argument:
              $ cinnamon-settings TYPE --tab=download --sort=SORT
              or
              $ cinnamon-settings TYPE -t 1 -s SORT
              where TYPE can be applets, desklets, extensions or themes
              and SORT can be name (or 0), score (or 1), date (or 2), installed (or 3), update (or 4)

              Example:
              $ cinnamon-settings applets -t 1 -s date
