PG_CHECKSUMS_EXT(1)                                                                             Application                                                                             PG_CHECKSUMS_EXT(1)

NAME
       pg_checksums_ext - enable, disable or check data checksums in a PostgreSQL database cluster

SYNOPSIS

       pg_checksums_ext [option...] [[-D | --pgdata] datadir]

DESCRIPTION
       pg_checksums_ext checks, enables or disables data checksums in a PostgreSQL cluster. The server must be shut down when enabling or disabling checksums, while verifying checksums can be done
       online. When verifying checksums, the exit status is zero if there are no checksum errors, and nonzero if at least one checksum failure is detected. When enabling or disabling checksums, the exit
       status is nonzero if the operation failed.

       When verifying checksums, every file in the cluster is scanned. When enabling checksums, each relation file block with a changed checksum is rewritten in-place. Disabling checksums only updates
       the file pg_control.

OPTIONS
       The following command-line options are available:

       -D directory
       --pgdata=directory
           Specifies the directory where the database cluster is stored.

       -c
       --check
           Checks checksums. This is the default mode if nothing else is specified.

       -d
       --disable
           Disables checksums.

       -e
       --enable
           Enables checksums.

       -f filenode
       --filenode=filenode
           Only validate checksums in the relation with filenode filenode.

       -N
       --no-sync
           By default, pg_checksums_ext will wait for all files to be written safely to disk. This option causes pg_checksums_ext to return without waiting, which is faster, but means that a subsequent
           operating system crash can leave the updated data directory corrupt. Generally, this option is useful for testing but should not be used on a production installation. This option has no effect
           when using --check.

       -P
       --progress
           Enable progress reporting. Turning this on will deliver a progress report while checking or enabling checksums. Progress reporting can also be triggered by the <signal>SIGUSR1</signal> signal.

       --max-rate=rate
           Set a maximum I/O rate (in MB/s) while checking or enabling checksums.

       -v
       --verbose
           Enable verbose output. Lists all checked files.

       --debug
           Enable debug output.

       -V
       --version
           Print the pg_checksums_ext version and exit.

       -?
       --help
           Show help about pg_checksums_ext command line arguments, and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       PGDATA
           Specifies the directory where the database cluster is stored; can be overridden using the -D option.

       PG_COLOR
           Specifies whether to use color in diagnostics messages. Possible values are always, auto, never.

NOTES
       Enabling checksums in a large cluster can potentially take a long time. During this operation, the cluster or other programs that write to the data directory must not be started or else data loss
       may occur.

       When using a replication setup with tools which perform direct copies of relation file blocks (for example pg_rewind), enabling or disabling checksums can lead to page corruptions in the shape of
       incorrect checksums if the operation is not done consistently across all nodes. When enabling or disabling checksums in a replication setup, it is thus recommended to stop all the clusters before
       switching them all consistently. Destroying all standbys, performing the operation on the primary and finally recreating the standbys from scratch is also safe.

       If pg_checksums_ext is aborted or killed while enabling or disabling checksums, the cluster's data checksum configuration remains unchanged, and pg_checksums_ext can be re-run to perform the same
       operation.
