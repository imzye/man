NAME
       cbmc - Bounded Model Checker for C/C++ and Java programs

SYNOPSIS
       cbmc [--property property-id] file.c ...

       cbmc [--show-properties] file.c ...

       cbmc [--all-properties] file.c ...

       goto-cc [-I include-path] [-c] file.c [-o outfile.o]

       goto-instrument infile outfile

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remain‐
       der.

DESCRIPTION
       cbmc generates traces that demonstrate how an  assertion  can  be  vio‐
       lated,  or  proves that the assertion cannot be violated within a given
       number of loop iterations.  CBMC can read C/C++  source-code  directly,
       or  a  goto-binary  generated  by  goto-cc.  Java programs are given as
       class or JAR files.  Without any further options, cbmc checks all prop‐
       erties  (automatically  generated  or user-specified) found in the pro‐
       gram.  If any of the properties can be violated,  a  counterexample  is
       printed and the analysis is aborted.  The analysis can be restricted to
       a particular property with the --property option.  The verification re‐
       sult  for  all properties can be obtained by means of the --all-proper‐
       ties option.

       goto-cc reads source code, and generates a  goto-binary.  Its  command-
       line interface is designed to mimic that of gcc(1).  Note in particular
       that goto-cc distinguishes between compiling and linking  phases,  just
       as gcc does. cbmc expects a goto-binary for which linking has been com‐
       pleted.

       goto-instrument reads a goto-binary, performs a given program transfor‐
       mation, and then writes the resulting program as goto-binary on disc.

       The  usual  flow  is  to  (1) translate source into a goto-binary using
       goto-cc, then (2) perform instrumentation with goto-instrument, and fi‐
       nally (3) perform the analysis with cbmc.

OPTIONS
   FRONTEND OPTIONS (cbmc and goto-cc)
       -I path
              Set include path (C/C++)

       -D macro
              Define preprocessor macro (C/C++)

       --preprocess
              Stop after preprocessing

       --show-symbol-table
              Show symbol table

       --show-goto-functions
              Show goto program

   ARCHITECTURAL OPTIONS (cbmc and goto-cc)
       cbmc by default uses architectural settings that match those of the ma‐
       chine cbmc is executed on, i.e., the settings  below  are  only  needed
       when  verifying  software that is meant to run on a different architec‐
       ture or OS. goto-cc generates a goto-binary for a particular  architec‐
       ture, i.e., the architecture cannot be changed after the goto-binary is
       generated.

       --16, --32, --64
              Set width of int

       --LP64, --ILP64, --LLP64, --ILP32, --LP32
              Set width of int, long and pointers

       --little-endian
              Allow little-endian word-byte conversions

       --big-endian
              Allow big-endian word-byte conversions

       --unsigned-char
              Make "char" unsigned by default

       --arch Set target architecture

       --os   Set target operating system

       --no-arch
              Don't set up an architecture

       --no-library
              Disable built-in abstract C library

       --round-to-nearest, --round-to-plus-inf, --round-to-minus-inf, --round-
       to-zero
              IEEE floating point rounding mode to use when the program begins
              (default is round to nearest). The  program  under  verification
              can override this setting, e.g., with fesetround(3).

   PROGRAM INSTRUMENTATION OPTIONS (cbmc and goto-instrument)
       Both  cbmc  and goto-instrument can generate assertions that catch spe‐
       cific common errors, as listed below.

       --bounds-check
              Enable array bounds checks

       --div-by-zero-check

              arithmetic

       tions.

ENVIRONMENT
       All  tools honor the TMPDIR environment variable when generating tempo‐
       rary files and directories. Furthermore note that the preprocessor used
       by  CBMC will use environment variables to locate header files. GOTO-CC
       aims to accept all environment variables that GCC does.
