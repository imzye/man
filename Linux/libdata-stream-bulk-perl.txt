NAME
       Data::Stream::Bulk::Util - Utility functions for Data::Stream::Bulk

VERSION
       version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
               use Data::Stream::Bulk::Util qw(array);

               use namespace::clean;

               # Wrap a list in L<Data::Stream::Bulk::Array>
               return bulk(qw(foo bar gorch baz));

               # return an empty resultset
               return nil();

DESCRIPTION
       This module exports convenience functions for use with Data::Stream::Bulk.

EXPORTS
       Sub::Exporter is used to create the "import" routine, and all of its aliasing/currying goodness is of course supported.

       nil Creates a new Data::Stream::Bulk::Nil object.

           Takes no arguments.

       bulk @items
           Creates a new Data::Stream::Bulk::Array wrapping @items.

       cat @streams
           Concatenate several streams together.

           Returns "nil" if no arguments are provided.

       filter { ... } $stream
           Calls "filter" on $stream with the provided filter.

       unique $stream
           Filter the stream to remove duplicates.

           Note that memory use may potentially scale to O(k) where k is the number of distinct items, because this is implemented in terms of a seen hash.

           In the future this will be optimized to be iterative for sorted streams.

           References are keyed by their refaddr (see "id" in Hash::Util::FieldHash).
