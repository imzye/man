NAME
       cwmrc — calm window manager configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the cwm(1) configuration file.

       The  current  line  can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash (‘\’).  Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark (‘#’), and extend to the end of the current line.  Care
       should be taken when commenting out multi-line text: the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.

       Arguments containing whitespace should be surrounded by double quotes (").

       The following options are accepted:

       autogroup group [windowname,]windowclass
               Automatically add new windows to group if their class property matches windowclass, or if their name and class properties match windowname and windowclass, respectively.  The more specific
               last match wins.  group is a number between 0 and 9.  If group is 0, matching windows will not be added to any group; this may be used to override “sticky group mode”.

               The name and class values, respectively, for existing windows are both set in the WM_CLASS property and may be obtained using xprop(1).

       bind-key key function
               Bind or rebind key key to function.  The modifier keys come first, followed by a ‘-’, then a keysym name, taken from /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h.

               The following modifiers are recognised:

                     C       Control key.
                     M       Meta key.
                     S       Shift key.
                     4       Mod4 (windows) key.
                     5       Mod5 (AltGr) key.

               The function may either be one from the “BIND FUNCTION LIST” (see below) or the command line that is to be executed.

       bind-mouse button function
               Bind or rebind button button to function.  The modifier keys come first, followed by a ‘-’, then the button number.

               The same modifiers are recognised as for key in bind-key.

               The following buttons are recognised:

                     1       Left mouse button.
                     2       Middle mouse button.
                     3       Right mouse button.
                     4       Scroll up mouse button.
                     5       Scroll down mouse button.

               The function may be taken from the “BIND FUNCTION LIST” (see below) or the command line that is to be executed.

       borderwidth pixels
               Set the window border width to pixels.

       command name path
               Every name entry is shown in the application menu.  When selected, the defined path is executed with execvp(3).

               The name entries term and lock have a special meaning.  They point to the terminal and screen locking programs specified by key bindings.  The defaults are xterm(1) and  xlock(1),  respec‐
               tively.

       fontname font
               Change the default font for Xft(3).

       gap top bottom left right
               Define  a “gap” in pixels at the edge of the screen, so that when a window is maximized it will not overlap this area.  This “gap” can be used for applications such as xclock(1), where the
               user may wish to remain visible.

       htile percent
               Set the percentage of screen the master window should occupy after calling window-htile.  If set to 0, the horizontal size of the master window will remain unchanged.  The default is 50.

       ignore windowname
               Ignore, and do not warp to, windows with the name windowname when drawing borders and cycling through windows.

       moveamount pixels
               Set a default size for the keyboard movement bindings, in pixels.  The default is 1.

       snapdist pixels
               Minimum distance to snap-to adjacent edge, in pixels.  The default is 0.

       sticky yes|no
               Toggle sticky group mode.  The default behavior for new windows is to not assign any group.  By enabling sticky group mode, cwm(1) will assign new windows to the currently selected group.

       unbind-key key
               Unbind function bound to key.  A special key keyword “all” can be used to unbind all keys.

       unbind-mouse button
               Unbind function bound to button.  A special button keyword “all” can be used to unbind all buttons.

       vtile percent
               Set the percentage of screen the master window should occupy after calling window-vtile.  If set to 0, the vertical size of the master window will remain unchanged.  The default is 50.

       wm name path
               Every name entry is shown in the wm menu.  When selected, the window manager is replaced by path.
