NAME
       wildmidi.cfg - Config file for libWildMidi

LIBRARY
       libWildMidi

DESCRIPTION
       Contains the patch configuration for libWildMidi and location of Gravis Ultrasound compatible patch files.

       dir ~/guspats/

       source /etc/wildmidi.cfg

       bank 0
       0 acpiano.pat amp=110 env_time4=300
       1 brpiano.pat amp=100

       drumset 0
       25 snarerol keep=env amp=225 note=60
       26 snap   note=65

SYNTAX
       guspat_editor_author_cant_read_so_fix_release_time_for_me
              Some patch file editors switch the 4th and 5th envelopes around making the sound play much longer than intended in players that stuck to the Gravis Ultrasound patch standard. Including this
              option in the config enables a fix that detects this oversight, playing the sound samples as if they were correct.

              NOTE: This is a global setting. If it is found to affect good patch samples it will be moved to a per patch setting in a future version.

       auto_amp
              Forces WildMIDI to amplify samples to their maximum level ignoring the amp=% in the patch lines of the config.

       auto_amp_with_amp
              Forces WildMIDI to amplify samples to their maximum level then apply the amp=% in the patch lines of the config.

       dir dir-name
              Change  the  search  path for config and patch files to dir-name. This is specific to the current config file and carried to any included config file unless they have their own dir setting.
              Any included file that has its own dir setting does not effect the dir setting of the current config file.

       source include-confg
              Include the settings from include-config. Any patch already set will be over-ridden by the included config file.

       bank N The patches following this setting belong to MIDI instrument bank N.

       drumset N
              The patches following this setting belong to MIDI drum bank N.

       patchno patchfile [amp=volume] [note=miodinte] [keep=loop] [keep=env] [remove=sustain] [remove=clamped] [env_level[0-5]=level] [env_time[0-5]=time]

       Example: 0 acpiano.pat amp=110

              patchno
                     This is the MIDI patch number the instrument belongs to.

              patchfile
                     The filename of the Gravis Ultrasound compatible patch file. If the filename is missing the .pat extension, libWildMidi will add .pat when attempting to load the file.

              amp=volume
                     Force the volume of the samples in this patch to volume% prior to using it.

              note=midinote
                     Use note midinote when playing the samples in this patch. NOTE: this is for instruments listed under drumset.

              keep=loop
                     Play the samples in this patch with the loop, when normally we would not for this instrument.

              keep=env
                     Use the envelope data in this patch, when normally we wouldn't for this instrument.

              remove=sustain
                     Do note hold the note after the 3rd envelope until note off, which is what happens if the sustain bit is set in the patch file.

              remove=clamped
                     Do not jump to 6th envelope on note off, which is what happens if the clamped bit is set in the patch file.

              env_level[0-5]=level
                     Set the envelope level to level with 1.0 being maximum, and 0.0 being minimum.

                     Example: set 5th envelope level to 10% - env_level[0-5]=0.1

              env_time[0-5]=time
                     Set the envelope time to time with a resolution of 1/1000th of a second. This setting is the time it should take for the envelope to reach maximum level.

                     Example: set 1st envelope time to 1sec - env_time0=1000

                     Example: set 3rd envelope time to 0.5secs - env_time2=500

       reverb_room_width fval
              Set the room width for the reverb engine in meters. fval is a float value in meters. Minimum setting is 1.0 meter, maximum setting is 100.0 meters, and default is 15.0 meters.

              Example: set room width to 30 meters - reverb_room_width 30

       reverb_room_length fval
              Set the room length for the reverb engine in meters. fval is a float value in meters. Minimum setting is 1.0 meter, maximum setting is 100.0 meters, and default is 20.0 meters.

              Example: set room length to 40 meters - reverb_room_length 40
