NAME
       check-sendfile - Check if some files have arrived

SYNOPSIS
       check-sendfile

DESCRIPTION
       The check-sendfile command tests if there are files hosed in the user's sendfile spool area.  If so he will be informed about the files.

       This  command  should be started from /etc/profile to give all users a chance to notices that some files have arrived in their absence.  As the defauld behaviour of sendfiled is to write a note on the
       user's tty he won't notice receiption if he's not logged in.  The lack of need to be logged in is one of sendfile's advantages.

FILES
       /var/spool/sendfile/$user
              Spool area for the specifig user.
