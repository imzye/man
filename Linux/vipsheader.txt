NAME
       vipsheader - prints information about an image file

SYNOPSIS
       vipsheader [OPTIONS ...] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       vipsheader(1) prints image header fields to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              Show all fields. Fields are displayed to be convenient for humans to read, so binary data, for example, is summarized rather than simply copied.

       -f FIELD, --field=FIELD
              Print value of FIELD from image header. Fields are printed in a way suitable for programs to understand, so, for example, binary data is base64-encoded and printed as a stream of characters.

              The special field name getext prints the VIPS extension block: the XML defining the image metadata. You can alter this, then reattach with vipsedit(1).

EXAMPLES
        $ vipsheader -f Xsize ~/pics/*.v
        1024
        1279
        22865
        1
        256
