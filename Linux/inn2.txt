NAME
       nnrpd.track - Specify hosts to be tracked by nnrpd

DESCRIPTION
       This file, which is located in pathetc, specifies which hosts are to have their activities recorded during an nnrpd session.  The nnrpd server reads it when first spawned by innd, provided
       readertrack in inn.conf is true; otherwise this file is not used.

       Entries consist of one host specification per line, each line having two fields, separated by a colon:

           host:identity

       The first field is either one of the FQDNs of a host, or a domain name (in the form "*.domain.com").

       The second field is simply a segment of text which may be used to more easily identify the client, typically an e-mail address or other identifying mark.  Each post of tracked hosts will have an
       entry associated with identity in the log message recorded to the pathlog/tracklogs directory, and every posted article will be saved in the pathlog/trackposts directory.

       An example of nnrpd.track file is:

           nasty.foo.com:nasty@foo.com
           *.bar.com:VeryNastyClient
