DSDP-MAXCUT(1)                   User Commands                  DSDP-MAXCUT(1)

NAME
       dsdp-maxcut - Find an approximate maximum cut of a graph

SYNOPSIS
       dsdp-maxcut GRAPH_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The  dsdp-maxcut  program reads a graph from a file, formulates the SDP
       relaxation of the maximum cut problem, solves  the  problem  using  the
       DSDP library, and applies a randomized algorithm to generate an approx‐
       imate solution.

FILE FORMAT
       The input file should be in the following format:
              n m
              r1 c1 [w1]
              …
              im jm [wm]
       where n is the number of nodes, and m is the number of edges.  Each r/c
       pair  or  r/c/w triple describes one edge, where r is the row, c is the
       column, and w is the weight.  The weight defaults to 0.0.
