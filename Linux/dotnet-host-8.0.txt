DESCRIPTION
       The dotnet nuget delete command deletes or unlists a package from the server.  For nuget.org (https://www.nuget.org/), the action is to unlist the package.

ARGUMENTS
       • PACKAGE_NAME

         Name/ID of the package to delete.

       • PACKAGE_VERSION

         Version of the package to delete.

OPTIONS
       • --force-english-output

         Forces the application to run using an invariant, English-based culture.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • --interactive

         Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.  Available since .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • -k|--api-key <API_KEY>

         The API key for the server.

       • --no-service-endpoint

         By  default, the command appends “/api/v2/package” to the specified URL.  This option is for custom feeds that must use the exact source URL as specified with the --source option.  For more
         information, see the --source option later in this article.

       • --non-interactive

         Doesn’t prompt for user input or confirmations.

       • -s|--source <SOURCE>

         Specifies the server URL.  The URL specified by using this option can be either V2 (https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/) or V3 (https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json).  For private  feeds,  replace
         the host name (for example, %hostname%/api/v3/index.json).
