NAME
       nymerge - tool to update and merge specialized-format patches

SYNOPSIS
       nymerge merge old new options [ print ] [ .go ]

DESCRIPTION
       nymerge  is  a  tool  in  the  Nypatchy  suite  of programs for working with Patchy Master Files (PAM files); see nypatchy(1).  Specifically, it can update a PAM file old with a new version number and
       date/time stamp, optionally also merging in updated source code from a separate PAM file merge, and saving the result to file new.  The default file extension of these three files is  presumed  to  be
       ".car".

USAGE
       The  merge file merge may be replaced with "-" if there is nothing to merge.  print is the file to which informational output should be written (the default is standard output if omitted), and options
       is a sequence of single-character flags.

       The command should be ended with ".go" unless one wants to enter the Nypatchy interactive shell.

OPTIONS
       Note that options should be given as a single string of characters with no space separation and no use of the - character (except that it can be used in place of the options field if  no  options  are
       desired).  Alphabetic options are not case-sensitive.

       F      Update only the first PAM file title.

       H      Print help information only.

       P      Log only the patch names, not the decks.

       Q      "quick" - Do not log printing of patch or deck names.

       U      Update version/date/time on all PAM titles found on the file.

       +      Inhibit the initial page-eject.

       Running the command "nymerge help .no" also gives some brief help on usage.
