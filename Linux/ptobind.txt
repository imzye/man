NAME
       ptobind - Join the ends of linked photos in a Hugin project

SYNOPSIS
       ptobind [options] --output output.pto input.pto

        Options:
         -m | --makefile file  Output Makefile
         -o | --output file    Output project
         -h | --help           Outputs help documentation.

DESCRIPTION
       ptobind is a wrapper around various tools that generates control points.  Output is in the form of a .pto project or a Makefile to create that .pto project.

       This is a specialist tool that assumes that the project is already connected into one or more chains of control points.  The first and last photos from each of these chains are selected for feature
       matching.  e.g. if there is a single chain, then this tool will try and join it into an loop, if there are two chains they will be fitted together side-by-side by trying to join the ends to each
       other, any loops will also be joined.

       This tool is intended to use the output and intermediate .key files created by ptochain.

       If the --makefile option is given, rules for generating the project are written to a Makefile, if --makefile isn't set then these rules will be executed immediately.

       Control point generator parameters are set via Option lines in the input project:

         #hugin_cpgenSize 1500
         #hugin_cpgenNumber 25
         #hugin_cpgenRansac true
         #hugin_cpgenRefine false
