NAME
       cf-promises - validate and analyze CFEngine policy code

SYNOPSIS
       cf-promises [OPTION]...  [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       cf-promises  is  a  tool  for checking CFEngine policy code. It operates by first parsing policy code checing for syntax errors. Second, it validates the integrity of policy consisting of multiple
       files. Third, it checks for semantic errors, e.g. specific attribute set rules. Finally, cf-promises attempts to expose errors by partially evaluating the policy, resolving as  many  variable  and
       classes promise statements as possible. At no point does cf-promises make any changes to the system.

OPTIONS
       --workdir, -w value
              Override the work directory for testing (same as setting CFENGINE_TEST_OVERRIDE_WORKDIR)

       --eval-functions value
              Evaluate functions during syntax checking (may catch more run-time errors). Possible values: 'yes', 'no'. Default is 'yes'

       --show-classes value
              Show discovered classes, including those defined in common bundles in policy. Optionally can take a regular expression.

       --show-vars value
              Show discovered variables, including those defined without dependency to user-defined classes in policy. Optionally can take a regular expression.

       --help, -h
              Print the help message

       --bundlesequence, -b value
              Use the specified bundlesequence for verification

       --debug, -d
              Enable debugging output

       --verbose, -v
              Output verbose information about the behaviour of cf-promises

       --log-level, -g value
              Specify how detailed logs should be. Possible values: 'error', 'warning', 'notice', 'info', 'verbose', 'debug'

       --dry-run, -n
              All talk and no action mode - make no changes, only inform of promises not kept

       --version, -V
              Output the version of the software

       --file, -f value
              Specify an alternative input file than the default. This option is overridden by FILE if supplied as argument.

       --define, -D value
              Define a list of comma separated classes to be defined at the start of execution

       --negate, -N value
              Define a list of comma separated classes to be undefined at the start of execution

       --inform, -I
              Print basic information about changes made to the system, i.e. promises repaired

       --diagnostic, -x
              Activate internal diagnostics (developers only)

       --policy-output-format, -p value
              Output the parsed policy. Possible values: 'none', 'cf', 'json' (this file only), 'cf-full', 'json-full' (all parsed promises). Default is 'none'. (experimental)

       --syntax-description, -s value
              Output a document describing the available syntax elements of CFEngine. Possible values: 'none', 'json'. Default is 'none'.

       --full-check, -c
              Ensure full policy integrity checks

       --warn, -W value
              Pass comma-separated <warnings>|all to enable non-default warnings, or error=<warnings>|all

       --color, -C value
              Enable colorized output. Possible values: 'always', 'auto', 'never'. If option is used, the default value is 'auto'

       --tag-release, -T value
              Tag a directory with promises.cf with cf_promises_validated and cf_promises_release_id

       --timestamp, -l
              Log timestamps on each line of log output

       --ignore-preferred-augments
              Ignore def_preferred.json file in favor of def.json

       --log-modules value
              Enable even more detailed debug logging for specific areas of the implementation. Use together with '-d'. Use --log-modules=help for a list of available modules

CFENGINE
       CFEngine  provides  automated  configuration  management of large-scale computer systems. A system administrator describes the desired state of a system using CFEngine policy code. The program cf-
       agent reads policy code and attempts to bring the current system state to the desired state described. Policy code is downloaded by cf-agent from a cf-serverd daemon. The daemon  cf-execd  is  re‐
       sponsible for running cf-agent periodically.
       Documentation for CFEngine is available at https://docs.cfengine.com/.

PROMISE THEORY
       CFEngine  is  built on principles from promise theory, proposed by Mark Burgess in 2004. Promise theory is a model of voluntary cooperation between individual, autonomous actors or agents who pub‐
       lish their intentions to one another in the form of promises. A promise is a declaration of intent whose purpose is to increase the recipient's certainty about a claim of past, present  or  future
       behaviour. For a promise to increase certainty, the recipient needs to trust the promiser, but trust can also be built on the verification that previous promises have been kept, thus trust plays a
       symbiotic relationship with promises.
