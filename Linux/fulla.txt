NAME
       fulla - Correct lens distortion, vignetting and chromatic aberration

SYNOPSIS
       fulla [options] inputfile(s)

DESCRIPTION
       Apply radial or flat-field vignetting correction as well as geometrical radial distortion and transversal chromatic aberration correction.

       fulla can be used to batch correct a large number of files. Radial distortion coefficients can be read from a lens database.

       Vignetting correction is done the same way as described in the nona script file documentation, or from lens database.  Vignetting correction can be done based on a flat-field or a radial scaling.

       Vignetting correction by flat-field division:
                               I = I / c,    c = flat-field / mean(flat-field)

       Radial vignetting correction:
                               I = I / c,    c = a + b*r^2 + c*r^4 + d*r^6

       The radial distortion correction is identical to the one implemented by PanoTools:

       r_new = a*r^4 + b*r^3 + c*r^2 + d*r   [1]

       Since transversal chromatic aberrations (TCA) leads to differently scaled objects in the red, green and blue channel, it can be corrected by scaling the red and blue channel so that they match the
       green channel. Most applications, like Photoshop or Picture Window Pro offer TCA correction by linear scaling. This is equal to varying the d parameter in equation [1].

       See http://hugin.sf.net/tutorials/tca for a method to determine these parameters.
