              Recursively checks all executable files in the directory for security features compiled into the executables

       --proc={pid}
              Checks the security features of a running process by name

       --proc-all
              Checks the security features of all running processes

       --proc-libs
              Checks the security features of the all libraries of a running process ID

       --kernel[=kconfig]
              Checks the security features of the running kernel or a specified kernel config

       --fortify-file={filename}
              Checks the fortifiability of a file and if any of the fortifiable features have already been compiled into the file

       --fortify-proc={pid}
              Checks the fortifiability of a running process and if any of the fortifiable features have already been compiled in

       --version
              Shows the current version of the running software
