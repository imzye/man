NAME
       ipa-ca-install - Install a CA on a server

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-ca-install [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a CA as an IPA-managed service. This requires that the IPA server
       is already installed and configured.

       ipa-ca-install can be used to upgrade from CA-less to CA-full or to in‐
       stall the CA service on a replica.

       Domain level 0 is not supported anymore.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug Enable debug logging when more verbose output is needed

       -p DM_PASSWORD, --password=DM_PASSWORD
              Directory Manager (existing master) password

       -w ADMIN_PASSWORD, --admin-password=ADMIN_PASSWORD
              Admin user Kerberos password used for connection check

       --external-ca
              Generate a CSR for the IPA CA certificate to be signed by an ex‐
              ternal CA.

       --external-ca-type=TYPE
              Type of the external CA. Possible values are "generic", "ms-cs".
              Default  value is "generic". Use "ms-cs" to include the template
              name required by Microsoft Certificate Services (MS CS)  in  the
              generated CSR (see --external-ca-profile for full details).

       --external-ca-profile=PROFILE_SPEC
              Specify the certificate profile or template to use at the exter‐
              nal CA.

              When --external-ca-type is "ms-cs" the following specifiers  may
              be used:

              <oid>:<majorVersion>[:<minorVersion>]
                     Specify  a certificate template by OID and major version,
                     optionally also specifying minor version.

              <name> Specify a certificate template by name.  The name  cannot
                     contain  any : characters and cannot be an OID (otherwise
                     the OID-based  template  specifier  syntax  takes  prece‐
                     dence).

              default
                     If no template is specified, the template name "SubCA" is
                     used.

       --external-cert-file=FILE
              File containing the IPA CA certificate and the external CA  cer‐
              tificate  chain. The file is accepted in PEM and DER certificate
              and PKCS#7 certificate chain formats. This option  may  be  used
              multiple times.

       --ca-subject=SUBJECT
              The  CA  certificate  subject DN (default CN=Certificate Author‐
              ity,O=REALM.NAME).  RDNs are in LDAP order  (most  specific  RDN
              first).

       --subject-base=SUBJECT
              The  subject  base  for  certificates  issued  by  IPA  (default
              O=REALM.NAME).  RDNs  are  in  LDAP  order  (most  specific  RDN
              first).

       --pki-config-override=FILE
              File containing overrides for CA installation.

       --ca-signing-algorithm=ALGORITHM
              Signing algorithm of the IPA CA certificate. Possible values are
              SHA1withRSA, SHA256withRSA,  SHA384withRSA,  SHA512withRSA.  De‐
              fault value is SHA256withRSA. Use this option with --external-ca
              if the external CA does not support the  default  signing  algo‐
              rithm.

       --no-host-dns
              Do not use DNS for hostname lookup during installation

       --skip-conncheck
              Skip connection check to remote master

       --skip-schema-check
              Skip check for updated CA DS schema on the remote master

       -U, --unattended
              An unattended installation that will never prompt for user input

EXIT STATUS
       0 if the command was successful

       1 if an error occurred
