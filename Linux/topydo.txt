NAME
       topydo.conf - Configuration files for topydo

   DESCRIPTION
       The topydo command will attempt to read configuration file information from the following locations:

       • /etc/topydo.conf • ~/.config/topydo/config • ~/.topydo • .topydo (in the current working directory) • topydo.conf (in the current working directoy) • topydo.ini (in the current working directoy)

       The files are read in that order, with variables in later files overriding earlier ones.

       The configuration sections and variables are documented in /etc/topydo.conf and /usr/share/doc/topydo/Documentation.html.
