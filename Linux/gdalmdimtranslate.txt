NAME
       gdalmdimtranslate  -  Converts  multidimensional data between different
       formats, and perform subsetting.

SYNOPSIS
          gdalmdimtranslate [--help-general] [-co "NAME=VALUE"]*
                            [-of format] [-array <array_spec>]*
                            [-group <group_spec>]*
                            [-subset <subset_spec>]*

                            <src_filename> <dst_filename>

DESCRIPTION
       gdalmdimtranslate program converts multidimensional raster between dif‐
       ferent formats, and/or can perform selective conversion of specific ar‐
       rays and groups, and/or subsetting operations.

       The following command line parameters can appear in any order.

       -of <format>
              Select the output format. This can be  a  format  that  supports
              multidimensional  output (such as raster.netcdf, vrt_multidimen‐
              sional), or a "classic" 2D formats, if only one single 2D  array
              results  of the other specified conversion operations. When this
              option is not specified, the format  is  guessed  when  possible
              from the extension of the destination filename.

       -co <NAME=VALUE>
              Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can
              be used to control particulars about the file created.

              The creation options available vary by format driver,  and  some
              simple  formats  have  no creation options at all. A list of op‐
              tions supported for a format can be listed  with  the  --formats
              command  line option but the documentation for the format is the
              definitive source of information  on  driver  creation  options.
              See  raster_drivers format specific documentation for legal cre‐
              ation options for each format.

              Array-level creation options may be  passed  by  prefixing  them
              with  ARRAY:.  See GDALGroup::CopyFrom() for further details re‐
              garding such options.

       -array <array_spec>
              Instead of converting the whole dataset, select one  array,  and
              possibly  perform operations on it. This option can be specified
              several times to operate on different arrays.

              <array_spec> may be just an  array  name,  potentially  using  a
              fully  qualified  syntax (/group/subgroup/array_name). Or it can
              be a combination  of  options  with  the  syntax:  name={src_ar‐
              ray_name}[,dstname={dst_array_name}][,trans‐
              pose=[{axis1},{axis2},...][,view={view_expr}]

              [{axis1},{axis2},...] is the  argument  of   GDALMDArray::Trans‐
              pose().  For example, transpose=[1,0] switches the axis order of
              a 2D array.

              {view_expr} is the value of the viewExpr argument  of  GDALMDAr‐
              ray::GetView()

              When  specifying  a view_expr that performs a slicing or subset‐
              ting on a dimension, the equivalent operation will be applied to
              the corresponding indexing variable.

       -group <group_spec>
              Instead  of  converting the whole dataset, select one group, and
              possibly perform operations on it. This option can be  specified
              several  times to operate on different groups. If only one group
              is specified, its content will be copied directly to the  target
              root group. If several ones are specified, they are copied under
              the target root group

              <group_spec> may be just a group name, potentially using a fully
              qualified  syntax  (/group/subgroup/subsubgroup_name). Or it can
              be   a    combination    of    options    with    the    syntax:
              name={src_group_name}[,dstname={dst_group_name}][,recursive=no]

       -subset <subset_spec>
              Performs  a  subsetting  (trimming or slicing) operation along a
              dimension, provided that it is indexed by a 1D variable  of  nu‐
              meric  or  string  data  type,  and whose values are monotically
              sorted.  <subset_spec> follows exactly the OGC WCS 2.0  KVP  en‐
              coding for subsetting.

              That  is  dim_name(min_val,max_val)  or dim_name(sliced_val) The
              first syntax will subset the dimension dim_name to values in the
              [min_val,max_val] range. The second syntax will slice the dimen‐
              sion dim_name to value sliced_val (and this  dimension  will  be
              removed from the arrays that reference to it)

              Using  -subset  is  incompatible  of specifying a view option in
              -array.

       -scaleaxes <scaleaxes_spec>
              Applies a integral scale factor to one  or  several  dimensions,
              that is extract 1 value every N values (without resampling).

              <scaleaxes_spec>  follows exactly the syntax of the KVP encoding
              of the SCALEAXES parameter of OGC WCS 2.0 Scaling Extension, but
              limited to integer scale factors.

              That is dim1_name(scale_factor)[,dim2_name(scale_factor)]*

              Using  -scaleaxes is incompatible of specifying a view option in
              -array.

       <src_dataset>
              The source dataset name.

       <dst_dataset>
              The destination file name.

C API
       This utility is also callable from C with GDALMultiDimTranslate().

EXAMPLES
       • Convert a netCDF file to a multidimensional VRT file

          $ gdalmdimtranslate in.nc out.vrt

       • Extract a 2D slice of a time,Y,X array

          $ gdalmdimtranslate in.nc out.tif -subset 'time("2010-01-01")' -array temperature

       • Subsample along X and Y axis

          $ gdalmdimtranslate in.nc out.nc -scaleaxes "X(2),Y(2)"

       • Reorder the values  of  a  time,Y,X  array  along  the  Y  axis  from
         top-to-bottom to bottom-to-top (or the reverse)

          $ gdalmdimtranslate in.nc out.nc -array "name=temperature,view=[:,::-1,:]"

       • Transpose an array that has X,Y,time dimension order to time,Y,X

          $ gdalmdimtranslate in.nc out.nc -array "name=temperature,transpose=[2,1,0]"
