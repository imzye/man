NAME
       spell - GNU Spell, a clone of Unix `spell'

SYNOPSIS
       spell [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       GNU  Spell  is  a spelling checking program which prints each misspelled word on a line of its own. It is designed as a clone of the standard Unix `spell' program, and implemented as a wrapper for
       Ispell.

       Spell accepts as its arguments a list of files to read from. Within that list, the magical file name `-' causes Spell to read from standard input.  In addition, when called with no file name argu‐
       ments, Spell assumes that it should process standard input.

       Spell is most useful when used in conjunction with other programs, because its output is minimalistic. Human users are usually more comfortable with verbose output.

OPTIONS
       -I, --ispell-version
              Print Ispell's version.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number.

       -b, --british
              Use the British dictionary.

       -d, --dictionary=FILE
              Use FILE to look up words.

       -h, --help
              Print a summary of the options.

       -i, --ispell=PROGRAM
              Calls PROGRAM as Ispell.

       -D, --ispell-dictionary=DICTIONARY
              Use the named DICTIONARY to look up words.

       -l, --all-chains
              Ignored; for compatibility.

       -n, --number
              Print line numbers before lines.

       -o, --print-file-name
              Print file names before lines.

       -s, --stop-list=FILE
              Ignored; for compatibility.

       -v, --verbose
              Print words not literally found.

       -x, --print-stems
              Ignored; for compatibility.

EXAMPLES
       In the first example below, the words printed on standard output are all the (purposely) misspelled words in 'sample' file. Notice the options '--print-file-name' and '--number' They are responsi‐
       ble for the prefix you see on each line.

           $ spell --print-file-name --number sample
           sample:1: Tihs
           sample:1: si
           sample:1: fo
           sample:1: Splel
           sample:1: worsd
           sample:1: spellled
           sample:1: worng
           sample:2: fi
           sample:2: cna
           sample:2: dael
           sample:2: fiel
           sample:2: Foo
           sample:2: bza
           sample:2: baz

       In the following example, spell will analyze a text from single a command line.

           $echo "Thiz is an examply" | spell
           Thiz
           examply

       After install `ibrazilian' (# apt install ibrazilian, on Debian systems) is possible to use `brazilian' as dictionary:

           $ echo "Eu sou brasileiro e carioka" | spell -D brazilian
           carioka

       To use personal dictionary called mydict.txt:

           $ echo "A little test" | spell -d mydict.txt

FILES
       ~/.ispell_default
              Considering Spell as a wrapper for Ispell, is possible to make a personal and complementary dictionary using this file. Insert a word per line.
