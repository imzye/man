NAME
       htmlclean - a small script to clean up existing HTML

SYNOPSIS
       htmlclean [-v] [-V] file1 [file2 file3 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This program provides a command-line interface to the HTML::Clean module, which can help you to provide more compatible, smaller HTML files at the expense of reducing the human readability of the
       HTML code.  In some cases you may be able to reduce the size of your HTML by up to 50%!

       The HTML::Clean library provides a number of features that improve your HTML for browsing and serving:

       htmlclean passes each file given on the command line to the library and writes out the new HTML according to the specified options.  The default is to create a backup file and replace the file
       with cleaned HTML.

       Removing whitespace, Comments and other useless or redundant constructs
       Insuring that font tags work across multiple operating systems

       For full details see the documentations for HTML::Clean itself.

OPTIONS
       "-V"
           Print the version of the program.

       "-v"
           Verbose mode. Print out the original and final file sizes, plus the compression percent.  For example:

             5261   4065 22% /tmp/development-es.html
             5258   4061 22% /tmp/development-fr.html
             4651   3683 20% /tmp/development.html
