NAME
       prefix - Script that allows you to reconfigure environment variables for multiple installations of a set of software installed on the same machine

SYNOPSIS
       prefix

DESCRIPTION
       It is assumed that the software for each installation is all under a single directory whose name is assigned to an environment variable called PREFIX.

       This  arrangement of enabling multiple installations of software on a single machine is useful at many times. On a single server, it can provide for development, test, and production installations
       of software. Alternatively, on development servers, it allows for multiple development "sandboxes", one for each developer. On production servers, it allows for multiple versions of the production
       software to be installed. One might be the currently running software, one the previous software kept online as a fall-back, and one a new release of software wich is scheduled to be  brought  on‐
       line soon.

       There are three usages of the prefix script:

              (1) The interactive usage should be placed as the last line
                  of a user's ".profile".  The user must be running the
                  Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne Again shell (bash).
                  The user is prompted to enter one of the known PREFIX locations,
                  specified in the $HOME/.prefixes file or the /etc/prefixes file.
                  During configuration, the $PREFIX/.prefixrc file is sourced
                  in order to accomplish environment-specific configurations.

              (2) The non-interactive user configuration does not consult
                  $HOME/.prefixes or /etc/prefixes or prompt the user, but merely
                  configures the environment in accordance with the cmd line argument.

              (3) The batch command usage is mainly for running commands from
                  cron or running commands in another environment without changing
                  to that environment.

       Usage (1): . prefix                     (sets up environment)
             (2): . prefix <prefix>            (non-interactive setup)
             (3): prefix <prefix> <cmd> <args> (runs cmd configured for PREFIX)
