DESCRIPTION
       The  GNU  objcopy  utility copies the contents of an object file to another.  objcopy uses the GNU BFD Library to read and write the object files.  It can write the destination object file in a format
       different from that of the source object file.  The exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options.  Note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two  for‐
       mats. However, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats may not work as expected.

       objcopy  creates temporary files to do its translations and deletes them afterward.  objcopy uses BFD to do all its translation work; it has access to all the formats described in BFD and thus is able
       to recognize most formats without being told explicitly.

       objcopy can be used to generate S-records by using an output target of srec (e.g., use -O srec).

       objcopy can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an output target of binary (e.g., use -O binary).  When objcopy generates a raw binary file, it will essentially produce a memory dump of the
       contents of the input object file.  All symbols and relocation information will be discarded.  The memory dump will start at the load address of the lowest section copied into the output file.

       When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may be helpful to use -S to remove sections containing debugging information.  In some cases -R will be useful to remove sections which contain in‐
       formation that is not needed by the binary file.

       Note---objcopy is not able to change the endianness of its input files.  If the input format has an endianness (some formats do not), objcopy can only copy the inputs into file formats that  have  the
       same endianness or which have no endianness (e.g., srec).

OPTIONS
       infile
       outfile
           The input and output files, respectively.  If you do not specify outfile, objcopy creates a temporary file and destructively renames the result with the name of infile.

       -I bfdname
       --input-target=bfdname
           Consider the source file's object format to be bfdname, rather than attempting to deduce it.

       -O bfdname
       --output-target=bfdname
           Write the output file using the object format bfdname.

       -F bfdname
       --target=bfdname
           Use bfdname as the object format for both the input and the output file; i.e., simply transfer data from source to destination with no translation.

       -B bfdarch
       --binary-architecture=bfdarch
           Useful  when  transforming  a  raw binary input file into an object file.  In this case the output architecture can be set to bfdarch. This option will be ignored if the input file has a known bf‐
           darch. You can access this binary data inside a program by referencing the special symbols that are created by the conversion process.  These symbols are called _binary_objfile_start, _binary_obj‐
           file_end and _binary_objfile_size.  e.g. you can transform a picture file into an object file and then access it in your code using these symbols.

       -j sectionname
       --only-section=sectionname
           Copy only the named section from the input file to the output file.  This option may be given more than once.  Note that using this option inappropriately may make the output file unusable.

       -R sectionname
       --remove-section=sectionname
           Remove any section named sectionname from the output file.  This option may be given more than once.  Note that using this option inappropriately may make the output file unusable.

       -S
       --strip-all
           Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the source file.

       -g
       --strip-debug
           Do not copy debugging symbols or sections from the source file.

       --strip-unneeded
           Strip all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing.

       -K symbolname
       --keep-symbol=symbolname
           Copy only symbol symbolname from the source file.  This option may be given more than once.

       -N symbolname
       --strip-symbol=symbolname
           Do not copy symbol symbolname from the source file.  This option may be given more than once.

       --strip-unneeded-symbol=symbolname
           Do not copy symbol symbolname from the source file unless it is needed by a relocation.  This option may be given more than once.

       -G symbolname
       --keep-global-symbol=symbolname
           Keep only symbol symbolname global.  Make all other symbols local to the file, so that they are not visible externally.  This option may be given more than once.

       -L symbolname
       --localize-symbol=symbolname
           Make symbol symbolname local to the file, so that it is not visible externally.  This option may be given more than once.

       -W symbolname
       --weaken-symbol=symbolname
           Make symbol symbolname weak. This option may be given more than once.

       -w
       --wildcard
           Permit  regular  expressions  in  symbolnames used in other command line options.  The question mark (?), asterisk (*), backslash (\) and square brackets ([]) operators can be used anywhere in the
           symbol name.  If the first character of the symbol name is the exclamation point (!) then the sense of the switch is reversed for that symbol.  For example:

                     -w -W !foo -W fo*

           would cause objcopy to weaken all symbols that start with ``fo'' except for the symbol ``foo''.

       -x
       --discard-all
           Do not copy non-global symbols from the source file.

       -X
       --discard-locals
           Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols.  (These usually start with L or ..)

       -b byte
       --byte=byte
           Keep only every byteth byte of the input file (header data is not affected).  byte can be in the range from 0 to interleave-1, where interleave is given by the -i or --interleave  option,  or  the
           default of 4.  This option is useful for creating files to program ROM.  It is typically used with an "srec" output target.

       -i interleave
       --interleave=interleave
           Only copy one out of every interleave bytes.  Select which byte to copy with the -b or --byte option.  The default is 4.  objcopy ignores this option if you do not specify either -b or --byte.

       -p
       --preserve-dates
           Set the access and modification dates of the output file to be the same as those of the input file.

       --debugging
           Convert debugging information, if possible.  This is not the default because only certain debugging formats are supported, and the conversion process can be time consuming.

       --gap-fill val
           Fill gaps between sections with val.  This operation applies to the load address (LMA) of the sections.  It is done by increasing the size of the section with the lower address, and filling in the
           extra space created with val.

       --pad-to address
           Pad the output file up to the load address address.  This is done by increasing the size of the last section.  The extra space is filled in with the value specified by --gap-fill (default zero).

       --set-start val
           Set the start address of the new file to val.  Not all object file formats support setting the start address.

       --change-start incr
       --adjust-start incr
           Change the start address by adding incr.  Not all object file formats support setting the start address.

       --change-addresses incr
       --adjust-vma incr
           Change the VMA and LMA addresses of all sections, as well as the start address, by adding incr.  Some object file formats do not permit section addresses to be changed arbitrarily.  Note that this
           does  not relocate the sections; if the program expects sections to be loaded at a certain address, and this option is used to change the sections such that they are loaded at a different address,
           the program may fail.

       --change-section-address section{=,+,-}val
       --adjust-section-vma section{=,+,-}val
           Set or change both the VMA address and the LMA address of the named section.  If = is used, the section address is set to val.  Otherwise, val is added to or subtracted from the  section  address.
           See the comments under --change-addresses, above. If section does not exist in the input file, a warning will be issued, unless --no-change-warnings is used.

       --change-section-lma section{=,+,-}val
           Set  or  change  the  LMA address of the named section.  The LMA address is the address where the section will be loaded into memory at program load time.  Normally this is the same as the VMA ad‐
           dress, which is the address of the section at program run time, but on some systems, especially those where a program is held in ROM, the two can be different.  If = is used, the  section  address
           is  set  to val.  Otherwise, val is added to or subtracted from the section address.  See the comments under --change-addresses, above.  If section does not exist in the input file, a warning will
           be issued, unless --no-change-warnings is used.

       --change-section-vma section{=,+,-}val
           Set or change the VMA address of the named section.  The VMA address is the address where the section will be located once the program has started executing.  Normally this is the same as the  LMA
           address,  which is the address where the section will be loaded into memory, but on some systems, especially those where a program is held in ROM, the two can be different.  If = is used, the sec‐
           tion address is set to val.  Otherwise, val is added to or subtracted from the section address.  See the comments under --change-addresses, above.  If section does not exist in the input  file,  a
           warning will be issued, unless --no-change-warnings is used.

       --change-warnings
       --adjust-warnings
           If --change-section-address or --change-section-lma or --change-section-vma is used, and the named section does not exist, issue a warning.  This is the default.

       --no-change-warnings
       --no-adjust-warnings
           Do not issue a warning if --change-section-address or --adjust-section-lma or --adjust-section-vma is used, even if the named section does not exist.

       --set-section-flags section=flags
           Set  the  flags for the named section.  The flags argument is a comma separated string of flag names.  The recognized names are alloc, contents, load, noload, readonly, code, data, rom, share, and
           debug.  You can set the contents flag for a section which does not have contents, but it is not meaningful to clear the contents flag of a section which does have contents--just remove the section
           instead.  Not all flags are meaningful for all object file formats.

       --add-section sectionname=filename
           Add  a  new section named sectionname while copying the file.  The contents of the new section are taken from the file filename.  The size of the section will be the size of the file.  This option
           only works on file formats which can support sections with arbitrary names.

       --rename-section oldname=newname[,flags]
           Rename a section from oldname to newname, optionally changing the section's flags to flags in the process.  This has the advantage over usng a linker script to perform the rename in that the  out‐
           put stays as an object file and does not become a linked executable.

           This  option  is  particularly helpful when the input format is binary, since this will always create a section called .data.  If for example, you wanted instead to create a section called .rodata
           containing binary data you could use the following command line to achieve it:

                     objcopy -I binary -O <output_format> -B <architecture> \
                      --rename-section .data=.rodata,alloc,load,readonly,data,contents \
                      <input_binary_file> <output_object_file>

       --change-leading-char
           Some object file formats use special characters at the start of symbols.  The most common such character is underscore, which compilers often add before every symbol.  This option tells objcopy to
           change  the  leading  character  of every symbol when it converts between object file formats.  If the object file formats use the same leading character, this option has no effect.  Otherwise, it
           will add a character, or remove a character, or change a character, as appropriate.

       --remove-leading-char
           If the first character of a global symbol is a special symbol leading character used by the object file format, remove the character.  The most common symbol leading character is underscore.  This
           option  will  remove  a  leading underscore from all global symbols.  This can be useful if you want to link together objects of different file formats with different conventions for symbol names.
           This is different from --change-leading-char because it always changes the symbol name when appropriate, regardless of the object file format of the output file.

       --srec-len=ival
           Meaningful only for srec output.  Set the maximum length of the Srecords being produced to ival.  This length covers both address, data and crc fields.

       --srec-forceS3
           Meaningful only for srec output.  Avoid generation of S1/S2 records, creating S3-only record format.

       --redefine-sym old=new
           Change the name of a symbol old, to new.  This can be useful when one is trying link two things together for which you have no source, and there are name collisions.

       --redefine-syms=filename
           Apply --redefine-sym to each symbol pair "old new" listed in the file filename.  filename is simply a flat file, with one symbol pair per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash charac‐
           ter.  This option may be given more than once.

       --weaken
           Change all global symbols in the file to be weak.  This can be useful when building an object which will be linked against other objects using the -R option to the linker.  This option is only ef‐
           fective when using an object file format which supports weak symbols.

       --keep-symbols=filename
           Apply --keep-symbol option to each symbol listed in the file filename.  filename is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.  This
           option may be given more than once.

       --strip-symbols=filename
           Apply  --strip-symbol  option  to  each  symbol listed in the file filename.  filename is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.
           This option may be given more than once.

       --strip-unneeded-symbols=filename
           Apply --strip-unneeded-symbol option to each symbol listed in the file filename.  filename is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash  char‐
           acter.  This option may be given more than once.

       --keep-global-symbols=filename
           Apply  --keep-global-symbol  option to each symbol listed in the file filename.  filename is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash charac‐
           ter.  This option may be given more than once.

       --localize-symbols=filename
           Apply --localize-symbol option to each symbol listed in the file filename.  filename is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the  hash  character.
           This option may be given more than once.

       --weaken-symbols=filename
           Apply  --weaken-symbol  option  to  each symbol listed in the file filename.  filename is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.
           This option may be given more than once.

       --alt-machine-code=index
           If the output architecture has alternate machine codes, use the indexth code instead of the default one.  This is useful in case a machine is assigned an official code and  the  tool-chain  adopts
           the new code, but other applications still depend on the original code being used.

       --writable-text
           Mark the output text as writable.  This option isn't meaningful for all object file formats.

       --readonly-text
           Make the output text write protected.  This option isn't meaningful for all object file formats.

       --pure
           Mark the output file as demand paged.  This option isn't meaningful for all object file formats.

       --impure
           Mark the output file as impure.  This option isn't meaningful for all object file formats.

       --prefix-symbols=string
           Prefix all symbols in the output file with string.

       --prefix-sections=string
           Prefix all section names in the output file with string.

       --prefix-alloc-sections=string
           Prefix all the names of all allocated sections in the output file with string.

       --add-gnu-debuglink=path-to-file
           Creates a .gnu_debuglink section which contains a reference to path-to-file and adds it to the output file.

       --only-keep-debug
           Strip a file, removing any sections that would be stripped by --strip-debug and leaving the debugging sections.

           The  intention is that this option will be used in conjunction with --add-gnu-debuglink to create a two part executable.  One a stripped binary which will occupy less space in RAM and in a distri‐
           bution and the second a debugging information file which is only needed if debugging abilities are required.  The suggested procedure to create these files is as follows:

           1.<Link the executable as normal.  Assuming that is is called>
               "foo" then...

           1.<Run "objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.dbg" to>
               create a file containing the debugging info.

           1.<Run "objcopy --strip-debug foo" to create a>
               stripped executable.

           1.<Run "objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.dbg foo">
               to add a link to the debugging info into the stripped executable.

           Note - the choice of ".dbg" as an extension for the debug info file is arbitrary.  Also the "--only-keep-debug" step is optional.  You could instead do this:

           1.<Link the executable as normal.>
           1.<Copy "foo" to  "foo.full">
           1.<Run "objcopy --strip-debug foo">
           1.<Run "objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo">

           ie the file pointed to by the --add-gnu-debuglink can be the full executable.  It does not have to be a file created by the --only-keep-debug switch.

       -V
       --version
           Show the version number of objcopy.

       -v
       --verbose
           Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of archives, objcopy -V lists all members of the archive.

       --help
           Show a summary of the options to objcopy.

       --info
           Display a list showing all architectures and object formats available.
