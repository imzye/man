DESCRIPTION
       Beginning with Shorewall 5.1.0, the shorewall utility is used to control the Shoreline Firewall (Shorewall), Shorewall Firewall 6 (Shorewall6), Shorewall Firewall Lite (Shorewall-lite) and
       Shorewall Firewall 6 Lite (Shorewall6-lite). The utility may be accessed under four different names:

       shorewall
           Controls the Shorewall configuration when Shorewall is installed. If Shorewall is not installed, the shorewall command controls Shorewall-lite if it is installed. If neither Shorewall nor
           Shorewall-lite is installed, the shorewall command controls Shorewall6-lite if it is installed.

       shorewall6
           The shorewall6 command controls Shorewall6 when Shorewall6 is installed.

       shorewall-lite
           The shorewall-lite command controls Shorewall-lite when Shorewall-lite is installed.

       shorewall6-lite
           The shorewall6-lite command controls Shorewall6-lite when Shorewall6-lite is installed.

       Prior to Shorewall 5.1.0, these four commands were implemented as four separate program, each of which controlled only a single firewall package. This manpage serves to document both the Shorewall
       5.1 and Shorewall 5.0 CLI.

OPTIONS
       The options are:

       -4
           Added in Shorewall 5.1.0. Causes the command to operate on the Shorewall configuration or the Shorewall-lite configuration. It is the default when either of those products is installed and
           when the command is shorewall or shorewall-lite.

       -6
           Added in Shorewall 5.1.0. Causes the command to operate on the Shorewall6 or Shorewall6-lite configuration. It is the default when only Shorewall6-lite is installed and when the command is
           shorewall6 or shorewall6-lite.

       -l
           Added in Shorewall 5.1.0. Causes the command to operate on either Shorewall-lite or Shorewall-6 lite and is the default when Shorewall is not installed or when the command is shorewall-lite or
           shorewall6-lite.

           With all four firewall products (Shorewall, Shorewall6, Shorewall-lite and Shorewall6-lite) installed, the following table shows the correspondence between the name used to invoke the command
           and the shorewall command with the above three options.

           Table 1. All four products installed

           The next table shows the correspondence when only Shorewall-lite and Shorewall6-lite are installed.

           Table 2. Only Shorewall-lite and Shorewall6-lite installed

           Note that when Shorewall isn't installed, the 'shorewall' command behaves like shorewall-lite. The same is not true with respect to Shorewall6, "shorewall6" and 'shorewall6-lite". You can make
           'shorewall6' behave like 'shorewallt-lite' by adding the following command to root's .profile file (or to .bashrc, if root's shell is bash):

                   alias shorewall6=shorewall6-lite

       -v[verbosity]
           Alters the amount of output produced by the command. If neither the -v nor -q option are specified, the amount of output is determined by the VERBOSITY setting in shorewall.conf[1](5)
           (shorewall6.conf[1](5)).

           When no verbosity is specified, each instance of this option causes 1 to be added to the effective verbosity. When verbosity (-1,0,1 or 2) is given, the command is executed at the specified
           VERBOSITY. There may be no white-space between -v and the verbosity.

       -q
           Alters the amount of output produced by the command. If neither the -v nor -q option are specified, the amount of output is determined by the VERBOSITY setting in shorewall.conf[1](5)
           (shorewall6.conf[1](5)).

           Each instance of this option causes 1 to be subtracted from the effective verbosity.

       -t
           Causes all progress messages to be timestamped.

       -T
           Added in Shorewall 5.2.4 to replace the earlier trace keyword.. If the command invokes the generated firewall script, the script's execution will be traced to standard error.

       -D
           Added in Shorewall 5.2.4 to replace the earlier debug keyword. If the command invokes the generated firewall script, individual invocations of the ip[6]tables utility will be used to configure
           the ruleset rather than ip[6]tables-restore. This is useful for diagnosing ip[6]tables-restore failures on a *COMMIT command.

           Note

           Prior to Shorewall 5.2.4, the general syntax for a CLI command was:

           [trace|debug] [nolock] [options] command [command-options] [command-arguments]

           Examples:

                   shorewall debug -tv2 reload
                   shorewall trace check
                   shorewall nolock enable eth0

           In Shorewall 5.2.4 and later, those commands would be:

                   shorewall -Dtv2 reload
                   shorewall check -D
                   shorewall -N enable eth0

           While not shown in the command synopses at the top of this page, the nolock keyword is still supported in Shorewall 5.2.4 and later, but is deprecated in favor of the -N option.

COMMANDS
       The available commands are listed below.

       add { interface[:host-list]... zone | zone host-list }
           Adds a list of hosts or subnets to a dynamic zone usually used with VPN's.

           The interface argument names an interface defined in the shorewall-interfaces[2](5) (shorewall6-interfaces[2](5))file. A host-list is comma-separated list whose elements are host or network
           addresses..if n .sp
               Caution
               The add command is not very robust. If there are errors in the host-list, you may see a large number of error messages yet a subsequent shorewall show zones command will indicate that all
               hosts were added. If this happens, replace add by delete and run the same command again. Then enter the correct command.

           Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.9, the dynamic_shared zone option (shorewall-zones[3](5),shorewall6-zones[3](5)) allows a single ipset to handle entries for multiple interfaces. When that option
           is specified for a zone, the add command has the alternative syntax in which the zone name precedes the host-list.

       allow address
           Re-enables receipt of packets from hosts previously blacklisted by a blacklist, drop, logdrop, reject, or logreject command.

       blacklist[!] address [ option ... ]
           Added in Shorewall 5.0.8 and requires DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=ipset.. in shorewall.conf[1](5). Causes packets from the given host or network address to be dropped, based on the setting of BLACKLIST
           in shorewall.conf[1](5). The address along with any options are passed to the ipset add command. Probably the most useful option is the timeout option. For example, to permanently blacklist
           192.0.2.22, the command would be:

                   shorewall blacklist 192.0.2.22 timeout 0

           Beginning with Shorewall 5.2.5, the above command can be shortened to:

                   shorewall blacklist! 192.0.2.22

           If the disconnect option is specified in the DYNAMIC_BLACKLISTING setting, then the effective VERBOSITY determines the amount of information displayed:

           •   If the effective verbosity is > 0, then a message giving the number of conntrack flows deleted by the command is displayed.

           •   If the effective verbosity is > 1, then the conntrack table entries deleted by the command are also displayed.

       call function [ parameter ... ]
           Added in Shorewall 4.6.10. Allows you to call a function in one of the Shorewall libraries or in your compiled script. function must name the shell function to be called. The listed parameters
           are passed to the function.

           The function is first searched for in lib.base, lib.common, lib.cli and lib.cli-std. If it is not found, the call command is passed to the generated script to be executed.

       check [-e] [-d] [-p] [-r] [-T] [-i] [-D][directory]
           Not available with Shorewall[6]-lite.

           Compiles the configuration in the specified directory and discards the compiled output script. If no directory is given, then /etc/shorewall is assumed.

           The -e option causes the compiler to look for a file named capabilities. This file is produced using the command shorewall-lite show -f capabilities > capabilities on a system with Shorewall
           Lite installed.

           The -d option causes the compiler to be run under control of the Perl debugger.

           The -p option causes the compiler to be profiled via the Perl -wd:DProf command-line option.

           The -r option was added in Shorewall 4.5.2 and causes the compiler to print the generated ruleset to standard out.

           The -T option was added in Shorewall 4.4.20 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler-generated error and warning message.

           The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";"). Such lines will
           be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)).

           The -D option was added in Shoewall 5.2.4 and causes the compiler to write a large amount of debugging information to standard output.

       clear [-f]
           Clear will remove all rules and chains installed by Shorewall. The firewall is then wide open and unprotected. Existing connections are untouched. Clear is often used to see if the firewall is
           causing connection problems.

           If -f is given, the command will be processed by the compiled script that executed the last successful start, restart or reload command if that script exists.

       close { open-number | source dest [ protocol [ port ] ] }
           Added in Shorewall 4.5.8. This command closes a temporary open created by the open command. In the first form, an open-number specifies the open to be closed. Open numbers are displayed in the
           num column of the output of the shorewall show opens command.

           When the second form of the command is used, the parameters must match those given in the earlier open command.

           This command requires that the firewall be in the started state and that DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in shorewall.conf (5)[1].

       compile [-e] [-c] [-d] [-p] [-T] [-i] [-D] [ directory ] [ pathname ]
           Not available with shorewall[6]-lite.

           Compiles the current configuration into the executable file pathname. If a directory is supplied, Shorewall will look in that directory first for configuration files. If the pathname is
           omitted, the file firewall in the VARDIR (normally /var/lib/shorewall/) is assumed. A pathname of '-' causes the compiler to send the generated script to it's standard output file. Note that
           '-v-1' is usually specified in this case (e.g., shorewall -v-1 compile -- -) to suppress the 'Compiling...' message normally generated by /sbin/shorewall.

           When -e is specified, the compilation is being performed on a system other than where the compiled script will run. This option disables certain configuration options that require the script
           to be compiled where it is to be run. The use of -e requires the presence of a configuration file named capabilities which may be produced using the command shorewall-lite show -f capabilities
           > capabilities on a system with Shorewall Lite installed

           The -c option was added in Shorewall 4.5.17 and causes conditional compilation of a script. The script specified by pathname (or implied if pathname is omitted) is compiled if it doesn't exist
           or if there is any file in the directory or in a directory on the CONFIG_PATH that has a modification time later than the file to be compiled. When no compilation is needed, a message is
           issued and an exit status of zero is returned.

           The -d option causes the compiler to be run under control of the Perl debugger.

           The -p option causes the compiler to be profiled via the Perl -wd:DProf command-line option.

           The -T option was added in Shorewall 4.4.20 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler-generated error and warning message.

           The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";"). Such lines will
           be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)).

           The -D option was added in Shoewall 5.2.4 and causes the compiler to write a large amount of debugging information to standard output.

       delete { interface[:host-list]... zone | zone host-list }
           The delete command reverses the effect of an earlier add command.

           The interface argument names an interface defined in the shorewall-interfaces[2](5) (shorewall6-interfaces[2](5) file. A host-list is comma-separated list whose elements are a host or network
           address.

           Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.9, the dynamic_shared zone option (shorewall-zones[3](5), shorewall6-zones[3](5)) allows a single ipset to handle entries for multiple interfaces. When that option
           is specified for a zone, the delete command has the alternative syntax in which the zone name precedes the host-list.

       disable { interface | provider }
           Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Disables the optional provider associated with the specified interface or provider. Where more than one provider share a single network interface, a provider name
           must be given.

           Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.10, this command may be used with any optional network interface.  interface may be either the logical or physical name of the interface. The command removes any
           routes added from shorewall-routes[4](5) (shorewall6-routes[4](5))and any traffic shaping configuration for the interface.

       drop address
           Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be silently dropped. This command requires that the firewall be in the started state and that DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in shorewall.conf (5)[1].

       dump  [-x] [-l] [-m] [-c]
           Produces a verbose report about the firewall configuration for the purpose of problem analysis.

           The -x option causes actual packet and byte counts to be displayed. Without that option, these counts are abbreviated.

           The -m option causes any MAC addresses included in Shorewall log messages to be displayed.

           The -l option causes the rule number for each Netfilter rule to be displayed.

           The -c option causes the route cache to be dumped in addition to the other routing information.

       enable { interface | provider }
           Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Enables the optional provider associated with the specified interface or provider. Where more than one provider share a single network interface, a provider name
           must be given.

           Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.10, this command may be used with any optional network interface.  interface may be either the logical or physical name of the interface. The command sets /proc
           entries for the interface, adds any route specified in shorewall-routes[4](5) (shorewall6-routes[4](5)) and installs the interface's traffic shaping configuration, if any.

       export [ directory1 ] [ user@]system[:directory2 ]
           Not available with Shorewall[6]-lite.

           If directory1 is omitted, the current working directory is assumed.

           Allows a non-root user to compile a shorewall script and stage it on a system (provided that the user has access to the system via ssh). The command is equivalent to:

                   /sbin/shorewall compile -e directory1 directory1/firewall &&\
                   scp directory1/firewall directory1/firewall.conf [user@]system:[directory2]

           In other words, the configuration in the specified (or defaulted) directory is compiled to a file called firewall in that directory. If compilation succeeds, then firewall and firewall.conf
           are copied to system using scp.

       forget [ filename ]
           Deletes /var/lib/shorewall/filename and /var/lib/shorewall/save. If no filename is given then the file specified by RESTOREFILE in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)) is assumed.

       help
           Displays a syntax summary.

       hits [-t]
           Generates several reports from Shorewall log messages in the current log file. If the -t option is included, the reports are restricted to log messages generated today. Not available with
           Shorewall6[-lite].

       ipcalc { address mask | address/vlsm }
           Ipcalc displays the network address, broadcast address, network in CIDR notation and netmask corresponding to the input[s]. Not available with Shorewall6[-lite].

       iprange address1-address2
           Iprange decomposes the specified range of IP addresses into the equivalent list of network/host addresses. Not available with Shorewall6[-lite].

       iptrace iptables match expression
           This is a low-level debugging command that causes iptables TRACE log records to be created. See iptables(8) for details.

           The iptables match expression must be one or more matches that may appear in both the raw table OUTPUT and raw table PREROUTING chains.

           The log message destination is determined by the currently-selected IPv4 or IPv6 logging backend[5].

       list
           list is a synonym for show -- please see below.

       logdrop address
           Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be logged then discarded. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in shorewall.conf[1] (5)
           (shorewall6.conf[1](5)). This command requires that the firewall be in the started state and that DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in shorewall.conf (5)[1].

       logwatch [-m] [ refresh-interval ]
           Monitors the log file specified by the LOGFILE option in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)) and produces an audible alarm when new Shorewall messages are logged. The -m option causes
           the MAC address of each packet source to be displayed if that information is available. The refresh-interval specifies the time in seconds between screen refreshes. You can enter a negative
           number by preceding the number with "--" (e.g., shorewall logwatch -- -30). In this case, when a packet count changes, you will be prompted to hit any key to resume screen refreshes.

       logreject address
           Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be logged then rejected. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in shorewall.conf[1] (5),
           (shorewall6.conf[1](5)). This command requires that the firewall be in the started state and that DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in shorewall.conf (5)[1].

       ls
           ls is a synonym for show -- please see below.

       noiptrace iptables match expression
           This is a low-level debugging command that cancels a trace started by a preceding iptrace command.

           The iptables match expression must be one given in the iptrace command being canceled.

       open source dest [ protocol [ port ] ]
           Added in Shorewall 4.6.8. This command requires that the firewall be in the started state and that DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in shorewall.conf (5)[1]. The effect of the command is to temporarily
           open the firewall for connections matching the parameters.

           The source and dest parameters may each be specified as all if you don't wish to restrict the connection source or destination respectively. Otherwise, each must contain a host or network
           address or a valid DNS name.

           The protocol may be specified either as a number or as a name listed in /etc/protocols. The port may be specified numerically or as a name listed in /etc/services.

           To reverse the effect of a successful open command, use the close command with the same parameters or simply restart the firewall.

           Example: To open the firewall for SSH connections to address 192.168.1.1, the command would be:

                   shorewall open all 192.168.1.1 tcp 22

           To reverse that command, use:

                   shorewall close all 192.168.1.1 tcp 22

       reenable{ interface | provider }
           Added in Shorewall 4.6.9. This is equivalent to a disable command followed by an enable command on the specified interface or provider.

       reject address
           Causes traffic from the listed addresses to be silently rejected. This command requires that the firewall be in the started state and that DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in shorewall.conf (5)[1].

       reload [-n] [-p] [-d] [-f] [-c] [-T] [-i] [-C] [-D] [ directory ]
           This command was re-implemented in Shorewall 5.0.0. The pre-5.0.0 reload command is now called remote-restart (see below).

           Shorewall and Shorewall6
               Reload is similar to shorewall start except that it assumes that the firewall is already started. Existing connections are maintained. If a directory is included in the command, Shorewall
               will look in that directory first for configuration files.

               The -n option causes Shorewall to avoid updating the routing table(s).

               The -p option causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack utility must be installed to use this option.

               The -d option causes the compiler to run under the Perl debugger.

               The -f option suppresses the compilation step and simply reused the compiled script which last started/restarted Shorewall, provided that /etc/shorewall and its contents have not been
               modified since the last start/restart.

               The -c option was added in Shorewall 4.4.20 and performs the compilation step unconditionally, overriding the AUTOMAKE setting in shorewall.conf[1](5) (Shorewall and Shorewall6 only). When
               both -f and -c are present, the result is determined by the option that appears last.

               The -T option was added in Shorewall 4.5.3 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler-generated error and warning message.

               The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";"). Such lines
               will be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5))..

               The -C option was added in Shorewall 4.6.5 and is only meaningful when AUTOMAKE=Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)). If an existing firewall script is used and if that
               script was the one that generated the current running configuration, then the running netfilter configuration will be reloaded as is so as to preserve the iptables packet and byte
               counters.

               The -D option was added in Shoewall 5.2.4 and causes the compiler to write a large amount of debugging information to standard output.

           Shorewall-lite and Shorewall6-lite
               Reload is similar to shorewall start except that it assumes that the firewall is already started. Existing connections are maintained.

               The -n option causes Shorewall to avoid updating the routing table(s).

               The -p option causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack utility must be installed to use this option.

               The -C option was added in Shorewall 4.6.5 If the existing firewall script is the one that generated the current running configuration, then the running netfilter configuration will be
               reloaded as is so as to preserve the iptables packet and byte counters.

       remote-getcaps [-R] [-r root-user-name] [ [ -D ] directory ] [ system ]
           Added in Shoreall 5.2.0, this command executes shorewall[6]-lite show capabilities -f > /var/lib/shorewall[6]-lite/capabilities on the remote system via ssh then the generated file is copied
           to directory on the local system. If no directory is given, the current working directory is assumed.

           if -R is included, the remote shorewallrc file is also copied to directory.

           If -r is included, it specifies that the root user on system is named root-user-name rather than "root".

       remote-getrc [-c] [-r root-user-name] [ [ -D ] directory ] [ system ]
           Added in Shoreall 5.2.0, this command copies the shorewallrc file from the remote system to directory on the local system. If no directory is given, the current working directory is assumed.

           if -c is included, the remote capabilities are also copied to directory, as is done by the remote-getcaps command.

           If -r is included, it specifies that the root user on system is named root-user-name rather than "root".

       remote-start [-n] [-s] [-c] [-r root-user-name] [-T] [-i] [ [ -D ] directory ] [ system ]
           This command was renamed from load in Shorewall 5.0.0 and is only available in Shorewall and Shoreawall6.

           If directory is omitted, the current working directory is assumed. Allows a non-root user to compile a shorewall script and install it on a system (provided that the user has root access to
           the system via ssh). The command is equivalent to:

                   /sbin/shorewall compile -e directory directory/firewall &&\
                   scp directory/firewall directory/firewall.conf root@system:/var/lib/shorewall-lite/ &&\
                   ssh root@system '/sbin/shorewall-lite start'

           In other words, the configuration in the specified (or defaulted) directory is compiled to a file called firewall in that directory. If compilation succeeds, then firewall is copied to system
           using scp. If the copy succeeds, Shorewall Lite on system is started via ssh. Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.13, if system is omitted, then the FIREWALL option setting in shorewall.conf[6](5)
           (shorewall6.conf(5)[1]) is assumed. In that case, if you want to specify a directory, then the -D option must be given.

           The -n option causes Shorewall to avoid updating the routing table(s).

           If -s is specified and the start command succeeds, then the remote Shorewall-lite configuration is saved by executing shorewall-lite save via ssh.

           if -c is included, the command shorewall[6]-lite show capabilities -f > /var/lib/shorewall[6]-lite/capabilities is executed via ssh then the generated file is copied to directory using scp.
           This step is performed before the configuration is compiled.

           If -r is included, it specifies that the root user on system is named root-user-name rather than "root".

           The -T option was added in Shorewall 4.5.3 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler-generated error and warning message.

       remote-reload [-s] [-c] [-r root-user-name] [-T] [-i] [ [ -D ] directory ] [ system ]
           This command was added in Shorewall 5.0.0 and is only available in Shorewall and Shorewall6.

           If directory is omitted, the current working directory is assumed. Allows a non-root user to compile a shorewall script and install it on a system (provided that the user has root access to
           the system via ssh). The command is equivalent to:

                   /sbin/shorewall compile -e directory directory/firewall &&\
                   scp directory/firewall directory/firewall.conf root@system:/var/lib/shorewall-lite/ &&\
                   ssh root@system '/sbin/shorewall-lite reload'

           In other words, the configuration in the specified (or defaulted) directory is compiled to a file called firewall in that directory. If compilation succeeds, then firewall is copied to system
           using scp. If the copy succeeds, Shorewall Lite on system is restarted via ssh. Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.13, if system is omitted, then the FIREWALL option setting in shorewall6.conf(5)[1]
           (shorewall6.conf[1](5)) is assumed. In that case, if you want to specify a directory, then the -D option must be given.

           If -s is specified and the restart command succeeds, then the remote Shorewall-lite configuration is saved by executing shorewall-lite save via ssh.

           if -c is included, the command shorewall-lite show capabilities -f > /var/lib/shorewall-lite/capabilities is executed via ssh then the generated file is copied to directory using scp. This
           step is performed before the configuration is compiled.

           If -r is included, it specifies that the root user on system is named root-user-name rather than "root".

           The -T option was added in Shorewall 4.5.3 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler-generated error and warning message.

           The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";"). Such lines will
           be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)).

       remote-restart [-s] [-c] [-r root-user-name] [-T] [-i] [ [ -D ] directory ] [ system ]
           This command was renamed from reload in Shorewall 5.0.0 and is available in Shorewall and Shorewall6 only.

           If directory is omitted, the current working directory is assumed. Allows a non-root user to compile a shorewall script and install it on a system (provided that the user has root access to
           the system via ssh). The command is equivalent to:

                   /sbin/shorewall compile -e directory directory/firewall &&\
                   scp directory/firewall directory/firewall.conf root@system:/var/lib/shorewall-lite/ &&\
                   ssh root@system '/sbin/shorewall-lite restart'

           In other words, the configuration in the specified (or defaulted) directory is compiled to a file called firewall in that directory. If compilation succeeds, then firewall is copied to system
           using scp. If the copy succeeds, Shorewall Lite on system is restarted via ssh. Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.13, if system is omitted, then the FIREWALL option setting in shorewall6.conf(5)[1]
           (shorewall6.conf[1](5)) is assumed. In that case, if you want to specify a directory, then the -D option must be given.

           If -s is specified and the restart command succeeds, then the remote Shorewall-lite configuration is saved by executing shorewall-lite save via ssh.

           if -c is included, the command shorewall-lite show capabilities -f > /var/lib/shorewall-lite/capabilities is executed via ssh then the generated file is copied to directory using scp. This
           step is performed before the configuration is compiled.

           If -r is included, it specifies that the root user on system is named root-user-name rather than "root".

           The -T option was added in Shorewall 4.5.3 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler-generated error and warning message.

           The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";"). Such lines will
           be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5).

       reset [chain, ...]
           Resets the packet and byte counters in the specified chain(s). If no chain is specified, all the packet and byte counters in the firewall are reset.

           Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.0, chain may be composed of both a table name and a chain name separated by a colon (e.g., mangle:PREROUTING). Chain names following that don't include a table
           name are assumed to be in that same table. If no table name is given in the command, the filter table is assumed.

       restart [-n] [-p] [-d] [-f] [-c] [-T] [-i] [-C] [-D] [ directory ]
           Beginning with Shorewall 5.0.0, this command performs a true restart. The firewall is completely stopped as if a stop command had been issued then it is started again.

           Shorewall and Shorewall6
               If a directory is included in the command, Shorewall will look in that directory first for configuration files.

               The -n option causes Shorewall to avoid updating the routing table(s).

               The -p option causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack utility must be installed to use this option.

               The -d option causes the compiler to run under the Perl debugger.

               The -f option suppresses the compilation step and simply reused the compiled script which last started/restarted Shorewall, provided that /etc/shorewall and its contents have not been
               modified since the last start/restart.

               The -c option was added in Shorewall 4.4.20 and performs the compilation step unconditionally, overriding the AUTOMAKE setting in shorewall.conf[1](5). When both -f and -c are present, the
               result is determined by the option that appears last.

               The -T option was added in Shorewall 4.5.3 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler-generated error and warning message.

               The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";"). Such lines
               will be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5).

               The -C option was added in Shorewall 4.6.5 and is only meaningful when AUTOMAKE=Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5). If an existing firewall script is used and if that script was the one that
               generated the current running configuration, then the running netfilter configuration will be reloaded as is so as to preserve the iptables packet and byte counters.

               The -D option was added in Shoewall 5.2.4 and causes the compiler to write a large amount of debugging information to standard output.

           Shorewall-lite and Shorewall6-lite
               The -n option causes Shorewall to avoid updating the routing table(s).

               The -p option causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack utility must be installed to use this option.

               The -C option was added in Shorewall 4.6.5 If the existing firewall script is the one that generated the current running configuration, then the running netfilter configuration will be
               reloaded as is so as to preserve the iptables packet and byte counters.

       restore  [-n] [-p] [-C] [ filename ]
           Restore Shorewall to a state saved using the shorewall save command. Existing connections are maintained. The filename names a restore file in /var/lib/shorewall created using shorewall save;
           if no filename is given then Shorewall will be restored from the file specified by the RESTOREFILE option in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)).

               Caution
               If your iptables ruleset depends on variables that are detected at run-time, either in your params file or by Shorewall-generated code, restore will use the values that were current when
               the ruleset was saved, which may be different from the current values.
           The -n option causes Shorewall to avoid updating the routing table(s).

           The -p option, added in Shorewall 4.6.5, causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack utility must be installed to use this option.

           The -C option was added in Shorewall 4.6.5. If the -C option was specified during shorewall save, then the counters saved by that operation will be restored.

       run command [ parameter ... ]
           Added in Shorewall 4.6.3. Executes command in the context of the generated script passing the supplied parameters. Normally, the command will be a function declared in lib.private.

           Before executing the command, the script will detect the configuration, setting all SW_* variables and will run your init extension script with $COMMAND = 'run'.

           If there are files in the CONFIG_PATH that were modified after the current firewall script was generated, the following warning message is issued:
               WARNING: /var/lib/shorewall/firewall is not up to
                           date

       safe-reload [-d] [-p] [-t timeout ] [ directory ]
           Added in Shorewall 5.0.0, this command performs the same function as did safe_restart in earlier releases. The command is available in Shorewall and Shorewall6 only.

           Only allowed if Shorewall is running. The current configuration is saved in /var/lib/shorewall/safe-reload (see the save command below) then a shorewall reload is done. You will then be
           prompted asking if you want to accept the new configuration or not. If you answer "n" or if you fail to answer within 60 seconds (such as when your new configuration has disabled communication
           with your terminal), the configuration is restored from the saved configuration. If a directory is given, then Shorewall will look in that directory first when opening configuration files.

           Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.0, you may specify a different timeout value using the -t option. The numeric timeout may optionally be followed by an s, m or h suffix (e.g., 5m) to specify
           seconds, minutes or hours respectively. If the suffix is omitted, seconds is assumed.

       safe-restart [-d] [-p] [-t timeout ] [ directory ]
           Only allowed if Shorewall[6] is running and is not available in Shorewall-lite and Shorewall6-lite. The current configuration is saved in /var/lib/shorewall/safe-restart (see the save command
           below) then a shorewall restart is done. You will then be prompted asking if you want to accept the new configuration or not. If you answer "n" or if you fail to answer within 60 seconds (such
           as when your new configuration has disabled communication with your terminal), the configuration is restored from the saved configuration. If a directory is given, then Shorewall will look in
           that directory first when opening configuration files.

           Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.0, you may specify a different timeout value using the -t option. The numeric timeout may optionally be followed by an s, m or h suffix (e.g., 5m) to specify
           seconds, minutes or hours respectively. If the suffix is omitted, seconds is assumed.

       safe-start [-d] [-p] [-ttimeout ] [ directory ]
           Shorewall is started normally. You will then be prompted asking if everything went all right. If you answer "n" or if you fail to answer within 60 seconds (such as when your new configuration
           has disabled communication with your terminal), a shorewall clear is performed for you. If a directory is given, then Shorewall will look in that directory first when opening configuration
           files.

           Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.0, you may specify a different timeout value using the -t option. The numeric timeout may optionally be followed by an s, m or h suffix (e.g., 5m) to specify
           seconds, minutes or hours respectively. If the suffix is omitted, seconds is assumed.

           This command is available in Shorewall and Shorewall6 only.

       save  [-C] [ filename ]
           Creates a snapshot of the currently running firewall. The dynamic blacklist is stored in /var/lib/shorewall/save. The state of the firewall is stored in /var/lib/shorewall/filename for use by
           the shorewall restore command. If filename is not given then the state is saved in the file specified by the RESTOREFILE option in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)).

           The -C option, added in Shorewall 4.6.5, causes the iptables packet and byte counters to be saved along with the chains and rules.

       savesets
           Added in shorewall 4.6.8. Performs the same action as the stop command with respect to saving ipsets (see the SAVE_IPSETS option in shorewall.conf[1] (5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)). This command
           may be used to proactively save your ipset contents in the event that a system failure occurs prior to issuing a stop command.

       show
           The show command can have a number of different arguments:

           action action
               Lists the named action file. Available on Shorewall and Shorewall6 only.

           actions
               Produces a report about the available actions (built-in, standard and user-defined). Available on Shorewall and Shorewall6 only.

           bl|blacklists [-x]
               Added in Shorewall 4.6.2. Displays the dynamic chain along with any chains produced by entries in shorewall-blrules(5). The -x option is passed directly through to iptables and causes
               actual packet and byte counts to be displayed. Without this option, those counts are abbreviated.

           [-f] capabilities
               Displays your kernel/iptables capabilities. The -f option causes the display to be formatted as a capabilities file for use with compile -e.

           [-b] [-x] [-l] [-t {filter|mangle|nat|raw}] [ chain... ]
               The rules in each chain are displayed using the iptables -L chain -n -v command. If no chain is given, all of the chains in the filter table are displayed. The -x option is passed directly
               through to iptables and causes actual packet and byte counts to be displayed. Without this option, those counts are abbreviated. The -t option specifies the Netfilter table to display. The
               default is filter.

               The -b ('brief') option causes rules which have not been used (i.e. which have zero packet and byte counts) to be omitted from the output. Chains with no rules displayed are also omitted
               from the output.

               The -l option causes the rule number for each Netfilter rule to be displayed.

               If the -t option and the chain keyword are both omitted and any of the listed chains do not exist, a usage message is displayed.

           classifiers|filters
               Displays information about the packet classifiers defined on the system as a result of traffic shaping configuration. Beginning with Shorewall 5.2.8, this command is deprecated, as its
               output is included in the information displayed by the 'show tc' command.

           config
               Displays distribution-specific defaults.

           connections [filter_parameter ...]
               Displays the IP connections currently being tracked by the firewall.

               If the conntrack utility is installed, beginning with Shorewall 4.6.11 the set of connections displayed can be limited by including conntrack filter parameters (-p , -s, --dport, etc). See
               conntrack(8) for details.

           event event
               Added in Shorewall 4.5.19. Displays the named event.

           events
               Added in Shorewall 4.5.19. Displays all events.

           ip
               Displays the system's IPv4 configuration.

           ipa
               Added in Shorewall 4.4.17. Displays the per-IP accounting counters (shorewall-accounting[7] (5), shorewall6-accounting[7](5)).

           ipsec
               Added in Shorewall 5.1.0. Displays the contents of the IPSEC Security Policy Database (SPD) and Security Association Database (SAD). SAD keys are not displayed.

           [-m] log
               Displays the last 20 Shorewall messages from the log file specified by the LOGFILE option in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)). The -m option causes the MAC address of each
               packet source to be displayed if that information is available.

           macros
               Displays information about each macro defined on the firewall system (Shorewall and Shorewall6 only)

           macro macro
               Added in Shorewall 4.4.6. Displays the file that implements the specified macro (usually /usr/share/shorewall/macro.macro). Available only in Shorewall and Shorewall6.

           [-x] mangle
               Displays the Netfilter mangle table using the command iptables -t mangle -L -n -v. The -x option is passed directly through to iptables and causes actual packet and byte counts to be
               displayed. Without this option, those counts are abbreviated.

           marks
               Added in Shorewall 4.4.26. Displays the various fields in packet marks giving the min and max value (in both decimal and hex) and the applicable mask (in hex).

           [-x] nat
               Displays the Netfilter nat table using the command iptables -t nat -L -n -v. The -x option is passed directly through to iptables and causes actual packet and byte counts to be displayed.
               Without this option, those counts are abbreviated.

           opens
               Added in Shorewall 4.5.8. Displays the iptables rules in the 'dynamic' chain created through use of the open command..

           policies
               Added in Shorewall 4.4.4. Displays the applicable policy between each pair of zones. Note that implicit intrazone ACCEPT policies are not displayed for zones associated with a single
               network where that network doesn't specify routeback.

           rc
               Added in Shorewall 5.2.0. Displays the contents of $SHAREDIR/shorewall/shorewallrc.

           [-c] routing
               Displays the system's IPv4 routing configuration. The -c option causes the route cache to be displayed along with the other routing information.

           [-x] raw
               Displays the Netfilter raw table using the command iptables -t raw -L -n -v. The -x option is passed directly through to iptables and causes actual packet and byte counts to be displayed.
               Without this option, those counts are abbreviated.

           saves
               Added in Shorewall 5.2.0. Lists snapshots created by the save command. Each snapshot is listed with the date and time when it was taken. If there is a snapshot with the name specified in
               the RESTOREFILE option in shorewall.conf(5[6]), that snapshot is listed as the default snapshot for the restore command.

           tc
               Displays information about queuing disciplines, classes and filters.

           zones
               Displays the current composition of the Shorewall zones on the system.

       start  [-n] [-p] [-d] [-f] [-c] [-T] [-i] [-C] [-D] [ directory ]

           Shorewall and Shorewall6
               Start shorewall[6]. Existing connections through shorewall managed interfaces are untouched. New connections will be allowed only if they are allowed by the firewall rules or policies. If
               a directory is included in the command, Shorewall will look in that directory first for configuration files. If -f is specified, the saved configuration specified by the RESTOREFILE option
               in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)) will be restored if that saved configuration exists and has been modified more recently than the files in /etc/shorewall. When -f is given,
               a directory may not be specified.

               Update: In Shorewall 4.4.20, a new LEGACY_FASTSTART option was added to shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)). When LEGACY_FASTSTART=No, the modification times of files in
               /etc/shorewall are compared with that of /var/lib/shorewall/firewall (the compiled script that last started/restarted the firewall).

               The -n option causes Shorewall to avoid updating the routing table(s).

               The -p option causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack utility must be installed to use this option.

               The -c option was added in Shorewall 4.4.20 and performs the compilation step unconditionally, overriding the AUTOMAKE setting in shorewall.conf[1](5) (shorewall6.conf[1](5)). When both -f
               and -care present, the result is determined by the option that appears last.

               The -T option was added in Shorewall 4.5.3 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler-generated error and warning message.

               The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";"). Such lines
               will be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf(5)[1] (shorewall6.conf[1](5)).

               The -C option was added in Shorewall 4.6.5 and is only meaningful when the -f option is also specified. If the previously-saved configuration is restored, and if the -C option was also
               specified in the save command, then the packet and byte counters will be restored.

               The -D option was added in Shoewall 5.2.4 and causes the compiler to write a large amount of debugging information to standard output.

           Shorewall-lite and Shorewall6-lite
               Start Shorewall[6] Lite. Existing connections through shorewall[6]-lite managed interfaces are untouched. New connections will be allowed only if they are allowed by the firewall rules or
               policies.

               The -p option causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the conntrack utility must be installed to use this option.

               The -n option prevents the firewall script from modifying the current routing configuration.

               The -f option was added in Shorewall 4.6.5. If the RESTOREFILE named in shorewall.conf[6](5) exists, is executable and is not older than the current filewall script, then that saved
               configuration is restored.

               The -C option was added in Shorewall 4.6.5 and is only meaningful when the -f option is also specified. If the previously-saved configuration is restored, and if the -C option was also
               specified in the save command, then the packet and byte counters will be restored.

       stop
           Stops the firewall. All existing connections, except those listed in shorewall-stoppedrules[8](5) or permitted by the ADMINISABSENTMINDED option in shorewall.conf[1], are taken down. The only
           new traffic permitted through the firewall is from systems listed in shorewall-stoppedrules[8](5) or by ADMINISABSENTMINDED.

       status [-i]
           Produces a short report about the state of the Shorewall-configured firewall.

           The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.2 and causes the status of each optional or provider interface to be displayed.

       try directory [ timeout ]
           This command is available in Shorewall and Shorewall6 only.

           If Shorewall[6] is started then the firewall state is saved to a temporary saved configuration (/var/lib/shorewall/.try). Next, if Shorewall[6] is currently started then a restart command is
           issued using the specified configuration directory; otherwise, a start command is performed using the specified configuration directory. if an error occurs during the compilation phase of the
           restart or start, the command terminates without changing the Shorewall[6] state. If an error occurs during the restart phase, then a shorewall restore is performed using the saved
           configuration. If an error occurs during the start phase, then Shorewall is cleared. If the start/restart succeeds and a timeout is specified then a clear or restore is performed after timeout
           seconds.

           Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.0, the numeric timeout may optionally be followed by an s, m or h suffix (e.g., 5m) to specify seconds, minutes or hours respectively. If the suffix is omitted,
           seconds is assumed.

       update  [-d] [-r] [-T] [-a] [-i] [-A] [ directory ]
           This command is available only in Shorewall and Shorewall6.

           Added in Shorewall 4.4.21 and causes the compiler to update /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf then validate the configuration. The update will add options not present in the old file with their
           default values, and will move deprecated options with non-defaults to a deprecated options section at the bottom of the file. Your existing shorewall.conf file is renamed shorewall.conf.bak.

           The command was extended over the years with a set of options that caused additional configuration updates.

           •   Convert an existing blacklist file into an equivalent blrules file.

           •   Convert an existing routestopped file into an equivalent stoppedrules file.

           •   Convert existing tcrules and tos files into an equivalent mangle file.

           •   Convert an existing notrack file into an equivalent conntrack file.

           •   Convert FORMAT, SECTION and COMMENT entries into ?FORMAT, ?SECTION and ?COMMENT directives.

           In each case, the old file is renamed with a .bak suffix.

           In Shorewall 5.0.0, the options were eliminated and the update command performs all of the updates described above.

               Important
               There are some notable restrictions with the update command:

                1. Converted rules will be appended to the existing file; if there is no existing file in the CONFIG_PATH, one will be created in the directory specified in the command or in the first
                   entry in the CONFIG_PATH (normally /etc/shorewall) otherwise.

                2. Existing comments in the file being converted will not be transferred to the output file.

                3. With the exception of the notrack->conntrack conversion, INCLUDEd files will be expanded inline in the output file.

                4. Columns in the output file will be separated by a single tab character; there is no attempt made to otherwise align the columns.

                5. Prior to Shorewall 5.0.15, shell variables will be expanded in the output file.

                6. Prior to Shorewall 5.0.15, lines omitted by compiler directives (?if ...., etc.) will not appear in the output file.

                       Important
                       Because the translation of the 'blacklist' and 'routestopped' files is not 1:1, omitted lines and compiler directives are not transferred to the converted files. If either are
                       present, the compiler issues a warning:

                            WARNING: "Omitted rules and compiler directives were not translated
           The -a option causes the updated shorewall.conf file to be annotated with documentation.

           The -i option was added in Shorewall 4.6.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";"). Such lines will
           be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in shorewall.conf[1](5).

           The -A option is included for compatibility with Shorewall 4.6 and is equivalent to specifying the -i option.

           For a description of the other options, see the check command above.

       version [-a]
           Displays Shorewall's version. The -a option is included for compatibility with earlier Shorewall releases and is ignored.

EXIT STATUS
       In general, when a command succeeds, status 0 is returned; when the command fails, a non-zero status is returned.

       The status command returns exit status as follows:

       0 - Firewall is started.

       3 - Firewall is stopped or cleared

       4 - Unknown state; usually means that the firewall has never been started.

ENVIRONMENT
       Two environmental variables are recognized by Shorewall:

       SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT
           When set to 1, causes Std out to be redirected to the file specified in the STARTUP_LOG option in shorewall.conf(5)[6].

       SW_LOGGERTAG
           Added in Shorewall 5.0.8. When set to a non-empty value, that value is passed to the logger utility in its -t (--tag) option.
