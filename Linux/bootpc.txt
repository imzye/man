NAME
       bootpc - bootp client

SYNOPSIS
       bootpc [--bootfile file] [--dev device] [--verbose] [--debug] [--server addr] [--hwaddr addr] [--returniffail] [--waitformore length] [--in2host addr] [--serverbcast] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the bootpc command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       bootpc is a boot protocol client used to grab the machine's IP address, set up DNS nameservers and other useful information.

OPTIONS
       --bootfile file
              Tell the server to use file as the boot file.

       --dev device
              Use device to communicate with the server.

       --verbose
              Be verbose.

       --debug
              Produce debugging output.

       --server addr
              Use the IP address addr to communicate with the server.

       --hwaddr addr
              Use addr as our hardware address rather than what the operating system gives us.

       --returniffail
              Terminate the program if a failure occurs.  By default bootpc will ask the user to press a key if the request did not succeed.

       --waitformore length
              Wait for more responses when one is received.  bootpc will wait for at most length seconds.  This is probably only useful for debugging.

       --in2host addr
              Takes an address and returns useful bits of the name after lookup, this was a separate program, but it is more compact to have both together.

       --serverbcast
              Tell the server to send back a broadcast reply.  This is necessary on Linux 2.1 and 2.2.

       --help Display the usage of bootpc.
