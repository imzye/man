NAME
       dh_installxsp - install host files into /etc/xsp/conf.d and /etc/mono-server/conf.d

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installxsp [debhelper options] [--name=name] [-V version(s)]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installxsp is a debhelper program that will install host configuration files in /etc/xsp4/conf.d and /etc/mono-server4/conf.d (for XSP 4). So, if xsp 4 is installed or will be installed,
       when xsp starts it automatically starts the daemon with the host file.

       The files debian/package.hostxsp4 are used for XSP 4.

       In the debian/rules file, dh_installxsp needs to be called before dh_installdeb to make sure the files are properly marked as conffiles to avoid the lintian warnings. Otherwise, the files
       created in /etc/ need to be marked as conffiles.

OPTIONS
       --name=name
           Look for files named debian/package.hostxsp4 and install them as /etc/xsp4/conf.d/package/hostfile.

       -V version(s)
           Installs the files for XSP 4.0 (-V 4). If this version is not specified (or just -V is given), this only installed files for XSP 4.

SEE ALSO

       This program is a part of mono-utils.
