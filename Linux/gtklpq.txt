       GtkLPQ
            Graphical Frontend

       lpq
            Show print queue

       lprm
            Remove jobs

       disable/enable
            Disable/enable printer

       reject/accept
            Reject/Accept printjobs for this printer

       GtkLPQ is part of the GtkLP-package.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by gtklpq:

       -P printer
            Use printer as default destination.

       -d printer
            This option is equivalent to "-P".

       -S server
            The name of the CUPS-Server.

       -p port
            The port of CUPS-Server, 631 per default.

       -D
            Debug.

       -V
            Displays the version of GtkLPQ.

       -U user
            The name of the cups-User to use.

       -t timeout
            The intervall in seconds between two queue-updates.

       -g XxY
            Pop up GtkLPQ at position (X,Y).

       -h
            Help

       -C
            Force console-mode.

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       If called as lpq, the following options differ from GtkLPQ`s options:

       -X
            Force X-Mode, even if GTKLP_FORCEX is not set to 1

       If called as lprm, the following options differ from GtkLPQ`s options:

       -
            Cancel all jobs

       Without any given jobs, lprm removes the current job.

       If called as disable, the following options differ from GtkLPQ`s options:

       -c
            Cancel all jobs

       -r reason
            Give an reason, why you do so

       If called as reject, the following options differ from GtkLPQ`s options:

       -r reason
            Give an reason, why you do so

PATHS
       To hide Printers from users, use the following pathes:
       /etc/gtklp/accept/
       /etc/gtklp/deny/
       $HOME/.gtklp/

       Just put an empty file with the name of the printer the user should see by default to accept, put an empty file with the name of the printer the user should never see to deny.
       The accept values can be overwritten by the user, the deny values can't.

SPECIAL
       If you can`t connect to an X-Server, GtkLPQ acts as console-lpq.

       If called as lpq, enable, disable, accept, or reject, GtkLPQ acts on console like these tools and has some other command-line parameters, see above.

VARIABLES
       You can set the following environment variables to influence the behaviour of GtkLPQ:

       CUPS_SERVER
            The default CUPS-server to connect to

       IPP_PORT
            The default Port of the CUPS-server to connect to

       PRINTER
            The default printer to use

       GTKLP_FORCEX
            Set to 1 to force X-Mode for lpr and lp

ERROR
       GtkLPQ produces the follwoing Error-Codes:

       0    normal program termination

       1    small error, wrong parameters, etc.

       2    Server Problems, server not found, no default printer found, etc.

       3    BAD error. Fields declared too short, too many printers, etc.
