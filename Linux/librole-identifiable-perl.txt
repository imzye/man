NAME
       Role::Identifiable - a thing you can identify somehow

VERSION
       version 0.009

DESCRIPTION
       Role::Identifiable isn't really a module that does anything.  It's here to make things simpler for indexing on CPAN and looking up docs.

       You probably want to use either Role::Identifiable::HasIdent, for identifying things by an identifier string, or Role::Identifiable::HasTags for identifying things by a list of tags.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
