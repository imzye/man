NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuildTiny::Fallback - Generate a Build.PL that uses Module::Build::Tiny and Module::Build

VERSION
       version 0.027

SYNOPSIS
       In your dist.ini:

           [ModuleBuildTiny::Fallback]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Dist::Zilla plugin that provides a Build.PL in your distribution that attempts to use Module::Build::Tiny when available, falling back to Module::Build when it is missing.

       This is useful when your distribution is installing on an older perl (before approximately 5.10.1) with a toolchain that has not been updated, where "configure_requires" metadata is not understood
       and respected -- or where Build.PL is being run manually without the user having read and understood the contents of META.yml or META.json.

       When the Module::Build fallback code is run, an added preamble is printed:

           *** WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING ***

           If you're seeing this warning, your toolchain is really, really old* and
           you'll almost certainly have problems installing CPAN modules from this
           century. But never fear, dear user, for we have the technology to fix this!

           If you're using CPAN.pm to install things, then you can upgrade it using:

           cpan CPAN

           If you're using CPANPLUS to install things, then you can upgrade it using:

           cpanp CPANPLUS

           If you're using cpanminus, you shouldn't be seeing this message in the first
           place, so please file an issue on github.

           This public service announcement was brought to you by the Perl Toolchain
           Gang, the irc.perl.org #toolchain IRC channel, and the number 42.

           ----

           * Alternatively, you are running this file manually, in which case you need to
           learn to first fulfill all configure requires prerequisites listed in META.yml
           or META.json -- or use a cpan client to install this distribution.

           You can also silence this warning for future installations by setting the
           PERL_MB_FALLBACK_SILENCE_WARNING environment variable, but please don't do
           that until you fix your toolchain as described above.

       This plugin internally calls both the [ModuleBuildTiny] and [ModuleBuild] plugins to fetch their normal Build.PL file contents, combining them together into the final Build.PL for the
       distribution.

       You are warned if anything else added content into Build.PL (e.g. some additional build-time dependency checks), as that code will not run in the fallback case. It is up to you to decide whether
       it is still a good idea to use this plugin in this situation.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
   mb_version
       Optional. Specifies the minimum version of Module::Build needed for proper fallback execution. Defaults to 0.28.

   mbt_version
       Optional.  Passed to [ModuleBuildTiny] as "version": the minimum version of Module::Build::Tiny to depend on (in "configure_requires" as well as a "use" assertion in Build.PL).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Peter Rabbitson (ribasushi), for inspiration, and Matt Trout (mst), for not stopping me.
