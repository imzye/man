NAME
       garlic - molecular visualization program

SYNOPSIS
       garlic [Garlic options] [X11 options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       This   manual   page   briefly   documents   garlic,   a   free   molecular   visualization   program.   Extensive  documentation  in  HTML  format  and  sources  may  be  found  at  garlic  home,
       <URL:http://www.zucic.org/garlic/>.  Physical location: School of Medicine, University of Osijek, Croatia, Europe.  Precompiled packages for a number  of  GNU/Linux  distributions  are  available.
       These  include  Debian,  SuSE,  Mandriva, Linspire and a number of other distros.  The HTML documentation may be downloaded and unpacked for local use (recommended usage). Here you can find a very
       short description of the program and the list of command line options.

       garlic is a molecular visualization program originally written for investigation of membrane proteins. Now it may be used to visualize and simple editing of all proteins and molecules.  This  ver‐
       sion recognizes PDB format version 2.1; see the source file pdb_atom.c for details about this format.

OPTIONS
       Command  line  options  may be divided in two groups: true (specific) garlic options and X11 options. Options may be given in any order. All options and hard-coded default values are listed in the
       table below. For each parameter, the value defined through command line is used, if available.  If not, the value defined in .garlicrc file is used. If .garlicrc file is not available, or there is
       no corresponding entry in this file, the hard-coded default value is used. The sample .garlicrc file included in the original package contains the values equal to hard-coded defaults.

   garlic options:
       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       -v, --version
              Print version and exit.

       -r, --register
              Register garlic: inform author that your site has garlic installed and that someone is going to use this program. By registering, you are encouraging author to continue development of  gar‐
              lic.  You  can  also  help author to ensure support for further development. This option sends one short e-mail message, containing only the e-mail message header and the word 'Hi!',to <zu‐
              cic@garlic.mefos.hr>. Please execute garlic -r if you are going to use this program. If you are not connected to the Internet, consider sending a short message from some other system.

       -nosys Hide the coordinate system icon (top left corner).

       -no-control
              Hide the control window (upper right corner).

       -stereo
              Display stereo image.

       -slab mode
              Default slab mode. Available slab modes are: off, planar (default), sphere, half-sphere, cylinder and half cylinder.

       -fading mode
              Default color fading mode. Available modes: off, planar (default), sphere, half-sphere, cylinder and half cylinder.

       -as number
              Default atom drawing style (hard-coded default: 2).

       -bs number
              Default bond drawing style (hard-coded default: 2).

       -fs number
              Default number of color fading surfaces. Parallel planes, concentric spheres or concentric cylinders may be used as fading surfaces. Three RGB triplets are assigned to  each  surface.  Sur‐
              faces  are evenly spaced; at least one and at most eight should be defined. At least three colors (left, middle and right) are assigned to each visible atom. These three colors are based on
              the position of a given atom relative to the nearest fading surface(s) and on colors assigned to these surfaces. Colors are combined using linear weighting.

       -lc<i> color
              Left color at the i-th surface; i is between zero and seven. The color string should be compliant with X11R5. Blue, for example, may be defined as blue or as RGB:0000/0000/FFFF etc. For ex‐
              ample -lc4 RGB:BBBB/8888/4444 defines the left color at the surface whose index is equal to four.

       -mc<i> color
              Middle color at the i-th surface.

       -rc<i> color
              Right color at the i-th surface.

       -pc, --print-config
              Print configuration data and exit.

       -pcn   Print cursor names to stdout and exit.

       -log logfile
              Write commands and messages to log file. The file will be created in the current working directory. If this is not possible, log file will be created in users home directory.

   X11 option:
       -display displayname
              X server to contact.

       -geometry geom
              Window geometry (default: almost the whole screen).

       -bg color
              Main window background color (default is black).

       -fg color
              Main window foreground color (default: white).

       -fn fontname
              Text font; (default is 10x20).

       -tbg color
              Text background color (default is black).

       -tfg color
              Text color (default is white).

       -cursor cursorname
              Cursor name; see /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h for names; remove the XC_ prefix.

FILES
       The configuration file is searched in the following order:
              ./.garlicrc
              ${HOME}/.garlicrc
              ${HOME}/garlic/.garlicrc
              /usr/share/garlic/.garlicrc
              /etc/garlicrc
              /usr/local/lib/garlic/.garlicrc
              /usr/lib/garlic/.garlicrc
