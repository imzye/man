NAME
       signapk - JAR and APK signing tool

SYNOPSIS
       Command line tool for signing Android ZIP/JAR/APK files:

       signapk [-w] [-a alignment] [-providerClass className] publickey.x509[.pem] privatekey.pk8 [publickey2.x509[.pem] privatekey2.pk8 ...] input.jar output.jar signapk file.jar

       input.jar is an existing file to sign.

DESCRIPTION
       Signs  ZIP  files,  including  JARs, APKs and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates, in a way compatible with Android's mincrypt verifier, using EC or RSA keys and SHA1 or SHA-256.  The tool can additionally
       sign APKs using APK Signature Scheme v2.  It is the standard tool used to sign APK and JAR files distributed as part of Android ROMs.

HISTORICAL NOTE
       Prior to the KitKat (aka 4.4.2 aka android-19) release, signapk ignored the signature algorithm specified in the certificate and always used SHA1withRSA.

       Starting with JellyBean-MR2 (aka 4.3 aka android-18), the platform supports SHA256withRSA, so we use the  signature  algorithm  in  the  certificate  to  select  which  to  use  (SHA256withRSA  or
       SHA1withRSA).  Also in JellyBean-MR2, EC keys are supported.

       Because there are old keys still in use whose certificate actually says “MD5withRSA”, those are treated as though they say “SHA1withRSA” for compatibility with older releases.
