NAME
       M2VRequantiser - MPEG-2 streams requantization

SYNOPSIS
       M2VRequantiser

       M2VRequantiser <RECOMPRESSION_FACTOR> <inputM2Vsize>

DESCRIPTION
       m2vrequantiseris  a tool that requantize MPEG-2 streams without recompressing. M2VRequantiser accepts raw MPEG2 video data (not VOB) from standard input and writes the recompressed frames to stan‐
       dard output.

       m2vrequantiser represents a good replacement for tcrequant, an obsolete utility provided by some versions of the transcode suite.

OPTIONS
       M2VRequantiser accepts the raw MPEG2 video data (not VOB) from the standard input and writes the recompressed frames to the standard output.

       M2VRequantiser takes two arguments. The first one is a floating point value specifying the ratio of compression. The second is the size of the M2V, since the data is streamed to M2VRequantiser  it
       cannot know the M2V size.

       There isn't any options and the usage is:

           $ M2VRequantiser <RECOMPRESSION_FACTOR> <inputM2Vsize>

EXAMPLE
       The following command would recompress 'original.m2v', whose size is 1024000 bytes, by a factor of 1.25:

           $ M2VRequantiser 1.25 1024000 < original.m2v > requantised.m2v
