NAME
       cptpg - convert GMT colour palette tables (cpt) to PostGIS colour-maps.

SYNOPSIS
       cptpg [-h] [-o file] [-p] [-v] [-V] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The cptpg utility converts the colour palette table (cpt) files used by
       GMT(1) to the colour-maps used by PostGIS, in particular those for the
       ST_ColorMap function. It should also be possible to use the maps in the
       GDAL program gdaldem, the GRASS r.colors utility and in ESRI products
       which call for a HDR color table.

       The program will read from stdin if a file is not specified as the
       final argument, and write to stdout if the -o option is not specified.

OPTIONS
       --backtrace-file path
           Specify a file to which to write a formatted backtrace. The file
           will only be created if there is a backtrace created, typically
           when an error occurs.

       --backtrace-format format
           Specify the format of the backtrace written to the files specified
           by --backtrace-file, one of plain, xml or json.

       -h, --help
           Brief help.

       -o, --output file
           Write the output to file, rather than stdout.

       -p, --percentage
           Convert (z) values to percentages.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose operation.

       -V, --version
           Version information.
