NAME
       sms4you - Personal gateway connecting SMS with XMPP or email.

       sms4you  forwards  messages from and to SMS and connects either with sms4you-xmpp or sms4you-email to choose the other mean of communication.  Nice for receiving or sending SMS, independently from
       carrying a SIM card.

IDEA
       Connect a suitable GSM modem or phone containing a SIM card into a computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi) at a fixed place. Give sms4you access to either a simple email address or a small xmpp server.  It
       will use this connection to receive emails or xmpp messages to be sent out as SMS and to send out emails or xmpp messages with received SMS messages.

CONCRETELY - WHY?
       There can be many reasons, why you want to use sms4you. Here are some examples:

       • You are living in the internetz, and you just need a gateway to this old thing "SMS", which some people really still seem to use.

       • You travel and use local SIM cards, but you still want to be able to receive SMS confirmation codes from banks and services.

       • You don't want to carry a (registered) SIM card for good reasons, but still you want to be able to send and receive SMS.

REQUIREMENTS
       sms4you  is implemented as a Python daemon, using Asynchronous I/O.  For the connection with the modem it uses ModemManager.  The different gateways for email and xmpp have different depenedencies
       and are wrapped therefore into different sub-projects:

INSTALLATION
       • As an email gateway

       • As a xmpp gateway
