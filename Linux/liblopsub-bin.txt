lopsubgen(1)                                                                                   User commands                                                                                   lopsubgen(1)

NAME
       lopsubgen - convert a lobsup suite into C or roff format

SYNOPSIS
       lopsubgen  [--help] [--version] [--output-dir=<dir>] [--gen-c[=<path>]] [--gen-header[=<path>]] [--gen-man[=<path>]] [--version-string=<string>]

DESCRIPTION
       The lopsubgen command reads a lobsub suite from stdin and converts it to zero or more output formats. If no output format is specified, the input is only checked for syntactic correctness.

       The format of the input (the lopsub suite) is described in lopsub-suite(5).

OPTIONS
   General options
       -h, --help
              print help and exit (give twice for detailed help)

       -V, --version
              print version and exit

       -o, --output-dir=<dir>
              where to write output file(s)

              default: .

              The default is to create all output files in the current working directory.

       --gen-c[=<path>]
              generate C output

              This produces a C file containing the definition of a subsub suite structure.

              If <path> is absolute, the output is written to this path and the argument to --output-dir is ignnored. Otherwise, the output path is relative to the value of the --output-dir option.

              If the optional argument is not given, the output file name is derived from the suite name by appending the string ".lsg.c".

       --gen-header[=<path>]
              generate a .h file

              The generated header file is intended to be included from the application. It defines handy C enums and preprocessor macros like the number of commands defined in the suite.

              The path for the generated header file is determined in the same way as for C output, see --gen-c.

   Options for man output
       --gen-man[=<path>]
              generate the man page

              If this is not given, all subsequent options in this section are ignored.

              The path for the output file is determined in the same way as for C output, see --gen-c.

       --version-string=<string>
              override version string

              If  this  option  is given, its argument is used as the version string while the value of the version-string directive of the suite is ignored. This is useful for applications which dynami‐
              cally create the version string by running a command like git-describe.
