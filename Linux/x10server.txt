X10SERVER(1)          User Contributed Perl Documentation         X10SERVER(1)

NAME
       x10server - creates a server used to receive events from an x10 client

USAGE
       Usage:

           x10server [options]

       Where options are:

           1 - turn debug output on
           0 - turn debug output off

DESCRIPTION
       When called, x10server will fork into the background unless the debug
       flag is set. By default the server looks for a TwoWay controller at
       /dev/twoway. It looks for a file called macros.config for macro
       definitions, a file called scheduler.config for scheduler definitions,
       and a file called devices.x10 for a list of x10 devices.
