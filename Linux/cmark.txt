NAME
       cmark - convert CommonMark formatted text to HTML

SYNOPSIS

       cmark [options] file*

DESCRIPTION
       cmark  converts Markdown formatted plain text to either HTML, groff man, CommonMark XML, LaTeX, or CommonMark, using the conventions described in the CommonMark spec.  It reads input from stdin or
       the specified files (concatenating their contents) and writes output to stdout.

OPTIONS
       --to, -t FORMAT
                   Specify output format (html, man, xml, latex, commonmark).

       --width WIDTH
                   Specify a column width to which to wrap the output. For no wrapping, use the value 0 (the default).  This option currently only affects the commonmark, latex, and man renderers.

       --hardbreaks
                   Render soft breaks (newlines inside paragraphs in the CommonMark source) as hard line breaks in the target format.  If this option is specified, hard wrapping is disabled  for  Common‐
                   Mark output, regardless of the value given with --width.

       --nobreaks  Render soft breaks as spaces.  If this option is specified, hard wrapping is disabled for all output formats, regardless of the value given with --width.

       --sourcepos Include source position attribute.

       --validate-utf8
                   Validate UTF-8, replacing illegal sequences with U+FFFD.

       --smart     Use smart punctuation.  Straight double and single quotes will be rendered as curly quotes, depending on their position.  -- will be rendered as an en-dash.  --- will be rendered as an
                   em-dash.  ... will be rendered as ellipses.

       --safe      Omit  raw  HTML and potentially dangerous URLs (default).  Raw HTML is replaced by a placeholder comment and potentially dangerous URLs are replaced by empty strings.  Potentially dan‐
                   gerous URLs are those that begin with `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, or `data:` (except for `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/jpeg`, or `image/webp` mime types).

       --unsafe    Render raw HTML or potentially dangerous URLs, overriding the default (--safe) behavior.

       --help      Print usage information.

       --version   Print version.
