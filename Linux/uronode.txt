URONODE.CONF(5)                                                                          Linux Programmer's Manual                                                                          URONODE.CONF(5)

NAME
       uronode.conf - URONode configuration file.

DESCRIPTION
       uronode.conf  file  is  read  by  URONode at program startup and is used to modify the behaviour of the node. The URONode node.conf is no compatible with the LinuxNode file, as it add new entries:
       FlexId Prompt and PassPromt.

       The lines within uronode.conf must either be a comment line, which starts with a # in the first column, or one of the commands listed below. Commands and arguments are delimited  by  white  space.
       Arguments can contain white space if they are enclosed in double quotes. Also C-style escapes (\n, \x0A, \012 etc.) are parsed within double quotes. Tabs may also be used for delimiting columns.

       Available configuration commands are:

       Alias <NAme> “<command> [<args...>]”
                     Sets  up  a  command  alias.  The  number of uppercase characters at the beginning of <NAme> specifies how much the user may abbreviate the command. The uppercase part should be long
                     enough to separate the command from other commands starting with the same letters. If there are no uppercase letters in the beginning, the whole name is converted to upper  case  and
                     user can not abbreviate the command.  The command and arguments are subject to parameter expansion (see below).

       ConnTimeout <timeout>
                     When  user  is  connected  to another system via this system and the connection is idle (no data flowing in either direction) for <timeout> seconds the connection is dropped and user
                     disconnected from node.  Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour).

       Email     <your@node.ampr.org>
                     This is your amprnet or commercial email address that's displayed to users on interfaces you require having a password on to access your node, highly suggested  on  inet  interfaces.
                     You may leave off the <>'s. If you do not have an Email line in node.conf then your email address to users will display as (null) and will make you look sloppy :-)

       EscapeChar <escape>
                     Specifies  the  escape character. <escape> should be the decimal representation of the ASCII code of the wanted escape character.  Setting escape character to -1 disables the feature
                     altogether.  The default is 20 (ctrl-t).

                     Note that the escape mechanism breaks 8-bit transparency of URONode and you should either disable it or set the no-escape flag in node.perms for  the  forwarding  stations  if  (com‐
                     pressed) forward is run trough URONode.

       ExtCmd <NAme> <flags> <uid> <exec> <args...>

                     NAme      This  is  the name under which the command appears at nodes command list.  The number of uppercase characters at the beginning of <NAme> specifies how much the user may ab‐
                               breviate the command.  The uppercase part should be long enough to separate the command from other commands starting with the same letters. If there are no  uppercase  let‐
                               ters in the beginning, the whole name is converted to upper case and user can not abbreviate the command.

                     flags     This is a sum of flags that control the way the external command is executed. Currently two flags are implemented:

                               1    Run  command  through pipe. Without this flag node just fork()s and exec()s the specified command and then waits for it to terminate. The command must it self be aware
                                    about the underlying protocol. It must handle packetising and any end of line conversions. With this flag however node sets up a pipe between it self and  the  command
                                    and handles packetising and end of line conversions for it.

                               2    Reconnected to flag. If this flag is set, the user gets a reconnected to prompt after the external command is finished.

                     uid       This is the userid that the following command should run under when executing.

                     exec      This is the executable that should be executed.

                     args...   These are the optional arguments that are passed to the executable.  The arguments are subject to parameter expansion (see below).

       HiddenPorts <portname> ...
                     Marks <portname> as hidden. Hidden ports are not shown to users in Links, Mheard, Ports and Routes commands and can not be used to make AX.25 downlink connections unless user is spe‐
                     cially permitted to do so (see node.perms(5)). Up to 32 hidden ports can be specified with this command.

       HostName <hostname>
                     This is the visible hostname of the node. It will be shown at telnet login and in the node welcome message.

       IdleTimeout <timeout>
                     After <timeout> seconds of inactivity while waiting for a command user is disconnected from node. Default is 900 seconds (15 mins).

       LocalNet <network>
                     Defines a "local" network. Users telneting from hosts in this network are treated separately (see node.perms(5)). <network> is a KA9Q NOS style network address consisting of a dotted
                     quad ip address of the network and a number of significant bits separated by a slash. Note that 127.0.0.0/8 (loopback net) is also considered "local" by default.

       LogLevel <loglevel>
                     Specifies what node should log. The available levels are:

                     0    Don't log anything.

                     1    Log only critical errors.

                     2    Log errors and logins/logouts.

                     3    Log errors, logins/logouts and all gateway commands.

                     Default is to log only critical errors.

       NodeId <nodeid>
                     This is the node id that is shown in every message from node. Default is "URONode".

       FlexID <flexid>
                     This is typically your ax25 callsign-ssid that links to flexnet and/or to your user interface set by the sysop in ax25d.conf.

       RoseID <rosecall@dnic,######>
                     This  is  your  node's  rosecall-ssid and your full dnic number typically consisting of your country code, area code, and phone extension. An example is: 3100,860906. The full string
                     would be for this part of the conf file using my config: RoseID n1uro-8@3100860906 or if you do not use rose enter: RoseID none

       NrPort <portname>
                     This is the name of the netrom port that is used when making outgoing netrom connects. Normally it should match the portname that is used in ax25d.conf to listen for incoming  netrom
                     calls. Default is the first netrom port.

       ReConnect on|off
                     ReConnect flag. If this is on, users gatewaying to another host get reconnected to this node after the remote host closes connection.  If it's off connection to the user will also be
                     closed. User can override the default behaviour with a single `s' or `d' at the end of the gatewaying command (connect or telnet). Default is off.

       Prompt <NodePrompt>
                     This is the prompt string of the node. It's delimited by double quotes.  You can use also a "\n" character for a multi-lines prompt.

       PassPrompt <PasswordPrompt>
                     This is the prompt string for sysop password request.  It's delimited by double quotes. You can use also a "\n" character for a multi-lines prompt.

PARAMETER EXPANSION
       The arguments passed to the real command by the Alias and ExtCmd commands are subject to parameter expansion. If a word starts with a %, it is expanded. The following formats are expanded:

       %parameter    This is substituted with the value of parameter

       %{parameter}  The same as above.

       %{parameter:default}
                     If parameter is defined this is susbtituted with the value of it. If not, the default value is substituted. This currently applies only to positional parameters 0...9.

       The following parameters are defined:

       0...9   The positional parameters.

       U       The username (callsign) of the remote station in upper case without the SSID.

       u       The username (callsign) of the remote station in lower case without the SSID.

       S       The username (callsign) of the remote station in upper case with the SSID.

       s       The username (callsign) of the remote station in lower case with the SSID.

       P       The nodename (callsign) of the remote station (NET/ROM), the portname the user is coming in via (AX.25) or the ip address of the remote host (TCP).  In upper case without the SSID.

       p       The nodename (callsign) of the remote station (NET/ROM), the portname the user is coming in via (AX.25) or the ip address of the remote host (TCP).  In lower case without the SSID.

       R       The nodename (callsign) of the remote station (NET/ROM), the portname the user is coming in via (AX.25) or the ip address of the remote host (TCP).  In upper case with the SSID.

       r       The nodename (callsign) of the remote station (NET/ROM), the portname the user is coming in via (AX.25) or the ip address of the remote host (TCP).  In lower case with the SSID.

       t       The type of the user connection (ax25, netrom, rose, inet, host) in lower case.

       T       The type of the user connection (ax25, netrom, rose, inet, host) in upper case.

       Anything else after a % is substituted with a %.
