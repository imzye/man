NAME
       profile-cleaner - Reduce the size of browser and some email program's profiles by organizing their sqlite databases using sqlite3's vacuum and reindex functions. The term "browser" is used loosely
       since profile-cleaner happily works on some email clients too.

SYNOPSIS
       profile-cleaner [option]

DESCRIPTION
       Profile-cleaner  is a very simple shell script that will invoke sqlite3 to vacuum and reindex databases belonging to supported browsers and email clients. It is compatible with profile-sync-daemon
       so users need not stop psd before calling profile-cleaner. In fact, profiles will clean much faster when they are synced to tmpfs via psd.

       Make sure that target browsers or email clients are not running when invoking profile-cleaner. Failure to do so will result in the open files NOT getting cleaned and reindexed.

              *Profile-cleaner will parse the respective profiles.ini file and clean all profiles defined therein.

CONFIG FILE
       Profile-cleaner will create $HOME/.config/profile-cleaner.conf the first time it is invoked. Users may define a color scheme therein based on their terminal background color. The default is a dark
       scheme for dark colored terminals. The file is commented and self-explanatory.

EXAMPLES
       Clean all firefox profiles:

        $ profile-cleaner f

              Clean chromium profile:

        $ profile-cleaner c

              Clean the user defined profile:

        $ profile-cleaner p /path/to/profile
