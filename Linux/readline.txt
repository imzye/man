NAME
       readline - improve readline editing (enabled by default)

DESCRIPTION
       A support package that tries to make editing with readline easier. At the moment, it reacts to clicking shift-left mouse button by trying to move the text cursor to this position. It does so by
       generating as many cursor-left or cursor-right keypresses as required (this only works for programs that correctly support wide characters).

       To avoid too many false positives, this is only done when:

       - the tty is in ICANON state.
       - the text cursor is visible.
       - the primary screen is currently being displayed.
       - the mouse is on the same (multi-row-) line as the text cursor.

       The normal selection mechanism isn't disabled, so quick successive clicks might interfere with selection creation in harmless ways.
