NAME
       tpm_takeownership - setup an owner on the TPM

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_takeownership [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm_takeownership setup an owner on the system's TPM (via the TPM_TakeOwnership API).  This operation requires the TPM to be enabled and can be restricted by tpm_setownable.  The command will prompt
       for owner and SRK passwords and confirmations of these if executed without either of the -well-known options, otherwise, a secret of all zeros is set for the requested password.  After the second
       confirmation, be patient as the command may take awhile.
