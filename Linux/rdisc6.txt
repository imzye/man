NAME
       rdisc - ICMPv6 Router Discovery tool

SYNOPSIS
       rdisc6 [-qv] [-r attempts] [-s source_ip] [-w wait_ms] [IPv6 address] <iface>

DESCRIPTON
       RDisc6 is an Unix program which implements the ICMPv6 Router Discovery in userland (it is normally done by the kernel). It is used to lookup the list of on-link routers and IPv6 prefixes.

       It can also be used to force the kernel to update the state of a given IPv6-autoconfigured network interface.

       The name of the network interface to probe routers for must be specified.

OPTIONS
       -1 or --single
              Exit as soon as the first advertisement is received.

       -h or --help
              Display some help and exit.

       -m or --multiple
              Wait for possible multiple advertisements and print all of them (default).

       -n or --numeric
              If the optional parameter is not a valid IPv6 address, do not try to resolve it as a DNS hostname.

       -q or --quiet
              Only display advertised IPv6 prefixes. Display nothing in case of failure.  That is mostly useful when calling the program from a shell script.

       -r attempts or --retry attempts
              Send ICMPv6 Router Discovery that many times until a reply is received, or abort. By default, rdisc6 will try 3 times before aborting (MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS from RFC2461).

       -s source_ip or --source source_ip
              Specify the IPv6 address to be used as the source for the router solicitation packets.

       -V or --version
              Display program version and license and exit.

       -v or --verbose
              Display verbose information. That is the default.

       -w wait_ms or --wait wait_ms
              Wait wait_ms milliseconds for a response before retrying.  By default, rdisc6 waits 4 second between each attempts (RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL from RFC2461).

       If rdisc6 does not receive any response after the specified number of attempts waiting for wait_ms milliseconds each time, it will exit with code 2. On error, it exits with code 1.  Otherwise it exits
       with code 0.

SECURITY
       rdisc6 must be setuid root to allow use by non privileged users. It will drop its root privileges before any attempt is made to send or receive data from the network to reduce the possible impact of a
       security vulnerability.
