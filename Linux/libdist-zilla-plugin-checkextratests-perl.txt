Dist::Zilla::App::Command::xtest(3pm)                                               User Contributed Perl Documentation                                               Dist::Zilla::App::Command::xtest(3pm)

NAME
       Dist::Zilla::App::Command::xtest - run xt tests for your dist

VERSION
       version 0.029

SYNOPSIS
       Run xt tests for your distribution:

         dzil xtest [ --no-author] [ --no-release ] [ --no-automated ] [ --all ]

       This runs with AUTHOR_TESTING and RELEASE_TESTING environment variables turned on, so it's like doing this:

         export AUTHOR_TESTING=1
         export RELEASE_TESTING=1
         dzil build
         rsync -avp My-Project-Version/ .build/
         cd .build;
         perl Makefile.PL
         make
         prove -l -r xt

       Except for the fact it's built directly in a subdir of .build (like .build/ASDF123).

       A build that fails tests will be left behind for analysis, and dzil will exit a non-zero value.  If the tests are successful, the build directory will be removed and dzil will exit with status 0.

       You can also use 'xt' as an alias for 'xtest':

         dzil xt

       If you provide one or more filenames on the command line, only those tests will be run (however deeply they are nested).

         dzil xtest pod-spell.t

       Arguments are turned into regexp patterns, so you can do any sort of partial match you want:

         dzil xtest author/    # just the author tests
         dzil xtest spell      # a test with 'spell' in the path

       There is no need to add anything to dist.ini -- installation of this module is sufficient to make the command available.

OPTIONS
   --no-author
       This will run the test suite without setting AUTHOR_TESTING

   --no-release
       This will run the test suite without setting RELEASE_TESTING

   --automated
       This will run the test suite with AUTOMATED_TESTING=1

   --all
       Equivalent to --release --automated --author
