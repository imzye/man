NAME
       pngchunkdesc - decode information embedded into a PNG chunk name

SYNOPSIS
       pngchunkdesc

DESCRIPTION
       PNG  files are based around a series of chunks, which embody the information stored in the image file. These chunks have four character ASCII names, where the case of each letter stores additional in‐
       formation.

       This program decodes the case information in the chunk names, and displays it. The program reads chunk names from stdin, and write chunk descriptions to stdout.

SEE ALSO
       pngchunks(1), pngcp(1), pnginfo(1).
