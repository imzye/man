NAME
       update-canna-dics_dir - compile dics.dir file

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       update-canna-dics_dir  assembles a dics.dir file in the Canna dictionary using one or more alias files found in a subdirectory of /etc/X11/fonts/.  It is typically invoked only from the post-installa‐
       tion and post-removal scripts of a package containing fonts (that provide aliases for their names) for the X Window System, but may be invoked at any time to reconstruct fonts.alias files.   For  each
       directory,  which  is  either  an  absolute  path  to  an  X  font  directory  or  (preferably)  simply  the last component of its path (such as "75dpi" or "misc"), update-canna-dics_dir will assemble
       /usr/lib/X11/fonts/directory/fonts.alias from the files found in /etc/X11/fonts/directory/package.alias.

       This enables multiple packages to provide aliases for fonts in the same directory.  No font package actually provides the fonts.alias file in the X font directory itself, so  there  is  no  danger  of
       overwriting one package's aliases with those of another.

       For instance, the two packages "xfonts-base" and "xfonts-cjk" may both install fonts into the directory /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc.  They each place their fonts.alias files in /etc/X11/fonts/misc/xfonts-
       base.alias and /etc/X11/fonts/misc/xfonts-cjk.alias (respectively).  update-canna-dics_dir  concatenates  these  two  files  (as  well  as  any  others  that  match  /etc/X11/fonts/misc/*.alias)  into
       /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias.

       The format for fonts.alias files is given in the mkfontdir(1) manual page.

       An example of how to use update-canna-dics_dir in package maintainer scripts is provided in the Debian Policy Manual.
