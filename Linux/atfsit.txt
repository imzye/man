NAME
       atfsit - A program to prepare files for version control

SYNOPSIS
       atfsit [ -cFhfsmM ] [ -qad ] [ -Iflags ] [ -Rflags ] [ -tdirectory ] file1 ...

DESCRIPTION
       Atfsit  is a semi-intelligent program to prepare files for ShapeTools version control.  This involves putting the correct type of headings at the top of the file so that retrv will update a header and
       log changes in the file.

       By default, atfsit will use default headers ``hard-wired'' into itself for each different file type that it ``knows'' about.  (See below for list of known file types).

       If the -tdirectory option is specified, then atfsit will use ``.template.suffix'' files (where ``suffix'' is a suffix that atfsit ``knows'' about) found in directory.  If a directory name is not spec‐
       ified on the command line, then the environment variable TEMPLATES is used.  If $TEMPLATES is not set, then the environment variable, HOME is tried.

       The following template files are recognized:

               Template NameFile Type
               ---------------------------------------
               .template.c Standard C
               .template.h C Include
               .template.f Fortran
               .template.shShell Script
               .template.makeMakefile
               .template.manManual

       Atfsit  is  ``semi-intelligent'' in that it can guess the type of headers to put in the file by the type of file (C program, C include, makefile, shell script, or manual).  It determines the file type
       by looking at the name of the file.  If the name of the file is ``Makefile'' or ``makefile'', then the file type is taken to be for make(1).  The suffix after the last ``.'' in the file name  is  then
       used.  The following table shows the suffixes that atfsit knows about:

               Suffix      File Type
               ---------------------------------------------
               c           C Program
               F           C Program (with compile flags)
               h           C Include
               f           Fortran
               mk          Make(1) file
               sh          Shell Script
               csh         Shell Script
               [1-9]       Manual (digits 1 - 9)

       If  the  environment  variable  ``ATFSDIR''  is  present, then atfsit will attempt to make a link from it to ``AtFS'' in the current directory if the -I option is used and there is no directory called
       ``AtFS'' already, in the current directory.  If the -I option is used and ``ATFSDIR'' is not specified in the environment, then a normal directory called ``AtFS'' will be created.  This feature can be
       overrided with the -d option.

OPTIONS
       c         Force file type to be ``Standard C''.

       F         Force  file type to be ``Standard C''. Add a special header-line for recording of compile-time options in addition to the default header.  The inserted line has the form static char *ConfFlg
                 = CFFLGS.  CFFLGS must be a string value. As it is very inconvenient, to define the proper value of CFFLGS from the command-line, this feature is more intended to be used from  within  Make‐
                 files.

       h         Force file type to be ``C Include''.

       f         Force file type to be ``Fortran''.

       M         Force file type to be ``Manual''.  Note: If you also specify the ``Iflags'' option, atfsit will run vadm(1) to tell ShapeTools what kind of comment string to use for the manual file.

       s         Force file type to be ``Shell Script''.

       m         Force file type to be ``Makefile''.  Note that this does the same thing as the -s option does.  It just prints a different message.

       t         Do not use any Template files for the headers.

       q         Be quiet.  Don't print out what is going on.  Only error messages are printed.

       d         Do not attempt to make the directory ``AtFS''.  See above for more info.

       a         Turn off auto guessing of file type.

       Iflags    Check In file.  Run save(1) on the file with ``flags'' being passed onto save(1) as the command line arguments.

       Rflags    Run vadm(1) with ``flags'' as the command line arguments.

FILES
       /tmp/atfsit*        - temporary buffer
       ~/.template.*   - template files to use as the header.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Complains about the usual stuff.  (i.e. - the specified file doesn't exist, or it can't read it...just things like that.)
