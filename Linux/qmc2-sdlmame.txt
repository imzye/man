NAME
       qmc2-sdlmame - QMC2 - M.A.M.E. Catalog/Launcher II

SYNOPSIS
       qmc2-sdlmame [-config_path path] [-cc] [-tc] [-r] [-h|-?|-help] [qt_arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       QMC2 is a graphical front-end based on Qt which drives the great MAME emulator. Besides being a powerful catalog and launcher for systems emulated by MAME it also contains sophisticated ROM management
       features through its built-in ROMAlyzer.

OPTIONS
       -config_path path
              Specify this argument to use the directory path instead of the default folder (~/.qmc2) to store QMC2's configuration, logs and cache-files / cache-folders.

       -cc    This command line option will instruct QMC2 to clear all emulator related caches while starting up in order to forcibly reload this data from the emulator.

       -tc    Specifying this option on the command line will perform a template check against the current default emulator (if set), printing its output to stdout and exiting before actual start-up occurs.

       -r     The reconfigure option will relaunch the setup wizard / welcome dialog before starting. This allows you to update or correct the most important emulator settings in an easy way.

       -h|-?|-help
              Shows a brief command line usage help.

       qt_arguments
              See http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qapplication.html#QApplication for more information. However, note that QMC2 will  overwrite  most  of  the  available  Qt  arguments  with  its  saved  settings  in
              ~/.qmc2/qmc2.ini.
