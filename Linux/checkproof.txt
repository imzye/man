NAME
       checkproof - manual page for checkproof 2.6-DEBUG

SYNOPSIS
       checkproof [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       checkproof 2.6-DEBUG

       Read an UPCL2 protocol and verify the inferences using one of a varity of external provers.

       This is a _very_ experimental program. Passing checkproof does indicate that all inferences in an UPCL2 protocol are correct (i.e. that the conclusion is logically implied by the premisses) - that is,
       if you believe that the transformation process and the used prover are correct. However, checkproof will e.g. gladly show that the empty proof protocol does not contain any buggy steps.

       If a proof protocol fails to pass this test, the proof may still be correct. Due to e.g. incomplete strategies (this applies in particular to Otter), build-in limits (Otter), and bugs  in  the  prover
       (potentially all systems, but observed in SPASS 0.55), a prover might fail to verify a correct step. Moreover, due to the different strategies, calculi, and in particular different term orderings cho‐
       sen by the systems, a single UPCL2 inference may result in a proof problem that is very hard to verify for other provers. However, if a proof step is rejected by more than one system, you should prob‐
       ably look at this step in detail.

       Options

       -h

       --help

              Print a short description of program usage and options.

       --version

              Print the version number of the program.

       -v

       --verbose[=<arg>]

              Verbose comments on the progress of the program. The short form or the long form without the optional argument is equivalent to --verbose=1.

       -o <arg>

       --output-file=<arg>

              Redirect output into the named file.

       -s

       --silent

              Equivalent to --output-level=0.

       -l <arg>

       --output-level=<arg>

              Select  an output level, greater values imply more verbose output. At the moment, level 0 only prints the result, level 1 prints inference steps as they are verified, level 2 prints prover com‐
              mands issued, and level 3 prints all prover output (which may be very little)

       -p <arg>

       --prover-type=<arg>

              Set the type of the prover to use for proof verification. Determines problem syntax, options,  and  check  for  success.  Supported  options  at  are  'E'  (the  default),'Otter'  'SPASS',  and
              'scheme-setheo'  (not  yet  implemented).  SPASS  support  is  only tested with SPASS 0.55 and may fail if the problem contains identifiers reserved by SPASS. There have been some supple syntax
              changes, so more recent SPASS versions will probably fail as well.

       -x <arg>

       --executable=<arg>

              Give the name under which the prover can be called. If no executable is given, checkproof will guess a name based on the type of the prover. This guess may be way off!

       -t <arg>

       --prover-cpu-limit=<arg>

              Limit the CPU time prover may spend on a single step. Default is 10 seconds.

REPORTING BUGS
       Report bugs to <schulz@eprover.org>. Please include the following, if possible:

       * The version of the package as reported by eprover --version.

       * The operating system and version.

       * The exact command line that leads to the unexpected behaviour.

       * A description of what you expected and what actually happend.

       * If possible all input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
