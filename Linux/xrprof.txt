NAME
       xrprof - profile R programs

SYNOPSIS
       xrprof [-h] [-m] [-F FREQ] [-d DURATION] [-o FILE] -p PID

DESCRIPTION
       A sampling profiler for R(1) programs.  xrprof writes to standard output the Rprof.out format widely used by existing R-based tools.

OPTIONS
       Malformed arguments will fall back on the defaults, if possible.

       -h     Print usage and exit.

       -p PID Specify the pid of the target R program.

       -F FREQ
              Set the sampling frequency, in Hertz. The default is 1 Hz, i.e. one sample per second, and the maximum is 1000 Hz (though far fewer samples are usually required).

       -d DURATION
              Set the duration for xrprof to take samples before exiting (provided the target program runs that long). The default is to last up to one hour.

       -o FILE
              Write output to FILE instead of standard output.

       -m     Run in “mixed mode”, where samples are drawn from both the R-level and native C/C++ stacks and collated together.

EXAMPLES
       Sample from an existing R program for 5 seconds at a useful frequency:

           $ xrprof -F 50 -d 5 -p `pidof R`

       Start a new R program in the background and then start the profiler, writing samples to the file Rprof.out in the current directory:

           $ Rscript myprogram.R &
           $ xrprof -F 50 -p $! > Rprof.out

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      A fatal error ocurred during sampling.
