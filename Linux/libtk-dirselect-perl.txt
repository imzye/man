NAME
       Tk::DirSelect - Cross-platform directory selection widget.

SYNOPSIS
         use Tk::DirSelect;
         my $ds  = $mw->DirSelect();
         my $dir = $ds->Show();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a cross-platform directory selection widget. For systems running Microsoft Windows, this includes selection of local and mapped network drives. A context menu (right-click or
       <Button3>) allows the creation, renaming, and deletion of directories while browsing.

       Note: Perl/Tk 804 added the "chooseDirectory" method which uses native system dialogs where available. (i.e. Windows) If you want a native feel for your program, you probably want to use that
       method instead -- possibly using this module as a fallback for systems with older versions of Tk installed.

METHODS
   "DirSelect([-title => 'title'], [options])"
       Constructs a new DirSelect widget as a child of the invoking object (usually a MainWindow).

       The title for the widget can be set by specifying "-title => 'Title'". Any other options provided will be passed through to the DirTree widget that displays directories, so be sure they're
       appropriate (e.g. "-width")

   "Show([directory], [options])"
       Displays the DirSelect widget and returns the user selected directory or "undef" if the operation is canceled.

       All arguments are optional. The first argument (if defined) is the initial directory to display. The default is to display the current working directory. Any additional options are passed through
       to the Popup() method. This means that you can do something like

         $ds->Show(undef, -popover => $mw);

       to center the dialog over your application.
