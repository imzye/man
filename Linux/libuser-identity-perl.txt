DIAGNOSTICS
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.  Cast by addCollection()

       Error: Cannot create a $type to add this to my collection.
           Some options are specified to create a $type object, which is native to this collection.  However, for some reason this failed.  Cast by addRole()

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either  the  specified  $type  does  not  exist,  or that module named $class returns compilation errors.  If the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a
           nickname which was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.  Cast by addCollection()

       Error: Cannot rename $name into $newname: already exists
           Cast by renameRole()

       Error: Cannot rename $name into $newname: doesn't exist
           Cast by renameRole()

       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using the options you specified.  Cast by addCollection()

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used to create a collection object.  In the  latter  case,  the  type  of  collection  must  be
           specified.  Cast by addCollection()

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.  Cast by add()

       Error: Wrong type of role for $collection: requires a $expect but got a $type
           Each $collection groups sets of roles of one specific type ($expect).  You cannot add objects of a different $type.  Cast by addRole()
