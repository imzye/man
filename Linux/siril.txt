NAME
       siril - image processing tool for astronomy and other applications

SYNOPSIS
       siril [options] [file]
       siril-cli [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       Siril is a powerful image processing tool designed for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of astronomical images. It offers a wide range of tools for aligning, stacking, and enhancing images from
       various file formats, including image sequences. It features a high-precision 32-bit floating-point engine and supports parallel processing to run quickly.
       The application is divided into 2 binaries. The first one, siril, launches the program in graphic mode. The second one, siril-cli, is a command line interface allowing to execute the following op‐
       tions.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Prints the program name and version, then exits.

       -i conf_file
              Starts Siril with the specified configuration file.

       -f, --format
              Prints all supported input image formats, depending on the libraries detected at compile-time.

       -c, --copyright
              Prints copyright information, then exits.

       -h, --help
              Displays a brief usage summary.

       -p     Starts  Siril  without  the  graphical  user  interface  and  uses  named  pipes  to  accept commands and print logs and status information. On POSIX systems, the named pipes are created in
              /tmp/siril_commands.in and /tmp/siril_commands.out.

       -r input_pipe_path, --inpipe=input_pipe_path
              Provides an alternative path for the input pipe that receives the commands if -p is passed. The pipe can be created by an external program with the mkfifo(1) command.

       -w output_pipe_path, --outpipe=output_pipe_path
              Provides an alternative path for the output pipe that prints logs and status updates if -p is passed. The pipe can be created by an external program with the mkfifo(1) command.

       -d working_directory, --directory=working_directory
              Sets the specified path as the current working directory.

       -s script_file, --script=script_file
              Starts Siril without the graphical user interface and runs the specified script instead. Scripts are text files that contain a list of commands to be executed sequentially. In these  files,
              lines starting with a # are considered as comments. If this option is not passed, pipe operation is assumed as if -p had been passed.

       -s -   Redirects inputs written after - to stdin.

       file   Opens the specified image or sequence file immediately after startup.

FILES
       ~/.config/siril/config.ini
              User preferences that can be overridden by the -i option.

       /usr/share/siril/siril.css
              The style sheet used to change the look of the graphical user interface. This is useful for customization or if a GTK theme is incompatible with some colored elements of Siril.
