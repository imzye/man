NAME
       netlabelctl - NetLabel management utility

SYNOPSIS
       netlabelctl [<global_flags>] <module> [<module_commands>]

DESCRIPTION
       The NetLabel management utility, netlabelctl, is a command line program
       designed to allow system administrators to configure the NetLabel  sys‐
       tem  in  the  kernel.   The utility is based around different "modules"
       which correspond to the different types of NetLabel commands  supported
       by the kernel.

OPTIONS
   Global Flags
       -h   Help message

       -t <seconds>
            Set  a  timeout to be used when waiting for the NetLabel subsystem
            to respond

       -v   Enable extra output

       -V   Display the version information

   Modules and Commands
       mgmt

       The management module is used to perform general queries about the Net‐
       Label  subsystem  within  the kernel.  The different commands and their
       syntax are listed below.

       version
              Display the kernel's NetLabel management protocol version.

       protocols
              Display the kernel's list of supported labeling protocols.

       map

       The domain mapping module is used to map  different  NetLabel  labeling
       protocols  to  either individual LSM domains or the default domain map‐
       ping.  It is up to each LSM to determine what defines a  domain.   With
       SELinux,  the  normal SELinux domain should be used, i.e. "ping_t".  In
       addition to protocol selection based only on the LSM domain, it is also
       possible  to  select the labeling protocol based on both the LSM domain
       and destination address.  The network  address  selectors  can  specify
       either single hosts or entire networks and work for both IPv4 and IPv6,
       although the labeling protocol chosen must support the IP version  cho‐
       sen.   When  specifying  the  labeling protocol to use for each mapping
       there is an optional "extra" field which is used  to  further  identify
       the  specific  labeling  protocol  configuration.   When specifying the
       unlabeled protocol, "unlbl", an extra value of either "4" or "6" may be
       used.   This restricts the mapping to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Omitting
       the extra value will result in a  mapping  for  all  address  families.
       When specifying the CIPSO/IPv4 or the CALIPSO/IPv6 protocol, "cipso" or
       "calipso", the DOI value should be specified; see the EXAMPLES  section
       for details.  The different commands and their syntax are listed below.

       add  default|domain:<domain> [address:<ADDR>[/<MASK>]] protocol:<proto‐
              col>[,<extra>]
              Add a new LSM domain / network address to NetLabel protocol map‐
              ping.

       del default|domain:<domain>
              Delete an existing LSM domain to NetLabel protocol mapping.

       list
              Display  all  of  the configured LSM domain to NetLabel protocol
              mappings.

       unlbl

       The unlabeled (unlbl) module controls the unlabeled protocol  which  is
       used both when labeling outgoing traffic is not desired as well as when
       unlabeled traffic is received by the system.  This module allows admin‐
       istrators  to  block  all unlabeled packets from the system through the
       "accept" flag and assign static, or fallback, security labels to  unla‐
       beled  traffic  based  on  the  inbound  network  interface  and source
       address.

       accept on|off
              Toggle the unlabeled traffic accept flag.

       add default|interface:<dev> address:<addr>[/<mask>] label:<label>
              Add a new static/fallback entry.

       del default|interface:<dev> address:<addr>[/<mask>]
              Delete an existing static/fallback entry.

       list
              Display the status of the unlabeled accept flag.

       cipso

       The CIPSO/IPv4 (cipso) module controls the CIPSO/IPv4  labeling  engine
       in  the  kernel.   The  CIPSO/IPv4 engine provided by NetLabel supports
       multiple Domains Of Interpretation  (DOI)  and  the  CIPSO/IPv4  module
       allows for different configurations for each DOI.  At present there are
       three types of configurations, the "trans" configuration  which  allows
       on-the-fly translation of MLS sensitivity labels, the "pass" configura‐
       tion which does not perform any  translation  of  the  MLS  sensitivity
       label and the "local" configuration which conveys the full LSM security
       label over localhost/loopback connections.  Regardless of which config‐
       uration type is chosen a DOI value must be specified and if the "trans"
       or "pass" configurations are specified then a list  of  the  CIPSO/IPv4
       tag types to use when generating the CIPSO/IPv4 packet labels must also
       be specified.  The list of CIPSO/IPv4 tags is ordered  such  that  when
       possible  the  first tag type listed is used when a CIPSO/IPv4 label is
       generated.  However, if it is not possible to use the  first  tag  type
       then  each  tag type is checked, in order, until a suitable tag type is
       found.  If a valid tag type can not be found then the operation causing
       the  CIPSO/IPv4  label  will fail, typically this occurs whenever a new
       socket is created.  The different commands and their syntax are  listed
       below.

       add trans doi:<DOI> tags:<T1>,<Tn> levels:<LL1>=<RL1>,<LLn>=<RLn> cate‐
              gories:<LC1>=<RC1>,<LCn>=<RCn>
              Add a new CIPSO/IPv4 configuration using the standard/translated
              mapping  with  the  given  level and category translations.  The
              levels are translated in such a way that the local  level  "LLn"
              is  translated  to  the  remote, on-the-wire level of "RLn"; the
              reverse translation is done  for  incoming  packets.   The  same
              translation  is  done  for the categories using "LCn" and "RCn".
              In order for a packet to be accepted, or a socket created by  an
              application,  there  must  be  a translation for the sensitivity
              level and all the categories  present  in  the  MLS  sensitivity
              label;  if  the  entire  requested  sensitivity label can not be
              translated the application will fail.

       add pass doi:<DOI> tags:<T1>,<Tn>
              Add a new CIPSO/IPv4 configuration without any level or category
              translations.

       add local doi:<DOI>
              Add  a  new CIPSO/IPv4 configuration for localhost/loopback con‐
              nections.

       del doi:<DOI>
              Delete an existing CIPSO/IPv4 configuration with the  given  DOI
              value.  If any LSM domain mappings are present which make use of
              this DOI they will also be deleted.

       list [doi:<DOI>]
              Display a list of all the CIPSO/IPv4 configurations or just  the
              configuration matching the optionally specified DOI.

       calipso

       The  CALIPSO/IPv6  (calipso)  module controls the CALIPSO/IPv6 labeling
       engine in the kernel.  This behaves  in  a  very  similar  way  to  the
       CIPSO/IPv4  engine,  however  the  protocol only specifies one tag-type
       (equivalent to CIPSO tag-type 1) and so  the  tag-type  should  not  be
       specified.   In addition there is no support for the "local" or "trans"
       configuration.  The different commands  and  their  syntax  are  listed
       below.

       add pass doi:<DOI>
              Add  a new CALIPSO/IPv6 configuration without any level or cate‐
              gory translations.

       del doi:<DOI>
              Delete an existing CALIPSO/IPv6 configuration with the given DOI
              value.  If any LSM domain mappings are present which make use of
              this DOI they will also be deleted.

       list [doi:<DOI>]
              Display a list of all the CALIPSO/IPv6  configurations  or  just
              the configuration matching the optionally specified DOI.

EXIT STATUS
       Returns zero on success, errno values on failure.

EXAMPLES
       netlabelctl cipso add pass doi:16 tags:1
            Add  a  CIPSO/IPv4  configuration  with a DOI value of "16", using
            CIPSO tag "1" (the permissive bitmap tag).  The CIPSO and LSM lev‐
            els/categories  are  passed through the NetLabel subsystem without
            any translation.

       netlabelctl  cipso  add  trans  doi:8   tags:1   levels:0=0,1=1   cate‐
            gories:0=1,1=0
            Add  a  CIPSO/IPv4  configuration  with  a DOI value of "8", using
            CIPSO tag "1" (the permissive bitmap tag).  The specified  mapping
            converts  local LSM levels "0" and "1" to CIPSO levels "0" and "1"
            respectively while local LSM categories "0" and "1" are mapped  to
            CIPSO categories "1" and "0" respectively.

       netlabelctl -p cipso list
            Display  all  of the CIPSO/IPv4 configurations in a human readable
            format.

       netlabelctl -p cipso list doi:16
            Display specific information about the CIPSO/IPv4 DOI 16  configu‐
            ration.

       netlabelctl cipso del doi:8
            Delete  the  CIPSO/IPv4 configuration assigned to DOI 8.  In addi‐
            tion to removing the CIPSO/IPv4 configuration any domain  mappings
            using this configuration will also be removed.

       netlabelctl map add domain:lsm_domain protocol:cipso,8
            Add  a  domain  mapping so that all outgoing packets sent from the
            "lsm_domain" will be labeled according to the CIPSO/IPv4  protocol
            using DOI 8.

       netlabelctl  map  add  domain:lsm_domain  address:192.168.1.0/24 proto‐
            col:cipso,8
            Add  a  mapping  so  that  all  outgoing  packets  sent  from  the
            "lsm_domain" to the 192.168.1.0/24 network will be labeled accord‐
            ing to the CIPSO/IPv4 protocol using DOI 8.

       netlabelctl -p map list
            Display all of the domain mappings in a human readable format.

       netlabelctl del domain:lsm_domain
            Delete the domain mapping for the "lsm_domain", packets sent  from
            the "lsm_domain" will fallback to the default NetLabel mapping.

       netlabelctl unlbl add interface:lo address:::1 label:foo
            Add  a static/fallback label to assign the "foo" security label to
            unlabeled packets entering the system  over  the  "lo"  (loopback)
            interface with an IPv6 source address of "::1" (localhost).

       netlabelctl unlbl add default address:192.168.0.0/16 label:bar
            Add  a static/fallback label to assign the "bar" security label to
            unlabeled packets entering the system over any interface  with  an
            IPv4 source address in the 192.168.0.0/16 network.
