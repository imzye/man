NAME
       mmark - generate XML, HTML or markdown from mmark markdown documents.

SYNOPSIS
       mmark [OPTIONS] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       Mmark is a powerful markdown processor written in Go, geared towards writing IETF documents. It is, however, also suited for writing complete books and other technical documentation.

       Mmark  provides  an  advanced  markdown dialect that processes file(s) to produce internet-drafts in XML RFC 7991 ⟨https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991⟩ format. Mmark can produce xml2rfc (aforemen‐
       tioned RFC 7991), HTML5 and manual pages.

       The syntax is detailed at https://mmark.miek.nl/syntax ⟨https://mmark.miek.nl/syntax⟩.

       Compared to other markdown variants mmark adds:

       •   (Extended) Title block to specify authors and IETF specific bits.

       •   (Special) sections for abstracts, prefaces or notes.

       •   Including other files with the option to specify line ranges, regular expressions and/or prefixing each line with a custom string.

       •   Document divisions: front matter, main matter and back matter.

       •   Captions for code, tables, quotes and subfigures.

       •   Asides for small notes.

       •   Figures and Subfigures that allow for grouping images into subfigures as well as giving a single image metadata (a link, attributes, etc.).

       •   Block Level Attributes that allow to specify attributes, classes and IDs for elements.

       •   Indices to mark an item (and/or a subitem) to be referenced in the document index.

       •   Citations and adding XML References (those used by the IETF).

       •   Cross references: short form of referencing a section in the document.

       •   Super- and Subscript.

       •   Callouts in code and text.

       •   BCP14 (RFC 2119) keyword detection.

RFC 7991
       This is the XML format used by the RFC editor for accepting Internet-Drafts.

HTML5
       The HTML5 renderer outputs HTML.

MANUAL PAGES
