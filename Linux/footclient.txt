NAME
       footclient - start new terminals in a foot server

SYNOPSIS
       footclient [OPTIONS]
       footclient [OPTIONS] <command> [COMMAND OPTIONS]

       All trailing (non-option) arguments are treated as a command, and its arguments, to execute (instead of the default shell).

DESCRIPTION
       footclient is used together with foot(1) in --server mode.

       Running it without arguments will open a new terminal window (hosted in the foot server), with your default shell. The exit code will be that of the terminal (thus, footclient does not exit until the
       terminal has terminated).

OPTIONS
       -t,--term=TERM
           Value to set the environment variable TERM to. Default: foot.

       -T,--title=TITLE
           Initial window title. Default: foot.

       -a,--app-id=ID
           Value to set the app-id property on the Wayland window to. Default: foot.

       -w,--window-size-pixels=WIDTHxHEIGHT
           Set initial window width and height, in pixels. Default: 700x500.

       -W,--window-size-chars=WIDTHxHEIGHT
           Set initial window width and height, in characters. Default: not set.

       -m,--maximized
           Start in maximized mode. If both --maximized and --fullscreen are specified, the last one takes precedence.

       -F,--fullscreen
           Start in fullscreen mode. If both --maximized and --fullscreen are specified, the last one takes precedence.

       -L,--login-shell
           Start a login shell, by prepending a '-' to argv[0].

       -s,--server-socket=PATH
           Connect to PATH instead of $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/foot-$WAYLAND_DISPLAY.sock.

       -H,--hold
           Remain open after child process exits.

       -l,--log-colorize=[{never,always,auto}]
           Enables or disables colorization of log output on stderr.

       -v,--version
           Show the version number and quit
