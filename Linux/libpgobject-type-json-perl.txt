NAME
       PGObject::Type::JSON - JSON wrappers for PGObject

VERSION
       Version 2.1.1

SYNOPSIS
          PGOBject::Type::JSON->register();

       Columns of type json will be converted into hashrefs

          my $obj =  PGOBject::Type::JSON->new($hashref);

       $obj will now serialize to the database as json.

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows json types or others (specified by custom register) types to be converted from JSON into objects according to their values.

       This module assumes that encoding will be in UTF8 across the board and is not safe to use with other database encodings.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   register(registry => 'default', types => ['json'])
   new($ref)
       Stores this as a reference. Nulls are now scoped references to a lexically scoped variable.

       If values other than scalars, arrayrefs, or hashes are passed in, throws an error.

   from_db
       serializes from the db. Note that database nulls are preserved distinct from json null's.

   to_db
       returns undef if is_null.  Otherwise returns the value encoded as JSON

   null
       Return a null type for storage in the db.

   TO_JSON
       The handler for setting this to the JSON parser

   reftype
       Returns the reftype of the object (i.e. HASH, SCALAR, ARRAY)

   is_null
       Returns true if is a database null.

   json_null
       Returns a JSON null

   is_json_null
       Returns true if the value is a JSON null.  Else it returns false
