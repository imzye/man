NAME
       sumatra - fast and exact comparison and clustering of sequences

SYNOPSIS
       sumatra [options] <dataset1> [dataset2]

DESCRIPTION
       Sumatra computes all the pairwise LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) scores of one nucleotide dataset or between two nucleotide datasets.

OPTIONS
       -h     [H]elp - print <this> help

       -l     Reference sequence length is the shortest.

       -L     Reference sequence length is the largest.

       -a     Reference sequence length is the alignment length (default).

       -n     Score is normalized by reference sequence length (default).

       -r     Raw score, not normalized.

       -d     Score is expressed in distance (default: score is expressed in similarity).

       -t ##.##
              Score threshold. If the score is normalized and expressed in similarity (default), it is an identity, e.g. 0.95 for an identity of 95%. If the score is normalized and expressed in distance,
              it  is  (1.0  - identity), e.g. 0.05 for an identity of 95%.  If the score is not normalized and expressed in similarity, it is the length of the Longest Common Subsequence. If the score is
              not normalized and expressed in distance, it is (reference length - LCS length).
              Only sequence pairs with a similarity above ##.## are printed. Default: 0.00 (no threshold).

       -p ##  Number of threads used for computation (default=1).

       -g     n's are replaced with a's (default: sequences with n's are discarded).

       -x     Adds four extra columns with the count and length of both sequences.

       dataset1
              (First argument) the nucleotide dataset to analyze

       dataset2
              (Second argument) optionally the second nucleotide dataset

RESULTS
       Results table description
       column 1 : Identifier sequence 1
       column 2 : Identifier sequence 2
       column 3 : Score
       column 4 : Count of sequence 1  (only with option -x)
       column 5 : Count of sequence 2  (only with option -x)
       column 6 : Length of sequence 1 (only with option -x)
       column 7 : Length of sequence 2 (only with option -x)
