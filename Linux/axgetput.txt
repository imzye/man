AXGETPUT(1)                Linux Programmer's Manual               AXGETPUT(1)

NAME
       axgetput  -  upload  or  download files via AX.25 / axspawn Linux login
       session.

SYNOPSIS
       axgetput [-b blocksize] [-i] [-v] [-h] [?] filename
       axgetput [-b blocksize] [-i] -s [-v] [-h] [?] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       -b blocksize
              Set the blocksize (frame length) of transmitted data.   Defaults
              to  256  bytes  which matches typical AX.25 network confurations
              best.

       -i     Compute CRC checksum only.

       .B -s  Indicates input from a stream.  This option is available only if
              STDIN  is a pipe.  The filename argument may be omitted if -s is
              given. The length of the file need not to be known.

       -v     print version and exit.

       -h, ?  print usage and exit.

       axgetput is the actual name of the program. You execute for e.g.   bget
       or bput while axgetput is the common program to which bget and bput are
       linked to.  axgetput autodetermines which operation mode the  user  de‐
       sires.

       axgetput  sets  the  pty to be 8bit clean (thus enables binary mode for
       the file transfer). It requires that the user is logged in through axs‐
       pawn(8).

       I. #BIN Protocol

       bget  is used for downloading a file on this system from the unix login
       shell via his ax25 session to his packet-radio  terminal  program.  The
       download  "protocol"  is  the  "#BIN"  standard known from packet radio
       mailboxes.

       bput does it the other way round: with this comand, the user may upload
       a file to this computer.

       The  #BIN  protocol  provides a CRC consistency check after the file is
       transfered. The transfer of the file modification time is part  of  the
       #BIN protocol.

       II. YAPP Protocol

       yget or yput is reserverd for the yapp protocol, which is not supported
       in this version.

       II. DIDADIT Protocol

       rget or rput is reserverd for the didadit protocol, which is  not  sup‐
       ported in this version.

       Anyone like to implement yapp and didadit protcols?
