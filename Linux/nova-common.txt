NAME
       nova-rootwrap - Root wrapper daemon for the OpenStack Compute service.

SYNOPSIS
          nova-rootwrap CONFIG_FILE COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       nova-rootwrap is an application that filters which commands nova is allowed to run as another user.

       To use this, you should set the following in nova.conf:

          rootwrap_config=/etc/nova/rootwrap.conf

       You also need to let the nova user run nova-rootwrap as root in sudoers:

          nova ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nova-rootwrap /etc/nova/rootwrap.conf *

       To  make  allowed  commands  node-specific, your packaging should only install {compute,network}.filters respectively on compute and network nodes, i.e.  nova-api-wsgi nodes should not have any of
       those files installed.

       NOTE:
          nova-rootwrap is being slowly deprecated and replaced by oslo.privsep, and will eventually be removed.
