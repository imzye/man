NAME
       collectl2pcp - import collectl data to a PCP archive

SYNOPSIS
       collectl2pcp [-fv?]  file [file ...]  archive

DESCRIPTION
       collectl2pcp reads raw collectl(1) data from each file and creates a new PCP archive with basename archive.  Each input file may be gzipped (with .gz suffix).  The PCP archive and at least one in‐
       put file are required arguments.

OPTIONS
       The available command line options are:

       -f, --force
            Overwrite archive (and the index and meta files) if it already exists.

       -v, --verbose
            Report progress and errors verbosely.  This also reports a count of unsupported metric data in the collectl(1) input file(s), which is normally silently skipped.

       -?, --help
            Display usage message and exit.

       file [file ...]
            These are the collectl(1) input files.  If more than one is given, they must contain data for the same host and be given in time-stamp chronological order on the command line.  Note that when
            collectl(1) is run as a service, it normally creates files with date based names that will sort chronologically (e.g. /var/log/collectl/*.gz will be sorted correctly).

PCP ENVIRONMENT
       Environment  variables  with  the  prefix  PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values for these
       variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see pmGetOptions(3).
