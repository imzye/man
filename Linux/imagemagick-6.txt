NAME
       ImageMagick - is a free software suite for the creation, modification and display of bitmap images.

SYNOPSIS
       convert-im6.q16 input-file [options] output-file

OVERVIEW
       Use  ImageMagick®  to  create,  edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 200) including PNG, JPEG,
       GIF, HEIC, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image
       colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B\['e]zier curves.

       The  functionality  of  ImageMagick  is typically utilized from the command-line or you can use the features from programs written in your favorite language.
       Choose from these interfaces: G2F (Ada), MagickCore (C), MagickWand (C), ChMagick (Ch), ImageMagickObject (COM+), Magick++  (C++),  JMagick  (Java),  JuliaIO
       (Julia),  L-Magick  (Lisp), Lua (LuaJIT), NMagick (Neko/haXe), Magick.NET (.NET), PascalMagick (Pascal), PerlMagick (Perl), MagickWand for PHP (PHP), IMagick
       (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), magick (R), RMagick (Ruby), or TclMagick (Tcl/TK). With a language interface, use ImageMagick to modify or create images dynam‐
       ically and automagically.

       ImageMagick utilizes multiple computational threads to increase performance and can read, process, or write mega-, giga-, or tera-pixel image sizes.

       ImageMagick  is  free  software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distribution or as source code that you may use, copy, modify, and distribute in both open
       and proprietary applications. It is distributed under a derived Apache 2.0 license.

       The ImageMagick development process ensures a stable API and ABI. Before each ImageMagick release, we perform a comprehensive security  assessment  that  in‐
       cludes memory error, thread data race detection, and continuous fuzzing to help prevent security vulnerabilities.

       The current release is ImageMagick 6.9.10-11. It runs on Linux, Windows, Mac Os X, iOS, Android OS, and others.

       The  authoritative  ImageMagick  version  6 web site is https://legacy.imagemagick.org. The authoritative source code repository is https://github.com/Image‐
       Magick/ImageMagick6. We maintain a source code mirror at https://gitlab.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6.

       The design of ImageMagick is an evolutionary process, with the design and implementation efforts serving to influence  and  guide  further  progress  in  the
       other. With ImageMagick version 7 we aim to improve the design based on lessons learned from the version 6 implementation.

       In  the  paragraphs  below,  find a short description for each command-line tool.Cl ick on the program name to get details on the program usage and a list of
       comman d-line options that alters how the program performs. If you are just getting acq uainted with ImageMagick, start at the top of the list,  the  convert
       program, and
        work your way down. Also be sure to peruse Anthony Thyssen's tutorial on how to
        use ImageMagick utilities to convert, compose, or edit images from the command- line.

       convert

              convert between image formats as well as resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much more.

       identify

              describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files.

       mogrify

              resize  an  image,  blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much more. Mogrify overwrites the original image file, whereas,
              convert writes to a different image file.

       composite

              overlaps one image over another.

       montage

              create a composite image by combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the composite image optionally adorned with  a  border,  frame,
              image name, and more.

       compare

              mathematically and visually annotate the difference between an image and its reconstruction..

       stream

              is  a  lightweight  tool  to stream one or more pixel components of the image or portion of the image to your choice of storage formats. It writes the
              pixel components as they are read from the input image a row at a time making stream desirable when working with large images or when you require  raw
              pixel components.

       display

              displays an image or image sequence on any X server.

       animate

              animates an image sequence on any X server.

       import

              saves  any  visible window on an X server and outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single window, the entire screen, or any rectangular por‐
              tion of the screen.

       conjure

              interprets and executes scripts written in the Magick Scripting Language (MSL).
