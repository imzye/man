SYNOPSIS
       basez [OPTION]... [FILE]
       hex [OPTION]... [FILE]
       base16 [OPTION]... [FILE]
       base32plain [OPTION]... [FILE]
       base32hex [OPTION]... [FILE]
       base64plain [OPTION]... [FILE]
       base64url [OPTION]... [FILE]

       base64pem [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       BaseZ encodes/decodes base16, base32, base32hex, base64 or base64url data stream per RFC 4648; MIME base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding per RFC 2045; or PEM Printable Encoding per RFC 1421.

       Base16 encoding produces a multiple of two-character blocks in hexadecimal notation [0-9a-f]. It needs no padding and preserves the sort order of the encoded data. Decoding is case insensitive.

       Base32  encoded stream is a multiple of eight-character blocks consisting of letters and numbers [A-Z2-7]. Numbers easily confused with some letters are skipped intentionally to make this encoding
       suitable for storage on -- or transport over -- any medium or data transport mechanism, including non-case-preserving barcodes or printed out strings that could be spelled out and typed in by  hu‐
       mans.  If  needed, the last encoded block is padded with equal sign end padding. Appearance of the padding character [=] at the end of the encoded steam can be avoided by encoding data of size di‐
       visible by 5. Base32 decoding is case insensitive.

       Base32hex encoding works the same way as base32 but with an alternative character-set [0-9a-v] to preserve the encoded data sort order.  This encoding should not be confused with base32.

       Base64 encoded stream is a multiple of four-character blocks using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, plus and slash [A-Za-z0-9+/]. It uses equal sign [=] for end padding.  Base64  de‐
       coding  is case sensitive. It has an option to convert local native text line breaks into canonical CRLF sequences prior to encoding or to convert CRLF sequences into native text line breaks after
       the decoding.

       Base64url encoding is technically the same as base64 but instead of the plus and slash signs [+/] it uses minus and underscore [-_]. Appearance of the padding character [=] in the  encoded  stream
       can be avoided by encoding data of size divisible by 3.

       Base64mime and base64pem are the same encodes as base64 but with encoded stream line length limit of 76 and 64 characters respectively. PEM decoding ignores all white and non-printable characters;
       MIME decoding ignores all characters outside of the encode character-set.

OPTIONS
       When no FILE is specified or when FILE is -, read standard input.  When multiple conflicting options appear, the last option wins.

       -d, -D, --decode
              Decode.   By  default  ignore the space and newline characters.  The --strict, --ignore-all-space, and --ignore-garbage options provide alternative behaviors.  Default option for unhex com‐
              mand.

       -r, --strict
              Do not ignore any characters outside of the encode character-set on decoding.

       -s, --ignore-all-space
              Ignore all white and non-printable ASCII characters on decoding. Default for base64pem decoding.

       -g, --ignore-garbage
              Ignore all characters outside of the encode character-set on decoding. Default for base64mime decoding.

       -x, --hex, --base16
              Base16 coding. Default for base16, hex and unhex commands.

       -j, --base32
              Base32 coding. Default for base32 and base32plain commands.

       -e  --base32hex
              Base32hex coding. Default for base32hex command.

       -c, --capitals, --upper-case
              Output upper case letters on encoding, if applicable.

       -l, --lower-case
              Output lower case letters on encoding, if applicable.

       -a, --base64
              Base64 coding. Default for basez, base64 and base64plain commands.

       -u, --base64url
              Base64url coding. Default for base64url command.

       -p, --base64pem
              PEM printable coding. Default for base64pem command.

       -m, --base64mime
              MIME base64 coding. Default for base64mime command.

       -t, --text
              Convert native text line breaks into CRLF sequences prior to encoding or convert CRLF sequences into native text line breaks after decoding. This option applies to all  variants  of  base64
              codings.

       -w N, -b N, --wrap=N, --break=N
              Set  encoded stream line length limit to N characters.  The default value is 76 for base64mime encode, 64 for base64pem encode, infinity for all other encodes.  To disable any appearance of
              EOL characters in the encoded stream, set to 0.

       -i FILEIN, --input=FILEIN
              Input file. Default is standard input.  When FILEIN is -, read stdin.

       -o FILEOUT, --output=FILEOUT
              Output file. Default is standard output.  When FILEOUT is -, write to stdout.

       -h, --help
              Display help.

       --version
              Display program version information.

EXAMPLES
       Base16 decode a string:

              echo 4a6f650a | hex --decode

       Inspect output of a command:

              echo Joe | hex --wrap 2

       Base32 encode a string:

              printf "Hi People\n" | base32plain

       MIME base64 encode a binary file to stdout per RFC 2045:

              base64mime FILE

       MIME base64 encode a text file to stdout per RFC 2045:

              base64mime --text FILE

       Base64 encode a file per RFC 4648

              base64plain FILE > base64.rfc4648.file
