NAME
       i2cset - set I2C registers

SYNOPSIS
       i2cset [-f] [-y] [-m mask] [-r] [-a] i2cbus chip-address data-address [value] ...  [mode]
       i2cset -V
       i2cset -h

DESCRIPTION
       i2cset is a small helper program to set registers visible through the I2C bus.

OPTIONS
       -V     Display the version and exit.

       -h     Display the help and exit.

       -f     Force access to the device even if it is already busy. By default, i2cset will refuse to access a device which is already under the control of a kernel driver. Using this flag is dangerous,
              it can seriously confuse the kernel driver in question. It can also cause i2cset to silently write to the wrong register. So use at your own risk and only if you know what you're doing.

       -y     Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cset will wait for a confirmation from the user before messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the operation directly. This
              is mainly meant to be used in scripts.

       -m mask
              The  mask  parameter,  if specified, describes which bits of value will be actually written to data-address. Bits set to 1 in the mask are taken from value, while bits set to 0 will be read
              from data-address and thus preserved by the operation. Please note that this parameter assumes that the read and write operations for the specified mode are symmetrical for the  device  you
              are accessing. This may or may not be the case, as neither I2C nor SMBus guarantees this.

       -r     Read back the value right after writing it, and compare the result with the value written. This used to be the default behavior. The same limitations apply as those of option -m.

       -a     Allow using addresses between 0x00 - 0x07 and 0x78 - 0x7f. Not recommended.

       There  are  three required options to i2cset. i2cbus indicates the number or name of the I2C bus to be scanned.  This number should correspond to one of the busses listed by i2cdetect -l. chip-ad‐
       dress specifies the address of the chip on that bus, and is an integer between 0x08 and 0x77.  data-address specifies the address on that chip to write to, and is an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF.

       The value parameter, if specified, is the value to write to that location on the chip. If this parameter is omitted, then a short write is issued. For  most  chips,  it  simply  sets  an  internal
       pointer  to  the target location, but doesn't actually write to that location. For a few chips though, in particular simple ones with a single register, this short write is an actual write. If the
       mode parameter is s or i, multiple values can be specified.

       The mode parameter, if specified, is one of the letters b, w, s, or i, corresponding to a write size of a single byte, a 16-bit word, a SMBus block write, or an I2C block write, respectively.  For
       SMBus and I2C block writes, the write size is determined by the number of value parameters.  Except for I2C block writes, a p can also be appended to the mode parameter to enable PEC.  If the mode
       parameter is omitted, i2cset defaults to byte mode without PEC. The value provided must be within range for the specified data type (0x00-0xFF for byte and block writes, 0x0000-0xFFFF for  words).
       Another possible mode is c, which doesn't write any value (so-called short write). You usually don't have to specify this mode, as it is the default when no value is provided, unless you also want
       to enable PEC.

WARNING
       i2cset  can  be extremely dangerous if used improperly. It can confuse your I2C bus, cause data loss, or have more serious side effects. Writing to a serial EEPROM on a memory DIMM (chip addresses
       between 0x50 and 0x57) may DESTROY your memory, leaving your system unbootable!  Be extremely careful using this program.

EXAMPLES
       Write value 0x42 to 8-bit register 0x11 of the I2C device at 7-bit address 0x2d on bus 1 (i2c-1), after user confirmation:
              # i2cset 1 0x2d 0x11 0x42

       Immediately clear the 3 least significant bits of 8-bit register 0x11 of the I2C device at 7-bit address 0x2d on bus 1 (i2c-1) (no user confirmation):
              # i2cset -y -m 0x07 1 0x2d 0x11 0x00

       Write value 0x5000 to 16-bit register 0x02 of the I2C device at 7-bit address 0x48 on bus 1 (i2c-1), after user confirmation:
              # i2cset 1 0x48 0x02 0x5000 w

       Also see i2cget(8) for examples of combined usage of i2cset and i2cget.
