NAME
       pfsoctavergb - Process red, green and blue channels in pfs stream using Octave

SYNOPSIS
       pfsoctavergb <octave_program>

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  command to execute a GNU Octave program on red, green and blue channels of each frame in the pfs stream. octave_program must be given in quotation marks ("") and must not produce any output
       (it can output to stderr, not to stdout). Red, green and blue color channels are available in octave_program as R, G and B matrices.

       Note: This command requires GNU Octave.

EXAMPLES
       pfsinrgbe frames_%04d.hdr | pfsoctavergb "R = R.^2; G = G.^2; B = B.^2;" | pfsview

       Expand the dynamic range of a sequence of frames and show the result with pfsview.
