NAME
       tdview - show recorded output of a terminal program

SYNOPSIS
       tdview [OPTIONS] RECORDING

DESCRIPTION
       tdview shows the recorded output of a terminal program. The recording can be made by either tdrecord(1) or tdrerecord(1).

OPTIONS
       tdview accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
              Display a short help message.

       -V, --version
              Print version and copyright information.

       -kdelay, --key-delay=delay
              Set  the  delay  for sending a the next keys to delay. Delay may be either a fixed number of miliseconds, or it may be specified as / (slash) followed by a divisor. When a divisor is speci‐
              fied, all key delays specified in the recording will be divided by the divisor.

       To stop tdview from interpreting file names that start with a dash as options, one can specify a double dash (--) after which tdview will interpret any following arguments as files to read.
