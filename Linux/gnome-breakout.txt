NAME
       gnome-breakout - Addictive breakout game for GNOME

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-breakout [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gnome-breakout command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. It does not have any documentation at all.

       gnome-breakout is a clone of the classic Breakout game.

       Control a paddle at the bottom of the playfield and bounce a ball against bricks at the top to destroy them.  When all of the bricks are destroyed you advance to the next level.
