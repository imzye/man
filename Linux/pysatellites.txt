NAME
       pysatellites - simulates the launching of satellites

SYNOPSIS

       pysatellites [-d debuglevel] [--debug=debuglevel] [-f file] [--fichier=file] [-h ] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This program can be used to train people to spatial mechanics at an elementary level. You are given the power to launch a satellite, from outside the atmosphere, around a handfull of predefined
       planets, or around any special object you may imagine. Input the intial velocity vector of the satellite, and you will get the simulated trajectory, as well as some informations like the plots of
       variation of speed. As an extra, you can compute a movie, which represents the planet seen from the satellite´s point of view during its orbital period.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
           Show a short usage description.

       -d debuglevel --debug=debuglevel
           Sets the debug level, from 0 to 10 (default = 0).

       -f file --fichier=file
           Sets the configuration file (default: none)
