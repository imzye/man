       foomatic-printjob -Q [ -s spooler ] [ -P queuename ] [ -i ] [ -a ] [ user1 user2 ... ]

       foomatic-printjob -R [ -s spooler ] [ -P queuename ] [ -i ] [ - | jobid1 jobid2 ... ]

       foomatic-printjob -C [ -s spooler ] [ -i ] command [ arguments ]

       foomatic-printjob -S [ -s spooler ] [ -i ]

       foomatic-printjob -h [ -s spooler ] [ -P queuename ] [ -i ]

DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-printjob  provides  a  spooler-independent  interface to creating and managing printer jobs and print queues.  Note that the first argument changes the mode of the command, as it combines the
       functionality of several System V-style printing commands.

   OPTIONS
       -sspooler Explicit spooler type.

       -Pqueuename
                 Any commands specified should apply to this queue instead of the default.

       -ooption=value
                 Set option to value

       -ooption  Set the switch option

       -#n       Print n copies

       file1  file2  ...
                 Files to be printed, when no file is given, standard input will be printed

       -Q        Query the jobs in a queue.  If a list of users is specified, only those users' jobs will be queried.

       -Q -a     Query the jobs in all queues.  If a list of users is specified, only those users' jobs will be queried.

       -R [ - | jobid1 jobid2 ... ]
                 Remove a job from a queue.  Using - will remove all jobs.

       -C command [ arguments ]
                 Execute control commands for queue/job manipulation.  The commands are the ones of the BSD "lpc" utility. Use the control command "help" to get a list of supported commands. Note: the amount
                 of commands varies with the spooler, but the same commands given under different spoolers do the same thing.

       -i        Interactive mode: You will be asked if foomatic-printjob is in doubt about something. Otherwise foomatic-printjob uses auto-detection or quits with an error.

       -S        Save the chosen spooler as the default spooler

       -h        Show this message or show a list of available options if a queue is specified
