NAME
       ts - timestamp input

SYNOPSIS
       ts [-r] [-i | -s] [-m] [format]

DESCRIPTION
       ts adds a timestamp to the beginning of each line of input.

       The optional format parameter controls how the timestamp is formatted, as used by strftime(3). The default format is "%b %d %H:%M:%S". In addition to the regular strftime conversion specifications,
       "%.S" and "%.s" and "%.T" are like "%S" and "%s" and "%T", but provide subsecond resolution (ie, "30.00001" and "1301682593.00001" and "1:15:30.00001").

       If the -r switch is passed, it instead converts existing timestamps in the input to relative times, such as "15m5s ago". Many common timestamp formats are supported. Note that the Time::Duration and
       Date::Parse perl modules are required for this mode to work. Currently, converting localized dates is not supported.

       If both -r and a format is passed, the existing timestamps are converted to the specified format.

       If the -i or -s switch is passed, ts reports incremental timestamps instead of absolute ones. The default format changes to "%H:%M:%S", and "%.S" and "%.s" can be used as well. In case of -i, every
       timestamp will be the time elapsed since the last timestamp. In case of -s, the time elapsed since start of the program is used.

       The -m switch makes the system's monotonic clock be used.

ENVIRONMENT
       The standard TZ environment variable controls what time zone dates are assumed to be in, if a timezone is not specified as part of the date.
