NAME
       aubiocut  -  a  command line tool to slice sound files at onset or beat
       timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       aubiocut source
       aubiocut [[-i] source]
                [-r rate] [-B win] [-H hop]
                [-O method] [-t thres]
                [-b] [-c]
                [-v] [-q] [-h]

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with  long  op‐
       tions  starting  with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included
       below.

       -i, --input source
              Run analysis on this audio  file.  Most  uncompressed  and  com‐
              pressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

       -r, --samplerate rate
              Fetch  the  input  source, resampled at the given sampling rate.
              The rate should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If  set  to
              0,  the  sampling  rate of the original source will be used. De‐
              faults to 0.

       -B, --bufsize win
              The size of the buffer to analyze, that is  the  length  of  the
              window  used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to
              512.

       -H, --hopsize hop
              The number of samples between  two  consecutive  analysis.   De‐
              faults to 256.

       -O, --onset method
              The  onset detection method to use. See ONSET METHODS below. De‐
              faults to 'default'.

       -b, --beat
              Use beat locations instead of onset locations.

       -t, --onset-threshold thres
              Set the threshold value for the onset peak picking.  Values  are
              typically  in  the  range [0.001, 0.900]. Lower threshold values
              imply more onsets detected. Increasing this threshold should re‐
              duce the number of incorrect detections. Defaults to 0.3.

       -c, --cut
              Cut  input  sound file at detected labels. A new sound files for
              each slice will be created in the current directory.

       -o, --output directory
              Specify the directory path where slices of the  original  source
              should be created.

       --cut-until-nsamples n
              How  many extra samples should be added at the end of each slice
              (default 0).

       --cut-until-nslices n
              How many extra slices should be added at the end of  each  slice
              (default 0).

       --create-first
              Alway create first slice.

       -h, --help
              Print a short help message and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -q, --quiet
              Be quiet.

ONSET METHODS
       Available  methods: default, energy, hfc, complex, phase, specdiff, kl,
       mkl, specflux.
