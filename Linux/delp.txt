NAME
       delp - The Free Pascal file deletion tool.

SYNOPSIS
       delp [options] directory

DESCRIPTION
       delp  deletes  files in the specified directory that are left over from a Free Pascal compilation process. It knows what files can be produced by the compile steps and deletes any such files it finds.
       At the end it gives a summary of the number of files that were deleted, together with the amount of bytes freed by this process.

USAGE
       delp takes the following options at this time:

       -e     Delete all executable files as well. This option has no effect on Linux.

       -h     Displays a short help message.

       -q     Be more quiet. Normally, delp gives a count of the number of files deleted.  If this option is given, no messages are displayed.
