NAME
       undertime - pick a meeting time

SYNOPSIS
       undertime [OPTIONS] [--timezones ZONES] [WHEN]
       undertime [-l|--list-zones] [-V|--version]
       undertime --selftest

DESCRIPTION
       undertime  is  a  program  that allows you to quickly pick a meeting time across multiple time zones for conference calls or other coordinated events. It shows all times of a given day for all the
       time zones selected, in a table that aligns the time so a line shows simultaneous times across all time zones. This takes into account daylight savings and other peculiarities (provided  that  the
       local time zone database is up to date) so you can also schedule meetings in the future as well.

       An  educated  guess  is  made to find the relevant time zones: the local time zone is first guessed and added to the list, then the arguments on the command line are looked up in the internal time
       zone database. Spaces in arguments are replaced by underscores and all-caps versions of lowercase strings are tried as well. When failing to match a provided time zone against the internal list, a
       warning is emitted. A complete list of time zones is shown when the --list-zones command line option is provided.

       You can also specify offsets instead of time zones, with the syntax UTC{+|-}offset or GMT{+|-}offset (for example UTC+2 for CEST or GMT-4 for EDT). Those are discouraged as  daylight  savings  are
       not  taken  into  account  so the computed time might not represent the expected local time. Don't confuse those patterns with the "standard" time zones Etc/GMT{+|-}X: they are the inverse of each
       other (i.e. EDT, UTC-4 is Etc/GMT+4, yes, that's confusing). To specify the Etc time zones the full time zone needs to given (for example Etc/GMT-2). Those should also be avoided: just use normal,
       location-based zones instead of those arbitrary offsets.

       Colors are used to highlight the "work hours" where possible meeting times could overlap and the current time is marked in bold. Colors are replaced by an underscore suffix and the current time by
       a star if colors are disabled. You can change those work hours with the --start and --end flags.

       Because daylight savings may actually change time, you should also pick an arbitrary time for the meeting (WHEN), using natural language (as parsed by the parsedatetime library). The current  time
       is also shown, in bold.

OPTIONS
       --timezones ZONES
              target date for the meeting, supports arbitrary dates like "in two weeks"

       -s HOUR, --start HOUR
              start of working day, in hours

       -e HOUR, --end HOUR
              end of working day, in hours

       --no-colors, --colors
              do not show colors. enabled by default if output is a terminal.

       --no-default-zone, --default-zone
              do not show current time zone first

       --no-unique, --unique
              deduplicate time zones

       --no-overlap, --overlap
              do not show the overlap column (labeled "n"), displayed by default.

       --overlap-min N
              show only times with N overlapping time zones.

       --format FORMAT
              pass FORMAT to the tabulate package to format the main table.

       --config FILE
              load YAML config FILE as defaults.

       -v, --verbose
              enable verbose messages

       --debug
              enable debugging messages

       -l, --list-zones
              show valid time zones and exit

       -V, --version
              show version number and exit

       --selftest
              run test suite

       -h, --help
              show summary of options and defaults

ENVIRONMENT
       TZ     Default time zone.

       NO_COLOR
              If this environment variable is defined, no color will be shown unless the --colors flag is passed. Comforming to NO_COLOR informal standard ⟨https://no-color.org/⟩

FILES
       ~/.config/undertime.yml $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/undertime.yml
              The  configuration  file  loaded  by  default, if present. The configuration file is formatted as a YAML dictionary, where keys are the long option names (without dashes) and the values are
              their values. Comments start with the # character. Options provided as arguments override the defaults set in the configuration file, particularly time zones. For example, this  means  time
              zones  specified  in the configuration file are ignored ignored when also specified as arguments. The --config parameter allows you to load another configuration file, on top of the default
              one, using the same logic, allowing you to have multiple "presets".

EXAMPLE
   Command line options
       undertime --timezones "New York" "Los Angeles" Paris
              Display possible meeting times for three major cities.

       undertime -s 8 -e 18 2014-03-15
              Show a longer work day in march 2014.

       undertime --overlap-min 3 2014-03-15
              Show only times that match in three time zones.

       undertime --timezones "New York" "Los Angeles" Paris -- tomorrow
              Show times for those three timezones, but for tomorrow. Note the options separator (--) is required otherwise the date will be parsed as a timezone.

   Configuration file
       A sample configuration file should be available in $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/undertime.yml, for example /etc/undertime.yml.
