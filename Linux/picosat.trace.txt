NAME
       picosat - Satisfiability (SAT) solver with proof and core support

SYNOPSIS
       picosat [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       PicoSAT is a satisfiability (SAT) solver for boolean variables in bool‐
       ean expressions.  A SAT solver can determine if it is possible to  find
       assignments to boolean variables that would make a given set of expres‐
       sions true.  If it's satisfiable, it can also show a set of assignments
       that make the expression true.  Many problems can be broken down into a
       large SAT problem (perhaps with thousands of variables), so SAT solvers
       have a variety of uses.

       The  picosat binary is built with options that provide for the greatest
       speed.  A second binary, picosat.trace, is built with  proof  and  core
       capabilities, which incur some overhead.

CONFORMING TO
       This program uses DIMACS CNF format as input.

       Like many SAT solvers, this program requires that its input be in  con‐
       junctive  normal  form (CNF or cnf) in DIMACS CNF format.  CNF is built
       from these building blocks:

       *  R term : A term is either a boolean variable (e.g., x4) or a negated
          boolean variable (NOT x4, written here as -x4).

       *  R clause : A clause is a set of one or more terms, connected with OR
          (written here as |); boolean variables  may  not  repeat   inside  a
          clause.

       *  R  expression  : An expression is a set of one or more clauses, each
          connected by AND (written here as &).

       Any boolean expression can be converted into CNF.

       DIMACS CNF format is a simple text format for CNF.  Every  line  begin‐
       ning "c" is a comment.  The first non-comment line must be of the form:

        p cnf NUMBER_OF_VARIABLES NUMBER_OF_CLAUSES

       Each  of  the  non-comment  lines afterwards defines a clause.  Each of
       these lines is a space-separated list of variables;  a  positive  value
       means that corresponding variable (so 4 means x4), and a negative value
       means the negation of that variable (so -5 means -x5).  Each line  must
       end in a space and the number 0.

EXIT STATUS
       The  output  is  a  number of lines.  Most of these will begin with "c"
       (comment), and give detailed technical information.   The  output  line
       beginning with "s" declares whether or not it is satisfiable.  The line
       "s SATISFIABLE" is produced if it is satisfiable (exit status 10),  and
       "s  UNSATISFIABLE"  is  produced  if it is not satisfiable (exit status
       20).

       If it is satisfiable, the output line beginning with "v" declares a set
       of variable settings that satisfy all formulas.  For example:

         v 1 -2 -3 -4 5 0

       Shows  that  there  is a solution with variable 1 true, variables 2, 3,
       and 4 false, and variable 5 true.

EXAMPLE
       An example of CNF is:

         (x1 | -x5 | x4) &
         (-x1 | x5 | x3 | x4) &
         (-x3 | x4).

       The DIMACS CNF format for the above set of expressions could be:

        c Here is a comment.
        p cnf 5 3
        1 -5 4 0
        -1 5 3 4 0
        -3 -4 0

       The "p cnf" line above means that this is SAT  problem  in  CNF  format
       with  5 variables and 3 clauses.   The first line after it is the first
       clause, meaning x1 | -x5 | x4.

       CNFs with conflicting requirements are not satisfiable.   For  example,
       the  following DIMACS CNF formatted data is not satisfiable, because it
       requires that variable 1 always be true and also always be false:

        c This is not satisfiable.
        p cnf 2 2
        -1 0
        1 0
