NAME
       getmac - Cross-platform Python package to get MAC addresses Latest version on PyPI Documentation status Travis CI build status Appveyor build status

       Get the MAC address of remote LAN hosts and system network interfaces using Python.

       It provides a platform-independant interface to get the MAC addresses of:

       • System network interfaces (by interface name)

       • Remote hosts on the local network (by IPv4/IPv6 address or hostname)

       It provides one function: get_mac_address()

       • Pure-Python

       • Supports Python 2.6+, 3.4+, pypy, and pypy3

       • No dependencies

       • Small size

       • Can be used as an independent .py file

       • Simple terminal tool (when installed as a package)

PYTHON EXAMPLES
          from getmac import get_mac_address
          eth_mac = get_mac_address(interface="eth0")
          win_mac = get_mac_address(interface="Ethernet 3")
          ip_mac = get_mac_address(ip="192.168.0.1")
          ip6_mac = get_mac_address(ip6="::1")
          host_mac = get_mac_address(hostname="localhost")
          updated_mac = get_mac_address(ip="10.0.0.1", network_request=True)

          # Enabling debugging
          from getmac import getmac
          getmac.DEBUG = 2  # DEBUG level 2
          print(getmac.get_mac_address(interface="Ethernet 3"))

          # Changing the port used for updating ARP table (UDP packet)
          from getmac import getmac
          getmac.PORT = 44444  # Default: 55555
          print(get_mac_address(ip="192.168.0.1", network_request=True))

TERMINAL EXAMPLES
          getmac --help
          getmac --version

          # No arguments will return MAC of the default interface.
          getmac
          python -m getmac

          # Interface names, IPv4/IPv6 addresses, or Hostnames can be specified
          getmac --interface ens33
          getmac --ip 192.168.0.1
          getmac --ip6 ::1
          getmac --hostname home.router

          # Running as a Python module with shorthands for the arguments
          python -m getmac -i 'Ethernet 4'
          python -m getmac -4 192.168.0.1
          python -m getmac -6 ::1
          python -m getmac -n home.router

          # Getting the MAC address of a remote host obviously requires
          # the ARP table to be populated. By default, getmac will do
          # this for you by sending a small UDP packet to a high port (55555)
          # If you don't want this to happen, you can disable it.
          # This is useful if you're 100% certain the ARP table will be
          # populated already, or in red team/forensic scenarios.
          getmac --no-network-request -4 192.168.0.1
          python -m getmac --no-network-request -n home.router

          # Debug levels can be specified with '-d'
          getmac --debug
          python -m getmac -d -i enp11s4
          python -m getmac -dd -n home.router

       Note: the terminal interface will not work on Python 2.6 and older (Sorry RHEL 6 users!).

GET_MAC_ADDRESS()
       • interface: Name of a network interface on the system.

       • ip: IPv4 address of a remote host.

       • ip6: IPv6 address of a remote host.

       • hostname: Hostname of a remote host.

       • network_request:  If an network request should be made to update and populate the ARP/NDP table of remote hosts used to lookup MACs in most circumstances. Disable this if you want to just use what's
         already in the table, or if you have requirements to prevent network traffic. The network request is a empty UDP packet sent to a high port, 55555 by default. This can be  changed  by  setting  get‐
         mac.PORT to the desired integer value. Additionally, on Windows, this will send a UDP packet to 1.1.1.1:53 to attempt to determine the default interface.

NOTES
       • If none of the arguments are selected, the default network interface for the system will be used.

       • "Remote  hosts"  refer  to hosts in your local layer 2 network, also commonly referred to as a "broadcast domain", "LAN", or "VLAN". As far as I know, there is not a reliable method to get a MAC ad‐
         dress for a remote host external to the LAN. If you know any methods otherwise, please open a GitHub issue or shoot me an email, I'd love to be wrong about this.

       • The first four arguments are mutually exclusive. network_request does not have any functionality when the interface argument is specified, and can be safely set if using in a script.

       • The physical transport is assumed to be Ethernet (802.3). Others, such as Wi-Fi (802.11), are currently not tested or considored. I plan to address this in the future, and am definitely open to pull
         requests or issues related to this, including error reports.

       • Exceptions  will  be  handled  silently  and  returned as a None.  If you run into problems, you can set DEBUG to true and get more information about what's happening. If you're still having issues,
         please create an issue on GitHub and include the output with DEBUG enabled.

       • Messages are output using the warnings module, and print() if getmac.DEBUG enabled (any value greater than 0).  If you are using logging, they can be captured using logging.captureWarnings().   Oth‐
         erwise, they can be suppressed using warnings.filterwarnings("ignore").  https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html

DOCKER EXAMPLES
       Run getmac container and provide flags

          docker run -it ghostofgoes/getmac:latest --help
          docker run -it ghostofgoes/getmac:latest --version
          docker run -it ghostofgoes/getmac:latest -n localhost

       There is a pre-built container located on the Docker hub.  Alternatively, you can build the image yourself (from the repository root directory):

          docker build . -t getmac

       • Windows

         • Commands: getmac, ipconfig

         • Libraries: uuid, ctypes

         • Third-party Packages: netifaces, psutil, scapy

       • Linux/Unix

         • Commands: arp, ip, ifconfig, netstat, ip link

         • Libraries: uuid, fcntl

         • The latest two versions probably (TBD)

       • Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

       • Docker

       All sub-versions are the latest available on your platform (with the exception of 2.6).

       • 2.6.6 (CentOS 6/RHEL 6 version)

       • 2.7

       • 3.4

       • 3.5

       • 3.6

       • 3.7

       Please report any problems by opening a issue on GitHub!

CAVEATS
       • Depending on the platform, there could be a performance detriment, due to heavy usage of regular expressions.

       • Platform test coverage is imperfect. If you're having issues, then you might be using a platform I haven't been able to test.  Keep calm, open a GitHub issue, and I'd be more than happy to help.

       • Older  Python  versions (2.5/3.3 and older) are not officially supported.  If you're running these, all is not lost! Simply copy/paste getmac.py into your codebase and make the necessary edits to be
         compatible with your version and distribution of Python.

KNOWN ISSUES
       • Hostnames for IPv6 devices are not yet supported.

       • Windows: the "default" of selecting the default route interface only works effectively if network_request is enabled. Otherwise, Ethernet as the default.

       • There is are currently no automated tests for Python 2.6, which means there is a much higher potential for regressions. Open an issue if you encounter any.
