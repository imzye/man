NAME
       pandoc-plantuml - Pandoc filter: converts PlantUML code blocks to PlantUML images

SYNOPSIS

       pandoc --filter pandoc-plantuml [...]

DESCRIPTION
       pandoc-plantuml is a filter for pandoc and is not intended to be used as a standalone command.

       This manual page documents briefly the pandoc-plantuml command.

EXAMPLES
       In your (in this example Markdown) document insert plantuml diagrams like this:

           ```plantuml
           Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
           Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

           Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
           Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
           ```

       This will create an output file with a plantuml-generated image linked in the file. The image will be put under the relative dir plantuml-images.
