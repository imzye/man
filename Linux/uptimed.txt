UPTIMED.CONF(5)                                                                                                                                                                             UPTIMED.CONF(5)

NAME
       uptimed.conf - The configuration file for uptimed(8)

DESCRIPTION
       uptimed.conf contains a list of key-value pairs to configure the behaviour of uptimed(8), comments start with #.  The beginning of uptimed.conf might look like the following:

              # Uptimed configuration file.

              # Interval to write the logfile with in seconds.
              UPDATE_INTERVAL=3600

              # Maximum number of entries in logfile. Set to 0 for unlimited.
              LOG_MAXIMUM_ENTRIES=500

       The  variables  LOG_MINIMUM_UPTIMED, MAIL_MINIMUM_UPTIME and MILESTONE expect a time unit which are encoded by a single letter.  h is used for hour, d is used for day, w is used for weeks and y is
       used for years. Default (nothings specified) is seconds.

       The default uptimed.conf is quite well commented so you should be able to use it as a basis. The following keys are supported:

       UPDATE_INTERVAL
              Interval to write the logfile with in seconds, e.g. 60.

       LOG_MAXIMUM_ENTRIES
              Maximum number of entries in logfile, e.g. 50. Set to 0 for unlimited.

       LOG_MINIMUM_UPTIMED
              Minimum uptime that must be reached to be considered a record.

       MAIL_MINIMUM_UPTIME
              Minimum uptime before sending out e-mail.

       MAIL_MINIMUM_POSITION
              Minimum position in uptime ranking before sending out e-mail.

       EMAIL  Email address to mail milestones/records to.  Assumes sendmail(8) compatible MTA installed as /usr/lib/sendmail.  You can enable this with SEND_EMAIL or with the -e option on  the  command‐
              line.

       SEND_EMAIL
              Controls if email is sent. Use 0 if you never want an email, 1 if you want emails for both milestones and records, 2 if you want emails only for milestones and 3 if you want emails only for
              records.

       SENDMAIL
              Command to call a sendmail compatible mailer, e.g. /usr/lib/sendmail -t.

       PIDFILE
              Path to store PID file, e.g.  /var/run/uptimed

       MILESTONE
              Configurable milestones.  Syntax is pretty easy: MILESTONE=time:description.  Keep in mind that the description needs to fit in the window.

   EXAMPLE FOR MILESTONE SETTINGS
              MILESTONE=5d:five days
              MILESTONE=10d:ten days
              MILESTONE=25d:twenty-five days
              MILESTONE=50d:fifty days
