LLVM-CXXMAP(1)                       LLVM                       LLVM-CXXMAP(1)

NAME
       llvm-cxxmap - Mangled name remapping tool

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-cxxmap [options] symbol-file-1 symbol-file-2

DESCRIPTION
       The  llvm-cxxmap  tool  performs  fuzzy  matching of C++ mangled names,
       based on a file describing name components that  should  be  considered
       equivalent.

       The  symbol  files  should contain a list of C++ mangled names (one per
       line).  Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.  The  output
       is a list of pairs of equivalent symbols, one per line, of the form

          <symbol-1> <symbol-2>

       where  <symbol-1>  is  a  symbol from symbol-file-1 and <symbol-2> is a
       symbol from symbol-file-2. Mappings for which the two symbols are iden‐
       tical are omitted.

OPTIONS
       -remapping-file=file, -r=file
              Specify  a  file  containing  a  list  of equivalence rules that
              should be used to determine whether two symbols are  equivalent.
              Required.  See REMAPPING FILE.

       -output=file, -o=file
              Specify a file to write the list of matched names to. If unspec‐
              ified, the list will be written to stdout.

       -Wambiguous
              Produce a warning if there are  multiple  equivalent  (but  dis‐
              tinct) symbols in symbol-file-2.

       -Wincomplete
              Produce  a  warning if symbol-file-1 contains a symbol for which
              there is no equivalent symbol in symbol-file-2.

REMAPPING FILE
       The remapping file is a text file containing lines of the form

          fragmentkind fragment1 fragment2

       where fragmentkind is  one  of  name,  type,  or  encoding,  indicating
       whether  the  following mangled name fragments are <name>s, <type>s, or
       <encoding>s, respectively.  Blank lines and lines starting with  #  are
       ignored.

       Unmangled   C  names  can  be  expressed  as  an  encoding  that  is  a
       (length-prefixed) <source-name>:

          # C function "void foo_bar()" is remapped to C++ function "void foo::bar()".
          encoding 7foo_bar _Z3foo3barv

       For convenience,  built-in  <substitution>s  such  as  St  and  Ss  are
       accepted as <name>s (even though they technically are not <name>s).

       For  example,  to  specify  that absl::string_view and std::string_view
       should be treated as equivalent, the following remapping file could  be
       used:

          # absl::string_view is considered equivalent to std::string_view
          type N4absl11string_viewE St17basic_string_viewIcSt11char_traitsIcEE

          # std:: might be std::__1:: in libc++ or std::__cxx11:: in libstdc++
          name St St3__1
          name St St7__cxx11

       NOTE:
          Symbol  remapping  is currently only supported for C++ mangled names
          following the Itanium C++ ABI mangling scheme. This covers  all  C++
          targets supported by Clang other than Windows targets.
