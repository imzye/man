NAME
       brp-pacu - dual fft live audio analysis program

SYNOPSIS
       brp-pacu

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the brp-pacu program.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       brp-pacu  is an audio analysis tool to configure any sound system with an equalizer.  It compares the output of the system to the input of the system and allows you to use this data to perform fi‐
       nal equalization by matching the results with actual DSP/EQ.

       Channel 1 is the output of the system we are observing (measured), channel 2 is the input (reference).  You also need a decent calibrated omnidrectional microphone (reasonably flat 20Hz-20kHz) and
       either a USB-Preamp like the 2-channel M-Audio, or a mixer with a 30dB pad or so going into the laptop mic input.  No Pad is necessary if you are lucky enough to have a laptop or PC  with  a  line
       input.  The headphone out will have the pink noise.

       brp-pacu works through Jack Audio Connection Kit.
