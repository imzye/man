SYNOPSIS
       Prime [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       About The Prime
       ===============
       Prime  is  a  GNU software, part of the GnuDOS package.  Prime is a file manager which works under the GNU/Linux console. It was influenced by other file managers (like the well known XTree Gold which
       was popular under MS-DOS). It provides a user friendly interface with menus, shortcuts, and key navigation. It is distributed as part of the GnuDOS package which was developed  to  help  users  coming
       from  DOS-like environments feel ease when dealing with the GNU system.  Prime provides multi-level experience, the level of complexity can be adjusted by the user: you want to use DOS-keys with a few
       basic GNU ones? you want to go with the full power of the GNU system? All are options that are provided by the six levels of experience of Prime:

         1- Newbie: All DOS shortcut keys, no GNU keys yet
         2- Novice: DOS shortcut keys, some of which are replaced with GNU's
         3- Intermediate: DOS keys with a few more replaced with GNU keys
         4- Advanced: ... And more GNU keys in
         5- Expert: Very few DOS keys, most are GNU keys
         6- Veteran: Only GNU keys, no DOS-like keys

       You start with level 1 by default.  To set your level, call the mino with '--levelX' or '-lX' options,

       Which keys are defined for which level?
       =======================================
       There is a table showing the DOS-like key combinations along with their respective GNU key bindings in the README file installed with this package.  To read more about the levels of experience and the
