NAME
       csdp-theta - Compute the Lovasz Theta number of a graph

SYNOPSIS
       csdp-theta GRAPH_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The csdp-theta program uses the CSDP library to compute the Lovasz Theta number of an input graph.

FILE FORMAT
       The input file should be in the following format:
              n
              m
              i1 j1
              …
              im jm
       where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges, and each i/j pair describes one edge.

EXIT STATUS
       The output is the Lovasz Theta number of the input graph.  The exit status is zero if the number is computed successfully.  Otherwise, the exit status is one, and an error message indicating the prob‐
       lem is produced on standard out.
