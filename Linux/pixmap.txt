NAME
       pixmap - Xpm pixmap editor for X

SYNOPSIS
       pixmap [-options ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The pixmap program is a tool for creating or editing rectangular images made up of colored pixels, i.e., pixmaps. Pixmaps are intensively used in X to define window backgrounds, icon images, etc.

       The pixmap program can have two different interfaces, a Athena widgets version and a Motif widgets version.

USAGE
       Pixmap  displays  grid  in which each square represents a single pixel in the picture being edited.  Squares can be set, cleared, or inverted (this last operation will be detailed later) directly with
       the buttons on the pointer and a menu of higher level operations such as draw line and fill circle is provided to the side of the grid.  Another menu on the top of the window allows  files  operations
       (Load,  Save,  ...),  edit operations (Cut/Copy/Paste, attributes of pixmap editing, ...) and colors operations (drawing color, attributes of colors, ...). Pixmap uses a Pixmap widget to represent the
       pixmap image.

       Pixmaps are stored as a C string array variable suitable for including in applications, using the format defined by Arnaud Le Hors in his Xpm library (refer to Xpm manual for format description). This
       format allows pixmaps to be used indistinctly on monochrome, grey scale or color displays.

OPTIONS
       Pixmap accepts the following options:

       -display/-d display
           This option specifies the name of the X server to use.

       -geometry geometry

       -colormap/-pc
           This options specifies that pixmap should use its own private colormap instead of the default colormap.

PIXELS EDITING WITH MOUSE
       Pixels  may be set, cleared, or inverted by pointing to them and clicking one of the buttons indicated below.  Multiple pixels can be changed at once by holding the button down and dragging the cursor
       across them.  Set pixels are filled with the current color; cleared pixels are filled with white; and inverted pixels are either set if they were originally cleared or cleared otherwise.

            Button 1
                This button (usually leftmost on the pointer) is used to set one or more pixels.

            Button 2
                This button (usually in the middle) is used to invert one or more pixels.

            Button 3
                This button (usually on the right) is used to clear one or more pixels.

            Button 4
                This button is used to clear one or more pixels.

            Button 5
                This button is used to clear one or more pixels.

       Every button operation can be changed by means of resources in the .Xdefaults file or application defaults file (/etc/X11/app-defaults/Pixmap).

MENU COMMANDS
       To make defining shapes easier, pixmap provides several commands for drawing and manipulating the pixmap edited, and commands for file management.

       Commands are layed in a vertical bar at the left of the Pixmap widget and in a menu bar at the top of the window. Most of the drawing commands are located in the left bar, where as file management and
       other general commands are located in the top menu bar.

       In  the left bar, some commands are represented by icons. They are, from left to right and up to down, Flip horizontally, Up, Flip vertically, Left, Fold, Right, Rotate right (counterclock), Down, Ro‐
       tate left (clockwise).

       Some commands are also available directly through the keyboard when the mouse cursor is located on the Pixmap widget. They will be mentionned as an accelerator in the following description.

       LEFT BAR COMMANDS

            Undo
                This command is used to undo the last operation. Only one operation can be undone.  The accelerator of this command is Any<Key>u.

            Clear
                This command is used to clear all of the pixels in the pixmap as if Button 3 had been dragged through every pixel in the pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is [Shift]<Key>c.

            Set This command is used to set all of the pixels in the pixmap to the current color, as if Button 1 had been dragged through every pixel in the  pixmap.   The  accelerator  of  this  command  is
                [Shift]<Key>s.

            Redraw
                This command is used to redisplay the pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>l.

            Copy
                This command is used to copy a region of the pixmap from one location to another. When this command is invoked, the region to copy should
                 be  specified  by pressing Button 1, dragging the mouse and releasing Button 1. The region can now be copied by pressing Button 1 with the cursor located on the region selected, dragging the
                mouse and releasing it where the upper left corner of the region should be copied.  If a region was already selected with a Mark command, only the second phase of the copy is necessary.   The
                accelerator  of  this  command  is available when a region has already been selected and is Ctrl<Btn2Down> to drag the region and Ctrl<Btn2Up> to draw it to point. This accelerated command is
                identical to the Paste command available through the Edit menu of the top menu bar.

            Move
                This command is used to move a region of the pixmap from one location to another. When this command is invoked, the region to move should be specified by pressing Button 1, dragging the mouse
                and releasing Button 1. The region can now be moved by pressing Button 1 with the cursor located on the region selected, dragging the mouse and releasing it where the upper left corner of the
                region should be moved. The initial region is cleared.  If a region was already selected with a Mark command, only the second phase of the move is necessary.

            Mark
                This command is used to mark a region to move or copy it later (commands Move and Copy above), or to put it in the Cut&Paste buffer (commands Cut and Copy of the Edit menu  of  the  top  menu
                bar). When this command is invoked, the region should be specified by pressing Button 1, dragging the mouse and releasing Button 1. Once marked, the region is highlighted.  The accelerator of
                this command is Ctrl<Btn1Down> to initiate the selection and Ctrl<Btn1Up> to finish it.

            Unmark
                This command is used to unmark a region previously marked. It will unhighlight the region.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Btn3Down>.

            Flip horizontally
                This command is used to flip horizontally the whole pixmap or the marked region. This means mirroring horizontally the pixmap image. The mirror is placed at the middle of the  pixmap  height.
                The accelerator of this command is [Shift|Ctrl]<Key>h.

            Up  This  command  is  used to move the whole pixmap or the marked region up.  Pixels at the top of the pixmap are pushed back at the bottom of the new pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is
                Any<Key>Up (not available in Motif version).

            Flip vertically
                This command is used to flip vertically the whole pixmap or the marked region. This means mirroring vertically the pixmap image. The mirror is placed at the middle of the pixmap  width.   The
                accelerator of this command is Any<Key>v.

            Left
                This  command is used to move the whole pixmap or the marked region left.  Pixels at the left of the pixmap are pushed back at the right of the new pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is
                Any<Key>Left (not available in Motif version).

            Fold
                This command is used to "Fold" the pixmap. This means splitting the pixmap image in four squares (top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right) and inverting them  (top  becomes  bottom,
                left becomes right, and so on).  "Folding" twice a pixmap does no change.  The accelerator of this command is [Shift|Ctrl]<Key>f.

            Right
                This  command is used to move the whole pixmap or the marked region right. Pixels at the right of the pixmap are pushed back at the left of the new pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is
                Any<Key>Right (not available in Motif version).

            Rotate right
                This command is used to rotate the pixmap image or the marked region right (clockwise) of 90 degrees.  Four Rotate right operations does  no  change.   The  accelerator  of  this  command  is
                [Shift|Ctrl]<Key>r.

            Down
                This  command  is used to move the whole pixmap or the marked region down. Pixels at the bottom of the pixmap are pushed back at the top of the new pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is
                Any<Key>Down (not available in Motif version).

            Rotate left
                This command is used to rotate the pixmap image or the marked region left (counterclock) of 90 degrees. Four Rotate left operations does  no  change.   The  accelerator  of  this  command  is
                [Shift]<Key>l.

            Point
                This  command  is  used  to set, invert or clear a pixel to the current color.  It can be considered as a mode. After selecting it, pixels are set, inverted or cleared depending on the button
                used (see Pixels Editing with the Mouse). If the mouse button remains pressed while dragging the mouse, more than one pixel can be affected.  This command has no accelerator.

            Curve
                This command is used to draw curved lines (set, cleared or inverted).  The curve is drawn while dragging the mouse. This command can be considered as a mode. Quite the same affect can be  ob‐
                tained by dragging the mouse in point mode, the main difference resides in the fact that pixels will be drawn contiguously.  This command has no accelerator.

            Line
                This command is used to draw lines between two points (set, cleared or inverted). The lines are first drawn highlighted while mouse button remains pressed. This command can be considered as a
                mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            Rectangle
                This command is used to draw rectangles between two points defining the two opposite corners of the rectangle (set, cleared or inverted).  The rectangles are  first  drawn  highlighted  while
                mouse button remains pressed. This command can be considered as a mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            Filled Rectangle
                This command is used to draw filled rectangles between two points defining the two opposite corners of the rectangle (set, cleared or inverted).  The rectangles outlines are first drawn high‐
                lighted while mouse button remains pressed. This command can be considered as a mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            Circle
                This command will set, invert or clear the pixels on a circle specified by a center and a point on the curve. Small circles may not look very round because of the size of the pixmap  and  the
                limits of having to work with discrete pixels. This command can be considered as a mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            Filled Circle
                This command will set, invert or clear all of the pixels in a circle specified by a center and a point on the curve. All pixels side and including the circle are set. This command can be con‐
                sidered as a mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            Flood Fill
                This command will set all clear pixels in an enclosed shape. The enclosed shape is determined by all the pixels whose color is different from the color of the pixel  on  which  the  user  has
                clicked.  If the shape is not closed, the entire pixmap will be filled. This command can be considered as a mode.  This command has no accelerator.

            Set Hot Spot
                This command allows the specification of a Hot Spot. The Hot Spot is selected by clicking the Set mouse button. Clicking Invert will invert the Hot Spot, set or reset it depending on its pre‐
                vious state. Hot spot is useful for cursor pixmaps and are used to reference the sensible part of the pixmap.  This command has no accelerator.

            Clear Hot Spot
                This command clears the current Hot Spot.  This command has no accelerator.

            Set Port
                This command allows to create a Port extension line graphically. It is part of the customized Port extension editor developped by Tim Wise (SES Inc.). The Port is set on the pixmap  image  by
                clicking any of the mouse button.  This command has no acelerator.

            Clear Port
                This command allows to remove a Port extension line graphically. It is part of the customized Port extension editor developped by Tim Wise (SES Inc.). The Port onto which any mouse button was
                clicked is cancelled.  This command has no accelerator.

            Move Port
                This command allows to move a Port, that is to change the coordinates specified in the Port extension line. It is part of the customized Port extension editor  developped  by  Tim  Wise  (SES
                Inc.). The Port onto which any mouse button was pressed is moved with the mouse cursor until the mouse button is released.  This command has no accelerator.

            Port Info...
                This  command  allows  to edit the information associated to a Port, that is contained in a Port extension line. It is part of the customized Port extension editor developped by Tim Wise (SES
                Inc.).  The information associated with the Port onto which any mouse button was clicked is displayed in a dialog window. It can be edited in that dialog and saved by clicking the "Okay" but‐
                ton of the dialog.  This command has no accelerator.

       TOP MENU COMMANDS

            Info
                This command pops up an info window.

       File MENU

            Load...
                This command is used to load a pixmap file in the pixmap editor. A dialog window is poped up in which a filename has to be provided. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of
                the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>l.

            Insert...
                This command is used to load a pixmap in the Cut&Paste buffer of the pixmap editor. The contents of the pixmap file can then be pasted on the current pixmap. A dialog window is  poped  up  in
                which a filename has to be provided. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>i.

            Save
                This  command  is  used  to save the current pixmap in the current file edited. By default, and until otherwise changed by a Filename..., Load... or Save As... operation, or by specifying the
                filename on the command line, the filename is scratch. The Filename... command can be used to change this default filename.  The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>s.

            Save As...
                This command is used to save the current pixmap in a particular file which name has to be provided in the dialog window which pops up. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel  button
                of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>a.

            Resize...
                This  command  is  used  to  resize  the  current pixmap to the width and height specified in the dialog window which pops up. The syntax is WIDTHxHEIGHT. This operation is different from the
                Rescale...  one in the way that it just add or remove pixels to the current pixmap without trying to fit the space correctly with the pixmap image. The operation can be interrupted  with  the
                Cancel button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>r.

            Rescale...
                This  command  is  used to rescale the current pixmap image in order to make it fit a larger or smaller space. The new width and height have to be specified in the dialog window which pops up
                with the syntax WIDTHxHEIGHT. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>e.

            Filename...
                This command is used to change the current filename, i.e., the name of the file in which the pixmap will be saved with a Save operation.  The new filename has to be  provided  in  the  dialog
                window which pops up. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>f.

            Hints comment...
                This  command pops up a dialog window in which the user can specify the hints section comment of the pixmap file. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.
                The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>h.

            Colors comment...
                This command pops up a dialog window in which the user can specify the colors section comment of the pixmap file. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.
                The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>c.

            Pixels comment...
                This command pops up a dialog window in which the user can specify the pixels section comment of the pixmap file. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.
                The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>p.

            Quit
                This command causes pixmap to display a dialog box asking whether or not it should save the pixmap (if it has changed) and then exit.  Answering yes is the same as invoking  Save;  no  causes
                pixmap to simply exit; and cancel will abort the Quit command so that more changes may be made.  The accelerator of this command is Alt<Key>q.

       Edit MENU

            Image
                This command pops up a window in which the real size pixmap is shown.  This window can be closed by clicking the mouse in it or by invoking Image once again. When the window is poped up, an X
                mark is displayed in the menu at the left of the Image label.  The accelerator of this command is <Key>i.

            Grid
                This command toggles the display of the grid. When the grid is displayed, an X mark is added at the left of the Grid label.  The accelerator of this command is <Key>g.

            Axes
                This command toggles the display of axes. When axes are displayed, an X mark is added at the left of the Axes label.  The accelerator of this command is <Key>a.

            Proportional
                This command toggles the display in proportional mode of the pixmap.  Proportional mode means that the Pixmap widget won't try to fit all the available space within  the  interface  and  will
                rather  display  each  pixel in a square, probably leaving some space around the pixmap widget. When the proportional mode is active, an X mark is added at the left of the Proportional label.
                The accelerator of this command is <Key>p.

            Zoom
                This command is used to zoom some pixels of the current pixmap. The zooming region has to be selected by the use as a rectangle region just as if he was marking a region (see  Mark  command).
                The operation can be interrupted by invoking any other command. When a region is zoomed, an X mark is added at the left of the Zoom label. Invoking once again the Zoom command zooms out.  The
                accelerator of this command is <Key>z.

            Zoom In
                This command is used to incrementaly zoom into the current pixmap.  This side effect of this is to enlarge the size of a square used to represent a single pixel.  The accelerator of this com‐
                mand is <Key>x.

            Zoom Out
                This  command  is  used  to incrementaly zoom out of the current pixmap.  This side effect of this is to reduce the size of a square used to represent a single pixel.  The accelerator of this
                command is <Key>y.

            Zooming Factor
                The command pops up a dialog window in which the user can edit the current zooming factor.  The zooming factor is the size of a square used to represent a single pixel.  Enlarging the zooming
                factor will zoom into the current pixmap, while reducing it will zoom out of the pixmap.  The accelerator of this command is <Key>f.

            Cut When  a  region is marked, this operation is active. It is used to cut the contents of the region to put it in the Cut&Paste buffer. The Paste command now becomes active and the marked region
                is unmarked. The pixels in the marked region are cleared. This command acts as the Move one when a region is already marked.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>c.

            Copy
                When a region is marked, this operation is active. It is used to copy the contents of the region in the Cut&Paste buffer. The Paste command now becomes active and the  marked  region  is  un‐
                marked. This command acts as the Copy command of the left border when a region is already marked.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>x.

            Paste
                When a region has been cut or copied in the Cut&Paste buffer, this command is active and can be used to paste the contents of the Cut&Paste buffer where the mouse button is clicked. The paste
                operation takes care of the button used to specify the point where to paste the buffer. The button can remain pressed to move the buffer around and then be released to paste the buffer at the
                current  location.  A Copy and Paste operation can be accelerated by Ctrl<Btn2Down> to intiate the operation and Ctrl<Btn2Up> to finish the operation, i.e., paste the buffer.  The accelerator
                of this command is Ctrl<Key>p.

            Crop
                When a region is marked, or a file has been inserted in the Cut&Paste buffer, this command will exchange the current pixmap with the marked region, or the  Cut&Paste  buffer.  Cropping  twice
                does nothing.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>o.

       Foreground Color MENU

            Add color...
                This  command is used to add a new color in the Color Panel (see below). The color name is specified in the dialog window which pops up either by a real color name found in rgb.txt file or by
                a string like #rrggbb where rr, gg and bb represent the red, green and blue components of the color in hexadecimal format. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the  dia‐
                log window.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>a.

            Symbolic name...
                This  command  is used to set the symbolic name of the current color.  The symbolic name is entered in the dialog window which pops up. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button
                of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>s.

            Monochrome name...
                This command is used to set the monochrome name of the current color, i.e., the name of the color to use on monochrome displays. The monochrome name is entered in the dialog window which pops
                up. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>m.

            Grey scale 4 name...
                This  command  is  used  to set the grey scale 4 name of the current color, i.e., the name of the color to use on grey scale 4 displays.  The grey scale 4 name is entered in the dialog window
                which pops up.  The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>4.

            Grey scale name...
                This command is used to set the grey scale name of the current color, i.e., the name of the color to use on grey scale (with more then 4 levels) displays.  The grey scale name is  entered  in
                the dialog window which pops up. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>g.

            Color name...
                This  command  is  used  to  set the color name of the current color. This change will be considered when saving the pixmap but to remain visible, it affects the label of the menu item of the
                color. This is useful to directly change a specific color for another one or to allow multiple symbols to represent the same color (the color can be the same on color display  but  change  on
                grey scale or monochrome ones).  The color name is entered in the dialog window which pops up. The operation can be interrupted with the Cancel button of the dialog window. The None (not case
                sensitive) name is used to change the pixel representing the transparent color.  The accelerator of this command is Ctrl<Key>n.

       Xpm Extensions MENU

            Add Extension...
                This command pops up a dialog window into which the user provides a name for an extension to be added in the current pixmap extensions list. The operation can be interrupted with  the  Cancel
                button  of the dialog window. If the user confirms with the Okay button, another dialog windows pops up where the user can edit the extension contents. When the user clicks on the Cancel but‐
                ton into this extension editing window, the edit operation is interrupted but the extension is added to the extensions list of the current pixmap. If the user wishes to abort the  Add  Exten‐
                sion... operation, he/she needs to click on the Remove button. The edition can otherwise be confirmed by clicking on the Okay button.

            Any extension name
                WHen  an  extension  is  added  in the extensions list of the current pixmap, its name appears in the Xpm Extensions menu. When selected in the menu, the extension edition window pops up. See
                above for its description.

       In addition the Motif version defines the status label as two active buttons which operate as Filename... and Resize... commands.

COLOR PANEL
       Colors in pixmap are presented in the Color Panel. Each loaded color is associated a square button, filled with the color pixel.  Scrollbars around the panel allow to scan the whole panel. To choose a
       color  for  drawing,  the  user  must click on a color button. At this time, the current name of the color is displayed as the title of the Foreground Color menu. A color can also be selected by using
       Shift<BtnDown> on a pixel of the current pixmap which color should be used. This accelerator is very useful when modifying small parts of a pixmap locally.

FILE FORMAT
       The Save or Save As... commands store pixmaps using the format defined by Arnaud Le Hors in his Xpm library (version 3.x).  Each pixmap is a C string array variable  that  can  be  included  and  used
       within programs, or referred to by X Toolkit pixmap resources (assuming that a String to Pixmap converter has been registered on the server). Here is an example of a pixmap file:

                     /* XPM */
                     static char * plaid[] = {
                     /* plaid pixmap
                      * width height ncolors chars_per_pixel */
                     "22 22 4 2 ",
                     /* colors */
                     "   c red         m white  s light_color ",
                     "Y  c yellow      m black  s lines_in_mix ",
                     "+  c yellow      m white  s lines_in_dark ",
                     "x                m black  s dark_color ",
                     /* pixels */
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "  x   x   x   x   x   x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "  x   x   x   x   x   x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "Y Y Y Y Y x Y Y Y Y Y + x + x + x + x + x + ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "  x   x   x   x   x   x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "  x   x   x   x   x   x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "x   x   x x x   x   x x x x x x + x x x x x ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "          x             x   x   Y   x   x   ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "          x             x   x   Y   x   x   ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "          x             x   x   Y   x   x   ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x ",
                     "          x             x   x   Y   x   x   ",
                     "          x           x   x   x Y x   x   x "
                     } ;

       The  plaid  name used to reference the pixmap variable is constructed from the name of the file in which is saved the pixmap.  Any directories are stripped off the front of the name and any suffix be‐
       ginning with a period is stripped off the end.

       The pixmap variable is a string array in which the first string of the array contains the width, height, number of colors and number of characters per pixel.

       The following strings represent the color descriptions, one string per color. A color description can be composed of one or more characters that represent a pixel, and color display name  preceded  by
       the  `c'  character,  and/or  a  symbolic  name preceded by the `s' character, and/or a monochrome display name preceded by the `m' character, and or a grey scale 4 levels display name preceded by the
       string `g4' , and/or a grey scale display name preceded by the aharacter `g', specified in any order.

       Following color description strings, each string represent a line of the pixmap, composed of symbolic characters assigned to colors.

USING PIXMAPS IN PROGRAMS
       The format of pixmap files is designed to make pixmaps easy to use within X programs, whatever your display is.  The following code could be used to create a pixmap to use as a window background,  us‐
       ing the enhanced Xpm library (version 3.3) from Groupe Bull and assuming that the pixmap was stored in a file name plaid.xpm:

               #include "plaid.xpm"

               Pixmap pixmap;

               XpmCreatePixmapFromData (display, drawable, plaid, &pixmap,
                            &pixmap_mask, &attributes);

       Additional routines are available for reading in pixmap files and returning the data in the file in Pixmaps.

WIDGET HIERARCHY
       The  hierarchy of the pixmap editor is discribed here in order to configure the editor by means of X resources in a .Xdefaults file.  The first widget class is the Athena version one, while the second
       one, seperated by a | character, is the Motif version one.

       Lines where only appears one or the other type of a widget (like Dialog| or |CascadeButtonGadget) mean that the widget doesn't exist in one or the other version. In the case of dialogs  in  the  Motif
       version,  the  widgets  are created by means of convenient routines which assign the name of the widget depending on the name of the dialog. By the way, we can't provide with a list of types and names
       for the substructure of dialog widgets in the Motif version. However, these shouldn't be often modified.

X DEFAULTS
       In addition to the standard Athena or Motif widgets resources, pixmap uses the following resources for the Pixmap widget (named pixmap):

       Cursor
           The cursor to use within the Pixmap widget.

       Foreground
           The initial foreground color for drawing.

       Highlight

       Transparent
           The color representing transparent pixels.

       Proportional
           Toggles initial proportional display mode.

       Grid
           Toggles initial grid display.

       GridTolerance
           Determines when to display grid according to SquareSize.

       Stippled
           Suppress stipple drawing of transparent pixels.

       Stipple
           Depth 1 pixmap to use to draw transparent pixels stippled.

       Axes
           Toggles axes display.

       Resize
           Toggles Pixmap widget resize when requesting by window manager.

       Distance
           The margin around Pixmap widget.

       SquareSize
           The size in screen points used to display each pixmap pixels.

       PixmapWidth
           The initial width of the pixmap.

       PixmapHeight
           The initial height of the pixmap.

       Button1Action
           The action associated to mouse button 1 (between Set, Invert and Clear).

       Button2Action
           The action associated to mouse button 2 (between Set, Invert and Clear).

       Button3Action
           The action associated to mouse button 3 (between Set, Invert and Clear).

BUGS
       If you move the pointer too fast while holding a pointer button down, some pixels may be missed.  This is caused by limitations in how frequently the X server can sample the pointer location.

       Loading a pixmap file where the same color is used more than once with different symbols and descriptions, and writing it will loose information concerning the color used more than  once.  The  pixmap
       file plaid given as an example in this man won't be saved that way by pixmap.

       Accelerators to menu operations don't seem to work with Athena version.

       In  the Motif version, the Filename... and Resize...  commands open their respective dialog window in a strange mode. The user has to voluntary (;-) give the focus to the text widget inside to be able
       to change its content.
