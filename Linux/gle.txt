NAME
       gle - Graphics Layout Engine

SYNOPSIS
       gle [options] file.gle ...

DESCRIPTION
       GLE  (Graphics  Layout Engine) is a graphics scripting language designed for creating publication quality graphs, plots, diagrams, figures and slides. GLE supports various graph types (function plots,
       histograms, bar graphs, scatter plots, contour lines, color maps, surface plots, ...) through a simple but flexible set of graphing commands. More complex output can be created  by  relying  on  GLE's
       scripting  language,  which  is full featured with subroutines, variables, and logic control. GLE relies on LaTeX for text output and supports mathematical formulea in graphs and figures. GLE's output
       formats include EPS, PS, PDF, JPEG, and PNG.
