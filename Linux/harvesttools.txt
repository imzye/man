NAME
       harvesttools - archiving and postprocessing for reference-compressed genomic multi-alignments

SYNOPSIS
       harvesttools <options>

DESCRIPTION
       Harvesttools  is  a  utility for creating and interfacing with Gingr files, which are efficient archives that the Harvest Suite uses to store reference-compressed multi-alignments, phylogenetic trees,
       filtered variants and annotations. Though designed for use with Parsnp and Gingr, HarvestTools can also be used for generic conversion between standard bioinformatics file formats.

OPTIONS
       -i <Gingr input>

       -b <bed filter intervals>,<filter name>,"<description>"

       -B <output backbone intervals>

       -f <reference fasta>

       -F <reference fasta out>

       -g <reference genbank>

       -a <MAF alignment input>

       -m <multi-fasta alignment input>

       -M <multi-fasta alignment output (concatenated LCBs)>

       -n <Newick tree input>

       -N <Newick tree output>

       --midpoint-reroot (reroot the tree at its midpoint after loading)

       -o <Gingr output>

       -S <output for multi-fasta SNPs>

       -u 0/1 (update the branch values to reflect genome length)

       -v <VCF input>

       -V <VCF output>

       -x <xmfa alignment file>

       -X <output xmfa alignment file>

       -h (show this help)

       -q (quiet mode)
