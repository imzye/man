NAME
       zfcpdbf - zfcp trace data sort/analyse tool.

SYNOPSIS
       zfcpdbf [OPTIONS] <adapter>
       zfcpdbf {-h|-v}

DESCRIPTION
       zfcpdbf Interprets the information from various logging and tracing sources, e.g. zfcp-, qdio- and cio-trace records and, if available, system messages.

       With  offline  debug  data,  such  as collected by dbginfo.sh or extracted from a Linux system dump with crash version 5.1.0 or later, zfcpdbf can run on any
       platform with a suitable Perl language environment.

       Any zfcpdbf since version 1.13.0 works with debug data from any Linux kernel since version 2.6.38. Recent zfcpdbf versions with older  kernel  versions  show
       zeros  or  empty values for newer trace record fields the old kernel did not yet have. Older zfcpdbf versions with recent kernel versions simply show the old
       trace records fields zfcpdbf already knows about and ignores any newer trace record fields of the kernel.  For full exploitation, it is recommended to always
       use the latest version of zfcpdbf no matter from which kernel version the debug data is.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print usage information, then exit.

       -v, --version
              Print version information, then exit.

       -x <AREA[,AREA]>, --exclude=<AREA[,AREA]>
              list of trace areas to exclude (default none).

       -i <AREA[,AREA]>, --include=<AREA[,AREA]>
              list of trace areas to include (default all).

       -z , --zfcp-only
              zfcp trace areas only (short cut).

       -t <DIFF>, --timediff=<DIFF>
              highlight requests with a round-trip processing time of <DIFF> or more.

       -e, --def-error
              do NOT show deferred error messages.

       -f, --force
              force execution on a detected version mismatch.

       -p <PATH>, --path=<PATH>
              use directory <PATH> for the location of the trace records.

       -r <PATH>, --root=<PATH>
              prepend <ROOT> to standard trace record location.

       -m <ZONE>, --timezone=<ZONE>
              set time zone for system message timestamps.

PARAMETERS
       <AREA> may be REC, HBA, SAN, SCSI, QDIO, QDIO_SETUP, QDIO_ERROR, CIO_TRACE, CIO_MSG, CIO_CRW, KERNEL or MULTIPATH.

       <DIFF> is the value in seconds which has to be lapsed between sending the request and receiving its response.

       <PATH> is specifying the location(directory) of trace records which were pulled from another system, e.g. pulled from a dump.

       <ROOT>  is specifying a directory which has to be prepended to the standard location of the trace records, e.g. typically used in conjunction with the result
       of the dbginfo script.

       <PATH> and <ROOT> are only useful if used on non-live systems and therefore typically used by service- or development-staff.

       <ZONE> is a time zone value in the [+-][h]h[:mm] format.

       <adapter> aka busid is specifying the host adapter of which the trace information should be processed. if a 4-digit value is provided  it  is  automaitically
       extended to the correct format 0f 0.0.xxxx.
