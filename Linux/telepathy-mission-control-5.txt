NAME
       mission-control-5 - Telepathy account manager/chanel dispatcher

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/telepathy/mission-control-5

DESCRIPTION
       Mission Control 5 implements the AccountManager and ChannelDispatcher services described in the Telepathy D-Bus specification, allowing clients like empathy(1) to store account details, connect to
       accounts, request communication channels, and have channels dispatched to them.

       It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and should usually be started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful to start it manually for debugging.

OPTIONS
       There are no command-line options.

ENVIRONMENT
       MC_DEBUG=all or MC_DEBUG=category[,category...]
              May  be  set  to "all" for full debug output from Mission Control and telepathy-glib, or various undocumented category names (which may change from release to release) to filter the output.

       MC_DEBUG=level
              Set a numeric debug level for Mission Control itself (but not telepathy-glib).  Level 0 logs nothing, level 1 logs most messages, and level 2 logs all messages.
