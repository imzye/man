NAME
       xrdfs - xrootd file and directory meta-data utility

SYNOPSIS
       xrdfs [--no-cwd] host[:port] [command [args]]

       command: help, chmod, ls, locate, mkdir, mv, stat, statvfs, query, rm, rmdir,
                  truncate, prepare, cat, tail, spaceinfo

DESCRIPTION
       The xrdfs utility executes meta-data oriented operations (e.g., ls, mv, rm, etc.) on one or more xrootd servers.  Command help is available by invoking xrdfs with no command line options or parameters
       and then typing "help" in response to the input prompt.

OPTIONS
       --no-cwd
          No CWD is being preset in interactive mode.

COMMANDS
       chmod path <user><group><other>
          Modify permissions of the path. Permission string example: rwxr-x--x

       ls [-l] [-u] [-R] [-D] [-Z] [-C] [dirname]
          Get directory listing.
          -l stat every entry and pring long listing
          -u print paths as URLs
          -R list subdirectories recursively
          -D show duplicate entries

          -C checksum every entry

       locate [-n] [-r] [-d] [-m] [-i] [-p] <path>
          Get the locations of the path.
          -r refresh, don't use cached locations
          -n make the server return the response immediately even though it may be incomplete
          -d do a recursive, deep locate in order to find data servers
          -m prefer host names to IP addresses
          -i ignore network dependencies (IPv6/IPv4)
          -p be passive: ignore tried/triedrc cgi opaque info

       mkdir [-p] [-m<user><group><other>] <dirname>
          Creates a directory/tree of directories.
          -p create the entire directory tree recursively
          -m<user><group><other> permissions for newly created directories

          Move path1 to path2 locally on the same server.

       stat <path>
          Get info about the file or directory.
          -q <flags> Makes xrdfs return error code 55 to the shell if the requested flag combination is not present; flags may be combined together using '|' or '&'
