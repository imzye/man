NAME
       asdftool - Manipulate Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF) files

SYNOPSIS
       asdftool [-h] [--verbose] {help,explode,implode,defragment,to_yaml} ...

DESCRIPTION
       ASDF  (Advanced  Scientific Data Format) is a proposed next generation interchange format for scientific data. ASDF aims to exist in the same middle ground that made FITS so successful, by being a
       hybrid text and binary format: containing human editable metadata for interchange, and raw binary data that is fast to load and use. Unlike FITS, the metadata is highly structured and is  designed
       up-front for extensibility.
