  NAME
      casparize - Set up caspar Makefile in a new directory

  SYNOPSIS
      casparize dir (/path/to/config/dir)

      casparize file (/path/to/config/dir/file)

  DESCRIPTION
      casparize  creates  a new configuration working directory in your current working directory, sets up a Makefile for caspar(7) in this new directory, and optionally copies an original configuration file
      from its original system place to the newly created configuration working directory.

  USAGE
      You typically use casparize when you already have created the root configuration working directory with its include directory and install.mk Caspar include file. By analysing your current  working  di‐
      rectory and the configuration directory path you give on the command line, casparize can deduce the contents of the Makefile in the newly created configuration working directory. It creates the new di‐
      rectory, creates the correct Makefile, and optionally copies the given configuration file in the new directory, ready for its first version commit.

  EXAMPLES
      A typical example:

        $ cd <svn>/etc
        $ casparize /etc/postfix/main.cf

      creates the directory <svn>/etc/postfix, creates <svn>/etc/postfix/Makefile including the proper content, and copies /etc/postfix/main.cf into <svn>/etc/postfix/main.cf. You can now  directly  add  and
      commit the new directory.

  BUGS
      Non known at this moment.
