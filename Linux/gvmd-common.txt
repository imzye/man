NAME
       gvm-manage-certs - manage certificate infrastructure for a GVM installation

SYNOPSIS
       gvm-manage-certs [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       gvm-manage-certs manages the certificate infrastructure for a GVM installation.  The certificate infrastructure enables GVM daemons to communicate in a secure manner and is used for authentication
       and authorization before establishing TLS connections between the daemons.

       The  GVM  certificate infrastructure consists of a certificate authority (CA) which is trusted by all GVM daemons.  This CA is then used to sign certificates used by the various daemons.  The cer‐
       tificates can be divided into two use cases:

       •  Server certificates, primarily used for authentication

       •  Client certificates, primarily used for authorization

       gvm-manage-certs can perform an automatic creation of a default certificate infrastructure for a standard GVM installation.  It can also verify an existing infrastructure and perform various  cer‐
       tificate related tasks to support the setup of a more complex infrastructure.

OPTIONS
   Certificate infrastructure management
       -a     Automatically set up default infrastructure for GVM

       -V     Verify existing GVM certificate infrastructure

       -C     Create a certificate authority (CA)

       -R     Create a certificate request for a CA

       -r     Create a certificate request for a CA and sign it

       -C     Create a certificate authority (CA)

       -I     Install a CA certificate

       -c     Create a certificate request and sign it

       -i     Install a certificate

       -S     Sign a certificate request

       -f     Force overwriting of existing files

   Certificate options
       -E     Create a server certificate.  This sets the appropriate key usage constraints for a server certificate.

       -L     Create a client certificate.  This sets the appropriate key usage constraints for a client certificate.

       -A     Skip CA generation in automatic mode.  This automatically (re-)generates server and client certificates, but keeps the CA certificate.

   Configuration
       -e file Read configuration from file (see below for configuration details)

   Output control
       -d     Print debug output

       -v     Print verbose messages

       -q     Be quiet, only print error messages

   Other options
       -h     Print help

EXIT STATUS
       0      The requested operation was successfully performed.

       1      An error occurred, the requested operation could not be performed.

ENVIRONMENT
       All certificate generation options can be set either through the configuration file or through environment variables like the following:

       GVM_CERTIFICATE_LIFETIME
              Days until the certificate will expire

       GVM_CERTIFICATE_HOSTNAME
              Name to use for the certificate

       GVM_CERTIFICATE_SIGNALG
              Hash algorithm to use for signing

       GVM_CERTIFICATE_KEYSIZE
              Size in bits of the generated key

       GVM_CERTIFICATE_SECPARAM
              GnuTLS security level [low|medium|high|ultra]

       GVM_CERT_DIR
              Directory where keys and certificates are stored before installation

       GVM_CERT_PREFIX
              Prefix for certificate filename (e.g. "server")

       For a complete list of options, please refer to the example configuration file included in the documentation.
