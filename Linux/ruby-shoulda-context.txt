NAME
       convert_to_shoulda_syntax - converts a regular Test::Unit Ruby source file into one that uses shoulda syntax.

SYNOPSIS
       convert_to_shoulda_syntax normal_test_file.rb

DESCRIPTION
       converts a unit test file using regular Test::Unit syntax to one using the nicer shoulda syntax, i.e. it will convert an existing test file with names like

              def test_should_do_stuff

              ...

              end

       to one using the new syntax:

              should "be super cool" do

              ...

              end

       A copy of the old file will be left under /tmp/ in case this script just seriously screws up.

SEE ALSO
       /usr/share/doc/libshoulda-ruby/ as installed by the libshoulda-ruby package for documentation of should itself.
