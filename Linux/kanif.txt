NAME
       kanif.conf - configuration file for kanif

SYNOPSIS
       $HOME/.kanif.conf, /etc/kanif.conf or /etc/c3.conf

DESCRIPTION
       kanif.conf is the configuration file for kanif. It is optional and only helps the management of static clusters (configurations that do not change much over time). It mimics the syntax of C3
       configuration file.

       It is composed of a sequence of one or more cluster definitions. Each cluster definition is made of the word "cluster" followed by the cluster name and, enclosed in a pair of curly braces :

       •   the front node specification. This is either:

           •   a simple hostname which can be reached from the inside of the cluster (compute nodes).

           •   two names separated by a colon. The first name is the name used from the outside to log on the front node (not used by kanif). The second is the name used from the cluster compute nodes to
               reach the front node.

           •   an hostname with a colon prepended. This is used for indirect clusters.  These are not supported by kanif at this time.

       •   zero or more compute nodes specifications:

           •   a simple hostname (anything that is not of the following form)

           •   an host set made of a prefix, a range and a suffix.

           •   an  exclude  directive  that  must  follow  an  host set or another exclude directive. This is made of the word "exclude" followed on the same line by either a single number or an interval
               between brackets. This applies to the range of the preceding host set. If the exclusion is an interval, the separator between the word "exclude" and this exclusion is optional.

           •   a dead node. The word "dead" followed by the name of the dead node on the same line.

       Notice that all nodes excluded (using exclude directives or dead nodes) will not take part of the deployment, but are still taken into account in cluster ranges when giving machines specifications
       to kanif (they are kind of placeholders). This is the interest of specifying nodes as dead or excluded rather than dropping them from the definitions.

EXAMPLE
         cluster megacluster {         # The # character introduce comments
               megacluster-dev
               megacluster0[1-9]
               megacluster[10-64]
         }

         cluster supercluster {
               super-ext:super-int
               exclude               # The host "exclude"
               super[01-99]
               exclude 02            # "super02" is excluded
               exclude[90-95]        # "super90" to "super95" are excluded
               dead                  # The host "dead"
               dead othernode        # "othernode" is dead
         }
