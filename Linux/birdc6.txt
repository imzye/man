NAME
       bird - BIRD Internet Routing Daemon
       birdc - BIRD Internet Routing Daemon remote control
       bird6 - BIRD Internet Routing Daemon, IPv6 version
       birdc6 - BIRD Internet Routing Daemon remote control, IPv6 version

SYNOPSIS
       bird [-c config-file] [-d] [-D debug-file] [-p] [-s control-socket]

       birdc [-s control-socket] [-v] [-r]

       bird6 [-c config-file] [-d] [-D debug-file] [-p] [-s control-socket]

       birdc6 [-s control-socket] [-v] [-r]

DESCRIPTION
       bird is an Internet Routing Daemon. That is, it sends and receives messages using different protocols in order to discover and exchange routing information with other routing daemons present on the
       same network. It is able to talk the most widely known routing protocols (such as BGPv4, RIPv2, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3), both on IPv4 and IPv6 and it features a very powerful language for route filtering.

       birdc is a remote control for bird. While bird is running, the system administrator can connect to it using birdc, to inspect its internal status and reconfigure it. The two processes use a Unix
       socket to communicate. Once started, bird will give access to an interactive shell: commands can be completed with TAB and help can be requested by pressing the key `?'. More documentation on the
       available commands can be foung on the website, see below.

       bird6 and birdc6 are the exact equivalent for bird and birdc for the IPv6 world. The accept the same command syntax with the same meaning.

OPTIONS
       The bird and bird6 are able to receive there options:

       -c config-file
           Use given configuration file instead of the default /etc/bird/bird.conf.

       -d
           Enable debug messages and run bird in foreground.

       -D debug-file
           Log debugging information to given file instead of standard error.

       -p
           Just parse the config file and exit. Return value is zero if the config file is valid, nonzero if there are some errors.

       -s control-socket
           Use given filename for a socket for communications with the client (remote control), default is /var/run/bird.ctl.

       The birdc and birdc6 are able to receive there options:

       -s control-socket
           Use given filename for a socket for communications with the server, default is /var/run/bird.ctl.

       -r
           Run birdc in restricted mode: only the `show ...' commands are allowed.

       -v
           Numeric return codes are dumped along with messages, making them easily parsable by a program. See the programmer's documentation for information about their meanings.

FILES
       /etc/bird/bird.conf
           The system-wide configuration file to control the behaviour of bird. See the website for more documentation.

       /etc/bird/bird6.conf
           The system-wide configuration file to control the behaviour of bird6. See the website for more documentation.
