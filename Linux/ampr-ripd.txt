NAME
       ampr-ripd - routing daemon for AMPRNet gateways v2.4.1

SYNOPSIS
       ampr-ripd  [-?|-h] [-d] [-v] [-s] [-r] [-i <interface>] [-a <ip|hostname|subnet>[,<ip|hostname|subnet>...]] [-p <password>] [-m <metric>]  [-w <window>] [-f <interface>] [-e <ip>] [-F <interface>]
       [-E <ip>] [-x <system command>] [-g <gateway>]

DESCRIPTION
       AMPRnet is a RIPv4 Listener and route injector daemon used with AMPRnet gateways.

OPTIONS
       -?, -h Usage info

       -d     Debug mode: no daemonization, verbose output

       -v     More verbose debug output Using this option without debug leaves the console attached

       -s     Save routes to /var/lib/ampr-ripd/encap.txt (encap format), if this file exists, it will be loaded on startup regardless of this option

       -r     Use a raw listening socket for systems with broken multicast support

       -i <interface>
              Tunnel interface to use, defaults to tunl0

       -t <table>
              Routing table to use, defaults to 'main'

       -a     <ip>[,<ip>...]    Comma separated list of IPs, hostnames or ampr subnets to be ignored.  Subnets can be in full network/mask (e.g. 44.182.20.0/24) or encap (e.g. 44.182.20/24)  format,  but
              MUST match an entry in the RIP broadcast If a hostname is used, its IP will be re-resolved 30 sec after every RIP broadcast.  The List contains local interface IPs by default

       -m <metric>
              Metric to be used when setting routes.  This is a numerical value from 0 to 255. Defaults to 0.

       -w <window>
              Sets  the TCP window size to a given value (defaults to 840).  This is needed since IP over AX.25 connections have small TCP window size.  A value of 0 disables setting the window size (not
              recommended, default value should be ok)

       -p <password>
              RIPv2 password, defaults to the current valid password. Use only if the password should ever change

       -f <interface>
              Interface for RIP forwarding, defaults to none/disabled

       -e <ip>
              RIP forward destination IP, defaults to 224.0.0.9 if enabled

       -F <interface>
              Interface for AMPR RIP forwarding, defaults to none/disabled

       -E <ip>
              AMPR RIP forward destination IP, defaults to 224.0.0.9 if enabled

       -x <system command>
              Execute this system command after route set/change. If the command includes white spaces, use quotes.

       -g <gateway>
              Gateway for direct 44net connections. Accepts an gateway IP or an interface name. If not set, it will be auto-detected.

       -L <callsign@locator>
              This parameter will enable the sending of a callsign@locator string (actually any string) to my home gateway (udp:44.182.21.1:59001).  The string will be sent at startup, and then  every  5
              minutes.  On termination, a "shutdown" string will be sent.  On HUP, the string will be sent immediately and the cycle restarted.  The purpose of this option is to allow the construction of
              a dynamic map of all ampr-ripd gateways for visual display.  If the parameter is not set, no data will be sent.

       Observation
              All routes are created with netlink protocol 44 for easy management.

SIGNALS
              - On signal SIG_HUP, ampr-ripd will delete all set routes, but will remain active, so routes will be set again on next received RIPv2 set, and the saved encap file updated.

              - On signal SIG_TERM (exit), ampr-ripd will delete all set routes and exit.

DEBUG
       With the default debug level, using the -d option, the daemon will stay in the foreground and allow you to find the RIPv2 password if needed (see the find_pass.sh shell script). To have full debug
       output, it has to be compiled with -D HAVE_DEBUG or by uncommenting the right DOPT line.

KNOWN ISSUES
       When using other table than 'main', interogating the routes via netlink does not work properly.  This means that on any update, the route is deleted and then recreated, even if it is  already  set
       correctly.  This should be no problem since this happen only at startup on encap loading and on route change.

       For BGP announced 44net endpoints, only a single subnet may be assigned to a given endpoint.
