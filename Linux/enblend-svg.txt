NAME
       enblend-svg - Wrapper around enblend for blending SVG layers

Synopsis
         enblend-svg [options] -o OUTPUT INPUT

DESCRIPTION
       Wrapper around enblend.  Usage is exactly the same as for enblend, except that it takes a single SVG file as input.  The SVG file needs to contain multiple Inkscape layers.  See tif2svg for a tool to
       create such SVG files.

       Requires enblend and ImageMagick linked against librsvg.

       <http://enblend.sourceforge.net/>

       Note that this tool expects that TIFF images are to be preferred to JPEG.  So if JPEG images are referenced in the SVG file and TIFF equivalents exist, then they will be used instead.
