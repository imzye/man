NAME
       Test::XML::Twig - Test XML::Twig handlers

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::XML::Twig tests => 2;
         use My::Twig qw( handler );

         test_twig_handler(
             \&handler,
             '<foo/>', '<bar/>',
             'turns foo to bar',
         );

         test_twig_handlers(
             { twig_handlers => { 'foo' => \&handler } },
             '<foo/>', '<bar/>',
             'turns foo into bar',
         );

DESCRIPTION
       This module is for testing XML::Twig handlers.

FUNCTIONS
       All functions are exported.

       get_twig ( INPUT [, ARGS ] )
           Return a parsed twig of INPUT, or undef on parse failure.  Optionally, ARGS may be supplied as a set of hash-like parameters to be passed into the twig constructor.

       test_twig_handler ( HANDLER, INPUT, EXPECTED, TESTNAME [, COND ] )
           Parse INPUT, using HANDLER as a twig_handler (i.e: it gets called after the parse tree has been built).  Tests that the result is the same as EXPECTED (which can be either a string of XML or a
           quoted regex).  HANDLER must be a code ref.

           Optionally, COND can be supplied.  Instead of the handler being called with the root element of INPUT, COND will be used with first_child() to select an alternative element.

           Returns true / false depending upon test success.

       test_twig_handlers ( ARGS, INPUT, EXPECTED, TESTNAME )
           This  is  similar  to  test_twig_handler(),  but  with  more  flexibility.   The first argument, ARGS, is a hash reference which can be used to specify any of the ordinary parameters to twig's
           constructor.  This lets you test things like start_tag_handlers, as well as multiple twig_handlers together.
