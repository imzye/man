NAME
       zpspell - Interactive spelling checking for Turkish

SYNOPSIS

       zpspell -a

       zpspell word ...

DESCRIPTION
       zpspell is a utility program that connects to the zemberek-server(8) using DBUS library so that it can function as an ispell -a replacement, as an independent spell checker for Turkish.

       zpspell supports interactive and non-interactive modes. Interactive mode provides ispell -a compatible protocol. Non-interactive mode uses its own output format and may be used for command
       line spell checking via pipes.

OPTIONS
       -a
           Run zpspell in ispell -a compatibility mode.

       word ...
           Spell check given words and print the results to stdout. Result line (one per word) contains: the word, semicolon, "correct" or "incorrect" (in Turkish) with suggestions in parentheses
           separated by comas.
