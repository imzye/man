NAME
       slirp-fullbolt - fast slirp for non interactive sessions

SYNOPSIS
       See slirp(1)

DESCRIPTION
       slirp-fullbolt  is  a  slirp  configured  to  write to the tty as fast as it can. It should only be used if you are using load-balancing, slirp does a pretty good job on single modems already, and
       slirp-fullbolt will make interactive sessions less responsive.
