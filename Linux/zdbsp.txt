NAME
       zdbsp - GL Nodes builder for DOOM engines

SYNOPSIS
       zdbsp [options] input.wad ... [-o output.wad]

       zdbsp @argfile.rsp

DESCRIPTION
       ZDBSP  is  a  nodes builder specially designed to be used with OpenGL-based DOOM game engines.  It adheres to the "GL-Friendly Nodes" specification, which means it adds some new special nodes to a
       WAD file that makes it very easy for an OpenGL DOOM engine to compute the polygons needed for drawing the levels.

OPTIONS
       --help Displays a summary of all ZDBSP's command line options, as if you had run ZDBSP without any options.
