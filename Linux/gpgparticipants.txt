NAME
       gpgparticipants - generate paper list for keysigning party

SYNOPSIS
       gpgparticipants [OPTIONS] {input|-} {output|-} datestring organizer title

DESCRIPTION
       gpgparticipants is targeted at organisers of a keysigning party that uses the Zimmermann-Sassaman key-signing protocol.

       It creates a file with all the keys from a list of participators in your keysigning party. You give it a list with key ID's and some general variables, and it will generate a file you can publish. You
       publish this list; participants will download and print this file to take with them to the party.

OPTIONS
       -aHASHES, --algorithm=HASHES

              For each algorithm in HASHES, a comma-separated list of digest algorithms supported by gpg(1), add a placeholder for the digest value (to be filled by the participants) to the output file.  De‐
              fault: SHA256,RIPEMD160.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME         Set the default home directory.

       GNUPGBIN     Set the gpg binary.  Default: "gpg".

       GNUPGHOME    Set the default working directory for gpg.  Default: "~/.gnupg".

EXAMPLES
       To create a KSP file with all keys present in the keyring:

           gpg --with-colons --fingerprint | sed -n "/^pub:/ {n; /^fpr:/p}" | cut -sd: -f10 | \
               gpgparticipants - ksp-file.txt "20080222 1100" "My Name <my.name@my.mail>" "my party 08"
