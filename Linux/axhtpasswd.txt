NAME
       axhtpasswd - Manage user files for basic authentication

SYNOPSIS
       axhttpd username

DESCRIPTION
       axhtpasswd  is  used  to help manually edit .htpasswd files, used by axhttpd This file is formatted as the familiar colon-separated username/encrypted-password pair, records delimited by newlines. The
       program reads the username from command line and the password from input, outputs the username/encrypted-password pair then exits.

       The encryption of this password uses a proprietary algorithm due to the dependency of many crypt libraries on DES, so the generated .htpasswd is not portable among other HTTPDs.

OPTIONS
       This program does not accept any other command line options.
