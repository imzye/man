DMASCC_CFG(1)              Linux Programmer's Manual             DMASCC_CFG(1)

NAME
       dmascc_cfg - Configure dmascc devices

SYNOPSIS
       dmascc <interface> [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
       dmascc_cfg  is  used  to configure dmascc devices such as PI2 and Pack‐
       eTwin cards.  The --show option can be used by any user, all other  op‐
       tions must be used by root.

OPTIONS
       --speed frequency
                 Set frequency of baud rate generator to frequency. A value of
                 0 disables the baud rate generator and the digital  PLL.  Use
                 the --show option to check whether the frequency you selected
                 could be approximated with sufficient accuracy.

       --nrzi [0|1]
                 0 selects NRZ mode, 1 selects NRZI mode.

       --clocks integer
                 Set the clock mode. You may OR together three choices  (other
                 values are not supported and may cause strange results).

       TX clock pin:

              0x00 input
              0x05 output TX clock *
              0x06 output baud rate generator *
              0x07 output digital PLL *

       TX clock source:

              0x00 RX clock pin
              0x08 TX clock pin #
              0x10 baud rate generator
              0x18 digital PLL +

       RX clock source:

              0x00 RX clock pin
              0x20 TX clock pin
              0x40 baud rate generator
              0x60 digital PLL +

       * Not allowed on PI2 Port A if J3 is installed.

       # TX clock pin must be configured as input.

       + Speed must be equal to 32 times the baud rate.

       --txdelay milliseconds
                 Set transmit delay to milliseconds. Maximum is 2500 ms.

       --txtime seconds
                 Set maximum time the transmitter may be active to seconds.

       --sqdelay milliseconds
                 Set  the squelch delay to milliseconds. Maximum delay is 2500
                 ms.

       --slottime milliseconds
                 Set the slot time to milliseconds. Maximum slottime  is  2500
                 ms.

       --waittime milliseconds
                 Set  the  minimum time between the transmitter turning off to
                 when it turns on to milliseconds. Maximum wait time  is  2500
                 ms.

       --persist f
                 Set the persistance parameter to f. Must be between 0 and 255
                 (inclusive).

       --dma channel
                 Set the DMA channel to channel. Can be 1 or 3.  Setting to  0
                 disables DMA.

BUGS
       dmascc_cfg  does  not  check the parameters for validity. The driver or
       kernel may crash if you specify invalid values.
