NAME
       SCAP Security Guide - Delivers security guidance, baselines, and associated validation mechanisms utilizing the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).

DESCRIPTION
       The  project  provides  practical  security hardening advice and also links it to compliance requirements in order to ease deployment activities, such as certification and accreditation. These include
       requirements in the U.S. government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence Community) as well as of the financial services and health care industries. For example, high-level and widely-accepted policies
       such as NIST 800-53 provides prose stating that System Administrators must audit "privileged user actions," but do not define what "privileged actions" are. The SSG bridges the gap between generalized
       policy requirements and specific implementation guidance, in SCAP formats to support automation whenever possible.

              Java applications and applets. Certain default settings within the JRE pose a security risk so it is necessary to deploy system wide properties to ensure a higher degree of security  when  uti‐
              lizing the JRE.

       Unclassified Information in Non-federal Information Systems and Organizations (NIST 800-171)

              Profile ID:  xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cui

              From NIST 800-171, Section 2.2: Security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal information systems and organizations have a well-defined structure  that  consists
              of:

              (i) a basic security requirements section; (ii) a derived security requirements section.

              The  basic security requirements are obtained from FIPS Publication 200, which provides the high-level and fundamental security requirements for federal information and information systems. The
              derived security requirements, which supplement the basic security requirements, are taken from the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53.

              This profile configures Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to the NIST Special Publication 800-53 controls identified for securing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)."

       Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

              Profile ID:  xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_hipaa

              The HIPAA Security Rule establishes U.S. national standards to protect individuals’ electronic personal health information that is created, received, used, or maintained by  a  covered  entity.
              The Security Rule requires appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health information.

              This  profile  configures  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to the HIPAA Security Rule identified for securing of electronic protected health information.  Use of this profile in no way guarantees or
              makes claims against legal compliance against the HIPAA Security Rule(s).

              Warning: The installation and use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) increases your attack vector and decreases your overall security posture. If  your  Information  Systems  Security  Officer
              (ISSO) lacks a documented operational requirement for a graphical user interface, please consider using the standard DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 profile.

DEPLOYMENT TO U.S. CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS
       SCAP  Security Guide content is considered vendor (Red Hat) provided content.  Per guidance from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Government programs are allowed to
       use Vendor produced SCAP content in absence of "Governmental Authority" checklists. The specific NIST verbage: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/ncp/repository/glossary?cid=1#Authority

DEPLOYMENT TO U.S. MILITARY SYSTEMS
       DoD Directive (DoDD) 8500.1 requires that "all IA and IA-enabled IT products incorporated into DoD information systems shall be configured in accordance with DoD-approved security configuration guide‐
       lines" and tasks Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to "develop and provide security configuration guidance for IA and IA-enabled IT products in coordination with Director, NSA."  The output of
       this authority is the DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides, or STIGs. DISA FSO is in the process of moving the STIGs towards the use of the NIST Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) in
       order to "automate" compliance reporting of the STIGs.

       Through  a  common,  shared  vision, the SCAP Security Guide community enjoys close collaboration directly with NSA, NIST, and DISA FSO. As stated in Section 1.1 of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG
       Overview, Version 1, Release 2, issued on 03-JUNE-2013:

       "The consensus content was developed using an open-source project called SCAP Security Guide. The project's website is https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide.  Except for dif‐
       ferences  in  formatting  to accomodate the DISA STIG publishing process, the content of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG should mirror the SCAP Security Guide content with only minor divergence as
       updates from multiple sources work through the consensus process."

       The DoD STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, revision V2R4, was released in July 2019 Currently, the DoD Red Hat Enterprise  Linux  7  STIG  contains  only  XCCDF  content  and  is  available  online:
       https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=operating-systems%2Cunix-linux

       Content  published  against the public.cyber.mil website is authoritative STIG content. The SCAP Security Guide project, as noted in the STIG overview, is considered upstream content. Unlike DISA FSO,
       the SCAP Security Guide project does publish OVAL automation content. Individual programs and C&A evaluators make program-level determinations on the direct usage of the  SCAP  Security  Guide.   Cur‐
       rently there is no blanket approval.
