NAME
       HTML::FormatText::Zen - format HTML as plain text using zen

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::FormatText::Zen;
        $text = HTML::FormatText::Zen->format_file ($filename);
        $text = HTML::FormatText::Zen->format_string ($html_string);

        $formatter = HTML::FormatText::Zen->new;
        $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder->new_from_file ($filename);
        $text = $formatter->format ($tree);

DESCRIPTION
       "HTML::FormatText::Zen" turns HTML into plain text using the "zen" program.

           <http://www.nocrew.org/software/zen/>

       The module interface is compatible with formatters like "HTML::FormatText", but all parsing etc is done by zen.

       See "HTML::FormatExternal" for the formatting functions.  The margins options work but nothing else.

       "rightmargin"
           As of zen version 0.2.3 there is no right margin option.

       "input_charset", "output_charset"
           As of zen version 0.2.3 the input charset is always latin-1 and output is always latin-1.  Entities in the input seem to be truncated to 8-bits for the output.
