NAME
       upmendex - Multilingual index processor

SYNOPSIS
       upmendex [-ilqrcgf] [-s sty] [-d dic] [-o ind] [-t log] [-p no] [--] [ idx0 idx1 idx2 ...]
       upmendex --help

DESCRIPTION
       The  program upmendex is a general purpose multilingual hierarchical index generator working with upLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX; it accepts one or more input files (.idx; often produced by a text for‐
       matter such as LaTeX families), sorts the entries, and produces an output file which can be formatted.  It supports Latin (including non-English), Greek, Cyrillic, Korean Hangul and Han  (Hanzi  ideo‐
       graphs) scripts, as well as Japanese Kana.  It is almost compatible with makeindex and mendex, and additional feature for handling readings of kanji words is also available.
       The formats of the input and output files are specified in a style file.  The readings of kanji words can be specified in a dictionary file.
       The index can have up to three levels (0, 1, and 2) of subitem nesting.

OPTIONS
       -i        Take input from stdin, even when index files are specified.

       -l        Set ´sort by character order´. By default, ´sort by word order´ is used.  Details are described below.

       -q        Quiet mode; send no message to stderr, except error messages and warnings.

       -r        Disable implicit page range formation. By default, three or more successive pages are automatically abbreviated as a range (e.g. 1–5).

       -c        Compress sequence of intermediate blanks (space(s) and/or tab(s)) into a space and ignore leading and trailing blank(s).  By default, blanks in the index key are retained.

       -g        Make Japanese index head A-line (A, Ka, Sa, ...) of the gojuon table (Japanese syllabary). By default, all the characters in the gojuon table are used.

       -f        Force to output characters even if the scripts are not supported by upmendex.

       -s sty    Employ sty as the style file.

       -d dic    Employ dic as the dictionary file. The dictionary file is composed of lists of <index_word reading>.

       -o ind    Employ ind as the output index file. By default, the file name is created by appending the extension ind to the base name of the first input file.

       -t log    Employ log as the transcript file. By default, the file name is created by appending the extension ilg to the base name of the first input file.

       -p no     Set  the  starting page number of the output index list to be no. The argument no may be numerical or one of the following: any (the next page to the end of contents), odd (the next odd page
                 to the end of contents), even (the next even page to the end of contents).

       --help    Show summary of options.

       --        Arguments after -- are not taken as options.

STYLE FILE
       The style file informs upmendex about the format of the idx input files and the intended format of the final output file. The format is upper compatible with the one for  makeindex  and  mendex.   The
       style  file  contains  a list of <specifier attribute> pairs.  There are two types of specifiers: input and output.  Pairs do not have to appear in any particular order.  A line begun by ´%´ is a com‐
       ment.

ABOUT JAPANESE PROCESSING
       upmendex has an additional feature to simplify the procedure of handling Japanese indexes, compared to makeindex. Users can save the effort of manually specifying a reading for every kanji word.
       Japanese kanji words are usually sorted by the syllables of their readings (´Yomi´), which can be represented by kana (Hiragana, Katakana) scripts.  upmendex accepts index words specified in kana  ex‐
       pression directly on an input file, and also accepts conversion from index words to kana scripts by referring to Japanese dictionaries.

       Examples of internal simplification of syllables are shown below.

              かぶしきがいしゃ         かふしきかいしや
              マッキントッシュ         まつきんとつしゆ
              ワープロ            わあふろ

       The  dictionary file consists of list with <´index_word´ ´reading´>.  The index word can be written in any scripts (kanji, kana, etc), and the reading must be in Hiragana or Katakana scripts.  The de‐
       limiter between the index word and its reading is one or more tab(s) or space(s).
       An example of a Japanese dictionary is shown below.

              漢字      かんじ
              読み      よみ
              環境      かんきょう
              α         アルファ

       Here, each index word is allowed to have only one Yomi.  Though some kanji words (ex. 「表」) may have more than one Yomi´s (ex. 「ひょう」 and 「おもて」), only one of them can be registered  in  the
       dictionary.  When some different Yomi´s are needed, they should be specified explicitly in kana expression (ex. \index{ひょう@表} or \index{おもて@表}) on the input file.
       Moreover,  a  dictionary file is automatically referred by setting the file name at an environment variable INDEXDEFAULTDICTIONARY.  The dictionary set by the environment variable can be used together
       with file(s) specified by -d option.

ABOUT SORTING PROCEDURE
       upmendex sorts indexes as is (´sort by word order´) by default.  Setting -l option, spaces between words in an index are truncated prior to sorting procedure (´sort by character order´).
       Even when sort by character order, the index at output remains the original sequence without the truncation.
       Follows show an example.

              sort by word order       sort by character order
              X Window            Xlib
              Xlib                XView
              XView                    X Window

       In addition, two sorting methods can be applied for indexes which contains both Japanese kana and other scripts (e.g. Latin script).  By setting priority 0 (default) and 1 at a style file, a space be‐
       tween Japanese Kana and other scripts is inserted and not inserted respectively, prior to the sorting procedure.
       Follows show an example.

              priority=0               priority=1
              index sort               indファイル
              indファイル              index sort

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       upmendex refers environment variables as follows.

       INDEXSTYLE
                 Directory where index style files exist.

       INDEXDEFAULTSTYLE
                 Index style file to be referred to as default.

       INDEXDICTIONARY
                 Directory where dictionary files exist.

       INDEXDEFAULTDICTIONARY
                 Dictionary file which is automatically read.

DETAIL
       Detailed specification is compatible with makeindex.

KNOWN ISSUES
       When plural page number expression is used, .idx files should be specified along with the order of page numbers. Otherwise, wrong page numbers might be output.
