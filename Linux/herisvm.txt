NAME
       heri-eval - evaluate classification algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       heri-eval [OPTIONS] dataset [-- SVM_TRAIN_OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       heri-eval runs training algorithm on dataset and then evaluate it using testing set, specified by option -e.  If option -n was applied, cross-validation is used for evaluation, training and
       testing on different folds are run in parallel, thus utilizing available CPUs. If -r is used, the dataset is splitted into training and testing datasets randomly with the specified ratio, and then
       holdout is run.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
             Display help information.

       -f    Enable output of per-fold statistics. See -Mf.

       -n N  Enable T*N-fold cross-validation mode and set the number of folds to N.

       -r ratio
             Split the dataset into training and testing parts with the specified ratio of their sizes (in percents).

       -t T  Enable T*N-fold cross-validation mode and set the number of runs to T which 1 by default.

       -e testing_dataset
             Enable hold-out mode and set the testing dataset.

       -T threshold
             Set the minimum threshold for making a classification decision. If this flag is applied, micro-average precision, recall, and F1 are calculated instead of accuracy.

       -o filename
             Save predictions from testing sets to the specified file.

             Format: outcome_class prediction_class [score]

       -O filename
             Save incorrectly classified objects to the specified file.

             Format: #object_number: outcome_class prediction_class [score])

       -m filename
             Save confusion matrix to the specified file.

             Format: frequency : outcome_class prediction_class

       -p opts
             Pass the specified opts to heri-stat(1).

       -s opts
             Pass the specified opts to heri-split(1).

       -M chars
             Sets the output mode where chars are: t -- output total statistics, f -- output per-fold statistics, c -- output cross-fold statistics.  The default is "-M tc".

       -S seed
             Pass the specified seed to heri-split(1).

       -K    Keep temporary directory after exiting.

       -D    Turn on the debugging mode, implies -K.

EXAMPLES
        heri-eval -e testing_set.libsvm training_set.libsvm -- -s 0 -t 0
