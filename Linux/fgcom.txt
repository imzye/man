NAME
       fgcom - VoIP client for the FlightGear radio infrastructure

SYNOPSIS
       fgcom  [--server=server]  [--host=listeninghost] [--port=port] [--call‐
       sign=callsign]   [--frequency=frequency]   [--atis=frequency]   [--air‐
       port=code]   [--username=user]   [--password=pass]   [--silence-thresh‐
       old=threshold] [--debug] [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       fgcom is the FlightGear utility  used  for  connecting  to  multiplayer
       voice servers.

       It  is  usually not necessary to run fgcom from the command line, as it
       is already integrated into FlightGear, with the exception of a few spe‐
       cific  cases  (such  as  recording  ATIS messages or performing a radio
       check, see the EXAMPLE section).

OPTIONS
       --server=server
              Connect to the FGCom server server. By default, FGCom  tries  to
              connect to fgcom.flightgear.org.

       --host=listeninghost, --port=port
              Listen  on  the  network interface having the IP address listen‐
              inghost, on port port. By default, FGCom listens on the loopback
              interface (127.0.0.1) on port 16661.

              The  specified  port can be used by an instance of FlightGear to
              communicate with FGCom and update the  pilot  position  as  they
              fly.

       --callsign=callsign
              Use  the callsign callsign during the session. By default, FGCom
              uses guest as callsign.

       --frequency=frequency
              Set the active radio frequency to frequency. The frequency  must
              be written in the format xxx.xxx and must be given in MHz.

       --atis=frequency
              Record  an  ATIS message on frequency MHz. The frequency must be
              written in the format xxx.xxx and must be given in MHz.

       --airport=code
              Position the pilot/controller to the  airport  having  the  ICAO
              code code.

              Since  some  radio frequencies might be reused across the world,
              it is essential to set the pilot/controller  position  correctly
              to  make  the  FGCom  server able to determine the correct voice
              channel. Always use this  flag  if  you  are  not  connecting  a
              FlightGear instance to FGCom.

       --username=user, --password=pass
              Log in to the FGCom server using the username user and the pass‐
              word pass.

       --silence-threshold=threshold
              Set the silence threshold to threshold dB. The value must be be‐
              tween -60 and 0. The default is -35.0 dB.

              The  silence  threshold  is the level below which the sound cap‐
              tured by the microphone is  considered  background  noise  (and,
              thus,  filtered out by FGCom).  Setting the silence threshold to
              -60 turns the filter off; setting it  to  0  filters  everything
              (mutes the microphone).

       --debug
              Enable debug output for troubleshooting purposes.

       --help Display usage information and exit.

       --version
              Display the FGCom version and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       fgcom exits with EXIT_SUCCESS on success, with EXIT_FAILURE if the syn‐
       tax of the command-line arguments is wrong or an error occurs.

NOTES
       FGCom understands several special frequencies used for testing purposes
       or general chatting:

       •  121.000 MHz, 121.500 MHz: "guard" frequencies reserved for emergency
          communications;

       •  123.450 MHz, 123.500 MHz, 122.750 MHz: general chat frequencies;

       •  700.000 MHz: radio station frequency. Depending on the FGCom  server
          in use, a recorded radio message will be played;

       •  723.340 MHz: French Air Patrol communication frequency;

       •  910.000 MHz: echo test frequency. Your voice will be echoed back af‐
          ter a short delay, to allow  you  to  check  that  your  microphone,
          speakers/headset and that your connection to the FGCom server works.
          The test is limited to a maximum of 65 seconds, after which you will
          be automatically disconnected;

       •  911.000 MHz: "music on hold". The frequency continuously plays back‐
          ground music, allowing you to check that your connection to the  FG‐
          Com server works.

BUGS
       •  At the time of writing, there is no mechanism in place to update the
          frequencies used by FGCom with the ones  used  in  the  real  world,
          should  those  change. The former, thus, might not always correspond
          to the latter. Always use the frequencies listed in FlightGear under
          AI  ->  ATC Services in Range instead of the ones published on aero‐
          nautical charts.

EXAMPLE
       Connect to the default FGCom server, switch to the San Francisco Inter‐
       national  Airport  (KSFO)  ground  frequency  (121.800  MHz)  and allow
       FlightGear to update the current pilot position by sending it  to  port
       16661 (the default one):

           $ fgcom --frequency=121.800 --airport=KSFO

       Perform a radio check by connecting to the echo test frequency:

           $ fgcom --frequency=910.000

       Record  an  ATIS  message  on  the  San Francisco International Airport
       (KSFO) ATIS frequency (118.850 MHz):

           $ fgcom --atis=118.850 --airport=KSFO
