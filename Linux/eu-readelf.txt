DESCRIPTION
       eu-readelf displays information about one or more ELF format object files.  The options control what particular information to display.

       elffile... are the object files to be examined.  32-bit and 64-bit ELF files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.

       This program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the BFD library, so if there is a bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.

OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.  At least one option in addition to -v or -H must be given.

   ELF Input Selection
       --dwarf-skeleton <file>
           Used with -w to find the skeleton Compile Units in FILE associated with the Split Compile units in a .dwo input file.

       --elf-section [section]
           Use the named SECTION (default .gnu_debugdata) as (compressed) ELF input data

   ELF Output Selection
       -a
       --all
           Equivalent to specifying --file-header, --program-headers, --sections, --symbols, --relocs, --dynamic, --notes, --version-info, --arch-specific, --section-groups and --histogram.

       -h
       --file-header
           Displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of the file.

       -l
       --program-headers
       --segments
           Displays the information contained in the file's segment headers, if it has any.

       -S
       --sections
       --section-headers
           Displays the information contained in the file's section headers, if it has any.

       -g
       --section-groups
           Displays the information contained in the file's section groups, if it has any.

       -I
       --histogram
           Display a histogram of bucket list lengths when displaying the contents of the symbol tables.

       -s
       --symbols [section name]
           Displays the entries in symbol table section of the file, if it has one.  If a symbol has version information associated with it then this is displayed as well.  The version string is displayed as
           a suffix to the symbol name, preceded by an @ character.  For example foo@VER_1.  If the version is the default version to be used when resolving unversioned references to the symbol then it is
           displayed as a suffix preceded by two @ characters.  For example foo@@VER_2.

       --dyn-syms
           Display (only) the dynamic symbol table.

       -e
       --exception
           Display sections for exception handling.

       -n
       --notes [section name]
           Displays the contents of the NOTE segments and/or sections, if any.

       -r
       --relocs
           Displays the contents of the file's relocation section, if it has one.

       -d
       --dynamic
           Displays the contents of the file's dynamic section, if it has one.

       -V
       --version-info
           Displays the contents of the version sections in the file, it they exist.

       -A
       --arch-specific
           Displays architecture-specific information in the file, if there is any.

   Additional output selection
       -x <name>
       --hex-dump=<name>
           Displays the contents of the indicated section name as a hexadecimal bytes.

       -w
       --debug-dump[=decodedline,=info,=info+,=abbrev,=pubnames,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=str,=loc,=ranges,=gdb_index,=addr]
           Displays the contents of the DWARF debug sections in the file, if any are present.  Compressed debug sections are automatically decompressed (temporarily) before they are displayed.  If one or
           more of the optional letters or words follows the switch then only those type(s) of data will be dumped.  The letters and words refer to the following information:
           "=abbrev"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_abbrev section.
           "=addr"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_addr section.
           "=frames"
               Display the raw contents of a .debug_frame section.
           "=gdb_index"
               Displays the contents of the .gdb_index and/or .debug_names sections.
           "=info"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_info section.
           "=info+"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_info section, plus any skeleton unit will be immediately followed by the corresponding split compile unit (from the .dwo file).  To show the difference
               between "regular" CUs and split CUs print offsets and references between { and } instead of [ and ].
           "=decodedline"
               Displays the interpreted contents of the .debug_line section.
           "=macro"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_macro and/or .debug_macinfo sections.
           "=loc"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_loc and/or .debug_loclists sections.
           "=pubnames"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_pubnames and/or .debug_gnu_pubnames sections.
           "=aranges"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_aranges section.
           "=ranges"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_ranges and/or .debug_rnglists sections.
           "=str"
               Displays the contents of the .debug_str, .debug_line_str and/or .debug_str_offsets sections.

               Note: displaying the contents of .debug_static_funcs, .debug_static_vars and debug_weaknames sections is not currently supported.
           -p <number or name>
           --string-dump=<number or name>
               Displays the contents of the indicated section as printable strings.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the section table; any other string identifies all sections with that
               name in the object file.

           -c
           --archive-index
               Displays the file symbol index information contained in the header part of binary archives.  Performs the same function as the t command to ar, but without using the BFD library.

   Output control
       -z
       --decompress
           Requests that the section(s) being dumped by x, R or p options are decompressed before being displayed.  If the section(s) are not compressed then they are displayed as is.

       -v
       --version
           Display the version number of eu-readelf.

       -W
       --wide
           Ignored for compatibility (lines always wide).

       -H
       --help
           Display the command line options understood by eu-readelf.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally,
           and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
