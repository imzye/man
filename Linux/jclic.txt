       JClic  is  formed by a set of computer applications that are used for carrying out different types of educational activities: puzzles, associations, text exercises, crosswords...  These activities
       are  packed in projects. A project is formed by a set of activities and one or more sequences, which indicate the order in which they have to be shown.  If  you  want  to  check  about  how  JClic
       projects are, you should take a look at:
