NAME
       munin-plugins-c - a single binary implementing a number of basic Munin plugins

DESCRIPTION
       A Munin node runs plugins to gather statistics about the system.  Most of the plugins were originally written in Perl or Shell for simplicity.  The munin-plugins-c binary implements a number of
       the plugins as a single binary.  It was written for reduced footprint in terms of system resources.  Similar to the busybox utility, it evaluates the name it is called as.

USAGE
       Discovering available plugins:

        /usr/libexec/munin-c/munin-plugins-c listplugins

       Enabling the cpu plugin:

        ln -s /usr/libexec/munin-c/munin-plugins-c /etc/plugins/cpu
