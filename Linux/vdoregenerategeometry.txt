NAME
       vdoregenerategeometry - regenerate a VDO whose first few blocks have been wiped

SYNOPSIS
       vdoregenerategeometry [options...]  filename

DESCRIPTION
       vdoregenerategeometry  will  attempt  to  regenerate  the geometry block of a VDO device in the event that the beginning of the backing store was wiped. This tool will fail if enough of the device was
       wiped that the VDO super block was also erased, or if there are multiple valid super block candidates on the volume.

       If the super block location is known, or to select one of the candidate super blocks in the event that multiple candidates were found, the --offset option can be  used  to  specify  the  location  (in
       bytes) of the super block on the backing store.

OPTIONS
       --help Print this help message and exit.

       --offset
              Specify the location (in bytes) of the super block.

       --version
              Show the version of vdoregenerategeometry.
