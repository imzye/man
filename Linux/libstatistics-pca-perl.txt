DESCRIPTION
       Principal component analysis (PCA) transforms higher-dimensional data consisting of a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables termed principal
       components (PCs). The higher the ranking of the PCs the greater the amount of variability that the PC accounts for. This PCA procedure involves the calculation of the eigenvalue decomposition
       using either the Math::Cephes::Matrix or Math::MatrixReal modules (see METHODS) from a data covariance matrix after mean centering the data. See
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis for more details.

METHODS
   new
       Create a new Statistics::PCA object.

           my $pca = Statistics::PCA->new;

   load_data
       Used for loading data into object. Data is fed as a reference to a LoL within an anonymous hash using the named argument 'data'. Data may be entered in one of two forms specified by the obligatory
       named argument 'format'.  Data may either be entered in standard 'table' fashion (with rows corresponding to observations and columns corresponding to variables). Thus to enter the following table
       of data:

                   Var1    Var2    Var3    Var4

           Obs1    32      26      51      12
           Obs2    17      13      34      35
           Obs3    10      94      83      45
           Obs4    3       72      72      67
           Obs5    10      63      35      34 ...

       The data is passed as an LoL with the with each nested ARRAY reference corresponding to a row of observations in the data table and the 'format' argument value 'table' as follows:

           #                       Var1    Var2    Var3    Var4 ...
           my $data  =   [
                           [qw/    32      26      51      12    /],     # Obs1
                           [qw/    17      13      34      35    /],     # Obs2
                           [qw/    10      94      83      45    /],     # Obs3
                           [qw/    3       72      72      67    /],     # Obs4
                           [qw/    10      63      35      34    /],     # Obs5 ...
                       ];

           $pca->load_data ( { format => 'table', data => $data, } );

       Alternatively you may enter the data in a variable-centric fashion where each nested ARRAY reference corresponds to a single variable within the data (i.e. the transpose of the above table-
       fashion). To pass the above data in this fashion use the 'format' argument with value 'variable' as follows:

           #                           Obs1    Obs2    Obs3    Obs4    Obs5 ...
           my $transpose = [
                               [qw/    32      17      10      3       10    /],   # Var1
                               [qw/    26      13      94      72      63    /],   # Var2
                               [qw/    51      34      83      72      35    /],   # Var3
                               [qw/    12      35      45      67      34    /],   # Var4 ...
                           ];

           $pca->load_data ( { format => 'variable', data => $transpose, } ) ;

   pca
       To perform the PCA analysis. This method takes the optional named argument 'eigen' that takes the values 'M' or 'C' to calculate the eigenvalue decomposition using either the Math::MatrixReal or
       Math::Cephes::Matrix modules respectively (defaults to 'M' without argument).

           $pca->pca();
           $pca->pca( { eigen => 'M' } );
           $pca->pca( { eigen => 'C' } );

   results
       Used to access the results of the PCA analysis. This method is context-dependent and will return a variety of different values depending on whether it is called in VOID or LIST context and the
       arguments its passed.  In VOID-context it prints a formatted table of the computed results to STDOUT.

           $pca->results;

       In LIST context this method takes an obligatory argument that determines its return values. To return an ordered list (ordered by PC ranking) of the proportions of total variance of each PC pass
       'proportion' to the method.

           my @list = $pca->results('proportion');
           print qq{\nOrdered list of individual proportions of variance: @list};

       To return an ordered list of the cumulative variance of the PCs pass argument 'cumulative'.

           @list = $pca->results('cumulative');
           print qq{\nOrdered list of cumulative variance of the PCs: @list};

       To return an ordered list of the individual standard deviations of the PCs pass argument 'stdev'.

           @list = $pca->results('stdev');
           print qq{\nOrdered list of individual standard deviations of the PCs: @list};

       To return an ordered list of the individual eigenvalues of the PCs pass argument 'eigenvalue'.

           @list = $pca->results('eigenvalue');
           print qq{\nOrdered list of individual eigenvalues of the PCs: @list};

       To return an ordered list of ARRAY references containing the eigenvectors of the PCs pass argument 'eigenvector'.

           # Returns an ordered list of array references containing the eigenvectors for the components
           @list = $pca->results('eigenvector');
           use Data::Dumper;
           print Dumper \@list;

       To return an ordered list of ARRAY references containing more detailed information about each PC use the 'full' argument. Each nested ARRAY reference consists of an ordered list of: PC rank, PC
       stdev, PC proportion of variance, PC cumulative_variance, PC eigenvalue and a further nested ARRAY reference containing the PC eigenvector.

           @list = $pca->results('full');
           for my $i (@list) {
               print qq{\nPC rank: $i->[0]}
                     . qq{\nPC stdev $i->[1]}
                     . qq{\nPC proportion of variance $i->[2]}
                     . qq{\nPC cumulative variance $i->[3]}
                     . qq{\nPC eigenvalue $i->[4]}
               }

       To return an ordered LoL of the transformed data for each of the PCs pass 'transformed' to the method.

           @list = $pca->results('transformed');
           print qq{\nThe transformed data for 'the' principal component (first PC): @{$list[0]} };
