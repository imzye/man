NAME
       gabedit - graphical user interface (GUI) to computational chemistry packages

SYNOPSIS
       gabedit [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       gabedit is a graphical user interface (GUI) to computational chemistry (Ab Initio) packages like: GAMESS-US, Gaussian, Molcas, Molpro, MPQC, Q-Chem, that can help to generate keywords and op‐
       tions, molecule specifications and the input sections for even the most advanced calculation types.

       Included  is an advanced “Molecule Builder” to rapidly sketch in molecules and examine them in three dimensions. It can further display a variety calculation results (molecular orbitals; sur‐
       faces from the electron density, electrostatic potential, NMR shielding density; IR and Raman computed spectra; ...). Most major molecular file formats are supported.

       Exporting of a variety of file formats, like Poyray, BMP, JPEG, PNG, PPM and PS, is available. Even a series of pictures for animation (vibration, geometry  convergence,  rotation,  contours,
       planes color-coded) can be automatically generated.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options to use.
