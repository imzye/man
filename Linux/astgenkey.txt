ASTGENKEY(8)                                                                               Linux Programmer's Manual                                                                               ASTGENKEY(8)

NAME
       astgenkey - generates keys for for Asterisk IAX2 RSA authentication

SYNOPSIS
       astgenkey [ -q ] [ -n ] [ keyname ]

DESCRIPTION
       astgenkey  This script generates an RSA private and public key pair in PEM format for use by Asterisk.  The private key should be kept a secret, as it can be used to fake your system's identity.  Thus
       by default (without the option -n ) the script will create a passphrase-encrypted copy of your secret key: without entering the passphrase you won't be able to use it.

       However if you want to use such a key with Asterisk, you'll have to start it interactively, because the scripts that start asterisk can't use that encrypted key.

       The key is identified by a name. If you don't write the name on the command-line you'll be prompted for one. The outputs of the script are:

       name.pub
              The public key: not secret. Send this to the other side.

       name.key
              The private key: secret.

       Those files should be copied to /var/lib/asterisk/keys

       (The private key: on your system. The public key: on other systems)

       To see the currently-installed keys from the asterisk CLI, use the command

              keys show

OPTIONS
       -q
              Run quietly.

       -n
              Don't encrypt the private key.

SECURITY
       The keys are created, using the umask of the user running the command.  To create the keys in a secure manner, you should check to ensure that your umask is first set to disallow the private key  from
       being world- readable, such as with the following commands:

       umask 0066

       astgenkey yourkey

       And then make the key accessible to Asterisk (assuming you run it as user "asterisk").

         chown asterisk /var/lib/asterisk/keys/yourname.*

FILES
       /var/lib/asterisk/keys
