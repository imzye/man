DESCRIPTION
       blktool is used for querying and/or changing settings of a block device.

       device is the name of the block device to query or modify.

OPTIONS
       -f     For  a  few  commands,  blktool will flush the buffers of the block device out to disk, before performing the requested command.  Specify this option, "force", disables any flushing blktool
              would attempt to do.

       -t class
              where class is one of 'ide', 'ata', 'scsi', 'i2o', or 'auto' to override the default auto-detection of device class.

COMMANDS
       acoustic-mgmt
              Query or set underlying device's acoustic level.

       block-sz
              Query or set device block size.

       bus-id Query device bus id.

       bus-state
              Query or set device bus state (0 off, 1 on, 2 tristate)

       class  Query the detected (or overridden, via -t) device class.  Typically this will result in 'ATA' or 'SCSI' for most devices.  Detection is based on device major; thus your SATA device may  ap‐
              pear as 'SCSI'.

       cd-speed
              Set CD-ROM device speed (in Kbytes/sec).

       defect-mgmt
              Toggle underlying device's defect management (obsolete).

       dev-keep-settings
              Toggle underlying device's revert-to-defaults-on-reset feature.

       dev-read-ahead
              Toggle underlying device's read-ahead feature.

       dma    Toggle DMA data transfer.  Omitting the on/off argument will print the current state.

       geometry
              Query device geometry (cylinders / heads / sectors / etc.).

       i2o-rcache
              Query or set an I2O block device's read cache.

       i2o-wcache
              Query or set an I2O block device's write cache.

       id     Query IDENTIFY [PACKET] DEVICE data.

       keep-settings
              Keep settings across device resets.  Omitting the on/off argument will print the current state.

       media  Lock in (or unlock) a removable device.

       multiple-count
              Set multiple count for use in READ/WRITE MULTIPLE commands.

       no-write-err
              Toggle ignore-write-errors flag.  Omitting the on/off argument will print the current state.

       pio-data
              ATA PIO data transfer via 16-bit or 32-bit I/O.  Omitting the on/off argument will print the current state.

       pio-mode
              Set underlying ATA device's PIO data transfer mode.

       pm-mode
              Set underlying device's Advanced Power Management mode.

       queued-depth
              Query or set underlying device's queue depth.

       read-ahead
              Query or set block device read-ahead (in units of sectors).

       readonly
              Toggle block device read-only setting.  Omitting the on/off argument will print the current state.

       reread-part
              Re-read partition table.

       reset  Execute device reset.

       sector-sz
              Query device sector size.

       sleep  Put device to sleep immediately.

       standby
              Put device in standby mode.

       unmask-irq
              Toggle unmasked irqs.  Omitting the on/off argument will print the current state.

       version
              Print version number and exit.

       wcache Toggle underlying device's writeback cache.

BUGS
       Inevitably there are some.  Please report any you find.
