NAME
       hfsplus — a set of tools to access HFS+ file systems

Description
       HFS+, also known as the Macintosh Extended Format, was introduced by Apple Computer in 1998 with the release of MacOS 8.1.  It contains many improvements over the old HFS file system, most notably
       the ability to allocate up to 2^64 blocks, resulting in much more efficient storage of many small files on large disks.

       The  hfsplus  collection  allows  one to access volumes formatted with the HFS+ file system from Debian GNU/Linux and related operating systems.  The collection contains tools to mount and unmount
       HFS+ volumes, to change and list directories, and to copy files to and from HFS+ volumes.

       Note that unlike its cousin, the hfsutils collection used for accessing HFS file systems, hfsplus does not use the Macintosh pathname syntax with ":" as delimiter.  Instead, it mimics the unix no‐
       tation, delimiting the names of volumes, directories and files in a path with "/", and also understands "." and ".." to some extent.
