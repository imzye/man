Name
       SemVer - Use semantic version numbers

Synopsis
         use SemVer; our $VERSION = SemVer->new('1.2.0-b1');

Description
       This module subclasses version to create semantic versions, as defined by the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Specification <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>.  The three salient points of the
       specification, for the purposes of version formatting, are:

       1.  A  normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the
           patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically.  For instance: "1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0".

       2.  A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics
           and hyphen "[0-9A-Za-z-]". Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal  version.
           A  pre-release  version  indicates  that  the  version  is  unstable  and  might  not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version: "1.0.0-alpha,
           1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92"

       3.  Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST  comprise  only  ASCII
           alphanumerics  and  hyphen  "[0-9A-Za-z-]". Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata SHOULD be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build
           metadata, have the same precedence.  Examples: "1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85".

   Usage
       For strict parsing of semantic version numbers, use the "new()" constructor.  If you need something more flexible, use "declare()". And if you need something  more  comparable  with  what  version
       expects, try "parse()".  Compare how these constructors deal with various version strings (with values shown as returned by "normal()":

           Argument  | new      | declare     | parse
        -------------+----------+---------------------------
         '1.0.0'     | 1.0.0    | 1.0.0       | 1.0.0
         '5.5.2-b1'  | 5.5.2-b1 | 5.5.2-b1    | 5.5.2-b1
         '1.05.0'    | <error>  | 1.5.0       | 1.5.0
         '1.0'       | <error>  | 1.0.0       | 1.0.0
         '  012.2.2' | <error>  | 12.2.2      | 12.2.2
         '1.1'       | <error>  | 1.1.0       | 1.100.0
          1.1        | <error>  | 1.1.0       | 1.100.0
         '1.1.0+b1'  | 1.1.0+b1 | 1.1.0+b1    | 1.1.0+b1
         '1.1-b1'    | <error>  | 1.1.0-b1    | 1.100.0-b1
         '1.2.b1'    | <error>  | 1.2.0-b1    | 1.2.0-b1
         '9.0-beta4' | <error>  | 9.0.0-beta4 | 9.0.0-beta4
         '9'         | <error>  | 9.0.0       | 9.0.0
         '1-b'       | <error>  | 1.0.0-b     | 1.0.0-b
          0          | <error>  | 0.0.0       | 0.0.0
         '0-rc1'     | <error>  | 0.0.0-rc1   | 0.0.0-rc1
         '1.02_30'   | <error>  | 1.23.0      | 1.23.0
          1.02_30    | <error>  | 1.23.0      | 1.23.0

       Note  that,  unlike  in  version, the "declare" and "parse" methods ignore underscores. That is, version strings with underscores are treated as decimal numbers. Hence, the last two examples yield
       exactly the same semantic versions.

       As with version objects, the comparison and stringification operators are all overloaded, so that you can compare semantic versions. You can also compare semantic  versions  with  version  objects
       (but not the other way around, alas). Boolean operators are also overloaded, such that all semantic version objects except for those consisting only of zeros (ignoring prerelease and metadata) are
       considered true.

Interface
   Constructors
       "new"

         my $semver = SemVer->new('1.2.2');

       Performs  a  validating  parse  of  the  version  string and returns a new semantic version object. If the version string does not adhere to the semantic version specification an exception will be
       thrown. See "declare" and "parse" for more forgiving constructors.

       "declare"

         my $semver = SemVer->declare('1.2'); # 1.2.0

       This parser strips out any underscores from the version string and passes it to to "version"'s "declare" constructor, which always creates dotted-integer version objects. This is the most flexible
       way to declare versions. Consider using it to normalize version strings.

       "parse"

         my $semver = SemVer->parse('1.2'); # 1.200.0

       This parser dispatches to "version"'s "parse" constructor, which tries to be more flexible in how it converts simple decimal strings and numbers. Not really recommended, since  it's  treatment  of
       decimals is quite different from the dotted-integer format of semantic version strings, and thus can lead to inconsistencies. Included only for proper compatibility with version.

   Instance Methods
       "normal"

         SemVer->declare('v1.2')->normal;       # 1.2.0
         SemVer->parse('1.2')->normal;          # 1.200.0
         SemVer->declare('1.02.0-b1')->normal;  # 1.2.0-b1
         SemVer->parse('1.02_30')->normal       # 1.230.0
         SemVer->parse(1.02_30)->normal         # 1.23.0

       Returns  a  normalized  representation  of  the version string. This string will always be a strictly-valid dotted-integer semantic version string suitable for passing to "new()". Unlike version's
       "normal" method, there will be no leading "v".

       "stringify"

         SemVer->declare('v1.2')->stringify;    # v1.2
         SemVer->parse('1.200')->stringify;     # v1.200
         SemVer->declare('1.2-r1')->stringify;  # v1.2-r1
         SemVer->parse(1.02_30)->stringify;     # v1.0230
         SemVer->parse(1.02_30)->stringify;     # v1.023

       Returns a string that is as close to the original representation as possible.  If the original representation was a numeric literal, it will be returned the way perl would normally represent it in
       a string. This method is used whenever a version object is interpolated into a string.

       "numify"

       Throws an exception. Semantic versions cannot be numified. Just don't go there.

       "is_alpha"

         my $is_alpha = $semver->is_alpha;

       Returns true if a prerelease and/or metadata string is appended to the end of the version string. This also means that the version number  is  a  "special  version",  in  the  semantic  versioning
       specification meaning of the phrase.

       "vbool"

         say "Version $semver" if $semver;
         say "Not a $semver" if !$semver;

       Returns true for a non-zero semantic semantic version object, without regard to the prerelease or build metadata parts. Overloads boolean operations.

       "vcmp"

       Compares  the  semantic version object to another version object or string and returns 0 if they're the same, -1 if the invocant is smaller than the argument, and 1 if the invocant is greater than
       the argument.

       Mostly you don't need to worry about this: Just use the comparison operators instead:

         if ($semver < $another_semver) {
             die "Need $another_semver or higher";
         }

       Note that in addition to comparing other semantic version objects, you can also compare regular version objects:

         if ($semver < $version) {
             die "Need $version or higher";
         }

       You can also pass in a version string. It will be turned into a semantic version object using "declare". So if you're using numeric versions, you may or may not get what you want:

         my $semver  = version::Semver->new('1.2.0');
         my $version = '1.2';
         my $bool    = $semver == $version; # true

       If that's not what you want, pass the string to "parse" first:

         my $semver  = Semver->new('1.2.0');
         my $version = Semver->parse('1.2'); # 1.200.0
         my $bool    = $semver == $version; # false
