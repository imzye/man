NAME
       rpyc_registry - RPyC registry

SYNOPSIS
       rpyc_registry [options]

DESCRIPTION
       RPyC  (pronounced  as  are-pie-see),  or Remote Python Call, is a transparent Python library for symmetrical remote procedure calls, clustering and distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of object-
       proxying, a technique that employs Python’s dynamic nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between processes and computers, so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they were local.

       rpyc_registry provides a way for clients to discover running instances of rpyc_classic(1) servers. The following options are available:

       --mode MODE, -m MODE
              Choose registry service type. Can be TCP or UDP (the default).

       --port PORT, -p PORT
              Choose the UDP/TCP listener port for the registry. The default is 18811.

       --timeout SECS, -t SECS
              Set a timeout after which unresponsive servers will be removed from the registry.  The default is 240 seconds.

       --logfile FILE
              Write log to FILE.  If not specified, log output is written to stderr.

       --quiet, -q
              Quiet mode. Only errors will be logged.
