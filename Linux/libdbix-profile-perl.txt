NAME
         DBIx::Profile - DBI query profiler
         Version 1.0

SYNOPSIS
         use DBIx::Profile; or "perl -MDBIx::Profile <program>"
         use DBI;
         $dbh->printProfile();

DESCRIPTION
         DBIx::Profile is a quick and easy, and mostly transparent, profiler
         for scripts using DBI.  It collects information on the query
         level, and keeps track of first, failed, normal, and total amounts
         (count, wall clock, CPU time) for each function on the query.

         NOTE: DBIx::Profile use Time::HiRes to clock the wall time and
         the old standby times() to clock the CPU time.  The CPU time is
         pretty coarse.

         DBIx::Profile can also trace the execution of queries.  It will print
         a timestamp and the query that was called.  This is optional, and
         occurs only when the environment variable DBIXPROFILETRACE is set
         to 1. (ex: (bash) export DBIXPROFILETRACE=1).

         Not all DBI methods are profiled at this time.
         Except for replacing the existing "use" and "connect" statements,
         DBIx::Profile allows DBI functions to be called as usual on handles.

         Prints information to STDERR, prefaced with the pid.

RECIPE
         1) Add "use DBIx::Profile" or execute "perl -MDBIx::Profile <program>"
         2) Optional: add $dbh->printProfile (will execute during
            disconnect otherwise)
         3) Run code
         4) Data output will happen at printProfile or $dbh->disconnect;

METHODS
         printProfile
            $dbh->printProfile();

            Will print out the data collected.
            If this is not called before disconnect, disconnect will call
            printProfile.

         setLogFile
            $dbh->setLogFile("ProfileOutput.txt");

            Will save all output to the file.
