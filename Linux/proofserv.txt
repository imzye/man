PROOFSERV(1)                                                                                General Commands Manual                                                                                PROOFSERV(1)

NAME
       proofserv - PROOF (The Parallel ROOT Facility)

DESCRIPTION
       Using PROOF (The Parallel ROOT Facility) one can analyze trees in parallel on a cluster of computers. The PROOF system consists also of the xproofd(1) daemon.

       xproofd takes care of user authentication and overlays itself then with the desired version of the proofserv(1) executable.

       The proofserv(1) is a basically the same as the ROOT interactive module root(1), except that it reads its commands from a socket instead of from the terminal.

       Since it is a remote server it will not do graphics and therefore is not linked with any graphics libraries (Motif, X11, etc.).

       proofserv is started by the daemon proofd(1) on request by the user.  It is not a command to be executed by the user directly.

       Note, that if proofserv is passed any arguments, it will use the libProofx interface, rather than the standard libProof interface.
