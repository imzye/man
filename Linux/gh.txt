NAME
       gh-repo-clone - Clone a repository locally

SYNOPSIS
       gh repo clone <repository> [<directory>] [-- <gitflags>...]

DESCRIPTION
       Clone a GitHub repository locally. Pass additional git clone flags by listing them after --.

       If the OWNER/ portion of the OWNER/REPO repository argument is omitted, it defaults to the name of the authenticating user.

       If  the  repository  is a fork, its parent repository will be added as an additional git remote called upstream. The remote name can be configured using --upstream-remote-name.  The --upstream-re‐
       mote-name option supports an @owner value which will name the remote after the owner of the parent repository.

       If the repository is a fork, its parent repository will be set as the default remote repository.

OPTIONS
       -u, --upstream-remote-name <string> (default "upstream")
              Upstream remote name when cloning a fork
