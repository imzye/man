NAME
       wasmedge-compile - AOT compiler for WasmEdge

SYNOPSIS
       wasmedge compile [OPTIONS] [--] WASM_OR_SO [ARG ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The wasmedge compile subcommand compiles WebAssembly into native machine code, i.e. it is an Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler.

       For pure WebAssembly, the wasmedge(1) program (or the equivalent wasmedge run subcommand) will execute the WebAssembly code in interpreter mode.  However, after compiling it with the wasmedge com‐
       pile AOT compiler, the wasmedge subcommand can execute the WASM in AOT mode, with substantial performance improvements.

       wasmedge compile was previously known as wasmedgec.

OPTIONS
   Generic program information
       -h, --help
          Show the help messages. Will ignore other arguments below.

       -v, --version
          Show the version information. Will ignore other arguments below.

   Basic options
       --dump
          Dump the LLVM IR to wasm.ll and wasm-opt.ll.

       --interruptible
          Generate a binary that supports interruptible execution.

       --generic-binary
          Generate a generic binary of the current host CPU architecture.

       --optimize
          Use --optimize LEVEL to set the optimization level. The LEVEL should be one of 0, 1, 2, 3, s, or z.  The default value will be 2, which means O2.

   Statistics information
       --enable-time-measuring
          Enable generating code for counting time during execution.

       --enable-gas-measuring
          Enable generating code for counting gas burned during execution.

       --enable-instruction-count
          Enable generating code for counting WebAssembly instructions executed.

       --enable-all-statistics
          Enable generating code for all statistics options include instruction counting, gas measuring, and execution time.

   WebAssembly proposals
       --disable-import-export-mut-globals
          Disable Import/Export of mutable globals proposal.

       --disable-non-trap-float-to-int
          Disable Non-trapping float-to-int conversions proposal.

       --disable-sign-extension-operators
          Disable Sign-extension operators proposal.

       --disable-multi-value
          Disable Multi-value proposal.

       --disable-bulk-memory
          Disable Bulk memory operations proposal.

       --disable-reference-types
          Disable Reference types proposal.

       --disable-simd
          Disable SIMD proposal.

       --enable-multi-memory
          Enable Multiple memories proposal.

       --enable-tail-call
          Enable Tail-call proposal.

       --enable-extended-const
          Enable Extended-const proposal.

       --enable-threads
          Enable Threads proposal.

       --enable-all
          Enable all features.

EXAMPLE
       Assuming a WebAssembly program placed under the file fibonacci.wasm, set up so to export a fib() function and accepting a single i32 integer as the input parameter, one can execute the following:

       $ wasmedge compile fibonacci.wasm fibonacci_aot.wasm
       $ time wasmedge --reactor fibonacci_aot.wasm fib 30

       The execution should be much faster compared to interpreter mode:

       time wasmedge --reactor fibonacci.wasm fib 30
