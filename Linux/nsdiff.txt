NAME
       nspatch - run `nsdiff | nsupdate` with error handling

SYNOPSIS
       nspatch [-hVv] [-r count]
               -- [nsdiff options] -- [nsupdate options]

DESCRIPTION
       The nspatch utility runs `"nsdiff | nsupdate"` and checks that both programs complete successfully. It suppresses their output unless there is an error, in a manner suitable for running from cron.

       The nsupdate script produced by nsdiff includes a prerequisite check to detect and fail if there is a concurrent update. These failures are detected by nspatch which retries the update.

       Rather than using a pipe, nspatch uses temporary files to store the output of nsdiff and nsupdate.

OPTIONS
       -h  Display this documentation.

       -V  Display version information.

       -r count
           If the update fails because of a concurrent update, nspatch will retry up to count times. The default retry count is 2.

       -v  Turn on verbose mode, so the output from nsdiff and nsupdate is printed even if they are successful. (By default it is suppressed.)

           The  verbose  option  is  passed  on  to nsdiff. If nspatch is not given the -v option, it passes the -v '' option to nsdiff. If nspatch is given the -v option, it passes the -v 'qr' option to
           nsdiff.

EXIT STATUS
       The nspatch utility returns 0 if no change is required or if the update is successful, or 1 if there is an error.

ENVIRONMENT
       "TMPDIR"
           Location for temporary files.
