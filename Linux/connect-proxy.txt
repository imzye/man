NAME
       connect-proxy — connect over SOCKS4/5 proxy

SYNOPSIS
       connect-proxy  [-dnhst45]   [-R resolve ]  [-p local-port ]  [-w secs ]  [-H [user@]proxy-server[:port]] ]  [-S [user@]socks-server[:port]] ]  [-T proxy-server[:port] ]  [-c telnet-proxy-command ]
       [host]  [port]

DESCRIPTION
       connect-proxy open connection over SOCKS4/5 proxies

       Please, note that any HTTP-Proxy tunnel won't work with content-inspection firewall (unless using SSL).

OPTIONS
       -H        specifies a hostname and port number of the http proxy server to relay. If port is omitted, 80 is used. You can specify this value in the environment variable HTTP_PROXY and pass the  -h
                 option to use it.

       -S        specifies the hostname and port number of the SOCKS server to relay.  Like -H, port number can be omitted and the default is 1080. You can also specify this value pair in the environment
                 variable SOCKS5_SERVER and give the -s option to use it.

       -4        specifies SOCKS relaying and indicates protocol version to use.  It is valid only when used with '-s' or '-S'.  Default is '-5' (protocol version 5)

       -R        method to resolve the hostname. Three keywords ("local", "remote", "both") or dot-notation IP address are acceptable.  The keyword "both" means, "Try local first, then remote". If a dot-
                 notation IP address is specified, use this host as nameserver. The default is "remote" for SOCKS5 or "local" for others. On SOCKS4 protocol, remote resolving method ("remote" and "both")
                 requires protocol 4a supported server.

       -p        will forward a local TCP port instead of using the standard input and output.

       -P        same  to '-p' except keep remote session. The program repeats waiting the port with holding remote session without disconnecting. To connect the remote session, send EOF to stdin or kill
                 the program.

       -w        timeout in seconds for making connection with TARGET host.

       -d        used for debug. If you fail to connect, use this and check request to and response from server.

USAGE
       To use proxy, this example is for SOCKS5 connection to connect to "host" at port 25 via SOCKS5 server on "firewall" host.

       connect-proxy -S firewall host 25

       SOCKS5_SERVER=firewall; export SOCKS5_SERVER; connect-proxy -s host 25

       For a HTTP-PROXY connection:

       connect-proxy -H proxy-server:8080  host 25

       HTTP_PROXY=proxy-server:8080; export HTTP_PROXY; connect-proxy -h host 25

       To forward a local port, for example to use ssh:

       connect-proxy -p 5550 -H proxy-server:8080 host 22 ssh -l user

       To use it along ssh transparently:

       # file://~/.ssh/config
       # not using proxy on lan
       Host 192.*
       ProxyCommand connect-proxy %h %p
       # mandatory to access the internet
       Host *
       ProxyCommand connect-proxy -H proxyserver:8080  %h %p

       Or for all users ( /etc/ssh/ssh_config )

ENVIRONMENT
       SOCKS5_USER, SOCKS5_PASSWORD, HTTP_PROXY_USER, HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD, CONNECT_PASSWORD, LOGNAME, USER

       ssh (1).
