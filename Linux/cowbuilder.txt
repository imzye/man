NAME
       cowbuilder - a pbuilder wrapper for cowdancer.

SYNOPSIS
       cowbuilder create [options]

       cowbuilder update [options]

       cowbuilder build [options] .dsc-file

       cowbuilder login [options]

       cowbuilder execute [options] -- script [script options]

       cowbuilder dumpconfig

DESCRIPTION
       cowbuilder Executes the specified pbuilder operation with cowdancer

COMMANDS
       Most commands invoke pbuilder with the specified commands, see pbuilder manual for details.

       create Create the base.cow image.  The directory for base.cow should be empty, or this command will fail.

       update, up, u
              Update the base.cow image.

       build, b
              Build a package given a .dsc file

       login, l
              Start a session within the base.cow.

       execute, e
              Execute a command within the base.cow.

       dumpconfig
              Dump configuration information, used for debugging.

OPTIONS
       Most options are the same as pbuilder, except for the following which are handled specially

       --buildplace
              The place where COW operation takes place.

       --basepath
              This  has a very different meaning to the --basetgz option of pbuilder, since there is no tgz.  This option specifies the directory in which the COW master data is stored, the default being
              /var/cache/pbuilder/base.cow

       --configfile [configuration file to load]
              Additional configuration file to read after all other configuration files have been read.

       --no-cowdancer-update
              Do not use cowdancer on cowbuilder update. Please use this option when cowdancer is interfering with upgrade process, or cowdancer itself is being upgraded within chroot.

       --debian-etch-workaround
              Workaround for Debian Etch. cow-shell will search for all files in the chroot, but will work.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       cowbuilder reads the following configuration files per default.

       /usr/share/pbuilder/pbuilderrc
              Application default, not to be changed.

       /etc/pbuilderrc
              System-wide default.

       ~/.pbuilderrc
              User default

       anything specified with --configfile option
              Additional configuration at runtime.
