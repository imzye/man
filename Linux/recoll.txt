NAME
       recoll - user interface for the Recoll full text search system

SYNOPSIS
       recoll [ -c <configdir> ] [ -o | -l | -f | -a ] [ -t ] [ -q <query> ]

       recoll [ -c <configdir> ] <url>

DESCRIPTION
       In the first form, the recoll command will start the graphical user interface for querying the Recoll database.

       On the first run, recoll will create the user configuration which can be customized before starting the first indexation.

       The -c option specifies the configuration directory name, overriding the default or $RECOLL_CONFDIR.

       The  -q  option  can be used to specify an initial query on the command line. This query will be interpreted by default as a query language string.  If -a is specified, the query string will be inter‐
       preted as an all words simple search query. If -o is specified, the query string will be interpreted as an any word simple search query. If -f is specified, the query string will be interpreted  as  a
       file name simple search query. If -l is specified, the query string will be interpreted as a query language simple search query.

       If  -t is specified, or if recoll is called as recollq (through a link), the Graphical User Interface will not be started, and results will be printed to the standard output. Additional options under‐
       stood by the recollq command may be specified in this case. These can control the output format and the maximum number of results to be printed.

       Please refer to online help for a full description.

       In the second form, the recoll command can be used to start a native viewer for a document indexed by Recoll. It will understand a final URL fragment (separated by a  '#'  character)  to  indicate  an
       ipath  , the specifier for the part of the Recoll document access path which is is internal to a container such as a mbox folder or a zip archive, and will, if needed, create a temporary file to let a
       normal system utility display the document.

       The second form is mostly used for opening embedded documents from the Ubuntu Unity Recoll lens.
