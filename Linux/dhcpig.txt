NAME
       dhcpig - DHCP exhaustion script using scapy network library

SYNOPSIS
       dhcpig [options] <interface> dhcpig -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       DHCPig initiates an advanced DHCP exhaustion attack. It will consume all IPs on the LAN, stop new users from obtaining IPs, release any IPs in use, then for good measure send gratuitous ARP and
       knock all windows hosts offline.

       When executed the script will perform the following actions:

       Grab your Neighbors IPs before they do
          Listen for DHCP Requests from other clients if offer detected, respond with
          request for that offer.

       Request all available IP addresses in Zone
          Loop and Send DHCP Requests all from different hosts  MAC addresses

       Find your Neighbors MAC  IP and release their IP from DHCP server
          ARP for all neighbors on that LAN, then send DHCPReleases to server

       Finally the script will then wait for DHCP exhaustion, (that is no received DHCP OFFERs for 10 seconds) and then

       Knock all Windows systems offline
          gratuitous ARP the LAN, and since no additional DHCP addresses are available these windows systems should stay offline. Linux systems will not give up IP even when another system on LAN is
       detected with same IP.
