NAME
       teamd.conf — libteam daemon configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       teamd uses JSON format configuration.

OPTIONS
       device (string)
              Desired name of new team device.

       debug_level (int)
              Level of debug messages. The higher it is the more debug messages will be printed. It is the same as adding "-g" command line options.

              Default: 0 (disabled)

       hwaddr (string)
              Desired hardware address of new team device. Usual MAC address format is accepted.

       runner.name (string)
              Name of team device. The following runners are available:

              broadcast — Simple runner which directs the team device to transmit packets via all ports.

              roundrobin — Simple runner which directs the team device to transmits packets in a round-robin fashion.

              random — Simple runner which directs the team device to transmits packets on a randomly selected port.

              activebackup — Watches for link changes and selects active port to be used for data transfers.

              loadbalance  —  To  do  passive  load  balancing, runner only sets up BPF hash function which will determine port for packet transmit. To do active load balancing, runner moves hashes among
              available ports trying to reach perfect balance.

              lacp — Implements 802.3ad LACP protocol. Can use same Tx port selection possibilities as loadbalance runner.

              Default: roundrobin

       notify_peers.count (int)
              Number of bursts of unsolicited NAs and gratuitous ARP packets sent after port is enabled or disabled.

              Default: 0 (disabled)

              Default for activebackup runner: 1

       notify_peers.interval (int)
              Value is positive number in milliseconds. Specifies an interval between bursts of notify-peer packets.

              Default: 0

       mcast_rejoin.count (int)
              Number of bursts of multicast group rejoin requests sent after port is enabled or disabled.

              Default: 0 (disabled)

              Default for activebackup runner: 1

       mcast_rejoin.interval (int)
              Value is positive number in milliseconds. Specifies an interval between bursts of multicast group rejoin requests.

              Default: 0

       link_watch.name | ports.PORTIFNAME.link_watch.name (string)
              Name of link watcher to be used. The following link watchers are available:

              ethtool — Uses Libteam lib to get port ethtool state changes.

              arp_ping — ARP requests are sent through a port. If an ARP reply is received, the link is considered to be up.

              nsna_ping — Similar to the previous, except that it uses IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation / Neighbor Advertisement mechanism. This is an alternative to arp_ping and becomes handy in pure-IPv6 en‐
              vironments.

       ports (object)
              List of ports, network devices, to be used in a team device.

              same_all — All ports will always have the same hardware address as the associated team device.

              by_active — Team device adopts the hardware address of the currently active port. This is useful when the port device is not able to change its hardware address.

              only_active — Only the active port adopts the hardware address of the team device. The others have their own.

              Default: same_all

              count — Select aggregator with highest number of ports.

              port_config — Aggregator with highest priority according to per-port options prio and sticky will be selected. This means that the aggregator containing the port with the  highest  priority
              will be selected unless at least one of the ports in the currently selected aggregator is sticky.

              Default: lacp_prio

EXAMPLES
       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {"name": "roundrobin"},
         "ports": {"eth1": {}, "eth2": {}}
       }

       Very basic configuration.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {"name": "activebackup"},
         "link_watch": {"name": "ethtool"},
         "ports": {
           "eth1": {
             "prio": -10,
             "sticky": true
           },
           "eth2": {
             "prio": 100
           }
         }
       }

       This  configuration  uses active-backup runner with ethtool link watcher. Port eth2 has higher priority, but the sticky flag ensures that if eth1 becomes active, it stays active while the link re‐
       mains up.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {"name": "activebackup"},
         "link_watch": {
           "name": "ethtool",
           "delay_up": 2500,
           "delay_down": 1000
         },
         "ports": {
           "eth1": {
             "prio": -10,
             "sticky": true
           },
           "eth2": {
             "prio": 100
           }
         }
       }

       Similar to the previous one. Only difference is that link changes are not propagated to the runner immediately, but delays are applied.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {"name": "activebackup"},
         "link_watch":  {
           "name": "arp_ping",
           "interval": 100,
           "missed_max": 30,
           "target_host": "192.168.23.1"
         },
         "ports": {
           "eth1": {
             "prio": -10,
             "sticky": true
           },
           "eth2": {
             "prio": 100
           }
         }
       }

       This configuration uses ARP ping link watch.

       {
       "device": "team0",
       "runner": {"name": "activebackup"},
       "link_watch": [
         {
           "name": "arp_ping",
           "interval": 100,
           "missed_max": 30,
           "target_host": "192.168.23.1"
         },
         {
           "name": "arp_ping",
           "interval": 50,
           "missed_max": 20,
           "target_host": "192.168.24.1"
         }
       ],
       "ports": {
         "eth1": {
           "prio": -10,
           "sticky": true
         },
         "eth2": {
           "prio": 100
           }
         }
       }

       Similar to the previous one, only this time two link watchers are used at the same time.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {
           "name": "loadbalance",
           "tx_hash": ["eth", "ipv4", "ipv6"]
         },
         "ports": {"eth1": {}, "eth2": {}}
       }

       Configuration for hash-based passive Tx load balancing.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {
           "name": "loadbalance",
           "tx_hash": ["eth", "ipv4", "ipv6"],
           "tx_balancer": {
             "name": "basic"
           }
         },
         "ports": {"eth1": {}, "eth2": {}}
       }

       Configuration for active Tx load balancing using basic load balancer.

       {
         "device": "team0",
         "runner": {
           "name": "lacp",
           "active": true,
           "fast_rate": true,
           "tx_hash": ["eth", "ipv4", "ipv6"]
         },
         "link_watch": {"name": "ethtool"},
         "ports": {"eth1": {}, "eth2": {}}
       }

       Configuration for connection to LACP capable counterpart.
