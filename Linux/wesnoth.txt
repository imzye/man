NAME
       wesnoth - Battle for Wesnoth, a turn-based fantasy strategy game

SYNOPSIS
       wesnoth [OPTIONS] [PATH_TO_DATA]

DESCRIPTION
       Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based fantasy strategy game.

       Defeat  all  enemy leaders using a well-chosen cadre of troops, taking care to manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have their own strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces
       to their best advantage while denying your foes the chance to do the same. As units gain experience, they acquire new abilities and become more powerful. Play in your own language and test your  skill
       against a smart computer opponent, or join Wesnoth's large community of online players. Create your own custom units, scenarios or campaigns, and share them with others.

OPTIONS
       --all-translations
              Show all translations in the in-game language selection list, even if they are deemed insufficiently complete.

       --bunzip2 infile.bz2
              decompresses a file which should be in bzip2 format and stores it without the .bz2 suffix. The infile.bz2 will be removed.

       --bzip2 infile
              compresses a file in bzip2 format, stores it as infile.bz2 and removes infile.

       -c[id_campaign], --campaign[=id_campaign]
              goes directly to the campaign with id id_campaign.  A selection menu will appear if no id was specified.

       --campaign-difficulty[=difficulty]
              The difficulty of the specified campaign (1 to max). If none specified, the campaign difficulty selection widget will appear.

       --campaign-scenario id_scenario
              The id of the scenario from the specified campaign. The default is the first scenario.

       --campaign-skip-story
              Skip [story] screens and dialog through the end of the start event.

       --clock
              Adds the option to show a clock for testing the drawing timer.

       --config-dir name
              Deprecated, use --userdata-dir.

       --config-path
              Deprecated, use --userdata-path.

       --core id_core
              overrides the loaded core with the one whose id is specified.

       --data-dir directory
              overrides the data directory with the one specified

       --data-path
              prints the path of the data directory and exits.

       -d, --debug
              enables additional command mode options in-game (see the wiki page at https://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/CommandMode for more information about command mode).

       --debug-lua
              enables some Lua debugging mechanisms

       -e[file], --editor[=file]
              start the in-game map editor directly. If file is specified, equivalent to -l --load.

       --fps  displays the number of frames per second the game is currently running at, in a corner of the screen.

       -f, --fullscreen
              runs the game in full screen mode.

       --gunzip infile.gz
              decompresses a file which should be in gzip format and stores it without the .gz suffix. The infile.gz will be removed.

       -h, --help
              displays a summary of command line options to standard output, and exits.

       -l, --load file
              loads the savegame file from the standard save game directory. If the -e or --editor option is used as well, starts the editor with the map from file open. If it is a directory, the editor will
              start with a load map dialog opened there.

       -L, --language lang
              uses language lang (symbol) this session.  Example: --language ang_GB@latin

       --log-level=domain1,domain2,...
              sets the severity level of the log domains.  all can be used to match any log domain. Available levels: error, warning, info, debug, none.  By default the warning level is  used  for  most  do‐
              mains, but deprecation defaults to none unless combined with the -d option.

       --log-precise
              shows the timestamps in log output with more precision.

       --log-strict
              sets  the  strict  level  of the logger. Any messages sent to log domains of this level or more severe will cause the unit test to fail regardless of the victory result. Only relevant when used
              with -u.

       --logdomains[=filter]
              lists defined log domains (only the ones containing filter if used) and exits

       --max-fps fps
              the number of frames per second the game can show, the value should be between 1 and 1000, the default is the monitor's refresh rate.

       -m, --multiplayer
              runs a multiplayer game. There are additional options that can be used together with --multiplayer as explained below.

       --mp-test
              load the test mp scenarios.

       --new-widgets
              there is a new WIP widget toolkit, this option enables it. This is very experimental, don't fill bug reports since most are known. Parts of the library are deemed stable and will  work  without
              this switch.

       --nodelay
              runs the game without any delays for graphic benchmarking. This is automatically enabled by --nogui.

       --noaddons
              disables loading of user addons.

       --nocache
              disables caching of game data.

       --nogui
              runs the game without the GUI. Only available in combination with --multiplayer or --screenshot or --plugin.

       --nomusic
              runs the game without music.

       --noreplaycheck
              don't try to validate replay of unit test. Only relevant when used with -u.

       --nosound
              runs the game without sounds and music.

       --password password
              uses password when connecting to a server, ignoring other preferences. Unsafe.

       --plugin script
              (experimental) load a script which defines a Wesnoth plugin. Similar to --script, but Lua file should return a function which will be run as a coroutine and periodically woken up with updates.

       -p, --preprocess source-file/folder target-directory
              preprocesses  a  specified  file/folder. For each file(s) a plain .cfg file and a processed .cfg file will be written in specified target directory. If a folder is specified, it will be prepro‐
              cessed recursively based on the known preprocessor rules. The common macros from the "data/core/macros" directory will be preprocessed  before  the  specified  resources.   Example:  -p  ~/wes‐
              noth/data/campaigns/tutorial ~/result.  For details regarding the preprocessor visit: https://wiki.wesnoth.org/PreprocessorRef#Command-line_preprocessor.

       --preprocess-defines=DEFINE1,DEFINE2,...
              comma separated list of defines to be used by the --preprocess command. If SKIP_CORE is in the define list the "data/core" directory won't be preprocessed.

       --preprocess-input-macros source-file
              used only by the --preprocess command. Specifies a file that contains [preproc_define]s to be included before preprocessing.

       --preprocess-output-macros[=target-file]
              used  only  by  the  --preprocess command. Will output all preprocessed macros in the target file. If the file is not specified the output will be file '_MACROS_.cfg' in the target directory of
              preprocess's command. The output file can be passed to --preprocess-input-macros.  This switch should be typed before the --preprocess command.

       -r XxY, --resolution XxY
              sets the screen resolution. Example: -r 800x600.

       --render-image image output
              takes a valid wesnoth 'image path string' with image path functions, and outputs to a .png file. Image path functions are documented at https://wiki.wesnoth.org/ImagePathFunctionWML.

       -R, --report
              initializes game directories, prints build information suitable for use in bug reports, and exits.

       --rng-seed number
              seeds the random number generator with number.  Example: --rng-seed 0.

       --screenshot map output
              saves a screenshot of map to output without initializing a screen.

       --script file
              (experimental) file containing a Lua script to control the client.

       -s[host], --server[=host]
              connects to the specified host if any, otherwise connect to the first server in preferences. Example: --server server.wesnoth.org.

       --showgui
              runs the game with the GUI, overriding any implicit --nogui.

       --strict-validation
              validation errors are treated as fatal errors.

       -t[scenario_id], --test[=scenario_id]
              runs the game in a small test scenario. The scenario should be one defined with a [test] WML tag. The default is test.  A demonstration of  the  [micro_ai]  feature  can  be  started  with  mi‐
              cro_ai_test.  Implies --nogui.

       --translations-over percent
              Set the standard for deeming a translation is complete enough to show in the in-game language list to percent.  Valid values are 0 to 100.

       -u, --unit scenario-id
              runs the specified test scenario as a unit test. Implies --nogui.

       --unsafe-scripts
              makes  the  package  package available to lua scripts, so that they can load arbitrary packages. Do not do this with untrusted scripts! This action gives lua the same permissions as the wesnoth
              executable.

       --userconfig-dir name
              sets the user configuration directory to name under $HOME or "My Documents\My Games" for windows.  You can also specify an absolute path for the configuration directory outside the $HOME or "My
              Documents\My  Games".  On  Windows  it  is  also possible to specify a directory relative to the process working directory by using path starting with ".\" or "..\".  Under X11 this defaults to
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME/.config/wesnoth, on other systems to the userdata path.

       --userconfig-path
              prints the path of the user configuration directory and exits.

       --userdata-dir name
              sets the userdata directory to name under $HOME or "My Documents\My Games" for windows.  You can also specify an absolute path for the userdata directory outside the $HOME or  "My  Documents\My
              Games". On Windows it is also possible to specify a directory relative to the process working directory by using path starting with ".\" or "..\".

       --userdata-path
              prints the path of the userdata directory and exits.

       --username username
              uses username when connecting to a server, ignoring other preferences.

       --validcache
              assumes that the cache is valid. (dangerous)

       -v, --version
              shows the version number and exits.

       -w, --windowed
              runs the game in windowed mode.

       --with-replay
              replays the game loaded with the --load option.

Options for --multiplayer
       The side-specific multiplayer options are marked with number.  number has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on the number of players possible in the chosen scenario.

       --ai-config number:value
              selects a configuration file to load for the AI controller for this side.

       --algorithm number:value
              selects  a  non-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for this side. The algorithm is defined by an [ai] tag, which can be a core one either in "data/ai/ais" or "data/ai/dev" or an
              algorithm defined by an addon. Available values include: idle_ai and experimental_ai.

       --controller number:value
              selects the controller for this side. Available values: human, ai and null.

       --era value
              use this option to play in the selected era instead of the Default era. The era is chosen by an id. Eras are described in the data/multiplayer/eras.cfg file.

       --exit-at-end
              exits once the scenario is over, without displaying victory/defeat dialog which normally requires the user to click End Scenario.  This is also used for scriptable benchmarking.

       --ignore-map-settings
              do not use map settings, use default values instead.

       --label label
              sets the label for AIs.

       --multiplayer-repeat value
              repeats a multiplayer game value times. Best to use with --nogui for scriptable benchmarking.

       --parm number:name:value
              sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the options used with --controller and --algorithm.  It should only be useful for people designing their  own  AI.  (not  yet
              documented completely)

       --scenario value
              selects a multiplayer scenario by id. The default scenario id is multiplayer_The_Freelands.

       --side number:value
              selects a faction of the current era for this side. The faction is chosen by an id. Factions are described in the data/multiplayer.cfg file.

       --turns value
              sets the number of turns for the chosen scenario. By default no turn limit is set.

EXIT STATUS
       Normal exit status is 0.  An exit status of 1 indicates an (SDL, video, fonts, etc) initialization error. An exit status of 2 indicates an error with the command line options.
       When  running  unit tests (with -u), the exit status is different. An exit status of 0 indicates that the test passed, and 1 indicates that the test failed. An exit status of 3 indicates that the test
       passed, but produced an invalid replay file. An exit status of 4 indicates that the test passed, but the replay produced errors. These latter two are only returned if --noreplaycheck is not passed.
