NAME
       sd_bus_pending_method_calls - Return the number of currently pending, outgoing method calls

SYNOPSIS
       #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

       int sd_bus_pending_method_calls(sd_bus *bus);

DESCRIPTION
       sd_bus_pending_method_calls() returns the number of currently pending outgoing method calls, i.e. method calls enqueued with sd_bus_call_async(3) for which no reply has been received yet, and
       which have not reached a timeout yet.

       The bus argument may be NULL, in which case zero is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       This function returns 0 if there are no pending method calls, or a NULL bus object was specified. On failure, a negative errno-style error code is returned.

   Errors
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       -ECHILD
           The bus connection has been created in a different process, library or module instance.

NOTES
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which can be compiled against and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

       The code described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the functions described here must not call setenv(3) from a parallel thread.
       It is recommended to only do calls to setenv() from an early phase of the program when no other threads have been started.

HISTORY
       sd_bus_pending_method_calls() was added in version 257.
