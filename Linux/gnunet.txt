NAME
       gnunet-revocation — revoke private keys (of egos) in GNUnet

SYNOPSIS
       gnunet-revocation  [-t  KEY  |  --test=KEY]  [-e  EPOCHS  |  --epochs=EPOCHS]  [-R NAME | --revoke=NAME] [-p | --perform] [-f NAME | --filename=NAME] [-c FILENAME, --config=FILENAME] [-h | --help]
                         [-L LOGLEVEL | --loglevel=LOGLEVEL] [-v | --version]

DESCRIPTION
       gnunet-revocation can be used to verify if a key has been revoked, to create a revocation certificate for later revocation, to instantly revoke a key and to use a pre-generated revocation certifi‐
       cate to revoke a key.  Upon successful revocation, all peers will be informed about the invalidity of the key.  As this is an expensive operation, GNUnet requires the issuer of the  revocation  to
       perform  an  expensive proof-of-work computation before they will be allowed to perform the revocation.  gnunet-revocation will perform this computation.  The computation can be performed ahead of
       time, with the resulting revocation certificate being stored in a file for later "instant" use.  gnunet-revocation also makes is possible to resume the pre-calculation of a revocation  ---  simply
       abort  a running proof-of-work calculation with CTRL-C, and the existing revocation certificate file will contain the status of the computation.  Note that performing a revocation proof-of-work is
       deliberately VERY expensive.  Depending on your CPU, the calculation can take days or weeks.

       -t KEY | --test=KEY
               Check if the given KEY (ASCII-encoded public key required) has been revoked.

       -e EPOCHS | --epochs=EPOCHS
               Number of epochs for which the revocation should be valid (default: 1)

       -R NAME | --revoke=NAME
               Calculate or perform revocation for the ego with the given NAME.

       -p | --perform
               Actually perform the revocation as soon as possible (do not just generate a revocation certificate, use it).  Must be supplied to actually perform the revocation.

       -f NAME | --filename=NAME
               Use NAME as the name of the file that is to contain the revocation certificate.  Intermediate computation results will be stored here, as well as the final  revocation  certificate.   When
               used  together with -p, this file will be inspected to see if it contains a valid certificate for instant revocation, in which case the revocation can be performed instantly.  If the given
               file contains anything (a valid certificate, with or without the completed proof-of-work) there is no need to supply the "-R" option or to still have the private key of the ego to  perform
               the revocation.

       -c FILENAME, --config=FILENAME
               Use the configuration file FILENAME.

       -h | --help
               Print short help on options.

       -L LOGLEVEL | --loglevel=LOGLEVEL
               Use LOGLEVEL for logging.  Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR.

       -v | --version
               Print GNUnet version number.
