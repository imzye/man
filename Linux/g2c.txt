NAME
       goo, g2c - generic object-orientator (programming language)

SYNOPSIS
       goo
       g2c

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the goo and g2c commands.

       goo and g2c interactively evaluate statements in GOO, a dynamic, type-based, object-oriented language in the same family as Dylan and Scheme.  The language is designed to be simple, productive, power‐
       ful, extensible, dynamic, efficient, and real-time.

       goo and g2c support two evaluation modes, controlled by the environment variable GOO_EVAL_MODE; the two commands differ only in which mode is the default.  In ast  mode  (short  for  "abstract  syntax
       tree", and the default for goo), they directly interpret parsed goo expressions.  In g2c mode (the default for g2c), they instead translate expressions into dynamically compiled C code.

OPTIONS
       None.

USAGE
       Typing goo or g2c at your shell will start up a goo read-eval-print loop, which accepts s-expressions and top-level commands commencing with a comma.  The following is a list of available commands:

       ,quit  Exit the program.

       ^C (control-C)
              Invoke a recursive read-eval-print loop.

       ,g2c-eval
              Change to dynamic compilation evaluation.

       ,ast-eval
              Change to ast evaluation.

       ,in ,name
              Change to module name.

ENVIRONMENT
       GOO_EVAL_MODE
              Determines evaluation mode, as documented in DESCRIPTION above.

       GOO_ROOT
              Installation root (/usr on Debian systems); files needed at runtime can be found under ${GOO_ROOT}/lib/goo.
