NAME
       gradm - Administration program for the grsecurity RBAC system

SYNOPSIS
       gradm  [ -E ] [ -R ] [ -C ] [ -F ] [ -L <logfile> ] [ -O <filename|stream> ] [ -M <filename|uid> ] [ -D ] [ -P [rolename] ] [ -a <rolename> ] [ -n <rolename> ] [ -p <rolename> ] [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -h ] [
       -v ]

DESCRIPTION
       gradm is the userspace RBAC parsing and authentication program for grsecurity

       grsecurity aims to be a complete security system for Linux 2.4.  gradm performs several tasks for the RBAC system including authenticated via a password to the kernel and parsing rules to be passed to
       the kernel.

OPTIONS
       All options to gradm are mutually exclusive, except for -L and -O.

       -E     Enable the RBAC system

       -R     Reload the RBAC system (only valid while in admin mode)

       -C     Perform a check of the RBAC policy, running the same analysis against it that is performed when enabling.

       -F     Toggle full learning mode.  If used only with -L, it enables the RBAC system in full learning mode.  If used with -L and -O, it parses the full learning logs and generates a complete ruleset.

       -M <filename|uid>
              Remove an execution ban on a given uid or filename that has been put in place by the RES_CRASH resource restriction of the RBAC system.

       -L <logfile>
              Parses  the learning logs.  Accepts an argument which specifies the logfile to scan for the learning logs.  If "-" is specified as the logfile, stdin will be used as the learning log.  This op‐
              tion can be used with -E, -O, or -F.

       -O <filename|stream>
              Specifies output mode.  Requires a single argument that can be "stdout", "stderr", or a regular file.  Only used with -L or -F.

       -D     Disable the RBAC system

       -P [rolename]
              Without an argument, it sets the password for administering the RBAC system.  With a role name as an argument, it sets the password for that given special role.

       -a <rolename>
              Authenticate to a special role that requires a password.

       -n <rolename>
              Authenticate to a special role that does not require a password.

       -p <rolename>
              Authenticate through PAM to a special role.

       -u
              Removes yourself from your current special role, reverting back to the normal role selection.  To be used, for instance, for logging out of an admin role without exiting your shell.

       -V     Displays verbose policy statistics when enabling the RBAC system or checking the RBAC policy.  Can only be used with -C, -E, or -F -L <filename>

       -h     Display help information

       -v     Print version information and exit
