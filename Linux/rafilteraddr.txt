NAME
       rafilteraddr - select argus(8) data based on an IANA IP address file.

SYNOPSIS
       rafilteraddr [-f address.file [ [-v] [raoptions] [-- filter-expression]

DESCRIPTION
       Rafilteraddr  reads  argus  data from an argus-data source, and selects
       records that include IP addresses specified by the  address.spec  file.
       This  program provides high performance address matching for any number
       of addresses.

RAFILTERADDR ADDRESS SPECIFICATION
       Rafilteraddr, reads a number of standard IANA IP address  file  formats
       that  specify  IPv4, CIDR and IPV4 prefix addresses.  Examples of these
       file types are provided in ./support/Config.

       rafilteraddr(1) specific options are:

       -f <IPv4 address specification>>
           Specify the list of addresses used for  the  address  filter.  This
           file  can  be  in several IANA based address specification formats,
           and is the same format as the address labels for ralabel.1.

       -v  Invert the logic and print flows that don't match any  of  the  ad‐
           dresses.

INVOCATION
       This  invocation  reads argus(8) data from argusfile and prints records
       that match any of the IP addresses in the iana-ipv4-addresses.

          rafilteraddr -r argusfile -f iana-ipv4-addresses -- ip

       An example address specification that  describes  a  mix  of  CIDR  ad‐
       dresses, IPv4 address ranges and explicit addresses:

         192.168.0.0/24
         192.168.1.3-192.168.2.45
         207.237.36.98
