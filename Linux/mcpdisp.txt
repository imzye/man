NAME
       mcpdisp - provide a mackie control display panel

SYNOPSIS
       mcpdisp [-hmtsV] [-x x] [-y y]

DESCRIPTION
       mcpdisp Mackie Control Protocol Display Program.  Mcpdisp presents a jack midi port that will accept mackie control protocol display messages that would normally appear on the surface "scrib‐
       ble strip" and displays them on the screen. The strip LEDs and meters are displayed as well. Mcpdisp also provides a through midi port to connect back to the controller. This is handy for de‐
       vices such as the BCF2000 or midikb that have no display of their own.

       A jack server must be running before mcpdisp is started or mcpdisp will fail.
