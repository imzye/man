NAME
       goferd - The Gofer Agent Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       goferd [ -h ] [ -f ]

DESCRIPTION
       goferd  is the daemon for the Gofer Agent which provides an extensible,
       light weight, universal python agent.  The gofer core agent is a python
       daemon (service) that provides infrastructure for exposing a remote API
       and for running Recurring Actions. The APIs contributed by plug-ins are
       accessible  by Remote Method Invocation (RMI). The transport for RMI is
       AMQP using an AMQP message broker.  Scheduled actions may also provided
       by plug-ins and are executed at the specified interval.
