NAME
       boot-benchmark - Benchmark the time taken to boot the libguestfs
       appliance

SYNOPSIS
        ./run utils/boot-benchmark/boot-benchmark

DESCRIPTION
       Benchmark the time taken to boot the libguestfs appliance.

       It is essentially the same as doing:

        time guestfish -a /dev/null run

       except that it warms up the caches and repeats the test many times,
       printing out the mean time and standard deviation.

       This needs to be run on a quiet machine, so that other processes
       disturb the timing as little as possible.  The program is completely
       safe to run at any time.  It doesn't read or write any external files,
       and it doesn't require root.

       You can run it from the build directory on the built copy of libguestfs
       like this:

        make
        ./run utils/boot-benchmark/boot-benchmark

       If you omit "./run" then it is run on the installed copy of libguestfs.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display brief help.

       --append "OPTIONS"
           Append "OPTIONS" to the kernel command line.

       -m MB
       --memsize MB
           Set the appliance memory size in MB.

       --smp N
           Enable "N" virtual CPUs.
