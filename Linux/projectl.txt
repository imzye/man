NAME
       projectl - sword action shooting

DESCRIPTION
       Slash & slash & slash!

       The sword mechanics are everything in this game. Your sword rotates away from the direction your ship moves, and in doing so slices through the various enemies. Hold down "Z" and the sword becomes
       a laser, with the same behaviour during movement. The laser is absolutely necessary as it's the only weapon that will cut through the green shots of the enemy ships.
