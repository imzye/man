NAME
       zcfan - zero-configuration fan control daemon for ThinkPads

DESCRIPTION
       zcfan is a minimal, zero-configuration fan control daemon for ThinkPads.

OPTIONS
       zcfan does not take any options. If any are provided, a help message will be printed and zcfan will exit.

CONFIGURATION
   USAGE
       zcfan has the following default fan states:

              Config name   thinkpad_acpi fan level   Default trip temperature (C)
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
              max_temp      7                         90
              med_temp      4                         80
              low_temp      1                         70

       You can optionally override this configuration at /etc/zcfan.conf with your desired threshold values in the following format:

              max_temp 85
              med_temp 70
              low_temp 55

       If no trip temperature is reached, the fan will be turned off.

   HYSTERESIS
       We will only reduce the fan level again once:

       1. The temperature is now at least temp_hysteresis Celsius below the trip point (default 10C), and

       2. At least 3 seconds have elapsed since the initial trip.

       This avoids unnecessary fluctuations in fan speed.

   WATCHDOG
       The kernel watchdog is reset every 120 seconds by default, but a smaller value can be selected in the /etc/zcfan.conf config file with the syntax

              watchdog_secs 10

DEPENDENCIES
       thinkpad-acpi must be loaded with fan_control=1.
