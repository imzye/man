NAME
       paperspecs - paper size specifications

DESCRIPTION
       A CSV format list of the paper size specifications used by paper.  Each line contains the following fields:

       NAME,WIDTH,HEIGHT,UNIT

       Valid units are: pt (PostScript points), mm, in.

       A size may be defined more than once. Only the first definition is normally used. This means that the user's paperspecs file overrides sizes in the system file (see below).

       Multiple  definitions are also used to allow inexact definitions to be looked up by size. For example, the LC_PAPER mechanism available on some systems defines paper sizes in whole numbers of mil‐
       limetres, which results in a definition for Letter size that does not exactly match the definition in inches.

FILES
       /etc/paperspecs
              System list of paper sizes.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/paperspecs
              User's list of paper sizes. This is prepended to the system list.

BUGS
       The CSV format is restricted: quotes are not allowed; hence, fields cannot be escaped.

CREDITS
       The original list of paper names came from Ghostscript 3.68's gs_stadt.ps.
