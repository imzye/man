NAME
       vidir - edit directories and filenames

SYNOPSIS
       vidir [--verbose] [directory|file|-]...

DESCRIPTION
       vidir allows editing of directories and filenames in a text editor.  If no directory is specified, the filenames of the current directory are edited.

       When editing a directory, each item in the directory will appear on its own numbered line. These numbers are how vidir keeps track of what items are changed. Delete lines to remove files from the
       directory, or edit filenames to rename files. You can also switch pairs of numbers to swap filenames.

       Filenames to be edited may be given any combination of directorys (which will be expanded to the non-recursive list of all files within directory), files, or -.  If the latter is specified, vidir
       reads a list of filenames from stdin and displays those for editing.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
