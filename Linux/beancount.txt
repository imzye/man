NAME
       treeify - manual page for treeify 3.2.0

DESCRIPTION
       usage: treeify [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-r PATTERN] [-d DELIMITER] [-s SPLIT] [-F]

              [-A] [--filler FILLER] [input]

       Identify  a  column  of  text that contains hierarchical id and treeify that column. This script will inspect a text file and attempt to find a vertically left-aligned column of text that contains
       identifiers with multiple components, such as "Assets:US:Bank:Checking", and replace those by a treelike structure rendered in ASCII, inserting new empty lines where necessary to create the  tree.
       Note: If your paths have spaces in them, this will not work.  Space is used as a delimiter to detect the end of a column. You can customize the delimiter with an option.

   positional arguments:
       input  Name of the file to process (default: stdin)

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -o, --output OUTPUT
              Name of the file to write (default: stdout)

       -r, --pattern PATTERN
              Pattern for repeatable components (default: "(Assets|L iabilities|Equity|Income|Expenses)(:[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9- _']*)*")

       -d, --delimiter DELIMITER
              Delimiter pattern to detect the end of a column text.  If your pattens contain strings, you may want to set this to a longer string, like ' {2,}' (default: "[ ]+")

       -s, --split SPLIT
              Pattern splitting into components (default: ":")

       -F, --filenames
              Use pattern and split suitable for filenames

       -A, --loose-accounts
              Use pattern and split suitable for loose account names

       --filler FILLER
              Filler string for new lines inserted for formatting
