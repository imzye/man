NAME
       myproxy-change-pass-phrase - change MyProxy passphrase

SYNOPSIS
       myproxy-change-pass-phrase [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  myproxy-change-pass-phrase  command  changes  the passphrase under
       which a credential is protected in the MyProxy repository.  The command
       first  prompts  for  the  current  passphrase  for the credential, then
       prompts twice for the new passphrase.  Only the  credential  owner  can
       change  a  credential's  passphrase.   The user must have a valid proxy
       credential as generated by grid-proxy-init  or  retrieved  by  myproxy-
       logon(1) when running this command.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays command usage text and exits.

       -u, --usage
              Displays command usage text and exits.

       -v, --verbose
              Enables verbose debugging output to the terminal.

       -V, --version
              Displays version information and exits.

       -s hostname[:port], --pshost hostname[:port]
              Specifies  the  hostname(s)  of the myproxy-server(s).  Multiple
              hostnames, each hostname optionally followed by a ':'  and  port
              number, may be specified in a comma-separated list.  This option
              is required if the MYPROXY_SERVER environment  variable  is  not
              defined.  If specified, this option overrides the MYPROXY_SERVER
              environment variable. If a port number is specified with a host‐
              name,   it   will   override  the  -p  option  as  well  as  the
              MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT environment variable for that host.

       -p port, --psport port
              Specifies  the  TCP  port  number  of   the   myproxy-server(8).
              Default: 7512

       -l username, --username username
              Specifies  the MyProxy account under which the credential should
              be stored.  By default, the command uses the value of  the  LOG‐
              NAME environment variable.  Use this option to specify a differ‐
              ent account username on the MyProxy server.  The  MyProxy  user‐
              name need not correspond to a real Unix username.

       -d, --dn_as_username
              Use  the  certificate  subject  (DN)  as  the  default username,
              instead of the LOGNAME environment variable.

       -k name, --credname name
              Specifies the credential name.

       -S, --stdin_pass
              By default, the command prompts for a passphrase and  reads  the
              passphrase  from  the active tty.  When running the command non-
              interactively, there may be no associated tty.  Specifying  this
              option tells the command to read passphrases from standard input
              without prompts or confirmation.

EXIT STATUS
       0 on success, >0 on error

ENVIRONMENT
       GLOBUS_GSSAPI_NAME_COMPATIBILITY
              This client will, by default, perform a  reverse-DNS  lookup  to
              determine the FQHN (Fully Qualified Host Name) to use in verify‐
              ing the identity of the server by checking the FQHN against  the
              CN   in   server's   certificate.    Setting  this  variable  to
              STRICT_RFC2818 will cause the reverse-DNS lookup to NOT be  per‐
              formed  and  the  user-specified  name to be used instead.  This
              variable setting will be ignored if MYPROXY_SERVER_DN (described
              later) is set.

       MYPROXY_SERVER
              Specifies  the  hostname(s)  where the myproxy-server(8) is run‐
              ning. Multiple hostnames can be specified in a  comma  separated
              list  with  each  hostname optionally followed by a ':' and port
              number.  This environment variable can be used in place  of  the
              -s option.

       MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT
              Specifies the port where the myproxy-server(8) is running.  This
              environment variable can be used in place of the -p option.

       MYPROXY_SERVER_DN
              Specifies the distinguished name (DN) of the  myproxy-server(8).
              All  MyProxy client programs authenticate the server's identity.
              By default, the MyProxy client programs  expect  the  server  to
              have    a   distinguished   name   with   "/CN=host/<fqhn>"   or
              "/CN=myproxy/<fqhn>" or "/CN=<fqhn>" (where <fqhn> is the fully-
              qualified  hostname  of  the  server).  If the server is running
              with some other DN, you can set  this  environment  variable  to
              tell  the MyProxy clients to accept the alternative DN. Also see
              GLOBUS_GSSAPI_NAME_COMPATIBILITY above.

       MYPROXY_TCP_PORT_RANGE
              Specifies a range of valid port numbers in  the  form  "min,max"
              for the client side of the network connection to the server.  By
              default, the client will bind to any available port.   Use  this
              environment  variable  to  restrict  the  ports  used to a range
              allowed by your firewall.  If unset,  MyProxy  will  follow  the
              setting of the GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE environment variable.

       X509_USER_CERT
              Specifies a non-standard location for the certificate to be used
              for authentication to the myproxy-server(8).

       X509_USER_KEY
              Specifies a non-standard location for the private key to be used
              for authentication to the myproxy-server(8).

       X509_USER_PROXY
              Specifies a non-standard location for the proxy credential to be
              used for authentication to the myproxy-server(8).

       X509_CERT_DIR
              Specifies a non-standard location for the CA certificates direc‐
              tory.
