SAFE-RM(1)                                                                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                          SAFE-RM(1)

NAME
       safe-rm - wrapper around the rm command to prevent accidental deletions

USAGE
       safe-rm [ ... ] (same arguments as rm)

DESCRIPTION
       safe-rm prevents the accidental deletion of important files by replacing rm with a wrapper which checks the given arguments against a configurable list of exclusions for files and directories
       which should never be removed.

       Users who attempt to delete one of these protected files or directories will not be able to do so and will be shown a warning message instead.

       safe-rm is meant to replace the rm command so you can achieve this by putting a symbolic link with the name "rm" in a directory which sits at the front of your path. For example, given this path:

         PATH=/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin

       You could create the following symbolic link:

         ln -s /usr/local/bin/safe-rm /usr/local/bin/rm

CONFIGURATION
       Protected paths can be set both at the site and user levels.

       All of these configuration files can contain a list of important files or directories (one per line):

         /etc/safe-rm.conf
         /usr/local/etc/safe-rm.conf
         ~/.config/safe-rm

       If all of these are empty, a default list of important paths will be used.

         /usr/lib/*

       will protect all of the files inside the /usr/lib directory if they are referred to directly, but it will not protect your system against:

         rm -rf /usr/lib

       For a full protection, you should include both of these lines:

         /usr/lib
         /usr/lib/*

EXIT STATUS
       Same exit status as the real rm command.

       Note that if all file arguments are skipped by safe-rm then the exit status will be the same as the exit status of the real rm when no files arguments are present.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Note that if you put the following in your protected paths list:

         $ cat /etc/safe-rm.conf
         /usr/lib

       Then safe-rm will prevent you from deleting the directory:

         $ rm -rf /usr/lib
         Skipping /usr/lib
         /bin/rm: missing operand
         Try `/bin/rm --help' for more information.

       However it cannot protect you from the following:

         $ cd /usr/lib
         $ rm -f *
