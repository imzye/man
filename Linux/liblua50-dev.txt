NAME
       lua-config - Lua configuration information

SYNOPSIS
       Basic usage

       gcc ` lua-config --include ` my_prog.c -o my_prog ` lua-config --libs `

DESCRIPTION
       The  lua-config script allows you to determine useful information about the chosen version of lua running on the Debian GNU/Linux system in use.  More infor‐
       mation can be found by running lua-config without any arguments.

CAVEATS
       This script is unique to Debian and as such you shouldn't rely on its presence on every system. Lua is an embedded language by default  and  different  Linux
       distributions  each  take a different approach to making it possible to compile with Lua. The pkg-config system also provides a way to look for libraries and
       is more likely to be supported across different Linux distributions. Debian's pkg-config name for Lua 5.0 is lua50 and the libraries are in lualib50.   These
       pkg-config files can be found in the liblua50-dev and liblualib50-dev packages.
