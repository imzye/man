BOGGLE(6)                      BSD Games Manual                      BOGGLE(6)

NAME
     boggle — word search game

SYNOPSIS
     boggle [-bd] [-s seed] [-t time] [-w length] [+ [+]] [boardspec]

DESCRIPTION
     The object of boggle is to find as many words as possible on the Boggle
     board within the three minute time limit.  A Boggle board is a four by
     four arrangement of Boggle cubes, each side of each cube displaying a
     letter of the alphabet or `qu'.  Words are formed by finding a sequence
     of cubes (letters) that are in the game's dictionary.  The (N+1)th cube
     in the word must be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to
     the Nth cube.  Cubes cannot be reused.  Words consist solely of lower
     case letters and must be at least 3 letters long.

     Command line flags can be given to change the rules of the game.

     -b         Run boggle in batch mode.  A boardspec must also be given.
                The dictionary is read from stdin and a list of words appear‐
                ing in boardspec is printed to stdout.

     -d         Enable debugging output.

     -s seed    Specify a seed seed other than the time of day.

     -t time    Set the time limit for each game from the default 3 minutes to
                time seconds.

     -w length  Change the minimum word length from 3 letters to length.

     +          This flag allows a cube to be used multiple times, but not in
                succession.

     ++         This flag allows the same cubes to be considered adjacent to
                itself.

     boardspec  A starting board position can be specified on the command line
                by listing the board left to right and top to bottom.

     Help is available during play by typing ‘?’.  More detailed information
     on the game is given there.

BUGS
     If there are a great many words in the cube the final display of the
     words may scroll off of the screen.  (On a 25 line screen about 130 words
     can be displayed.)

     No word can contain a ‘q’ that is not immediately followed by a ‘u’.

     When using the + or ++ options the display of words found in the board
     doesn't indicate reused cubes.
