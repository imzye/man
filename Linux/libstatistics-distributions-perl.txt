NAME
       Statistics::Distributions - Perl module for calculating critical values and upper probabilities of common statistical distributions

SYNOPSIS
         use Statistics::Distributions;

         $chis=Statistics::Distributions::chisqrdistr (2,.05);
         print "Chi-squared-crit (2 degrees of freedom, 95th percentile "
              ."= 0.05 level) = $chis\n";

         $u=Statistics::Distributions::udistr (.05);
         print "u-crit (95th percentile = 0.05 level) = $u\n";

         $t=Statistics::Distributions::tdistr (1,.005);
         print "t-crit (1 degree of freedom, 99.5th percentile = 0.005 level) "
              ."= $t\n";

         $f=Statistics::Distributions::fdistr (1,3,.01);
         print "F-crit (1 degree of freedom in numerator, 3 degrees of freedom "
              ."in denominator, 99th percentile = 0.01 level) = $f\n";

         $uprob=Statistics::Distributions::uprob (-0.85);
         print "upper probability of the u distribution (u = -0.85): Q(u) "
              ."= 1-G(u) = $uprob\n";

         $chisprob=Statistics::Distributions::chisqrprob (3,6.25);
         print "upper probability of the chi-square distribution (3 degrees "
              ."of freedom, chi-squared = 6.25): Q = 1-G = $chisprob\n";

         $tprob=Statistics::Distributions::tprob (3,6.251);
         print "upper probability of the t distribution (3 degrees of "
              ."freedom, t = 6.251): Q = 1-G = $tprob\n";

         $fprob=Statistics::Distributions::fprob (3,5,.625);
         print "upper probability of the F distribution (3 degrees of freedom "
              ."in numerator, 5 degrees of freedom in denominator, F = 6.25): "
              ."Q = 1-G = $fprob\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This Perl module calculates percentage points (5 significant digits) of the u (standard normal) distribution, the student's t distribution, the chi-square distribution and the F distribution. It
       can also calculate the upper probability (5 significant digits) of the u (standard normal), the chi-square, the t and the F distribution.  These critical values are needed to perform statistical
       tests, like the u test, the t test, the F test and the chi-squared test, and to calculate confidence intervals.
