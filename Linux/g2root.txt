NAME
       g2root - convert GEANT geometry files to ROOT files

SYNOPSIS
       g2rootd [-f map_name] geant_name macro_name

DESCRIPTION
       You can convert a GEANT (see http://geant.cern.ch/ fore more on GEANT) geometry to ROOT geometry with the following steps

       1      Run the interactive version of GEANT and produce a Zebra RZ file detector.geom, by typing the command:

              Geant > rz/file 21 detector.geom on

       2      Run the g2root program to convert the Zebra RZ file into a ROOT macro detector.C:

              g2root detector.geom detector.C

       3      Run the following ROOT session;

              root [1] .x detector.C
              root [2] detector.Draw()
              root [3] c1.x3d()   // (this invokes the 3-d Root viewer)
              root [4] TFile f("detector.root","NEW") //open a new root file
              root [5] detector.Write() //Write the geometry structure
              root [6] f.Write()

       Note that the TNode structure currently in ROOT was not designed as a replacement for a true geometry package. The idea was mainly to draw simple geometries in event display programs. We are currently
       investigating several alternatives for a true & efficient geometry package supporting;

       -      a disk data base with storage of multiple geometry versions

       -      an interactive editor and viewer

       -      with 3-d views

       -      but also 2-d cut views

       -      with interfaces to existing or future MC such as GEANT3 or GEANT4

       A second program called gh2root (see http://root.cern.ch/root/gh2root.html) generates automatically C++ code corresponding to the GEANT3 Zebra structures JSET, JVERTX, JKINE, JHITS and JDIGI.
