NAME
       TrueCrack - Brute-force password cracker for TrueCrypt (Copyright) volumes.

SYNOPSIS
       truecrack -t truecrypt_file -w passwords_file [OPTION...]
       truecrack -t truecrypt_file -c alphabet [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       TrueCrack is a brute-force password cracker for TrueCrypt (Copyright) volumes. It works on Linux and it is optimized for Nvidia Cuda technology.

       It supports:
        - PBKDF2 (defined in PKCS5 v2.0) based on key derivation functions: Ripemd160, Sha512 and Whirlpool.
        - XTS block cipher mode for hard disk encryption based on encryption algorithms: AES, SERPENT, TWOFISH.
        - File-hosted (container) and Partition/device-hosted.
        - Hidden volumes and Backup headers.

       TrueCrack is able to perform a brute-force attack based on:
        - Dictionary: read the passwords from a file of words.
        - Alphabet: generate all passwords of given length from given alphabet.

       TrueCrack works on gpu and cpu. TrueCrack requires a lots of resources: we suggest a dedicated gpu board.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help information

       -k, --key ripemd160 | sha512 | whirlpool
              Key derivation function (default ripemd160).

       -m, --maxlength maxlength
              Maximum length of passwords, for Alphabet attack.

       -s, --startlength startlength
              Starting length of passwords, for Alphabet attack (default 1).

       -r, --restore number
              Restore the computation.

       -b, --backup
              Backup header instead of volume header.
