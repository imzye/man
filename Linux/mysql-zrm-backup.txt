DESCRIPTION
       ZRM  for  MySQL  provides  automated  scheduling  of  live
MySQL database
       backup.  You only need to configure it once to reflect the
MySQL deploy‐
       ment,  then  schedule it to run unattended backups.  Vari‐
ous options can
       help an administrator:

       * Verify the backups created.

       * Generate various types of reports about the backups cre‐
ated.

       * Specify compression and encryption as desired.

       * Report information about the backups via an email or RSS
feed.

       * Access pre‐ and post‐ backup plugins to extend the suite
further.

       * Control full and selective  restore  operations  on  the
database,  both
       locally and remotely.

       mysql‐zrm‐backup   provides  the  core backup functions of
ZRM for MySQL
       databases.

       Use the  mysql‐zrm.conf(5)  configuration  file   to   set
mysql‐zrm‐backup
       options   described  on this page.  Use the ‐‐action check
option to ver‐
       ify the configuration of mysql‐zrm‐backup.

       Use mysql‐zrm‐backup to create full or  incremental  back‐
ups  of  MySQL
       databases.

       To   display help on individual action options, append the
‐‐help option
       to the command  line.   For   example:   ’mysql‐zrm‐backup
‐‐options‐file
       ‐‐help’

BACKUP SETS
       ZRM   for   MySQL   organizes  backups  into  Backup Sets.
Each backup set
       defines the list of databases or  tables  within  a  data‐
base,  how  it
       should   be  backed up and the backup schedule for the da‐
ta. Backup sets
       are identified by a unique name.

       Every backup run (each time mysql‐zrm is executed) is  as‐
sociated  with
       one   backup   set.  Various  parameters can be associated
with each backup
       run.

       mysql‐zrm    first    reads    the    global      configu‐
ration     file
       (/etc/mysql‐zrm/mysql‐zrm.conf).   The   global configura‐
tion file can be
       overridden  by  backup  set  specific  configuration  file
stored   in
       /etc/mysql‐zrm/backup  set  name  directory. The mysql‐zrm
command line
       options will override the parameters  specified   in   the
configuration
       files.

BACKUP METHODS
       mysql‐zrm   backups  can  be  either  full or incremental.
Full backups can
       be logical backups or raw backups.  Logical  backups  con‐
tain SQL  state‐
       ments   to  recreate the database.  Raw backups are actual
copies of the
       database files.

       When logical backup is specified, the  utility  uses  only
mysqldump  for
       backing up specified databases and tables.

       When   raw   backup   is   specified,  the utility has the
ability to decide
       which backup mechanism to use for a  particular  database.
If  there  are
       no transactional storage engine based tables in the speci‐
fied database,
       then it uses mysqlhotcopy for backing  up  that  database.
Otherwise,  it
       uses mysqldump for backing up the specified database.

       Snapshot   backups  are  discussed in the Snapshot Options
section of this
       man page.

       When replication is specified and if the MySQL server is a
replication
       slave,  then  it  will also backup all replication related
files.

       When  destination specified then the backups are stored in
a sub‐direc‐
       tory  under  the  specified  directory.  Default  path  is
/var/lib/mysql‐zrm.
       If  the  destination  specified does not  exist,  it  will
return an error
       and exit; the utility does not create the directory.

       An index file is also created in the backup directory. The
index  is  a
       file that contains the details of what was backed up,  how
much data was
       backed  up,  what parameters were used to backup the data,
how much  time
       it took to backup etc.

       When  an  incremental  backup  is  specified, the  follow‐
ing options are
       ignored:

       backup‐mode,

       snapshot‐plugin,

       all‐databases,

       databases,

       database

       tables

OPTIONS
       You  can  select  a  backup  set  by name on  the  command
line,  or  select
       source  database(s), backup methods, plugins, etc. by  us‐
ing the options
       described  in the Options subsections that follow. You can
also  specify
       mysql‐zrm‐backup  options  in  a configuration file speci‐
fied using the
       ‐‐options switch.

       ‐‐backup‐set name
              Specify  backup‐set  for the backup run. This is  a
Command  line
              option  only  and cannot be specified in  the  con‐
figuration file.
              The default value is BackupSet1. If  such  a  value
is  already
              present, it will be used.

       ‐‐options‐file conf_file
              Set   the   file   along    with    full   pathname
that  contains
              mysql‐zrm‐backup  configuration  options; this file
has  the  same
              format as mysql‐zrm.conf(5).

       ‐‐help Displays  the  help  message  and  exits. This com‐
mand‐line‐only
              parameter  cannot be specified in the configuration
file.

Backup Source Options
       ‐‐all‐databases
              Opt for all databases to be backed up or  restored.
This  is  the
              default if database or databases are not specified.

       ‐‐databases "name1 name2 ..."
              List the databases to backup or restore.

       ‐‐database name [‐‐tables "name1 name2 ..."]
              List   the   tables  that should be backed up. This
option is valid
              during the backup operation only.

       ‐‐exclude‐pattern "pattern"
              All databases or tables that match the pattern  are
not  backed
              up.  If  ‐‐all‐databases  or ‐‐databases are speci‐
fied, the exclude
              pattern applies to database  names.  If  ‐‐database
is  specified,
              the   exclude pattern applies to table names. Wild‐
card characters
              * (match one or more  characters),  ?  (match   one
character),  []
              (match  one  of  the  characters  specified  within
parenthesis) and |
              (match one of the patterns) are supported. For  ex‐
ample:  Exclude
              pattern   "*_db|dbase[123]|abcd"  will  match names
tom_db, dbase1,
              dbase2, abcd. All tables or databases  that   match
this  pattern
              will   be   excluded.  Character # is not permitted
in the exclude
              pattern.

       ‐‐routines|‐‐no‐routines
              If ‐‐routines is specified then mysqldump will dump
stored  rou‐
              tines. The default is ‐‐no‐routines. This parameter
is optional.

       ‐‐mysql‐binpath mysql_command_dir
              Set the full path  where  mysql   binary   commands
are  installed.
              For example: /opt/lampp/bin.

       ‐‐mysql‐binlog‐path mysql_binary_log_location
              Set   the   full  path of the location of mysql bi‐
nary logs.  For
              example: /var/log/mysql

       ‐‐config‐file‐list="list_file_path"
              Intended for configuration file  backup,  this  op‐
tional  parameter
              lets   you specify a list of files to backup during
a full backup
              of  any  type  (snapshot,  logical,  or  raw).  The
list_file_path  is
              the   path  to  the  file that contains the list of
configuration
              files to back up. The list  itself  should  specify
full pathnames,
              separated by newlines.

              The   config‐file‐list  is processed after the main
data has been
              backed up, and the list file itself  is  copied  to
the destination
              directory  along  with the configuration files. The
backup index
              will record the config‐file‐list parameter.

              Files specified by config‐file‐list  will  be   re‐
stored  during  a
              full  restore to their original locations, preserv‐
ing permissions
              and ownership.

MySQL Access Options
       ‐‐user user
              Specify MySQL backup/restore  user  on  the   MySQL
server.  If  no
              user   is   specified  here,  ensure  that you have
the MySQL user
              specified in the my.cnf or   ‐‐options   file   has
the  necessary
              privileges.

       ‐‐password password
              Specify   password  for the MySQL user. If you wish
to prevent the
              password from being sent in plaintext over the net‐
work, you  may
              wish  to  configure  the  MySQL  username and pass‐
word using the
              MySQL my.cnf or ‐‐options file.

       ‐‐host hostname
              Specify MySQL server host name or IP name.

       ‐‐port portnumber
              Specify MySQL server port.

       ‐‐socket name
              Specify socket file to use for  communication  with
MySQL  server.

       ‐‐ssl‐options "MySQL ssl options"
              Set  any  ‐‐ssl* options that MySQL supports. Refer
to MySQL Docu‐
              mentation for SSL options details.

       ‐‐single‐transaction [always|never|only‐innodb]
              The single‐transaction option controls  under  what
circumstances
              MySQL   for  ZRM will pass the ‐‐single‐transaction
option setting
              to mysqldump when executing a database dump.  Spec‐
ifying  always
              causes  ‐‐single‐transaction  to  always be passed,
never causes
              the ‐‐single‐transaction to never  be  passed,  and
only‐innodb
              specifies   that  ‐‐single‐transaction will only be
passed during
              innodb‐only backups.  For example,  if  only‐innodb
is  specified,
              the  ‐‐single‐transaction  will  not  be passed for
backups that
              include myisam or other non‐transactional tables.

       ‐‐extra‐mysqldump‐options=" mysqldump_options"
              Use this to pass any extra mysqldump  options  when
ZRM for  MySQL
              executes  a  mysqldump. For example, if you require
mysqldump to
              be run with the ‐‐flush‐logs  and  ‐‐no‐create‐info
options, spec‐
              ify         ‐‐extra‐mysqldump‐options="‐‐flush‐logs
‐‐no‐create‐info" in
              the mysql‐zrm.conf file.

       ‐‐extra‐mydumper‐options=" mydumper_options"
              Use this to pass any extra  mydumper  options  when
ZRM  for  MySQL
              executes   a  mydumper. For example, if you require
mydumper to be
              run  with   the   ‐‐threads   and    ‐‐regex    op‐
tions,   specify
              ‐‐extra‐mydumper‐options="‐‐threads=4
‐‐regex=’Regular  expres‐
              sion  for  ’db.table’  matching’"  in  the   mysql‐
zrm.conf file.

Backup Method Options
       ‐‐backup‐level level
              Choose 0 for full backup. Choose  1  for  incremen‐
tal  back  up.
              Default is full backup.

       ‐‐backup‐mode raw|logical
              Database/tables that  use  a  transactional  engine
cannot be backed
              up  by  mysqldump. They  should  be  backed  up  by
mysqlhotcopy.
              Choose  raw  to  use mysqlhotcopy to  back  up  the
database/tables
              that use a transactional engine.  Choose logical to
use  mysql‐
              dump  to  back  up the database/tables  that  don’t
use a transac‐
              tional engine.  Default value is raw.

       ‐‐logical‐parallel |1
              Choose  0  for  mysqldump  backup. Choose 1 for my‐
dumper muti‐thread
              logical back up. Default is mydsqldump backup.

       ‐‐synchronous‐checksum | ‐‐no‐synchronous‐checksum
              Specifies  whether  a  checksum  should   be   pro‐
duced during the
              backup         process.         Default          is
no‐synchronous‐checksum,  in  which
              case  the  checksum  is  produced  only  after  the
backup process is
              complete.     Specifying     ‐‐synchronous‐checksum
significantly
              increases overall backup times.

       ‐‐replication | ‐‐noreplication
              Choose  replication  to  backup  replication files.
They will be
              backed  up  only  if  the  host  is  a  replication
slave.  Default
              option is ‐‐noreplication.

       ‐‐default‐character‐set char_set_name
              The   default   character   set   that    mysqldump
should use. If not
              specified utf8 is used. This parameter is optional.

       ‐‐compress‐data‐during‐transport
              If  the  value  is set to 1,  the  backup  is  com‐
pressed  when  it
              transferred  from  MySQL server to ZRM server. Set‐
ting the value
              to zero, no compression is performed.  No  compres‐
sion  is  per‐
              formed  by default. Data compression during  trans‐
fer is indepen‐
              dent of the Backup compression parameter.

Plugin Options
       ‐‐pre‐backup‐plugin plugin
              (Optional)  Specify  the  plugin  along  with  full
pathname  to  be
              called  before  a backup run. All pre‐backup plugin
scripts must
              accept the following command‐line parameters (which
are  passed
              to the plugin using ‐‐pre‐backup‐plugin‐options:

              ‐‐all‐databases
                  Use when all databases on the server are  being
backed up.

              ‐‐database database1 database2...
                  Use  when  selected  databases are being backed
up.

              ‐‐database database ‐‐tables table1 table2...
                  Use if selected tables are being backed up.

              The  script  should  be  written  to  return a non‐
zero value on
              error; pre‐backup plugin failures should cancel the
backup  and
              generate a failure message for reports and logs.

       ‐‐pre‐backup‐plugin‐options "option1 option2..."
              Pass options to the pre‐backup‐plugin as one of the
command line
              arguments.

       ‐‐copy‐plugin plugin
              Specify  plugin along with full pathname to be used
for transfer‐
              ring  backup  files  to  and  from  a remote  MySQL
server to the
              machine  running  ZRM  for  MySQL.  Use this option
when
                 1. remote incremental backup is required
                 2. copying replication related files from a  re‐
mote machine
                 3.  execute  mysqlhotcopy  (MySQL  command)  and
copy  the  data
              from the remote machine
                 4.  restore  data  to  a  remote  machine  using
mysqlhotcopy(MySQL
              command).  This parameter is optional.

       ‐‐ssh‐user user
              Specifies the user to be used for SSH. This  param‐
eter  is  only
              used by the ssh‐copy.pl plugin. The user  specified
should either
              be  the  user mysqld runs as or root. If not speci‐
fied the default
              value used is mysql. This parameter is optional.

       ‐‐ssh‐identify‐file filename
              Selects  a file from which  the  identity  (private
key) for RSA or
              DSA  authentication  is read. This identity file is
used  by  the
              ssh‐copy.pl plugin for authentication.

       ‐‐remote‐mysql‐binpath path
              Full  path  where  mysql  binaries  are   installed
on the remote
              machine. For example: /opt/lampp/bin.  This  param‐
eter  is  only
              used by the socket‐copy.pl and ssh‐copy.pl plugins.
If not spec‐
              ified, the default value used is /usr/bin.

       ‐‐socket‐remote‐port port
              Port  that  the   socket‐plugin.pl  should  use  to
connect.  This
              parameter  is  only  used  by   the  socket‐copy.pl
plugin. If not
              specified  the  default value used is  25300.  This
parameter  is
              optional

       ‐‐post‐backup‐plugin plugin
              Set  the  plugin  along  with full pathname  to  be
called after a
              backup  run.  If synchronous‐checksum is not set or
its  value  is
              set to zero,  the  post  backup  plugin  is  called
twice, once at the
              end  of  backup  and once when the checksum is fin‐
ished.

       ‐‐post‐backup‐plugin‐options  "Option1   Option2   Option3
Option4..."
              option1        is        the        value        of
post‐backup‐plugin‐options  from  the
              mysql‐zrm.conf(5) file.  option2 is the data  being
backed up. It
              will be either

              ‐‐all‐databases
                  Use  when all databases on the server are being
backed up.

              ‐‐database database1 database2...
                  Use when selected databases  are  being  backed
up.

              ‐‐database database ‐‐tables table1 table2...
                  Use if selected tables are being backed up.

              Option3 will be ‐‐backup‐directory path

              Option4  will  be  ‐‐checksum‐pending or it will be
‐‐checksum‐fin‐
              ished if synchronous‐checksum is set to 1.

              If  synchronous‐checksum is not set or its value is
set to zero,
              the  post‐backup‐plugin is called again and it will
have 3 param‐
              eters   First   parameter   is   the    value    of
post‐backup‐plugin‐options
              from   the  mysql‐zrm.conf(5)  configuration  file.
Second parameter
              will   be  ‐‐backup‐directory  path.  Third  param‐
eter  will  be
              ‐‐checksum‐finished.

Compression and Encryption Options
       ‐‐compress | ‐‐no‐compress
              Choose whether the files should be compressed using
the  utility
              specified    by    the    ‐‐compress‐plugin.    The
default   is
              ‐‐no‐compress.

       ‐‐compress‐mysqldump‐onthefly                            |
‐‐no‐compress‐mysqldump‐onthefly
              Choose whether  to  compress  the  data  dumped  by
mysqldump  on  the
              fly.    Default   compression command used is gzip.
Default is no
              compression on the fly.

       ‐‐compress‐plugin plugin_name
              Use plugin_name to specify a path to the utility to
use for com‐
              pression. The default is gzip.

       ‐‐no‐encrypt | ‐‐encrypt
              Choose   whether  the files should be encrypted us‐
ing the utility
              specified by the ‐‐encrypt‐plugin. The  default  is
‐‐no‐encrypt.

       ‐‐encrypt‐plugin plugin_name [‐‐decrypt‐option [option]
              Use    plugin_name   to   specify  a utility to use
for compression
              along with its full path.   If  decrypt‐option   is
not  specified
              then  the  ‐d  option of encrypt‐plugin is used for
decrypting.

       ‐‐passfile filename

Snapshot Plugin Options
       ‐‐snapshot‐plugin="plugin_pathname"
              Specifies  the  plugin  to  be  used  for  snapshot
operations. The
              default is the lvm‐snapshot plugin.

       [‐‐check‐innodb | ‐‐no‐check‐innodb]
              Specifies  whether  to check for innodb shared data
and log  files
              to   back  up  during  every  snapshot‐based  based
backup.  If
              ‐‐check‐innodb  is  specified,  innodb shared  data
and  logs  are
              only  backed  up if the databases being  backed  up
use innodb. If
              ‐‐no‐check‐innodb   is   specified  (the  default),
the   innodb
              databases  and logs are  backed  up  regardless  of
whether they are
              relevant.   The default value is ‐‐no‐check‐innodb,
which  means
              innodb  shared  data  and  logs  are always  copied
if the innodb
              engine  is  enabled  in  MySQL.   In   most  cases,
‐‐no‐check‐innodb
              provides the best performance.

       ‐‐snapshot‐size size
              Set  the size of the lvm‐snapshot to be  generated.
For raw back‐
              ups,  each  specified database is first checked en‐
sure that it  is
              on  a  LVM  volume, and  then  a  snapshot  of  the
specified size is
              created  and  used   to  backup  the  database.  If
the  specified
              database   is   not  on  a   LVM   volume,   either
mysqlhotcopy or mysql‐
              dump will be used to create the backup based on the
logic speci‐
              fied  by the ‐‐backup‐mode option. This  option  is
ignored if the
              ‐‐backup‐mode is logical.

       ‐‐backup‐type regular|‐‐backup‐type quick
              Choose  the  method of snapshot backup. The regular
option  speci‐
              fies  that the snapshot should  be  copied  into  a
standard ZRM for
              MySQL  backup  archive.  The quick option specifies
that the  snap‐
              shot  itself should be used as a near‐line  backup.
Quick backups
              are  convenient  as they provide near‐instantaneous
restores,  but
              because  they  remain  on  the  MySQL  server  they
do not protect
              against media or server failure. Note that  if  the
’’’quick’’’
              option   is  specified,  the   ’’’compress’’’   and
’’’encrypt’’’
              options  are  ignored, and the backup size will al‐
ways be zero. In
              addition,  no   checksums   are   performed,  which
means that quick
              snapshot backups cannot be verified.

Backup Destination Options
       ‐‐backup‐name image_name
              Specify  a  unique name to store the backup.  If  a
name  is  not
              specified or it already exists in the ‐‐destination
dirpath (see
              the  next  option),  the backup image will be named
with  the  cur‐
              rent date and time.

       ‐‐destination dir_path
              Specify  the directory to store the backup. The de‐
fault location
              is  /var/lib/mysql‐zrm/.  If a directory other than
the default is
              specified,  you must create it manually on both the
MySQL server
              and  the  ZRM  server, and it must have permissions
set  to  allow
              read/write access to the mysql backup user.

Logging and Notification Options
       ‐‐mailto address
              Set the address to which a backup  report  will  be
sent.

       ‐‐mail‐policy always|never|only‐on‐error
              Mail   policy   determines  when email notification
should be sent.
              The value always is the default value and email no‐
tification  is
              sent  for  all events. If the mail policy is set to
never, email
              notification is not sent for  all  events.  If  the
mail  policy  is
              set   to   only‐on‐error,   notification   is  sent
when there is a
              backup failure if mailto is specified.

       ‐‐comment "Comment string"
              Insert a comment or a note about  the  backup  run.
This  can  be
              used   to   tag   backup  runs and the note can re‐
trieved using the
              mysql‐zrm‐reporter(1) utility.

       ‐‐quiet | ‐‐no‐quiet
              Choose quiet to suppress display  of  log  messages
on  stdout.
              Choose   no‐quiet  to display the log messages std‐
out.  Default is
              ‐‐no‐quiet.

       ‐‐verbose
              Provide verbose output in the log.  Default is that
verbose  is
              turned off and a terse output is generated.

       FILES

       /var/lib/mysql‐zrm
              Default directory for storing all backup data.

       /etc/mysql‐zrm/backup set name/mysql‐zrm.conf
              Default  location  for the backup‐set configuration
file used by
              the mysql‐zrm‐backup utility.

RETURN VALUES
       On success, zero is returned. On error, non‐zero value  is
returned.
