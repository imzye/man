DESCRIPTION
       ogr2ogr  can  be used to convert simple features data between file for‐
       mats. It can also perform various operations during the  process,  such
       as spatial or attribute selection, reducing the set of attributes, set‐
       ting the output coordinate system or  even  reprojecting  the  features
       during translation.

       -f <format_name>
              Output  file  format  name,  e.g.  ESRI Shapefile, MapInfo File,
              PostgreSQL.  Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not specified, the  for‐
              mat  is  guessed  from the extension (previously was ESRI Shape‐
              file).

       -append
              Append to existing layer instead of creating new

       -overwrite
              Delete the output layer and recreate it empty

       -update
              Open existing output datasource in update mode rather than  try‐
              ing to create a new one

       -select <field_list>
              Comma-delimited  list  of fields from input layer to copy to the
              new layer. A field is skipped if  mentioned  previously  in  the
              list  even  if  the  input layer has duplicate field names. (De‐
              faults to all; any field is skipped if a subsequent  field  with
              same  name  is  found.) Geometry fields can also be specified in
              the list.

              Note this setting cannot be used together with -append. To  con‐
              trol  the  selection  of  fields  when appending to a layer, use
              -fieldmap or -sql.

       -progress
              Display progress on terminal. Only works if  input  layers  have
              the "fast feature count" capability.

       -sql <sql_statement>
              SQL  statement  to  execute.  The  resulting table/layer will be
              saved to the output. Starting with GDAL 2.1, the @filename  syn‐
              tax  can  be used to indicate that the content is in the pointed
              filename.

       -dialect <dialect>
              SQL dialect. In some cases can  be  used  to  use  (unoptimized)
              ogr_sql_dialect instead of the native SQL of an RDBMS by passing
              the OGRSQL dialect value.  The sql_sqlite_dialect dialect can be
              select  with  the SQLITE and INDIRECT_SQLITE dialect values, and
              this can be used with any datasource.

       -where restricted_where
              Attribute query (like SQL WHERE). Starting with  GDAL  2.1,  the
              @filename  syntax can be used to indicate that the content is in
              the pointed filename.

       -skipfailures
              Continue after a failure, skipping the failed feature.

       -spat <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
              spatial query extents, in the SRS of the source layer(s) (or the
              one  specified with -spat_srs). Only features whose geometry in‐
              tersects the extents will be selected. The geometries  will  not
              be clipped unless -clipsrc is specified.

       -spat_srs <srs_def>
              Override spatial filter SRS.

       -geomfield <field>
              Name  of the geometry field on which the spatial filter operates
              on.

       -dsco NAME=VALUE
              Dataset creation option (format specific)

       -lco NAME=VALUE
              Layer creation option (format specific)

       -nln <name>
              Assign an alternate name to the new layer

       -nlt <type>
              Define the geometry type for the created layer. One of NONE, GE‐
              OMETRY,  POINT,  LINESTRING, POLYGON, GEOMETRYCOLLECTION, MULTI‐
              POINT, MULTIPOLYGON, MULTILINESTRING, CIRCULARSTRING,  COMPOUND‐
              CURVE, CURVEPOLYGON, MULTICURVE, and MULTISURFACE non-linear ge‐
              ometry types. Add Z, M, or ZM to the type name to specify  coor‐
              dinates  with elevation, measure, or elevation and measure. PRO‐
              MOTE_TO_MULTI can be used to automatically promote  layers  that
              mix  polygon  or multipolygons to multipolygons, and layers that
              mix linestrings or multilinestrings to multilinestrings. Can  be
              useful  when  converting  shapefiles to PostGIS and other target
              drivers that implement strict checks for geometry  types.   CON‐
              VERT_TO_LINEAR  can  be  used  to to convert non-linear geometry
              types into linear geometry types by approximating them, and CON‐
              VERT_TO_CURVE  to  promote  a non-linear type to its generalized
              curve type (POLYGON to CURVEPOLYGON, MULTIPOLYGON  to  MULTISUR‐
              FACE,  LINESTRING  to  COMPOUNDCURVE, MULTILINESTRING to MULTIC‐
              URVE). Starting with version 2.1 the type can be defined as mea‐
              sured  ("25D"  remains  as an alias for single "Z"). Some forced
              geometry conversions may result in invalid geometries, for exam‐
              ple  when  forcing  conversion  of multi-part multipolygons with
              -nlt POLYGON, the resulting polygon will break the  Simple  Fea‐
              tures rules.

              Starting  with  GDAL 3.0.5, -nlt CONVERT_TO_LINEAR and -nlt PRO‐
              MOTE_TO_MULTI can be used simultaneously.

       -dim <val>
              Force the coordinate dimension to val (valid values are XY, XYZ,
              XYM, and XYZM - for backwards compatibility 2 is an alias for XY
              and 3 is an alias for XYZ). This affects both the layer geometry
              type,  and feature geometries. The value can be set to layer_dim
              to instruct feature geometries to be promoted to the  coordinate
              dimension declared by the layer. Support for M was added in GDAL
              2.1.

       -a_srs <srs_def>
              Assign an output SRS, but without reprojecting  (use  -t_srs  to
              reproject)

              The coordinate reference systems that can be passed are anything
              supported by  the  OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput()  call,
              which  includes EPSG Projected, Geographic or Compound CRS (i.e.
              EPSG:4296), a well known text (WKT) CRS definition, PROJ.4  dec‐
              larations, or the name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS defi‐
              nition.

       -t_srs <srs_def>
              Reproject/transform to this SRS on output, and assign it as out‐
              put SRS.

              A  source  SRS  must be available for reprojection to occur. The
              source SRS will be by default the one found in the source  layer
              when it is available, or as overridden by the user with -s_srs

              The coordinate reference systems that can be passed are anything
              supported by  the  OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput()  call,
              which  includes EPSG Projected, Geographic or Compound CRS (i.e.
              EPSG:4296), a well known text (WKT) CRS definition, PROJ.4  dec‐
              larations, or the name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS defi‐
              nition.

       -s_srs <srs_def>
              Override source SRS. If not specified the SRS found in the input
              layer  will  be used. This option has only an effect if used to‐
              gether with -t_srs to reproject.

              The coordinate reference systems that can be passed are anything
              supported  by  the  OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput() call,
              which includes EPSG Projected, Geographic or Compound CRS  (i.e.
              EPSG:4296),  a well known text (WKT) CRS definition, PROJ.4 dec‐
              larations, or the name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS defi‐
              nition.

       -ct <string>
              A  PROJ  string  (single  step operation or multiple step string
              starting with +proj=pipeline), a WKT2 string describing a  Coor‐
              dinateOperation, or a urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation:EPSG::XXXX
              URN overriding the default transformation from the source to the
              target  CRS.  It  must  take  into account the axis order of the
              source and target CRS.

              New in version 3.0.

       -preserve_fid
              Use the FID of the source features instead of letting the output
              driver  automatically assign a new one (for formats that require
              a FID). If not in append mode, this behavior is the  default  if
              the output driver has a FID layer creation option, in which case
              the name of the source FID column will be used and  source  fea‐
              ture IDs will be attempted to be preserved. This behavior can be
              disabled by setting -unsetFid.

       -fid fid
              If provided, only the feature with the specified feature id will
              be  processed.   Operates  exclusive of the spatial or attribute
              queries. Note: if you want to select several features  based  on
              their  feature id, you can also use the fact the 'fid' is a spe‐
              cial field recognized by OGR SQL. So, -where  "fid  in  (1,3,5)"
              would select features 1, 3 and 5.

       -limit nb_features
              Limit the number of features per layer.

       -oo NAME=VALUE
              Input dataset open option (format specific).

       -doo NAME=VALUE
              Destination dataset open option (format specific), only valid in
              -update mode.

       -gt n  Group n features per transaction (default 100 000). Increase the
              value for better performance when writing into DBMS drivers that
              have transaction support. n can be set to unlimited to load  the
              data into a single transaction.

       -ds_transaction
              Force  the  use of a dataset level transaction (for drivers that
              support such mechanism), especially for drivers such as  FileGDB
              that only support dataset level transaction in emulation mode.

       -clipsrc [xmin ymin xmax ymax]|WKT|datasource|spat_extent
              Clip  geometries  to  the  specified  bounding box (expressed in
              source SRS), WKT geometry  (POLYGON  or  MULTIPOLYGON),  from  a
              datasource  or to the spatial extent of the -spa.. option if you
              use the spat_extent keyword. When specifying a  datasource,  you
              will  generally  want  to  use it in combination of the -clipsr‐
              clayer, -clipsrcwhere or -clipsrcsql options

       -clipsrcsql <sql_statement>
              Select desired geometries using an SQL query instead.

       -clipsrclayer <layername>
              Select the named layer from the source clip datasource.

       -clipsrcwhere <expression>
              Restrict desired geometries based on attribute query.

       -clipdst <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
              Clip geometries after reprojection to the specified bounding box
              (expressed  in dest SRS), WKT geometry (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON)
              or from a datasource.  When specifying a  datasource,  you  will
              generally  want  to  use it in combination of the -clipdstlayer,
              -clipdstwhere or -clipdstsq.. options

       -clipdstsql <sql_statement>
              Select desired geometries using an SQL query instead.

       -clipdstlayer <layername>
              Select the named layer from the destination clip datasource.

       -clipdstwhere <expression>
              Restrict desired geometries based on attribute query.

       -wrapdateline
              Split geometries crossing the dateline  meridian  (long.  =  +/-
              180deg)

       -datelineoffset
              Offset  from dateline in degrees (default long. = +/- 10deg, ge‐
              ometries within 170deg to -170deg will be split)

       -simplify <tolerance>
              Distance tolerance for simplification. Note: the algorithm  used
              preserves topology per feature, in particular for polygon geome‐
              tries, but not for a whole layer.

       -segmentize <max_dist>
              Maximum distance between 2 nodes. Used  to  create  intermediate
              points.

       -makevalid
              Run the OGRGeometry::MakeValid() operation, followed by OGRGeom‐
              etryFactory::removeLowerDimensionSubGeoms(),  on  geometries  to
              ensure they are valid regarding the rules of the Simple Features
              specification.

       -fieldTypeToString type1,...
              Converts any field of the specified type  to  a  field  of  type
              string  in the destination layer. Valid types are : Integer, In‐
              teger64, Real,  String,  Date,  Time,  DateTime,  Binary,  Inte‐
              gerList,  Integer64List, RealList, StringList. Special value All
              can be used to convert all fields to strings.  This is an alter‐
              nate  way  to using the CAST operator of OGR SQL, that may avoid
              typing a long SQL query. Note that this does not  influence  the
              field types used by the source driver, and is only an afterwards
              conversion.

       -mapFieldType srctype|All=dsttype,...
              Converts any field of the specified type to another type.  Valid
              types  are : Integer, Integer64, Real, String, Date, Time, Date‐
              Time, Binary, IntegerList, Integer64List, RealList,  StringList.
              Types  can also include subtype between parenthesis, such as In‐
              teger(Boolean), Real(Float32), ...  Special  value  All  can  be
              used to convert all fields to another type. This is an alternate
              way to using the CAST operator of OGR SQL, that may avoid typing
              a  long  SQL  query.  This  is  a  generalization of -fieldType‐
              ToString.  Note that this does not  influence  the  field  types
              used by the source driver, and is only an afterwards conversion.

       -unsetFieldWidth
              Set field width and precision to 0.

       -splitlistfields
              Split fields of type StringList, RealList or IntegerList into as
              many fields of type String, Real or Integer as necessary.

       -maxsubfields <val>
              To be combined with -splitlistfields to limit the number of sub‐
              fields created for each split field.

       -explodecollections
              Produce  one  feature  for each geometry in any kind of geometry
              collection in the source file, applied after any -sql option.

       -zfield <field_name>
              Uses the specified field to fill the Z coordinate of geometries.

       -gcp <ungeoref_x> <ungeoref_y> <georef_x> <georef_y> <elevation>
              Add the indicated ground control point. This option may be  pro‐
              vided multiple times to provide a set of GCPs.

       -order <n>
              Order of polynomial used for warping (1 to 3). The default is to
              select a polynomial order based on the number of GCPs.

       -tps   Force use of thin plate spline transformer  based  on  available
              GCPs.

       -fieldmap
              Specifies the list of field indexes to be copied from the source
              to the destination. The (n)th value specified in the list is the
              index  of  the field in the target layer definition in which the
              n(th) field of the source layer  must  be  copied.  Index  count
              starts  at  zero.  To omit a field, specify a value of -1. There
              must be exactly as many values in the list as the count  of  the
              fields in the source layer. We can use the 'identity' setting to
              specify that the fields should be transferred by using the  same
              order.   This setting should be used along with the -append set‐
              ting.

       -addfields
              This is a specialized version of -append. Contrary  to  -append,
              -addfields  has the effect of adding, to existing target layers,
              the new fields found in source layers.  This  option  is  useful
              when  merging files that have non-strictly identical structures.
              This might not work for output formats that don't support adding
              fields  to  existing  non-empty layers. Note that if you plan to
              use -addfields, you may need to combine it with  -forceNullable,
              including for the initial import.

       -relaxedFieldNameMatch
              Do  field name matching between source and existing target layer
              in a more relaxed way if the target driver has an implementation
              for it.

       -forceNullable
              Do  not  propagate  not-nullable  constraints to target layer if
              they exist in source layer.

       -unsetDefault
              Do not propagate default field values to target  layer  if  they
              exist in source layer.

       -unsetFid
              Can  be  specified  to prevent the name of the source FID column
              and source feature IDs from being re-used for the target  layer.
              This  option  can for example be useful if selecting source fea‐
              tures with a ORDER BY clause.

       -emptyStrAsNull
              New in version 3.3.

              Treat empty string values as null.

       -resolveDomains
              New in version 3.3.

              When this is specified, any selected field that is linked  to  a
              coded  field  domain  will be accompanied by an additional field
              ({dstfield}_resolved), that will contain the description of  the
              coded value.

       -nomd  To  disable  copying  of metadata from source dataset and layers
              into target dataset and layers, when supported by output driver.

       -mo META-TAG=VALUE
              Passes a metadata key and value to set on  the  output  dataset,
              when supported by output driver.

       -noNativeData
              To disable copying of native data, i.e. details of source format
              not captured by OGR abstraction, that are otherwise preserved by
              some drivers (like GeoJSON) when converting to same format.

              New in version 2.1.

PERFORMANCE HINTS
       When writing into transactional DBMS (SQLite/PostgreSQL,MySQL, etc...),
       it might be beneficial to increase the number of INSERT statements exe‐
       cuted between BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT TRANSACTION statements. This
       number is specified with the -gt option. For example, for  SQLite,  ex‐
       plicitly  defining -gt 65536 ensures optimal performance while populat‐
       ing some table containing many hundreds of  thousands  or  millions  of
       rows.  However, note that -skipfailures overrides -gt and sets the size
       of transactions to 1.

       For PostgreSQL, the PG_USE_COPY config option can be set to YES  for  a
       significant  insertion  performance boost. See the PG driver documenta‐
       tion page.

       More generally, consult the documentation page of the input and  output
       drivers for performance hints.

C API
       This utility is also callable from C with GDALVectorTranslate().

EXAMPLES
       Basic conversion from Shapefile to GeoPackage:

          ogr2ogr \
            -f GPKG output.gpkg \
            input.shp

       Change the coordinate reference system from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857:

          ogr2ogr \
            -s_srs EPSG:4326 \
            -t_srs EPSG:3857 \
            -f GPKG output.gpkg \
            input.gpkg

       Example  appending to an existing layer (both -update and -append flags
       need to be used):

          ogr2ogr -update -append -f PostgreSQL PG:dbname=warmerda abc.tab

       Clip input layer with a bounding box (<xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>):

          ogr2ogr \
            -spat -13.931 34.886 46.23 74.12 \
            -f GPKG output.gpkg \
            natural_earth_vector.gpkg

       Filter Features by a -where clause:

          ogr2ogr \
            -where "\"POP_EST\" < 1000000" \
            -f GPKG output.gpkg \
            natural_earth_vector.gpkg \
            ne_10m_admin_0_countries

       Example reprojecting from ETRS_1989_LAEA_52N_10E to EPSG:4326 and clip‐
       ping to a bounding box:

          ogr2ogr -wrapdateline -t_srs EPSG:4326 -clipdst -5 40 15 55 france_4326.shp europe_laea.shp

       Example  for using the -fieldmap setting. The first field of the source
       layer is used to fill the third field (index 2 = third  field)  of  the
       target  layer,  the  second  field  of the source layer is ignored, the
       third field of the source layer used to fill the  fifth  field  of  the
       target layer.

          ogr2ogr -append -fieldmap 2,-1,4 dst.shp src.shp

       More examples are given in the individual format pages.
