SYNOPSIS
       stopmotion [--nonGUI <options>] file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly introduces the program and documents the commands available when running in non GUI mode.

       stopmotion  is a program for creating stop-motions animations from couple of images. You can use your favourite video device for grabbing the images as long you have a program capable of doing it.
       You just sets stopmotion to use the program. It's also possible to do the same with video export. Stopmotion has a set of tools which helps you creating the movements smooth and precise.

       -a DIR, --addFrames=DIR
              Creates a new project containing the images located in DIR (e.g. /foo/bar)
