NAME
       pvfs2-genconfig - create configuration files for PVFS2 servers

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-genconfig  [  --protocol protocol_name ] [ --port port_number ] [
       --ioservers list_of_servers  ]  [  --metaservers  list_of_servers  ]  [
       --logfile  pathname  ]  [ --storage pathname ] [ --quiet ] <global_con‐
       fig_file> <local_config_file>

DESCRIPTION
       pvfs2-genconfig helps create the config files used by  pvfs2-server(1).
       Users  can  pass  any  number  of  command  line options, in which case
       pvfs2-genconfig will not prompt and use the value of the options in the
       generated  config  file.   Without  any  command  line options, it will
       prompt the user for key information

       The global_config_file and local_config_file options warrant  a  little
       explanation.  pvfs2-genconfig will create one config file with settings
       applicable to every server in the system.   It  will  also  create  one
       smaller  config file with settings applicable to the individual servers
       in the system.  Getting the many server-specific config  files  out  to
       the server nodes is left as an exercise for the reader.

OPTIONS
       --protocol
              The communication method the servers will use.  As of this writ‐
              ing, the only supported options are "gm" (for myrinet  networks)
              and "tcp".

       --port The port the server will bind to.  This port should be appropri‐
              ate for the protocol: GM ports must be in  the  range  0-7,  for
              example.

       --ioservers
              A  comma-delimited  list  of  servers  used for datafiles.  This
              option can be given more than  one  time.   Each  instance  will
              append to the list of servers.

       --metaservers
              A  comma-delimited  list  of  servers  used  for metadata.  This
              option can be given more than  one  time.   Each  instance  will
              append to the list of servers.  Note that as of pvfs-0.0.3, more
              than one metadata server is not supported.

       --logfile
              Directory in which the server will create its logfile.

       --storage
              Directory in which the server will create its storage space

       --quiet
              Generate the config file w/o echoing any output to the screen.
