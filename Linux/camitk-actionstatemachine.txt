       camitk-actionstatemachine  is  able  to replay a pipeline (workflow) of CamiTK actions.  This application takes an CamiTK augmented version of a SCXML subset as input and interactively replays the
       described state-machine. The state-machine contains a list of CamiTK actions and transitions.

       The targeted users are in R&D departments or laboratories.
