NAME
       MooseX::Types::CheckedUtilExports - Wrap Moose::Util::TypeConstraints to be safer for MooseX::Types

VERSION
       version 0.51

DESCRIPTION
       Prevents errors like:

           subtype Foo =>
           ...

       Which should be written as:

           subtype Foo,
           ...

       When using MooseX::Types. Exported by that module.

       Exports checked versions of the following subs:

       "type" "subtype" "maybe_type" "duck_type" "enum" "coerce" "from" "as"

       While "class_type" and "role_type" will also register the type in the library.

       From Moose::Util::TypeConstraints. See that module for syntax.
