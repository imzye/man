DESCRIPTION
       Status/Is it playable?

       A bit, but not much fun yet. (No real levels, just a testbed for the enemy-formations). Anyway its stable and runs without throwing coredumps around. Start the game with ketm. In the game you need
       only cursor-keys and space. With ESC you can abort a game.
