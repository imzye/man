NAME
       mimepostcard - send/output a multipart/alternative message

SYNOPSIS
       Usage:

           mimepostcard /path/to/some/graphic.jpg to@addr.com

       You can point it at a .gif file as well.  The special address "-" just
       causes the message to go to STDOUT.

DESCRIPTION
       This sends a mesasge both as HTML and plain text.  I use "Data"; you
       would probably use "Path".
