       stackcollapse-php.php  collapse php function traces into single lines.

       Parses php samples generated by xdebug with xdebug.trace_format = 1 and
       outputs stacks as single lines, with methods separated  by  semicolons,
       and  then  a space and an occurrence count. For use with flamegraph.pl.
       See https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph.

       USAGE: ./stackcollapse-php.php [OPTIONS] infile > outfile

       -h --help
              Show this message

       -t     Weight stack counts by duration using  the  time  index  in  the
              trace (default)

       -c     Invocation counts only. Simply count stacks in the trace and sum
              duplicates, don't weight by duration.

       Example input: For more  info  on  xdebug  and  generating  traces  see
       https://xdebug.org/docs/execution_trace.
