NAME
       aklog-kafs - AFS Kerberos authentication tool

SYNOPSIS
       aklog-kafs [<cell> [<realm>]]

       *** NOTE THE ABOVE IS PROVISIONAL AND IS LIKELY TO CHANGE *** ®

DESCRIPTION
       This  program is used to get an authentication ticket from Kerberos that can be used by the in-kernel AFS filesystem (kAFS) to perform authenticated and encrypted accesses to the server.  Without this
       only unencrypted anonymous accesses can be made.

       Before calling this, the kinit program or similar should be invoked to authenticate with the appropriate Kerberos server.

ARGUMENTS
       <cell> This is the name of the cell with which the ticket is intended to be used.  If not given, the name of the default cell will be read from /proc/net/afs/rootcell and used instead.

       <realm>
              This is the name of the Kerberos realm from which the ticket will be obtained.
