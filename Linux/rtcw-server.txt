NAME
       wolfded - Return to Castle Wolfenstein dedicated server

SYNOPSIS
       wolfded [-h|--help] [-q|--quiet] [+set option value]...  [+command] ...

DESCRIPTION
       wolfded is the dedicated server for the first-person shooter Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

OPTIONS
       The wrapper script used for RTCW in Debian accepts these options:

       -h, --help
              Display a short help summary

       -q, --quiet
              Disable all output

       Any  console  command  can also be prefixed with + and used as a command-line option (run the server in a terminal to use the console).  The +set command is generally the most useful to use on the
       command line.

       Options that can be set with +set (note that this is not a full list!) include:

ENVIRONMENT
       The wrapper script used to launch RTCW allows it to be debugged by setting environment variables.

       RTCW_DEBUGGER=command
              A debugger or other prefix to prepend to the RTCW command line, such as strace; overridden by RTCW_BACKTRACE

       RTCW_BACKTRACE=1
              Use gdb(1) to get a backtrace if RTCW crashes (the gdb package must be installed for this to work)
