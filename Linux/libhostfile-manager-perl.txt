               $manager->write_hostfile;

ACCESSORS
       Str path_prefix( [Str $prefix] )
             Defines the prefix that will be searched for hostfile fragments.  Defaults to '/etc/hostfiles/'.

             The contents of the hostfile under management.

       HashRef fragments
             The available hostfile fragments.

       Array fragment_list
             A list of the names of available fragments.

       Str get_fragment( Str $fragment_name )
             The contents of an individual hostfile fragment.
