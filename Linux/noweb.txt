NAME
       nowebstyle - LaTeX package for noweb

SYNOPSIS
       \usepackage{noweb}

DESCRIPTION
       When  noweave generates code for LaTeX, the noweb package is required.  In addition to the necessary arcana, it defines a webcode environment in which you can place fragments of code, and in which
       only backslash and curly braces have their special meanings; all other characters are taken literally.  It also defines a noweb pagestyle.  Finally, it defines a  \noweboptions{...}  command  that
       can be used to tinker with the appearance of the output.  Options are separated by commas and include:

       margintag
              Put the sub-page number (tag) of each code-chunk definition in the left margin. (Default)

       nomargintag
              Don't use margin tags.

       shift  Shift text to the left so that long code lines won't extend off the right-hand side of the page.

       smallcode
              Set code in LaTeX \small font instead of \normalsize.  Similar options exist for all the LaTeX size-changing commands.

       longxref, shortxref, noxref
              Choose  a style for chunk cross-reference.  Long style uses  small paragraphs after each chunk, as in Knuth.  Short style uses symbols on the definition line, as in Hanson.  noxref provides
              no chunk cross-reference.  Defaults to shortxref.

       alphasubpage, numsubpage, nosubpage
              Number chunks by the number of the page on which they appear, followed by an alphabetic (numeric, not used) ``sub-page'' indicator.  Defaults to alphasubpage.  nosubpage  implies  nomargin‐
              tag.

       webnumbering
              Number chunks consecutively, in WEB style, instead of using sub-page numbers.

       subscriptidents, nosubscriptidents, hyperidents, nohyperidents
              Controls  subscripting  of  identifiers  in  code,  including quoted code.  Selecting subscriptidents means an identifier appearing in a code chunk (or in quoted code within a documentation
              chunk) will be subscripted with the chunk number of its definition.  hyperidents means such identifiers will be hyperlinked to their definitions, provided of course that a hypertext package
              like hyperref is loaded.  nosubscriptidents and nohyperidents are equivalent, and they turn off such markings.  The default is hyperidents.

       subscriptquotedidents, nosubscriptquotedidents, hyperquotedidents, nohyperquotedidents
              Controls linking of identifiers as above, but applies only to uses of identifiers in quoted code.

       hideunuseddefs
              Omit defined but unused identifiers from the local identifier cross-reference (Preston Briggs).

       noidentxref
              Omit the local identifier cross-reference which follows each code chunk.

       externalindex
              Use an index generated with noindex(1) (q.v.).

       longchunks
              When expanding \nowebchunks, show page numbers of definitions and uses of each chunk.

       english, french, german, portuges, icelandic
              Write cross-reference information in the language specified.  Defaults to english.

CONTROL SEQUENCES
       The noweb package describes a gazillion special control sequences.  Only a few are listed here.

       \nextchunklabel{l}
              Associates label l with the sub-page reference of the next code chunk.  Can be used in for concise chunk cross-reference with, e.g., chunk~\subpageref{l}.

       \nwanchorto{URL}{anchor text}
              Creates a link to the given URL with the given anchor text.  Implemented in latex(1) using footnotes, but sl2h(1) translates this to <a href=URL>anchor text</a>

       \nwanchorname{name}{anchor text}
              Creates an anchor point for a hyperlink.  Implemented in latex(1) using \label , but sl2h(1) translates this to <a name=name>anchor text</a>

       \ifhtml ... \fi
              Text between \ifhtml and \fi is ignored by latex(1), but sl2h(1) and the l2h noweb filter translate the text into HTML.

COMPATIBILITY
       For compatibility with plain TeX, noweb continues to use the old-style font commands \tt and so on.  When used with the KOMA scripts (document classes scrartcl, scrreprt, and scrbook), noweb needs
       the document-class option enabledeprecatedfontcommands.
