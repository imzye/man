NAME
       fauhdlc - Compile VHDL files to intermediate code.

SYNOPSIS

       fauhdlc [flags] [ --output filename ] [ --c-output filename ] [ --lib library  [  vhdl-file  ]...] { vhdl-file ...}

DESCRIPTION
       fauhdlc is a VHDL compiler, that will output intermediate code or C-code. It supports a subset of the VHDL 2000 standard.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

       -o, --output output-file
           Output intermediate code into output-file.

       -l, --lib library-name
           Put the following VHDL-files into the library with name library-name. If no --lib is present, all files will be put into the library "work".

       -f, --freestanding
           Do not preload any library except std.vhdl. By default, fauhdlc will preload common libraries (currently only std_logic_1164) in the appropriate library namespace. The --freestanding prevents
           this behaviour, for example if you want to override the implementation of such a library.

       -Werror
           Treat warnings as errors.

       -p, --parse-only
           Stop with compilation after parsing the source file(s). Mainly useful for debugging the compiler.

       -d, --dot-parse dot-file
           Output the raw syntax tree into dot-file, which can be used with the GraphViz tools.

       -c, --dot-const dot-file
           Output the syntax tree that exists after performing constant folding into dot-file, which can be used with the GraphViz tools.

       -C, --c-output c-file
           Generate output as a C file c-file, that can be compiled with a C-compiler, e.g.  gcc. This option is yet experimental.
