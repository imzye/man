NAME
       nobodd-tftpd - nobodd-tftpd - serve boot partition files over TFTP

       A read-only TFTP server capable of reading FAT boot partitions from within image files or devices. Intended to be paired with a block-device service (e.g.  NBD) for netbooting Raspberry Pis.

SYNOPSIS
          usage: nobodd-tftpd [-h] [--version] [--listen ADDR] [--port PORT]
                              [--board SERIAL,FILENAME[,PART[,IP]]]

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show the help message and exit

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       --board SERIAL,FILENAME[,PART[,IP]]
              can be specified multiple times to define boards which are to be served boot images over TFTP; if PART is omitted the default is 1; if IP is omitted the IP address will not be checked

       --listen ADDR
              the address on which to listen for connections (default: "::" for all addresses)

       --port PORT
              the port on which to listen for connections (default: "tftp" which is port 69)

CONFIGURATION
       nobodd-tftpd can be configured via the command line, or from several configuration files. These are structured as INI-style files with bracketed [sections] containing key=value lines, and op‐
       tionally #-prefixed comments. The configuration files which are read, and the order they are consulted is as follows:

       1. /etc/nobodd/nobodd.conf

       2. /usr/local/etc/nobodd/nobodd.conf

       3. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nobodd/nobodd.conf (where $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config if unset)

       Later files override settings from files earlier in this order.

       The configuration file may contain a [tftp] section which may contain the following values:

       listen This is equivalent to the --listen parameter and specifies the address(es) on which the server will listen for incoming TFTP connections.

       port   This  is equivalent to the --port parameter and specifies the UDP port on which the server will listen for incoming TFTP connections. Please note that only the initial TFTP packet will
              arrive on this port. Each "connection" is allocated its own ephemeral port <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port> on the  server  and  all  subsequent  packets  will  use  this
              ephemeral port.

       includedir
              If this is specified, it provides the name of a directory which will be scanned for files matching the pattern *.conf. Any files found matching will be read as additional configuration
              files, in sorted filename order.

       For example:

          [tftp]
          listen = 192.168.0.0/16
          port = tftp
          includedir = /etc/nobodd/conf.d

       For  each image the TFTP server is expected to serve to a Raspberry Pi, a [board:SERIAL] section should be defined. Here, "SERIAL" should be replaced by the serial number of the Raspberry Pi.
       The serial number can be found in the output of cat /proc/cpuinfo at runtime. For example:

          $ grep ^Serial /proc/cpuinfo
          Serial          : 100000001234abcd

       If the serial number starts with 10000000 (as in the example above), exclude the initial one and all leading zeros. So the above Pi has a serial number of 1234abcd  (in  hexadecimal).  Within
       the section the following values are valid:

       image  Specifies the full path to the operating system image to serve to the specified Pi, presumably prepared with nobodd-prep.

       partition
              Optionally specifies the number of the boot partition. If this is not specified it defaults to 1.

       ip     Optionally limits serving any files from this image unless the IP address of the client matches. If this is not specified, any IP address may retrieve files from this share.

       For example:

          [board:1234abcd]
          image = /srv/images/ubuntu-24.04-server.img
          partition = 1
          ip = 192.168.0.5

       In  practice, what this means is that requests from a client with the IP address "192.168.0.5", for files under the path "1234abcd/", will be served from the FAT file-system on partition 1 of
       the image stored at /srv/images/ubuntu-24.04-server.img.

       Such definitions can be produced by nobodd-prep when it is provided with the nobodd-prep --serial option.

       Boards may also be defined on the command-line with the --board option. These definitions will augment (and override, where the serial number is identical) those definitions provided  by  the
       configuration files.

SYSTEMD/INETD USAGE
       The  server  may inherit its listening socket from a managing process. In the case of inetd(8) where the listening socket is traditionally passed as stdin (fd 0), pass "stdin" as the value of
       --listen (or the listen option within the [tftp] section of the configuration file).

       In the case of systemd(1), where the listening socket(s) are passed via the environment, specify "systemd" as the value of --listen (or the listen option within the [tftp] section of the con‐
       figuration file) and the service will expect to find a single socket passed in LISTEN_FDS. This will happen implicitly if the service is declared as  socket-activated.  However,  the  service
       must not use Accept=yes as the TFTP protocol is connection-less. The example units provided in the source code demonstrate using socket-activation with the server.

       In  both  cases,  the service manager sets the port that the service will listen on, so the --port option (and the port option in the [tftp] section of the configuration file) is silently ig‐
       nored.
