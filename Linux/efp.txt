NAME
       efp - Escape from Pong NES game

SYNOPSIS
       nes [options] /usr/share/nes/efp.nes | /usr/share/nes/efpbw.nes

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the game Escape from Pong.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       efp  is a game of pong for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) with a twist.  In this version you control the ball, and your objective is to escape the board safely.  You will need to fake out
       the paddle, fight against gravity, and avoid the (red) wall of death to survive.

       The two ROMs efp and efpbw differ only in the direction of the thrust when using the arrow keys.  This is so that you can use whichever way is more comfortable for you.

NOTES
       You will need an emulator for the NES in order to play this game.  Unfortunately, I have found that it doesn't work correctly with all emulators.  One that I have tested is FCE Ultra, so try  that
       if your regular one doesn't work.  See /usr/share/doc/efp/README.Debian for more details.
