NAME
       Color - Color Correct a TIFF file using any sequence of ICC profiles or Calibrations.

DESCRIPTION
       Color Correct a TIFF or JPEG file using any sequence of ICC profiles or Calibrations

SYNOPSIS
       cctiff [-options] {[-iintent] profile.icc | calbrtn.cal ...} infile.(tif|jpg) outfile.(tif|jpg)

       -v     Verbose.

       -c     Combine linearisation curves into one transform.

       -p     Use slow precise correction.

       -k     Check fast result against precise, and report.

       -r n   Override the default CLUT resolution

       -t n   Choose output encoding from 1..n

       -f [T|J]
              Set output format to Tiff or Jpeg (Default is same as input)

       -q quality
              Set JPEG quality 1..100 (Default 80)

       -a     Read and Write planes > 4 as alpha planes

       -I     Ignore any file or profile colorspace mismatches

       -D     Don't append or set the output TIFF or JPEG description

       -e profile.[icc | tiff | jpg]
              Optionally embed a profile in the destination TIFF or JPEG file.

              Then for each profile in sequence:

       -i intent
              p = perceptual, r = relative colorimetric, s = saturation, a = absolute colorimetric

       -o order
              n = normal (priority: lut > matrix > monochrome) r = reverse (priority: monochrome > matrix > lut)

       profile.[icc | tiff]
              Device, Link or Abstract profile

              ( May be embedded profile in TIFF/JPEG file)

              or each calibration file in sequence:

       -d dir f = forward cal. (default), b = backwards cal.

       calbrtn.cal
              Device calibration file.

       infile.tif/jpg
              Input TIFF/JPEG file in appropriate color space

              outfile.tif/jpg Output TIFF/JPEG file

cctiff                                                                                           September 2014                                                                                        COLOR(1)
