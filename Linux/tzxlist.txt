NAME
       tzxlist — Sinclair ZX Spectrum “real” tape file lister

SYNOPSIS
       tzxlist [OPTION] tapefile...

DESCRIPTION
       tzxlist  outputs  a  description  of  the contents of TZX, TAP, PZX and
       Warajevo TAP tape files.

       On supported systems it attempts to handle conversions of the  de-facto
       standard TZX Windows-1252 character encoding to the charset used on the
       current system. If a problem with conversion is encountered any  appli‐
       cable strings will be output as-is.

OPTIONS
       -d block number
              The  block  number specified will be dumped to files: the header
              (.hdr), the data (.dat) and a description (.dsc). The former two
              are  binary  files and the latter is a text file. Set -1 for all
              blocks.

       -h, --help
              give brief usage help, listing available options.

       -V, --version
              output version information.

       tapefile
              specifies a tape file whose contents are to be listed.

BUGS
       None known.
