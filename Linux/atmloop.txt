NAME
       atmloop - get/set loopback mode of ATM interfaces

SYNOPSIS
       atmloop -s [-l level] [-r level] [itf]
       atmloop [itf]
       atmloop -q [itf]
       atmloop -V

DESCRIPTION
       atmloop sets or shows the current loopback settings of an ATM interface, and allows to query the loopback modes supported by the interface.

       Some ATM cards can be configured to echo data back to the driver (local loopback) or to the network (remote loopback). The echoing may be done at several different levels:

       aal    AAL PDUs

       atm    ATM cells

       digital
              bits sent to or received from the line interface

       analog the analog signal

       The levels supported by an interface can be queried with the -q option.  If invoked without options, atmloop displays the current loopback settings.

OPTIONS
       -s     set loopback mode. Followed by either -l or -r, both options to set local and remote loopback at the same time (if supported by the driver), or none of them to turn off any loopback.

       -l level
              enable local loopback.

       -r level
              enable remote loopback.

       -q level
              query loopback levels supported by the interface.

       -V     print version number of atmloop on standard output and exit.
