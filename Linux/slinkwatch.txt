NAME
       slinkwatch - automatic maintenance of Suricata monitoring interfaces

SYNOPSIS
       slinkwatch [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       slinkwatch  is  a  tool  to dynamically maintain interface entries in Suricata's configuration file, depending on what network interfaces are connected. It is meant to ease deployment of identical
       sensor installations at many heterogenous sites, allowing to make full use of the sensor resources in the light of varying monitoring volume.
