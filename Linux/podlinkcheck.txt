DESCRIPTION
       PodLinkCheck parses Perl POD from a script, module or documentation and checks that "L<>" links within it refer to a known program, module, or man page.

           L<foo>          check module, pod or program "foo"
           L<foo/section>    and check section within the pod
           L<bar(1)>       check man page "bar(1)"

       The command line is either individual files or whole directories.  For a directory all the .pl, .pm and .pod files under it are checked.  So for example to churn through all installed add-on modules,

           podlinkcheck /usr/share/perl5

       Bad links are usually typos in the module name or section name, or sometimes "L<display|target>" parts the wrong way around.  Occasionally there may be an "L<foo>" used where just markup "C<>" or
       "I<>" was intended.

   Checks
       External links are checked by seeking the target .pm module or .pod documentation in the @INC path (per Pod::Find), or seeking a script (no file extension) in the usual executable "PATH".  A section
       name in a link is checked by parsing the POD in the target file.

       If a module is not installed in @INC or extra "-I" directories then its existence is also checked in the CPAN indexes with "App::cpanminus", "CPAN::SQLite", "CPAN" or "CPANPLUS".  Nothing is
       downloaded, just current data consulted.  A warning is given if a section name in a link goes unchecked because it's on CPAN but not available locally.

       If checking your own work then most likely you will have copies of cross-referenced modules installed (having compared or tried them).  In that sense the CPAN index lookups are a fallback.

       Manpage links are checked by asking the "man" program if it recognises the name, including any number part like chmod(2).  A manpage can also satisfy what otherwise appears to be a POD link with no
       sub-section, since there's often some confusion between the two.

   Internal Links
       Internal links are sometimes written

           L<SYNOPSIS>                     # may be ambiguous

       but the Perl 5.10 "perlpodspec" advice is to avoid ambiguity between an external module and a one-word internal section by writing a section with / or quotes,

           See L</SYNOPSIS> above.         # good

           See L<"SYNOPSIS"> above.        # good

       "podlinkcheck" warns about "L<SYNOPSIS>" section links.  But not if it's both an valid external module and internal section -- because it's not uncommon to have a module name as a heading or item and
       an "L<>" link still meaning the external one.

   Section Name Matching
       An "L<>" section name can use just the first word of an item or heading.  This is how "Pod::Checker" behaves and it's good for "perlfunc" cross references where just the function name can be given
       without the full argument list of the "=item".  Eg.

           L<perlfunc/split>

       The first word is everything up to the first whitespace.  This doesn't come out very well on a target like "=item somefun( ARG )", but it's how "Pod::Checker" 1.45 behaves.  If the targets are your
       own then you might make the first word or full item something sensible to appear in an "L<>".

       If a target section is not found then "podlinkcheck" will try to suggest something close, eg. differing only in punctuation or upper/lower case.  Some of the POD translators may ignore upper/lower
       case anyway, but it's good to write an "L<>" the same as the actual target.

           foo.pl:130:31: no section "constructor" in "CHI"
             (file /usr/share/perl5/CHI.pm)
             perhaps it should be "CONSTRUCTOR"

       For reference, numbered "=item" section names go in an "L<>" without the number.  This is good since the numbering might change.  If "podlinkcheck" suggests a number in a target then it may be a
       mistake in the target document.  A numbered item should have the number alone on the "=item" and the section name as the next paragraph.

           =item 1.                        # good

           The First Thing                 # the section name

           Paragraph about this thing.

           =item 2. The Second Thing       # bad

           Paragraph about this next thing.

       The second item "2. The Second Thing" is not a numbered item for POD purposes, but rather text that happens to start with a number.  Of course sometimes that's what you want, eg.

           =item 64 Bit Support

       "podlinkcheck" uses "Pod::Simple" for parsing and so follows its interpretation of the various hairy "L<>" link forms.  If an "L<>" appears to be mis-interpreted you might rewrite or add some escapes
       (like E<sol>) for the benefit of all translators which use "Pod::Simple".  In Perl 5.10 that includes the basic "pod2man".

   Other Ways to Do It
       "podchecker" (the "Pod::Checker" module) checks internal links, but it doesn't check external links.

       "Test::Pod::LinkCheck" is similar in a .t test framework.  It uses some of PodLinkCheck but different reporting and a stricter approach to dubious POD.

EXIT STATUS
       Exit is 0 for no problems found, or non-zero for problems.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       "PATH"
           The search path for installed scripts.

       "HOME"
           Used by the various "CPAN" modules for "~/.cpan" etc directories.

       "PERL5LIB"
           The usual extra Perl module directories (see "ENVIRONMENT" in perlrun), which become @INC where link targets are sought.

BUGS
       "App::cpanminus" is checked first since it's a bsearch of 02packages.details.txt, and "CPAN::SQLite" second since it's a database lookup.  But if a target is not found there then the full "CPAN" and
       "CPANPLUS" caches are loaded and checked.  This might use a fair bit of memory for a non-existent target, but it's also possible they're more up-to-date.

       No attempt is made to tell which of the indexes is the most up-to-date.  If a module has been renamed (bad) then it may still exist in an old index.  The suggestion is to avoid having old stuff lying
       around (including old mirror files in "App::cpanminus").

       The code consulting "CPAN.pm" may need a tolerably new version of that module, maybe 1.61 circa Perl 5.8.0.  On earlier versions its index is not used.

       The line:column number reported for an offending "L<>" is found by some gambits extending what "Pod::Simple" normally records.  There's a chance it could be a little off within the paragraph.

       "Pod::Simple" prior to version 3.24 didn't allow dots "." in man-page names, resulting in for example login.conf(5) being treated as a Perl module name not a man page name.  If you have such links
       then use "Pod::Simple" 3.24 up.

       Directories are currently traversed using File::Find::Iterator.  It follows symlinks but neither its version 0.4 nor PodLinkCheck guard against infinite descent into symlink cycles.  The intention
       perhaps would be follow all symlinks to files, but follow to a directory just once as protection against cycles.

FILES
       ~/.cpanm/sources/*/02packages.details.txt files from "App::cpanminus"

       ~/.cpan/cpandb.sql used by "CPAN::SQLite"

       ~/.cpan/Metadata used by "CPAN"

       ~/.cpanplus/* variously used by "CPANPLUS"
