NAME
       corosync-qdevice-net-certutil  - tool to generate qdevice model net TLS
       certificates

SYNOPSIS
       corosync-qdevice-net-certutil [-i|-m|-M|-r|-s|-Q] [-c certificate]  [-n
       cluster_name]

DESCRIPTION
       corosync-qdevice-net-certutil  is  a frontend for NSS certutil used for
       generating client certificate for the net model of qdevice.

OPTIONS
       -i     Initialize the QDevice Net NSS certificate  database.   The  de‐
              fault  directory for the database is /etc/corosync/qdevice/net/.
              This directory has to be writable by the current user. It  needs
              the  QNetd  CA certificate passed as the -c parameter. This cer‐
              tificate can be found on the server running QNetd  in  the  file
              /etc/corosync/qnetd/nssdb/qnetd-cacert.crt.

       -m     Import the cluster certificate and key from a pk12 file.

       -r     Generate  a  certificate request. The certificate request is ex‐
              ported into  /etc/corosync/qdevice/net/qdevice-net-node.crq.  It
              is  necessary  to  pass the cluster name using the -n parameter.
              The  cluster  name   has   to   match   the   one   defined   in
              /etc/corosync/corosync.conf.

       -M     Import  a  signed certificate and export a certificate with pri‐
              vate key into pk12 file.

       -Q     Use ssh/scp to properly set both  corosync-qnetd  and  corosync-
              qdevice  certificates on all nodes. It's highly recommended that
              you use an ssh agent, or ssh/scp will keep asking for a password
              - roughly 8 times the number of nodes.

       -c     File with certificate to load.

       -n     Name of the cluster.
