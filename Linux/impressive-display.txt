NAME
       impressive-display - Fullscreen PDF Display Session Manager

SYNOPSIS
       impressive-display

DESCRIPTION
       impressive-display is a wrapper around impressive. It can turn a system into a PDF based display terminal.

       impressive-display registers itself as an x-session-manager alternative and provides a very minimal X11 session, launching the matchbox-window-manager, pulseaudio (if requested) and unclutter (if
       requested) before starting a fullscreen PDF, image, and video presentation.

OPTIONS
       impressive-display ignores all given command line options. The Impressive PDF Display can be configured system-wide via /etc/default/impressive-display. Overrides can be configured on a per-user
       basis via $HOME/.impressive-display/config
