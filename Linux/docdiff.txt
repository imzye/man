NAME
       docdiff — character/word-oriented diff

SYNOPSIS
       docdiff [options]  file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the docdiff       commands.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the HTML format; see below.

       docdiff  is  a  program that compares two files and shows the difference.  It can compare files word by word, char by char, or line by line.  It has several output formats such as HTML/XHTML, tty,
       Manued, or user-defined markup.

       It supports several encodings and end-of-line characters, including ASCII, UTF-8, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS, CR, LF, and CRLF.
