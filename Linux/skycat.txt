NAME
       rtdCubeDisplay - simple FITS cube display program

SYNOPSIS
       rtdCubeDisplay -f <filename> -c <cameraname> [-l] [-t msec] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       rtdCubeDisplay  displays  FITS  cube images for the real-time display.  By specifying a FITS cube file (option -f) and a camera name (option -c) the images are extracted from the file and an image
       event is sent to the rtdServer. In order to display the image a rtd widget application e.g. 'rtd' must register to the same camera name as specified above.  For the 'rtd' application this is  done
       by  setting the RTD_CAMERA environment.

       -f <filename>
              FITS cube images

       -c <cameraname>
              Camera name to identify real time source

       -l     Loop indefinetly

       -t msec
              Delay time between cube images (in msec) default 500 ms
