NAME
       lstape - list tape devices.

SYNOPSIS
       lstape          [-h|--help] [--scsi-only|--ccw-only] [-v|--version] [-V|--verbose]
                       [--online|--offline] [-s]
                       [-t <device-type>[,<device-type>]...]
                       [<device-bus-ID>...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  lstape  command  lists  all  available  tape  devices  on the current host. For channel attached tape devices this output is the same as the contents of
       /proc/tapedevices (which is obsolete) but also includes offline devices. By default all tape devices are displayed.

       The lstape command without the --ccw-only option causes extra SAN traffic for each SCSI tape or changer device by invoking the sg_inq command.

OPTIONS
       -h or --help
               Print help text.

       -v or --version
               Print the version of the s390-tools package and the command.

       -V or --verbose
               Adds additional information that does not fit into a single line of output.  This is currently only used for SCSI devices.

       --scsi-only|--ccw-only
               Limit output to either SCSI or channel attached tape devices. The output without SCSI devices is the same as it was with previous  versions  of  this
               command.

       -s|--shortid
               Using  this  option  will list only tape devices that are in channel subsystem 0, with subchannel set 0. All other devices will be suppressed and the
               leading "0.0." for bus IDs of the remaining devices will be removed.  Since this is specific to CCW devices this option has no effect on  the  output
               of SCSI tape devices.

       --online|--offline
               Limit output to either online or offline devices. This filter has no effect on the output of SCSI devices.

       -t|--type <device-type>
               Limit output to given device types, for example 3490 (currently only applies to channel-attached tape devices).

       <device-bus-ID>
               Limits the output to information about the specified tape device or devices only. For CCW-attached devices only.

OUTPUT FIELDS FOR SCSI TAPE/CHANGER DEVICES
       Generic
              SCSI generic device file for the tape drive, for example /dev/sg0.  "N/A" if the SCSI generic (sg) kernel functionality is not available.

       Device Main  character  device  node  file  for accessing the tape drive or medium changer.  SCSI tape devices are only visible if they are known to the SCSI
              layer. There are at least two possible drivers that can claim a SCSI tape device. The lstape command tries to determine the  device  driver.  For  the
              generic  tape  and changer driver the device names start with "st" or "sch", while for the IBM tape driver this would be "IBMtape" or "IBMchanger". If
              "N/A" is shown, the device driver could not be determined.

       Target Linux SCSI device name in H:C:T:L format.

       Vendor The vendor field from the SCSI device.

       Model  The model field from the SCSI device.

       Type   "tapedrv" for a tape drive or "changer" for a medium changer.

       State  The state of the SCSI device object in the kernel.  Any state other than "running" can indicate problems.

       For SCSI devices, the --verbose option additionally displays:

       HBA    The device bus-ID of the FCP device or of the virtio-scsi-ccw virtual HBA through which the tape drive is attached.  "N/A" if the device does not have
              a sysfs ancestor with subsystem ccw.

       WWPN   The WWPN (worldwide port name) of the tape drive in the SAN.  "N/A" if device is not attached through zfcp.

       Serial The serial number.  "NO/INQ" if there is no sg_inq command available.  "NO/SG" if no SCSI generic (sg) kernel support is available.

EXAMPLES
       lstape
              List all tape devices that are available

       lstape --ccw-only -t 3490 --online
              Show all 3490 CCW devices that are online.

       lstape --scsi-only --verbose
              Show all SCSI tape or changer devices with maximum information.
