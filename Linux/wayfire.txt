NAME
       wayfire — modular and extensible wayland compositor

SYNOPSIS
       wayfire [-c, --config config_file] [-B, --config-backend config_backend] [-d, --debug] [-D, --damage-debug] [-h, --help] [-R, --damage-renderer] [-v, --version]

DESCRIPTION
       wayfire  is  a  wayland compositor focusing on modularity and extensibility by providing a small core compositor implementation with all major functionality being provided by plugins.  The default
       plugins provide 3D effects similar to compiz, such as 3D cube, wobbly windows, blur, fish eye, etc.

       The optional flags are described as follows:

       -c, --config config_file

               Start  wayfire  with  an  alternative  configuration  file.   The  default  configuration  file  is  searched  first  in  the  ${WAYFIRE_CONFIG_FILE}   environment   variable,   or   paths
               ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/wayfire.ini, ${HOME}/.config/wayfire.ini.

       -B, --config-backend config_backend

               Specify config backend to use.

       -d, --debug

               Enable debug logging.

       -D, --damage-debug

               Enable additional debug for damaged regions.

       -h, --help

               Print a short help message.

       -R, --damage-renderer

               Rerender damaged regions.

       -v, --version

               Print the version.
