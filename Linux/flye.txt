DESCRIPTION
       Input reads can be in FASTA or FASTQ format, uncompressed or compressed with gz. Currently, PacBio (raw, corrected, HiFi) and ONT reads (raw, corrected) are supported.  Expected  error  rates  are
       <30%  for  raw,  <3% for corrected, and <1% for HiFi. Note that Flye was primarily developed to run on raw reads. Additionally, the --subassemblies option performs a consensus assembly of multiple
       sets of high-quality contigs. You may specify multiple files with reads (separated by spaces). Mixing different  read  types  is  not  yet  supported.  The  --meta  option  enables  the  mode  for
       metagenome/uneven coverage assembly.

       You must provide an estimate of the genome size as input, which is used for solid k-mers selection. Standard size modifiers are supported (e.g. 5m or 2.6g). In the case of metagenome assembly, the
       expected total assembly size should be provided.

       To  reduce memory consumption for large genome assemblies, you can use a subset of the longest reads for initial disjointig assembly by specifying --asm-coverage option. Typically, 40x coverage is
       enough to produce good disjointigs.

       You can run Flye polisher as a standalone tool using --polish-target option.
