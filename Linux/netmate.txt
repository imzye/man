NAME
       netmate - displays network protocol headers in uniform RFC like format

SYNOPSIS
       netmate filename

DESCRIPTION
       Netmate  is a GTK+ program that shows network protocols headers in 32-bit aligned fields, identical as they are represented in Request for Comments (RFCs).  It can be used to learn and teach about
       network protocols and to understand their functionality and collaboration.

       This tool supports input files in pcap(ng) format as they are created by tcpdump, wireshark or other code based on libpcap.

       Netmate is written in C and released under the GNU General Public License.  It was inspired by netdude, that is not further developed any more.

       Currently the following network protocols are supported:
       - Layer 2: Ethernet, SLL (Linux Cooked)
       - Layer 3: ARP, ICMP, ICMPv6, IPv4, IPv6
       - Layer 4: TCP, UDP

DEVELOPMENT
       This tool is still under development! Please send any further wishes, feature requests or problems in compiling and execution to ruport@f00l.de.  Also send me any more network protocols  you  want
       to be supported in future releases.
