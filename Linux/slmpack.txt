NAME
       slmpack - convert the ARPA format of SunPinyin back-off language model to its binary representation

SYNOPSIS
       slmpack arpa_file dict_file binary_slm_file

DESCRIPTION
       slmpack converts the ARPA format of a threaded SunPinyin back-off language model to its binary representation.

NOTE
       If you convert a language model to ARPA format using slminfo, and then convert it back using slmpack, the check-sum of generated binary file may be different from that of the original one. The reason
       is the padding bits in the n-gram instances are not initialized before writing the data out.
