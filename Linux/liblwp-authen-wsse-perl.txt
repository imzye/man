NAME
       LWP::Authen::Wsse - Library for enabling X-WSSE authentication in LWP

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.05 of LWP::Authen::Wsse, released December 27, 2005.

SYNOPSIS
           use LWP::UserAgent;
           use HTTP::Request::Common;
           my $url = 'http://www.example.org/protected_page.html';

           # Set up the WSSE client
           my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
           $ua->credentials('example.org', '', 'username', 'password');

           $request = GET $url;
           print "--Performing request now...-----------\n";
           $response = $ua->request($request);
           print "--Done with request-------------------\n";

           if ($response->is_success) {
               print "It worked!->", $response->code, "\n";
           }
           else {
               print "It didn't work!->", $response->code, "\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       "LWP::Authen::Wsse" allows LWP to authenticate against servers that are using the "X-WSSE" authentication scheme, as required by the Atom Authentication API.

       The module is used indirectly through LWP, rather than including it directly in your code.  The LWP system will invoke the WSSE authentication when it encounters the authentication scheme while
       attempting to retrieve a URL from a server.

       You also need to set the credentials on the UserAgent object like this:

          $ua->credentials('www.company.com:80', '', "username", "password");

       Alternatively, you may also subclass LWP::UserAgent and override the "get_basic_credentials()" method.  See LWP::UserAgent for more details.
