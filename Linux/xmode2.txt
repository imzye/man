MODE2(1)                         User Commands                        MODE2(1)

NAME
       xmode2 - Show the pulse/space length of infrared signals

SYNOPSIS
       xmode2 [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The main purpose of xmode2 is to check operation of your home-brew LIRC
       receiver hardware and to see the IR waveform of the  remote  controller
       without an expensive oscilloscope. Very useful for debugging. Of course
       this program won't work with hardware that decodes the  signals  itself
       like   e.g.   TV  cards  or  the  Irman  i.  e.,  it  only  works  with
       LIRC_MODE_MODE2 type drivers.

       xmode2 prints a simple graphics display of the pulse/space lengths.  It
       accepts  a  few commands including time base changes; see the xmode2 -h
       output.

       lirc-lsplugins(1) allows checking if a driver is a LIRC_MODE2 type one.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              display usage summary

       -v --version
              display version

       -d --device=device
              read from given device

       -H --driver=driver
              use given driver

       -m --mode
              enable alternative display mode

       -r --raw
              access device directly

RUNNING AS ROOT
       In many cases xmode2 needs to run as root to access devices not  avail‐
       able to regular users. On the other hand, running as root creates prob‐
       lems such as log files owned by root, security concerns etc.

       In order to cope with this, xmode2 by  default  drops  root  privileges
       after opening the input device. This support is based on that root per‐
       missions are acquired using sudo(1) e. g., using

               $ sudo xmode2 --driver default --device /dev/lirc0

       If not using sudo, the same behaviour could be accomplished  using  the
       SUDO_USER environment variable e. g.,

               # SUDO_USER=$LOGNAME xmode2 --raw /dev/lirc0

       The  --keep-root  option will make xmode2 keep it's root privileges for
       the complete run.

DRIVER LOADING
       Drivers are loaded dynamically. The search path used for this is deter‐
       mined by (falling priority):

       - The --plugindir option.

       - The    'plugindir'   entry   in    the   [lircd]   section   of   the
         lirc_options.conf file.

       - The environment variable LIRC_PLUGINDIR.

       - A hardcoded default (usually /usr/lib[64]/lirc/plugins).

FILES
       ~/.cache/xmode2.log
           Debug output. Setting the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable relo‐
           cates this file to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/mode2.log
