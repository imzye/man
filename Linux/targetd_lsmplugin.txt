NAME
       targetd_lsmplugin -- libStorageMgmt targetd plugin

DESCRIPTION
       LibStorageMgmt  targetd  plugin allows user to manage storage using the targetd storage API [1]. The 'targetd_lsmplugin' executable file is for libStorageMgmt daemon to execute when client user speci‐
       fies targetd plugin in the URI.

URI
       To use this plugin, users should set their URI to this format:

           # HTTP connection
           targetd://<username>@<targetd_server>:<port number>

           # HTTPS connection
           targetd+ssl://<username>@<targetd_server>:<port number>

           # HTTPS connection with certificate file
           targetd+ssl://<username>@<targetd_server>:<port number>?ca_cert_file=<full path and filename>

           # HTTPS connection disabling all certificate checks (not recommended for production)
           targetd+ssl://<username>@<targetd_server>:<port number>?no_ssl_verify=yes

       username

              The username is the user account configured in targetd configuration file.

       targetd_server

              The targetd_server is the IP address or DNS name of server running targetd daemon.

       port number

              The port number is the listening port of the targetd daemon.  The default port of 18700 is used if none is supplied on the URI.

       URI parameters
              These URI parameters are supported by this plugin:

              ca_cert_file=<certificate file>
                     This URI parameter is for SSL connections only.  For those users that utilize a self signed certificate you can pass the path and file to the certificate that should be  used  to  verify
                     the server certificate.

              no_ssl_verify=yes
                     This  URI  parameter  is for SSL connections only. With this URI parameter, the targetd plugin will not validate servers SSL certificate.  It's often used for self-signed CA environment,
                     but it's strongly suggested to remove this URI parameter and install self-signed CA properly, or use cert_file parameter instead.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE
       Linux targetd 0.7.1 or later version.  Detailed support status can be queried via:

        * lsm.Client.capabilities()  (Python API)
        * lsm_capabilities()         (C API)
        * lsmcli capabilities        (lsmcli command line).

FIREWALL RULES
       By default, this plugin requires access to the targetd server's TCP 18700 port.
