NAME
       tape — tap-producing test harness for node and browsers

SYNOPSIS
       tape [-r module] [file] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       tape  is  a  tap-producing  test harness for node and browsers requiring only a few line of code. It can be used for unit and integration testing.  tape will execute test described by file option.
       File are interpreted using glob module by default. You may therefore need to quote file in order to avoid globbing by shell.  Tests are written in pure javascript, so  tests  could  be  run  using
       Node.js.

OPTIONS
       -r, --require
                load  one  or  more  modules before running any tests. Please note that all modules loaded using the -r flag will run before any tests, regardless of when they are specified. For example,
                tape -r a b -r c will actually load a and c before loading b, since they are flagged as required modules.

       -i, --ignore
                ignore tests from certain folders and/or files are not intended to be run. It defaults to `.gitignore` file when passed with no argument. For example:
                tape -i .ignore **/*.js`

       --no-only
                This is particularly useful in a CI environment where an "only test" is not supposed to go unnoticed. By passing the `--no-only` flag, any existing "only test" causes tests to fail:
                tape --no-only **/*.js`
                Alternatively, the environment variable `NODE_TAPE_NO_ONLY_TEST` can be set to `true` to achieve the same behavior; the command-line flag takes precedence.

METHODS
       The assertion methods in `tape` are heavily influenced or copied from the methods in node-tap.
       var test = require('tape')

EXAMPLES
       tape 'tests/**/*.js'
       tape -r './my/local/module' 'tests/**/*.js'
       tape -r 'babel-register' 'tests/**/*.js'
