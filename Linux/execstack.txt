NAME
       execstack - tool to set, clear, or query executable stack flag of ELF binaries and shared libraries

SYNOPSIS
       execstack [OPTION...] [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       execstack  is  a  program  which sets, clears, or queries executable stack flag of ELF binaries and shared libraries.  Linux has in the past allowed execution of instructions on the stack and
       there are lots of binaries and shared libraries assuming this behaviour.  Furthermore, GCC trampoline code for e.g. nested functions requires executable stack on many architectures.  To avoid
       breaking binaries and shared libraries which need executable stack, ELF binaries and shared libraries now can be marked as requiring executable stack or not requiring  it.   This  marking  is
       done  through  the  p_flags field in the PT_GNU_STACK program header entry.  If the marking is missing, kernel or dynamic linker need to assume it might need executable stack.  The marking is
       done automatically by recent GCC versions (objects using trampolines on the stack are marked as requiring executable stack, all other newly built objects are marked as not requiring  it)  and
       linker  collects  these  markings into marking of the whole binary or shared library.  The user can override this at assembly time (through --execstack or --noexecstack assembler options), at
       link time (through -z execstack or -z noexecstack linker options) and using the execstack tool also on an already linker binary or shared library.  This tool is especially  useful  for  third
       party shared libraries where it is known that they don't need executable stack or testing proves it.

OPTIONS
       -s --set-execstack
              Mark binary or shared library as requiring executable stack.

       -c --clear-execstack
              Mark binary or shared library as not requiring executable stack.

       -q --query
              Query executable stack marking of binaries and shared libraries.  For each file it prints either - when executable stack is not required, X when executable stack is required or ?  when
              it is unknown whether the object requires or doesn't require executable stack (the marking is missing).

       -V     Print execstack version and exit.

       -? --help
              Print help message.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message.

ARGUMENTS
       Command line arguments should be names of ELF binaries and shared libraries which should be modified or queried.

EXAMPLES
              # execstack -s ~/lib/libfoo.so.1
       will mark ~/lib/libfoo.so.1 as requiring executable stack.
              # execstack -c ~/bin/bar
       will mark ~/bin/bar as not requiring executable stack.
              # execstack -q ~/lib/libfoo.so.1 ~/bin/bar
       will query executable stack marking of the given files.

SEE ALSO
       ld.so(8).

BUGS
       execstack doesn't support yet marking of executables if they do not have PT_GNU_STACK program header entry nor they have room for program segment header table growth.
