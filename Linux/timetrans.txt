NAME
       timetrans - Converts time into time

SYNOPSIS
         timetrans [units-options] [-count]

DESCRIPTION
       timetrans converts time from one type of unit to another.  If any of
       the units options are specified, then timetrans will convert those time
       units into the number of seconds to which they add up.  If given the
       count option, timetrans will convert that number of seconds into the
       appropriate number of weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  The
       converted result is printed out.  Units options cannot be specified in
       the same execution as the count option, and vice versa.

       timetrans is intended for use with DNSSEC-Tools, for calculating a
       zone's expiration time.
