NAME
       prunerepo - remove old packages from rpm-md repository

SYNOPSIS
       prunerepo [--days DAYS] [--cleancopr] [--nocreaterepo] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL] [--dry-run] [-h] [-v] path

DESCRIPTION
       RPM packages that have newer version available in that same repository are deleted from filesystem and the rpm-md metadata are recreated afterwards. If there is a source rpm for a deleted rpm (and
       they both share the same directory path), then the source rpm will be deleted as well.

       Support for specific repository structure (e.g. COPR) is also available making it possible to additionally remove build logs and whole build directories associated with a package.

       After deletion of obsoleted packages, the command "createrepo_c --database --update" is called to recreate the repository metadata.

ARGUMENTS
       path
           local path to a yum repository

OPTIONS
       --days DAYS
           only remove packages (and build directories when --cleancopr is used) that are DAYS old or older (for packages by their build date, for directories the last modification time is considered)

       --cleancopr
           additionally remove whole copr build dirs and logs if the associated package gets deleted

       --alwayscreaterepo
           Recreate repository even when there was no change in data

       --nocreaterepo
           repository is not automatically recreated (not even after data deletion). Supresses --alwayscreaterepo.

       --log-level
           set logging to desired level

       --dry-run
           do not remove anything from the repository and print the actions instead. Verbose mode will be set.

       -h, --help
           show this help message and exit

       -v, --version
           print program version and exit

EXAMPLES
       prunerepo /path/to/repo
           removes all packages for which a newer version is available in the repository

       prunerepo /path/to/repo --cleancopr
           the same thing but also removes copr-specific build directories if they no longer contain any srpm/rpm package

       prunerepo /path/to/repo --days 7
           does not delete a package built in last 7 days even if a newer version is available for it

       prunerepo /path/to/repo --days 7 --nocreaterepo
           the same thing but omits call to createrepo_c at the end
