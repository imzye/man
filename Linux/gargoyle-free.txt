SYNOPSIS
       gargoyle [story]
       gargoyle -d --dump-config

       gargoyle -m --migrate-config
       gargoyle -p --paths [story]
       gargoyle -t --themes

DESCRIPTION
       gargoyle is an interactive fiction player that supports all the major interactive fiction formats, including:

             • AGT
             • Adrift (excluding Adrift 5)
             • AdvSys
             • Alan 2 and 3
             • Glulx
             • Hugo
             • JACL
             • Level 9
             • Magnetic Scrolls
             • Scott Adams
             • TADS 2 and 3
             • Z-machine

       If story is provided, it will be played.  Otherwise, a file chooser will be displayed so a story can be selected.

       The following options are available:

       -d, --dump-config
             Dump the default config file to standard output.

       -e, --edit-config
             Open Gargoyle's configuration file in a text editor, first creating it if necessary.

       -m, --migrate-config
             Search for a move a legacy configuration file to the preferred location.  In general, on Unix systems, this will mean renaming $HOME/.garglkrc to $HOME/.config/garglk.ini.

       -p, --paths
             Display a list of configuration file paths as well as theme paths that will be used at runtime.  If story is provided, game-specific configuration paths will be included.

       -t, --themes
             Display a list of available color themes.

CONFIGURATION
       gargoyle  is  highly  configurable,  although  all  configuration  is  done  through a text-based configuration file.  To edit the configuration file, use ⟨control-comma⟩ while Gargoyle is running
       (⟨command-comma⟩ on Mac), which will open the configuration file in a text editor.  The configuration file can also be edited directly.  The following locations are tried in order:

             • $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/garglk.ini or $HOME/.config/garglk.ini
             • $HOME/.garglkrc

       In addition, game-specific and directory-specific overrides are available.  For game-specific overrides, the game extension is removed  and  replaced  with  ini.   For  example,  zork1.z3  becomes
       zork1.ini.   If this file exists, it will be treated as a configuration file.  For directory-specific overrides, if the file garglk.ini exists in the same directory as the game, it will be treated
       as a configuration file.

       Finally, it is possible for a global configuration file to be installed.  This is often the file /etc/garglk.ini, but this is configurable at build time, and may also be disabled.

       To see exactly which locations are being used, pass the -p or --paths flag to gargoyle.  Note that this will not include game- or directory-specific configuration files.

       Configuration files are additive: first, the global configuration file is parsed.  Next, the user's configuration file (such as $HOME/.config/garglk.ini) is parsed, with all of  its  provided  op‐
       tions replacing whatever was specified in the global configuration file.  Finally, if there is a directory-specific and/or game-specific configuration file, their options will replace any existing
       options.  Configuration files need not provide all options.  This allows, for example, a game to select only the colors to be used, while respecing all of the user's other choices.
