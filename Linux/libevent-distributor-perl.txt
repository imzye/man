NAME
       "Event::Distributor::Query" - an event that collects a result

DESCRIPTION
       This subclass of Event::Distributor::_Event invokes each of its subscribers in turn, yielding either the (first) successful and non-empty result, or a failure if they all fail. Yields a
       (successful) empty result if there are no subscribers.
