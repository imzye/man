NAME
       seqcluster - seqcluster Documentation [image: seqcluster banner] [image]

       Analysis of small RNA sequencing data. It detect unit of transcription over the genome, annotate them and create an HTML interactive report that helps to explore the data quickly.

       Contents:

INSTALLATION
   Seqcluster
       With bcbio installed

       If you already have
       `bcbio`_
       , seqcluster comes with it. If you want the last development version:

          /bcbio_anaconda_bin_path/seqcluster_install.py --upgrade

       Docker:

          docker pull lpantano/smallsrna

       Bioconda binary

       install conda if you want an isolate env:

          wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
          bash Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/install/seqcluster/anaconda

       You can install directly from binstar (only for linux):

          ~/install/seqcluster/anaconda/conda install seqcluster seqbuster bedtools samtools pip nose numpy scipy pandas pyvcf -c bioconda

       With that you will have everything you need for the python package.  The last step is to add seqcluster to your PATH if conda is not already there.

       Go to Tools dependecies below to continue with the installation.

       Note: After installation is highly recommended to get the last updated version doing:

          seqcluster_install.py --upgrade

       automated installation

       Strongly recommended to use bcbio installation if you work with sequencing data. But if you want a minimal installation:

          pip install fabric
          seqcluster_install --upgrade
          mkdir -p $PATH_TO_TOOLS/bin
          seqcluster_install --tools $PATH_TO_TOOLS

       After that you will need to add to your path: export PATH=$PATH_TO_TOOLS/bin:$PATH

   Tools dependecies for a full small RNA pipeline
       For seqcluster command:

       • bedtools

       • samtools

       • rnafold (for HTML report)

       For some steps of a typical small RNA-seq pipeline (recommended to use directly
       `bcbio`_
        ):

       • STAR, bowtie

       • fastqc

       • cutadapt (install with bioconda using the same python env than seqcluster.

       You will need to link the cutadapt binary to your PATH)

   Data
       Easy way to install your small RNA seq data with cloudbiolinux.  Seqcluster has snipped code to do that for you. Recommended to use
       `bcbio`_
        for the pipeline since will install everything you need in a single step bcbio_nextgen.py upgrade -u development --tools --genomes hg19 --aligners bowtie.

       But If you want to run seqcluster step by step an example of hg19 human version it will be (another well annotated supported genome is mm10):

       Download genome data:

          seqcluster_install --data $PATH_TO_DATA --genomes hg19 --aligners bowtie2 --datatarget smallrna

       If you want to install STAR indexes since gets kind of better results than bowtie2 (warning, 40GB memory RAM needed):

          seqcluster_install --data $PATH_TO_DATA --genomes hg19 --aligners star

   R package
       Install isomiRs package for R using devtools:

          devtools::install_github('lpantano/isomiRs')

       To install all packages used by the Rmd report:

          Rscript -e 'source(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lpantano/seqcluster/master/scripts/install_libraries.R)'

GETTING STARTED
       Best practices are implemented in a python framework.

   clustering of small RNA sequences
       seqcluster generates a list of clusters of small RNA sequences, their genome location, their annotation and the abundance in all the sample of the project [image]

       REMOVE ADAPTER

       I am currently using cutadapt:

          cutadapt --adapter=$ADAPTER --minimum-length=8 --untrimmed-output=sample1_notfound.fastq -o sample1_clean.fastq -m 17 --overlap=8 sample1.fastq

       COLLAPSE READS

       To reduce computational time, I recommend to collapse sequences, also it would help to apply filters based on abundances.  Like removing sequences that appear only once.

          seqcluster collapse -f sample1_clean.fastq -o collapse

       Here I am only using sequences that had the adapter, meaning that for sure are small fragments.

       This is compatible with UMI barcodes. If you have in the read name UMI_ATCGAT ``, then the tool will remove PCR dupiclates as well. To confirm this happened, the tool should output  this  sentence
       during the processing of the file: ``Find UMI tags in read names, collapsing by UMI.

       PREPARE SAMPLES

          seqcluster prepare -c file_w_samples -o res --minl 17 --minc 2 --maxl 45

       the file_w_samples should have the following format:

          lane1_sequence.txt_1_1_phred.fastq      cc1
          lane1_sequence.txt_2_1_phred.fastq      cc2
          lane2_sequence.txt_1_1_phred.fastq      cc3
          lane2_sequence.txt_2_1_phred.fastq      cc4

       two columns file, where the first column is the name of the file with the small RNA sequences for each sample, and the second column in the name of the sample.

       The fastq files should be like this:

          @seq_1_x11
          CCCCGTTCCCCCCTCCTCC
          +
          QUALITY_LINE
          @seq_2_x20
          TGCGCAGTGGCAGTATCGTAGCCAATG
          +
          QUALITY_LINE
          </pre>

       Where _x[09]  indicate the abundance of that sequence, and the middle number is the index of the sequence.

       This script will generate: seqs.fastq and seqs.ma.  * seqs.fastq: have unique sequences and unique ids * seqs.ma: is the abundance matrix of all unique sequences in all samples

       ALIGNMENT

       You should use an aligner to map seqs.fa to your genome. A possibility is bowtie or STAR.  From here, we need a file in BAM format for the next step.  VERY IMPORTANT: the BAM file should be sorted

          bowtie -a --best --strata -m 5000 INDEX seqs.fastq -S | samtools view -Sbh /dev/stdin | samtools sort -o /dev/stdout temp > seqs.sort.bam

       or

          STAR --genomeDir $star_index_folder --readFilesIn res/seqs.fastq --alignIntronMax 1  --outFilterMultimapNmax 1000 --outSAMattributes NH HI NM --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate

       CLUSTERING

          seqcluster cluster -a res/Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam  -m res/seqs.ma -g $GTF_FILE  -o res/cluster -ref PATH_TO_GENOME_FASTA --db example

       • -a is the SAM file generated after mapped with your tool, which input has been seqs.fa

       • -m the previous seqs.fa

       • -b annotation files in bed format (see below examples) [deprecated]

       • -g annotation files in gtf format (see below examples) [recommended]

       • -i genome fasta file used in the mapping step (only needed if -s active)

       • -o output folder

       • -ref genome fasta file. Needs fai file as well there. (i.e hg19.fa, hg19.fa.fai)

       • -d create debug logging

       • -s construction of putative precursor (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

       • --db (optional) will create sqlite3 database with results that will be used to browse data with html web page (under development)

       Example of a bed file for annotation (the fourth column should be the name of the feature):

          chr1    157783  157886  snRNA   0       -

       Strongly recommend gtf format. Bed annotation is deprecated. Go here to know how to download data from hg19 and mm10.

       Example of a gtf file for annotation (the third column should be the name of the feature and the value after gene name attribute is the specific annotation):

          chr1    source  miRNA      1       11503   .       +       .       gene name 'mir-102' ;

       hint: scripts to generate human and mouse annotation are inside seqcluster/scripts folder.

       OUTPUTS

       • counts.tsv: count matrix that can be input of downstream analyses

       • size_counts.tsv: size distribution of the small RNA by annotation group

       • seqcluster.json: json file containing all information

       • log/run.log: all messages at debug level

       • log/trace.log: to keep trace of algorithm decisions

   Interactive HTML Report
       This will create html report using the following command assuming the output of seqcluster cluster is at res:

          seqcluster report -j res/seqcluster.json -o report -r $GENONE_FASTA_PATH

       where $GENOME_FASTA_PATH is the path to the genome fasta file used in the alignment.

       Note: you can try our new visualization tool!

       • report/html/index.html: table with all clusters and the annotation with sorting option

       • report/html/[0-9]/maps.html: summary of the cluster with expression profile, annotation, and all sequences inside

       • report/html/[0-9]/maps.fa: putative precursor

       An example of the output is below: [image]

   Easy start with bcbio-nextgen.py
       Note:If you already are using bcbio, visit bcbio to run the pipeline there.

       To install the small RNA data:

          bcbio_nextgen.py upgrade -u development --tools --datatarget smallrna

       Options to run in a cluster

       It uses ipython-cluster-helper to send jobs to nodes in the cluster

       • --parallel should set to ipython

       • --scheduler should be set to sge,lsf,slurm

       • --num-jobs indicates how much jobs to launch. It will run samples independently. If you have 4 samples, and set this to 4, 4 jobs will be launch to the cluster

       • --queue the queue to use

       • --resources allows to set any special parameter for the cluster, such as, email in sge system: M=my@email.com

       Read complete usability here: https://github.com/roryk/ipython-cluster-helper An examples in slurm system is:

          --parallel ipython --scheduler slurm --num-jobs 4 --queue general

       Output

       • one folder for each analysys, and inside one per sample

          • adapter: *clean.fastq is the file after adapter removal, *clean_trimmed.fastq is the collapse clean.fastq, *fragments.fastq is file without adapter, *short.fastq is file with reads < 16 nt.

          • align: BAM file results from align trimmed.fastq

          • mirbase: file with miRNA anotation and novel miRNA discovery with mirdeep2

          • tRNA: analysis done with tdrmapper [citation needed]

          • qc: *_fastqc.html is the fastqc results from the uncollapse fastq file

       • seqcluster: is the result of running seqcluster. See its documentation for further information.

       • report/srna-report.Rmd: template to create a quick html report with exploration and differential expression analysis. See example here

OUTPUTS
   seqcluster
       • counts.tsv: count matrix that can be input of downstream analyses. nloci will be 0 always that the meta-cluster has been resolved successfully. For instance, it can happen that you got sequences
         you  have a bunch of sequences mapping to hundreds of different places on the genome, then seqcluster doesn’t resolve that, and put everything under the larger region covered by those sequences.
         So, mainly, 0 all are good rows. The ann column is just where the meta-clusters overlap with. It can happen that one name appears many times if different locations of  the  meta-cluster  map  to
         different copies of that feature. OR if the annotation file used had multiple lines for that.

       • read_stats.tsv: number of reads for each sample after each step in the analysis. Meant to give a hint if we lose a lot of information or not.

       • size_counts.tsv: size distribution of the small RNA by annotation group. (position, reads, cluster)

       • seqcluster.json: json file containing all information. This file is used as the input of the report suit.

       • log/run.log: all messages at debug level

       • log/trace.log: to keep trace of algorithm decisions

   Report
       Beside the static HTML report that you can get using report subcommand, you can download this HTML. (watch the repository to get notifications of new releases.)

       • Go inside seqclusterViz folder

       • Open reader.html

       • Upload the seqcluster.db file generated by report subcommand.

       • Start browsing your data!

       Meaning of different sections:

       • Top-left table shows list of meta-clusters, user can filter by number ID or keywords.

       • Top-right table shows positions where this meta-cluster has been detected.

       • Expression profile along precursor: Lines are number of reads in that position of the precursor. It is sum of the log2 RPM of the expression for each sample.

       • Table: raw counts for each sample and sequence. Only top 100 are shown.

       • secondary structure: The region with more sequences inside meta-cluster is used to plot the secondary structure. Colors refers to abundance in each position. Darker means more abundance.

       About

       mirRQC project

       samples overview:

       >>  Universal  Human  miRNA  reference RNA (Agilent Technologies, #750700), human brain total RNA (Life Technologies, #AM6050), human liver total RNA (Life Technologies, #AM7960) and MS2-phage RNA
       (Roche, #10165948001) were diluted to a platform-specific concentration. RNA integrity and purity were evaluated using the Experion automated gel  electrophoresis  system  (Bio-Rad)  and  Nanodrop
       spectrophotometer.  All  RNA  samples  were  of  high quality (miRQC A: RNA quality index (RQI, scale from 0 to 10) = 9.0; miRQC B: RQI = 8.7; human liver RNA: RQI = 9.2) and high purity (data not
       shown). RNA was isolated from serum prepared from three healthy donors using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and RNA samples were pooled. Informed con‐
       sent was obtained from all donors (Ghent University Ethical Committee). Different kits for isolation of serum RNA are available; addressing their impact was outside the scope of  this  work.  Syn‐
       thetic  miRNA templates for let-7a-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7c, let-7d-5p, miR-302a-3p, miR-302b-3p, miR-302c-3p, miR-302d-3p, miR-133a and miR-10a-5p were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and
       5′ phosphorylated. Synthetic let-7 and miR-302 miRNAs were spiked into MS2-phage RNA and total human liver RNA, respectively, at 5 × 106 copies/μg RNA. These  samples  do  not  contain  endogenous
       miR-302  or let-7 miRNAs, which allowed unbiased analysis of cross-reactivity between the individual miR-302 and let-7 miRNAs measured by the platform and the different miR-302 and let-7 synthetic
       templates in a complex RNA background. Synthetic miRNA templates for miR-10a-5p, let-7a-5p, miR-302a-3p and miR-133a were spiked in human serum RNA at 6 × 103 copies per microliter of serum RNA or
       at 5-times higher, 2-times higher, 2-times lower and 5-times lower concentrations, respectively. All vendors received 10 μl of each serum RNA sample.

       Commands

       Data was download from GEO web with this script. The following 2 configs were used for the two sets: mirqc samples  and non mirqc samples. Samples were analyzed with bcbio  with  the  following  ‐
       commands

       report

       Report showing part of the output report of bcbio pipelines together with some validations are here.

MIRNA ANNOTATION
       miRNA annotation is running inside bcbio small RNAseq pipeline together with other tools to do a complete small RNA analysis.

       For some comparison with other tools go here.

       You can run samples after processing the reads as shown below.  Currently there are two version: JAVA

       Naming

       See always up to date information here in mirtop open project.

       It is a working process, but since 10-21-2015 isomiR naming has changed to:

       • Nucleotide  substitution: NUMBER|NUCLEOTIDE_ISOMIR|NUCLEOTIDE_REFERENCE means at the position giving by the number the nucleotide in the sequence has substituted the nucleotide in the reference.
         This, as well, is a post-transcriptional modification.

       • Additions at 3' end: 0/NA means no modification. UPPER CASE LETTER means addition at the end. Note these nucleotides don't match the precursor. So they are post-transcriptional modification.

       • Changes at 5' end: 0/NA means no modification. UPPER CASE LETTER means nucleotide insertions (sequence starts before miRBase mature position). LOWWER CASE LETTER means nucleotide deletions  (se‐
         quence starts after miRBase mature position).

       • Changes  at  3'  end:  0/NA means no modification. UPPER CASE LETTER means nucleotide insertions (sequence ends after miRBase mature position). LOWWER CASE LETTER means nucleotide deletions (se‐
         quence ends before miRBase mature position).

   Processing of reads
       REMOVE ADAPTER

       I am currently using cutadapt.

          cutadapt --adapter=$ADAPTER --minimum-length=8 --untrimmed-output=sample1_notfound.fastq -o sample1_clean.fastq -m 17 --overlap=8 sample1.fastq

       COLLAPSE READS

       To reduce computational time, I recommend to collapse sequences, also it would help to apply filters based on abundances.  Like removing sequences that appear only once.

          seqcluster collapse -f sample1_clean.fastq -o collapse

       Here I am only using sequences that had the adapter, meaning that for sure are small fragments. The output will be named as sample1_clean_trimmed.fastq

   Prepare databases
       For human or mouse, follows this instruction to download easily miRBase files. In general you only need hairpin.fa and miRNA.str from miRBase site. mirGeneDB is also supported, download the needed
       files here.

       Highly recommended to filter hairpin.fa to contain only the desired species.

   miRNA/isomiR annotation with JAVA
       MIRALIGNER

       Download the tool from miraligner repository.

       Download the mirbase files (hairpin and miRNA) from the ftp and save it to DB folder.

       You can map the miRNAs with.

          java -jar miraligner.jar -sub 1 -trim 3 -add 3 -s hsa -i sample1_clean_trimmed.fastq -db DB  -o output_prefix

   Convert to GFF3-srna
       Use mirtop to convert to GFF3-srna format. This is the desired format to share the isomiR information and can be used to join multiple projects together easily.

       See  to know how to convert all the output into a single file and share easily with collaborators:

          mirtop gff --format seqbuster --sps hsa --hairpin database/hairpin.fa --gtf database/hsa.gff3 -o test_out out_folder/*/*.mirna

   Post-analysis with R
       Use the outputs to do differential expression, clustering and descriptive analysis with this package: isomiRs

       To load the data you can use IsomirDataSeqFromFiles function and get the count data with isoCounts to move to DESeq2 or similar packages.

COLLAPSE FASTQ(.GZ) FILES
       Definition

       Normally quality values are lost in  small RNA-seq pipelines due to collapsing after adapter recognition. This option allow to collapse reads after adapter removal with cutadapt or any other tool.
       This way the mapping can use quality values, allowing to map using bwa for instance, or any other alignment tool that doesn't support FASTA files.

       Methods

       The new quality values are the average of each of the sequence collapse.

       Example

          seqcluster collapse -f sample_trimmed.fastq -o collapse

       • -f is the fastq(.gz) file

       • -o the folder where the outout will be created. A new FASTQ file, where the name stand for:

            @seq_[0-9]_x[0-9]

       The number right after _x means the abundance of this sequence in the sample

HANDLING MULTI-MAPPED READS
       Definition

       multi-mapped reads are the sequences that map more than one time on the genome, for instance, because there are multiple copies of a gene, like happens with tRNA precursors

       Consequence

       Many  pipelines  ignores  these  sequences as defaults, what means that you are losing at leas 20-30% of the data. In this case is difficult to decide where these sequences come from and currently
       there are three strategies:

       • ignore them

       • count as many times as they appear: for instance, if a sequences map twice, just count it two times in the two loci. This will due an over-representation of the loci abundances, and actually  is
         against the assumption of all packages that perform differential expression in count data.

       • weight  them:  divide  the total count by the number of places it maps. In the previous example, each loci would get 1/2 * count. This produces weird dispersion values for packages that fit this
         value as part of the model.

       Our implementation [image]

       We try to decide the origin of these sequences. The most common scenario is that a group of sequences map two three different regions, probably due to multi-copies on the genome of the precursor.

       We introduce two options:

       • most-voting strategy: In this case, we just count once all sequences, and we output this like one unit of transcription with multiple regions. This is the option by default.

       • bayes inference: we give the same prior probability to all locations, and use the number of sequences starting in the same position than the one we are trying to predict its location as  P(B|A).
         With  this  we  calculate  the  posterior that will be used to get the proportion of counts to the different locations. We apply the code from the book: "Think Bayes" ( Allen B. Downey). This is
         still under development. To activate this option, the user just needs to add --method babes

       The main advantage of this, it is that it can be the input of any downstream analysis that is applied to RNA-seq, like DESeq, edgeR ... As well, there is less noise, because there is only one out‐
       put coming from here, not three.
