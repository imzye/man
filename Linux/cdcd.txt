NAME
       cdcd - Command Driven CD player

SYNOPSIS
       cdcd [OPTION]...  [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       cdcd  allows  control  of  a CD player either directly off of the command line or in its own interactive query mode.  Invoking cdcd without a command will cause cdcd to enter query mode.  Invoking
       cdcd with a command will cause cdcd to execute that command and then terminate when it is finished.

OPTIONS
       --device DEVICE

       -d DEVICE
              Use DEVICE as the CD device.  DEVICE is the device special file name of the CD-ROM device.  Do not use a Linux SCSI Generic device.

USAGE
       The following are the supported commands:

       play [start track] [end track] [min:sec]
              If start track is specified, play will play the specified track instead of the first track. If end track is specified, the disc will be played from the start track to the end  track.  start
              track  and end track may either be part of or an entire track title. If a starting position is specified (in the form min:sec), then the disc will begin playing the specified amount of time
              into the specified track.  One may specify a starting position without specifying a start track or only specify a start track and starting position while specifying no end track

       stop   This will stop the CD if it is playing.

       open, eject
              This will eject the CD-ROM tray

       close  This will close the CD-ROM tray

       pause  This will pause the CD if it is playing

       resume This will cause a paused CD to resume playing

       ff [min:sec]
              This will fast-forward the CD 15 seconds by default, or the specified amount of time

       rew [min:sec]
              This will rewind the CD 15 seconds by default, or the specified amount of time

       next   This will advance the CD one track

       prev   This will return the CD to the previous track

       getvol This will return the current volume settings

       setvol [left front] [right front] [left rear] [right rear]
              Sets the CD-ROM volume to the given settings.  Most CD players only support the front two channels

       status Gives only numerical data regarding the CD's status

       info   Gives disc name, artist, current track name, and disc positions

       tracks Lists all tracks on the CD and their lengths

       rndplay
              Plays a random track

       list   Lists all CDs in a CD-ROM changer

       slot   Changes the current CD in the CD-ROM changer

       edit [name, artist, genre, track no.] [value]

       ext [track no., disc]
              This will display extended information about the disc.  If no parameter is given it will display information about the current track.  Specifying disc will display information for the  disc
              itself

       refresh
              This  will  connect  to  a  server  and  retrieve information about the CD even if there already exists information about it.  Otherwise, this is done automatically by any command that uses
              disc/track names

       device [device name]
              This sets the CD-ROM device cdcd will use in future invocations which don't specify the -d option.  cdcd stores this information in your .cdcdrc file.

       verbose [on, off]
              This toggles whether cdcd will display everything that is happening (e.g.  when accessing a CDDB or CD Index server)

       quit   Exits cdcd

       sites [refresh, display, add, delete, move]
              This edits the server list.  More specific help on each of the commands is available by typing cdcd help sites

       submit [e-mail address]
              This will submit a CDDB entry to a CDDB server

       access [local, remote, proxy]
              Specifying local will cause CD information requests to return Unknown for track, artist, and album titles, and will not attempt to connect to any servers.  remote will cause cdcd to connect
              to a server whenever any CD information is required.  If you need to use a HTTP proxy, it may be specified in the form proxy url, where url is the URL for your HTTP proxy

COMPLETION
       cdcd uses traditional readline command and trackname completion.  To complete a command, simply hit 'tab' when you have typed a partially completed command.  To complete a  trackname,  first  type
       whatever command you wish to pass a track name to (e.g. play, ext) and then begin with a double quotation mark.  Type the beginning of the track name and then hit tab.  The track name will be com‐
       pleted for you.

              cdcd> pl<tab>
              cdcd> play "See<tab>
              cdcd> play "See You On The Other Side"
