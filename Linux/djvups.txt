NAME
       djvups - Convert DjVu documents to PostScript.

SYNOPSIS
       djvups  [options] [djvufile] [outputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program decodes DjVu file djvufile, and generates a PostScript file named outputfile.  The DjVu data is read from the standard input when argument djvufile is not specified or when it is equal to
       a single dash.  Similarly, the output data is written to the standard output when argument outputfile is not specified or equal to a single dash.

       PostScript printers have various capabilities.  Investigate options -level and -gray for obtaining the best results.

OPTIONS
       -help  Prints the list of recognized options.

       -verbose
              Displays a progress bar.

       -page=pagespec
              Specify the document pages to be converted.  The page specification pagespec contains one or more comma-separated page ranges.  A page range is either a page number, or two page  numbers  sepa‐
              rated by a dash.  Specification 1-10, for instance, prints pages 1 to 10.  Specification 1,3,99999-4 prints pages 1 and 3, followed by all the document pages in reverse order up to page 4.

       -format=ps
              Produce a PostScript file.  This is the default.

       -format=eps
              Produce  an  Encapsulated  PostScript  file.  Encapsulated PostScript files are suitable for embedding images into other documents.  Encapsulated PostScript file can only contain a single page.
              Setting this option overrides the options -copies, -orientation, -zoom, -cropmarks, and -booklet.

       -copies=n
              Specify the number of copies to print.

       -orientation=orient
              Specify whether pages should be printed using the auto, portrait, or landscape orientation.

       -mode=modespec
              Specify how pages should be decoded.  The default mode, color, renders all the layers of the DjVu documents.  Mode black only renders the foreground layer mask.  This mode does  not  work  with
              DjVuPhoto images because these files have no foreground layer mask.  Modes foreground and background only render the foreground layer or the background layer of a DjVuDocument image.

       -zoom=zoomspec
              Specify  a  zoom factor zoomspec.  The default zoom factor, auto, scales the image to fit the page.  Argument zoomspec also can be a number in range 25 to 2400 representing a magnification per‐
              centage relative to the original size of the document.

       -frame=yesno
              Specifying yes causes the generation of a thin gray border representing the boundaries of the document pages.  The default is no.

       -cropmarks=yesno
              Specifying yes causes the generation of crop marks indicating where pages should be cut.  The default is no.

       -level=languagelevel
              Select the language level of the generated PostScript.  languagelevel.  Valid language levels are 1, 2, and 3.  Level 3 produces the most compact and fast printing PostScript  files.   Some  of
              these  files  however  require  a very modern printer.  Level 2 is the default value.  The generated PostScript files are almost as compact and work with all but the oldest PostScript printers.
              Level 1 can be used as a last resort option.

       -color=yesno
              The default value, yes, generates a color PostScript file.  Specifying value no converts the image to gray scale.  The resulting PostScript file is smaller and marginally more portable.

       -gray  This option is equivalent to option -color=no and is provided for convenience.

       -colormatch=yesno
              The default value, yes, generates a PostScript file using device independent colors in compliance with the sRGB specification.  Modern printers then produce colors that match  the  original  as
              well as possible.  Specifying value no generates a PostScript file using device dependent colors.  This is sometimes useful with older printers.  You can then use option -gamma to tune the out‐
              put colors.

       -gamma=gammaspec
              Specify a gamma correction factor for the device dependent PostScript colors.  Argument gammaspec must be in range 0.3 to 5.0.  Gamma correction normally pertains to cathodic screens only.   It
              gets meaningful for printers because several models interpret device dependent RGB colors by emulating the color response of a cathodic tube.

       -booklet=opt
              Turns the booklet printing mode on.  The booklet mode prints two pages on each side in a way suitable for making a booklet by folding the sheets. Option opt can take values no for disabling the
              booklet mode, yes for enabling the recto/verso booklet mode, and recto or verso to print only one side of each sheet.

       -bookletmax=max
              Specifies the maximal number of pages per booklet.  A single printout might then be composed of several booklets. Argument max is rounded up to the next multiple of 4.   Specifying  0  sets  no
              maximal number of pages and ensures that the printout will produce a single booklet.  This is the default.

       -bookletalign=align
              Specifies  a  positive  or  negative offset applied  to the verso of each sheet.  Argument align is expressed in points (one point is 1/72th of an inch, or 0.352 millimeter) This is useful with
              certain printers to ensure that both recto and verso are properly aligned.  The default value is of course 0.

       -bookletfold=base[+incr]
              Specifies the extra margin left  between both pages on a single sheet.  The base value base is expressed in points (one point is 1/72th of an inch, or 0.352 millimeter). This margin  is  incre‐
              mented for each outer sheet by value incr expressed in millipoints. The default value is 18+200.
