NAME
       BarnOwl - tty‐based zephyr client

SYNOPSIS
       barnowl [-n] [-d] [-D] [-v] [-h] [-c CONFIGFILE] [-t TTY] [-s CONFIGDIR]

DESCRIPTION
       BarnOwl  is  a  fully integrated tty‐based instant messaging client.  Currently it supports AOL Instant Messenger, MIT Zephyr, Jabber, IRC, and Twitter.  It is curses‐based, allows for emacs‐style
       editing of outgoing messages, and uses Perl as an extension and configuration language.  BarnOwl will also run happily without a configuration file.

       Once BarnOwl is started, typing ‘h’ will display a help screen.  Typing ‘:’ enters command mode, allowing the user to type a BarnOwl command line.

OPTIONS
       The following command-line options are avilable when running BarnOwl:

       -n, --no-subs
              Do not subscribe to zephyr messages on startup.  By default, BarnOwl subscribes to the default subscriptions and to anything found in ~/.zephyr.subs.  When this option is used, no subscrip‐
              tions are loaded.

       -c, --config-file=FILE
              Specify an alternate config file for BarnOwl to use.  The config file is an arbitrary Perl script evaluated in the main package, and if it overrides the BarnOwl::startup method that is  run
              when BarnOwl starts.  (Compare ~/.owl/startup, which contains BarnOwl commands that are run at startup after the config file is loaded.)

              By default, BarnOwl uses the first of ~/.owl/init.pl, ~/.barnowlconf, or ~/.owlconf that exists.

       -s, --config-dir=DIR
              Specify an alternate configuration directory.  By default, BarnOwl uses ~/.owl/.

       -t, --tty=TTY
              Specify the tty name to use for the zephyr location.

       -v, --version
              Print the version number of BarnOwl and exit.

       -d, --debug
              Enable debugging.  By default, debugging information is placed in /var/tmp/barnowl-debug.PID.

       -h, --help
              Print command‐line option help.
