DIRHASH(1)                                                                                     User Commands                                                                                     DIRHASH(1)

NAME
       dirhash - Python module and CLI for hashing of file system directories.

DESCRIPTION
       usage: dirhash [-h] [-v] [-a] [-m  [...]] [-i  [...]] [--empty-dirs]

       [--no-linked-dirs] [--no-linked-files] [-p
              [...]] [-c]

              [-s CHUNK_SIZE] [-j JOBS] [-l] directory

       Determine the hash for a directory.

   positional arguments:
       directory
              Directory to hash.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -a , --algorithm
              Hashing  algorithm  to  use,  by default "md5". Always available: ['md5', 'sha1', 'sha224', 'sha256', 'sha384', 'sha512']. Additionally available on current platform: ['blake2b', 'blake2s',
              'md4', 'md5-sha1', 'ripemd160', 'sha3_224', 'sha3_256', 'sha3_384', 'sha3_512', 'sha512_224', 'sha512_256', 'shake_128', 'shake_256', 'sm3', 'whirlpool']. Note that the same  algorithm  may
              appear multiple times in this set under different names (thanks to OpenSSL) [https://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html]

   Filtering options:
              Specify  what  files  and  directories  to  include.  All files and directories (including symbolic links) are included by default. The --match/--ignore arguments allows for selection using
              glob/wildcard (".gitignore style") path matching. Paths relative to the root `directory` (i.e. excluding the name of the root directory itself) are matched against  the  provided  patterns.
              For example, to only include python source files, use: `dirhash path/to/dir -m "*.py"` or to exclude hidden files and directories use: `dirhash path/to.dir -i ".*" ".*/"` which is short for
              `dirhash  path/to.dir -m "*" "!.*" "!.*/"`. By adding the --list argument, all included paths, for the given filtering arguments, are returned instead of the hash value. For further details
              see https://github.com/andhus/dirhash/README.md#filtering

       -m     [ ...], --match  [ ...]  One or several patterns for paths to include. NOTE: patterns with an asterisk must be in quotes ("*") or the asterisk preceded by an escape character (\*).

       -i     [ ...], --ignore  [ ...]  One or several patterns for paths to exclude. NOTE: patterns with an asterisk must be in quotes ("*") or the asterisk preceded by an escape character (\*).

       --empty-dirs
              Include empty directories (containing no files that meet the matching criteria and no non-empty sub directories).

       --no-linked-dirs
              Do not include symbolic links to other directories.

       --no-linked-files
              Do not include symbolic links to files.

   Protocol options:
              Specify what properties of files and directories to include and whether to allow cyclic links. For further details see https://github.com/andhus/dirhash/DIRHASH_STANDARD.md#protocol

       -p     [ ...], --properties  [ ...]  List of file/directory properties to include in the hash. Available properties are: ['name', 'data', 'is_link'] and at least one of name and data must  be  in‐
              cluded. Default is [data name] which means that both the name/paths and content (actual data) of files and directories will be included

       -c, --allow-cyclic-links
              Allow presence of cyclic links (by hashing the relative path to the target directory).

       Implementation options:

       -s CHUNK_SIZE, --chunk-size CHUNK_SIZE
              The chunk size (in bytes) for reading of files.

       -j JOBS, --jobs JOBS
              Number of jobs (parallel processes) to use.

   Special options:
       -l, --list
              List the file paths that will be taken into account, given the provided filtering options.
