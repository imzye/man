SMP_REP_BROADCAST(8)                                                                               SMP_UTILS                                                                               SMP_REP_BROADCAST(8)

NAME
       smp_rep_broadcast - invoke REPORT BROADCAST SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_rep_broadcast [--broadcast=BT] [--help] [--hex] [--interface=PARAMS] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a  SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT BROADCAST function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the --sa=SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the
       SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between  HBAs  if  there  are  multiple
       present.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -b, --broadcast=BT
              BT  is  the  broadcast type, an integer in the range 0 (default) to 15.  Broadcast (Change) corresponds to 0. Other known broadcast types are listed in the NOTES section. BT may be decimal (de‐
              fault) or hexadecimal prefixed by '0x' (or '0X') or with a 'h' (or 'H') suffix.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. The mpt interface needs this option and it will typically be an expander's SAS address. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS addresses are
              shown in hexadecimal.  To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

NOTES
       The following is a list of broadcast types:
       0        Broadcast (Change)
       1        Broadcast (Reserved change 0)
       2        Broadcast (Reserved change 1)
       3        Broadcast (SES)
       4        Broadcast (Expander)
       5        Broadcast (Asynchronous event)
       6        Broadcast (Reserved 3)
       7        Broadcast (Reserved 4)
       8        Broadcast (Zone activate)

       The remaining zone types (9 to 15) may be issued by the ZONED BROADCAST function.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP REPORT BROADCAST function was introduced in SAS-2 .
