NAME
       makehyper - generate a GNU Backgammon Hypergammon position database

SYNOPSIS
       makehyper [-nvh] [-f filename] [-r filename] [-c chequers] [-t thresh‐
       old]

DESCRIPTION
       Hypergammon is a variation of backgammon with a much reduced number of
       chequers (usually three).  It's possible to fully analyse this simpli‐
       fied game and generate a database of position evaluations in order to
       play perfectly.  makehyper generates such a position evaluation data‐
       base.

       Since many of the positions are in contact, it's not possible to gener‐
       ate the database in one pass; instead, makehyper iterates until the po‐
       sition evaluation converges.  The convergence threshold can be changed
       with the -t option.

OPTIONS
       -f filename, --outfile filename
              Write the hypergammon database to filename.  Default is "hy‐
              per<number of chequers>.bd", the name expected by GNU Backgammon
              when using the database.

       -r filename, --restart filename
              Restart calculation of the database from the given file, which
              should be a checkpoint from an earlier run.

       -c chequers, --chequers chequers
              Set the number of chequers in the game.  The default is 3, for
              normal 3-chequer hypergammon.

       -n, --no-checkpoint
              Do not write a checkpoint file after each iteration.

       -t threshold, --threshold threshold
              Set the convergence threshold.  The default is 1e-5.

       -v, --version
              Show version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display usage and exit.
