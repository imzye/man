NAME
       parasite6

SYNOPSIS
       parasite6 [-lRFHD] interface [fake-mac]

       This  is  an "ARP spoofer" for IPv6, redirecting all local traffic to your own system (or nirvana if fake-mac does not exist) by answering falsely to Neighbor Solitication requests Option -l loops and
       resends the packets per target every 5 seconds.  Option -R will also try to inject the destination of the solicitation NS security bypass: -F fragment, -H hop-by-hop and -D large destination header
