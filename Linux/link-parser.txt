NAME
       link-parser - parse natural language sentences using Link Grammar

SYNOPSIS
       link-parser --help
       link-parser --version
       link-parser [language|dict_location] [--quiet] [-<special_"!"_command>...]

DESCRIPTION
       link-parser  is  the  command-line  wrapper to the link-grammar natural language parsing library.  This library will parse sentences written in English, Russian and other languages, generating linkage
       trees showing relationships between the subject, the verb, and various adjectives, adverbs, etc. in the sentence.

EXAMPLE
       link-parser

       Starts the parser interactive shell.  Enter any sentence to parse:

BACKGROUND
       The link-parser command-line tool is useful for general exploration and use, although it is presumed that, for the parsing of large quantities  of  text,  a  custom  application,  making  use  of  the
       link-grammar library, will be written.  Several such applications are described on the Link Grammar web page (see SEE ALSO below); these include the AbiWord grammar checker, and the RelEx semantic re‐
       lation extractor.

       The theory of Link Grammar is explained in many academic papers.  In the first of these, Daniel Sleator and Davy Temperley, "Parsing English with a Link Grammar" (1991), the authors defined a new for‐
       mal  grammatical  system  called a "link grammar". A sequence of words is in the language of a link grammar if there is a way to draw "links" between words in such a way that the local requirements of
       each word are satisfied, the links do not cross, and the words form a consistent connected graph. The authors encoded English grammar into such a system, and wrote link-parser to parse  English  using
       this grammar.

       The engine that performs the parsing is separate from the dictionaries describing a language.  Currently, the most fully developed, complete dictionaries are for the English and Russian languages, al‐
       though experimental, incomplete dictionaries exist for German and eight other languages.

OVERVIEW
       link-parser, when invoked manually, starts an interactive shell, taking control of the terminal.  Any lines beginning with an exclamation mark are assumed to be a  "special  command";  these  are  de‐
       scribed below.  The command !help will provide more info; the command !variables will print all of the special commands.  These are also called "variables", as almost all commands have a value associ‐
       ated with them: the command typically enable or disable some function, or they alter some multi-valued setting.

       All other input is treated as a single, English-language sentence; it is parsed, and the result of the parse is printed.  The variables control what is printed:  By default, an ASCII-graphics  linkage
       is printed, although post-script output is also possible.  The printing of the constituent tree can also be enabled. Other output controls include the printing of disjuncts and complete link data.

       In  order to analyze sentences, link-parser depends on a link-grammar dictionary.  This contains lists of words and associated metadata about their grammatical properties.  An English language dictio‐
       nary is provided by default.  If other language dictionaries are installed in the default search locations, these may be explicitly specified by means of a 2-letter ISO language code: so, for example:

           link-parser de

       will start the parser shell with the German dictionary.

       Alternately, the dictionary location can be specified explicitly with either an absolute or a relative file path; so, for example:

           link-parser /usr/share/link-grammar/en

       will run link-parser using the English dictionary located in the typical install directory.

       link-parser can also be used in a non-interactive mode ("batch mode") via the -batch option (a special command, see below): So, for example:

           cat thesis.txt | link-parser -batch

       will read lines from the file thesis.txt, processing each one as a complete sentence. For sentences that don't have a full parse, it will print
       +++++ error N
       (N is a number) to the standard output.

       Alternately, an input file may be specified with the !file filename special command, described below.

       Note that using "batch mode" disables the usual ASCII-graphics linkage printing. The input sentences also don't appear by default on stdout.  These features may be  re-enabled  via  special  commands;
       special commands may be interspersed with the input.

       Instead of specifying -batch in the command-line, !batch can be specified in the said input file.

       For more details, use !help batch in link-parser's interactive shell.

OPTIONS
       --help Print usage and exit.

       --version
              Print program version and configuration details, and exit.

       --quiet
              Suppress the version messages on startup.

   Special ! commands
       The  special  "!" commands can be specified as command-line options in the command-line, or within the interactive shell itself by prefixing them with "!" on line start.  The full option name does not
       need to be used; only enough letters to make the option unique must be specified.

       When specifying as a command-line option, a special command is proceeded by "-" instead of "!".

       Boolean variables may be toggled simply by giving the !varname, for example, !batch.  Setting other variables require using an equals sign: !varname=value, for example, !width=100.

       The !help command prints general help. When issued from the interactive shell, it can get an argument, usually a special command.  The !variables command prints all of the current  variable  settings.
       The !file command reads input from its argument file.  The !file command is not a variable; it cannot be set.  It can be used repeatedly.

       The !exit command instructs link-parser to exit.

       The exclamation mark "!" is also a special command by itself, used to inspect the dictionary entry for any given word (optionally terminated by a subscript).  Thus two exclamation marks are needed be‐
       fore such a word when doing so from the interactive shell. The wildcard character "*" can be specified as the last character of the word in order to find multiple matches.

       Default values of the special commands below are shown in parenthesis. Most of them are the default ones of the link-grammar library.
       Boolean default values are shown as on (1) or off (0).

       !bad (off)
              Enable display of bad linkages.

       !batch (off)
              Enable batch mode.

       !constituents (0)
              Generate constituent output. Its value may be:

              0      Disabled

              1      Treebank-style constituent tree

              2      Flat, bracketed tree [A like [B this B] A]

              3      Flat, treebank-style tree (A like (B this))

       !cost-max (2.7)
              Largest cost to be considered.

       !dialect (no value)
              Use the specified (comma-separated) names.
              They modify the disjunct cost of dictionary words whose expressions contain symbolic cost specifications.

       !disjuncts (off)
              Display of disjuncts used.

       !echo (off)
              Echo input sentence.

       !graphics (on)
              Enable graphical display of linkage.  For each linkage, the sentence is printed along with a graphical representation of its linkage above it.

              The following notations are used for words in the sentence:

              [word] A word with no linkage.

              word[?].x
                     An unknown word whose POS category x has been found by the parser.

              word[!]
                     An unknown word whose link-grammar dictionary entry has been assigned by a RegEx.  (Use !morphology=1 to see the said dictionary entry.)

              word[~]
                     There was an unknown word in this position, and it has got replaced, using a spell guess with this word, that is found in the link-grammar dictionary.

              word[&]
                     This word is a part of an unknown word which has been found to consist of two or more words that are in the link-grammar dictionary.

              word.POS
                     This word found in the dictionary as word.POS.

              word.#CORRECTION
                     This word is probably a typo - got linked as an alternative word CORRECTION.

              For dictionaries that support morphology (enable with !morphology=1):

              word=  A prefix morpheme

              =word  A suffix morpheme

              word.= A stem

       !islands-ok (on)
              Use null-linked islands.

       !limit (1000)
              Limit the maximum linkages processed.

       !links (off)
              Enable display of complete link data.

       !null (on)
              Allow null links.

       !morphology (off)
              Display word morphology.  When a word matches a RegEx, show the matching dictionary entry.

       !panic (on)
              Use "panic mode" if a parse cannot be quickly found.
              The command !panic_variables prints the special variables that are used only in "panic mode".

       !postscript (off)
              Generate postscript output.

       !short (16)
              Maximum length of short links.

       !spell (7)
              If zero, no spell and run-on corrections of unknown words are performed.
              Else, use up to this many spell-guesses per unknown word. In that case, the number of run-on corrections (word split) of unknown words is not limited.

       !timeout (30)
              Abort parsing after this many seconds.

       !use-sat (off)
              Use Boolean SAT-based parser.

       !verbosity (1)
              Level of detail in output. Some useful values:

              0      No prompt, minimal library messages

              1      Normal verbosity

              2      Show times of the parsing steps

              3      Display some more information messages

              4      Display data file search and locale setup

              5-9    Tokenizer and parser debugging

              10-19  Dictionary debugging

              101    Print all the dictionary connectors, along with their length limit

       !walls (off)
              Display wall words.

       !width (16381)(*)
              The width of the display.
              * When writing to a terminal, this value is set from its width.

       !wordgraph (0)
              Display the wordgraph (word-split graph).

              0      Disabled

              1      Default display

              2      Display parent tokens as subgraphs

              3      Use esoteric display flags as set by !test=wg:FLAGS

FILES
       The following files are per-language, when LL is the 2-letter ISO language code.

       LL/4.0.dict
              The Link Grammar dictionary.

       LL/4.0.affix
              Values of entities used in tokenization.

       LL/4.0.regex
              Regular expressions (see regex(7)) that are used to match tokens not found in the dictionary.

       LL/4.0.dialect
              Dialect component definitions.

       LL/4.0.knowledge
              Post-processing definitions.

       LL/4.0.constituent-knowledge
              Definitions for producing a constituent tree.

       command-help-LL.txt or command-help-LL-CC.txt
              Help text for the !help topic special "!" command.  If several such files are provided, the desired one can be selected by e.g. the LANGUAGE environment variable if it is set  to  LL  or  LL-CC
              (default is en). Currently only command-help-en.txt is provided.

       The directory search order for these files is:
              • ./
              • data/
              • ../
              • ../data/
              •  A custom data directory, as set by the API call dictionary_set_data_dir().
              •  Installation-depended system data directory (*)

              * This location is displayed as DICTIONARY_DIR when the --version argument is provided to link-parser on the command line.  On windows it may be relative to the location of the link-grammar li‐
              brary DLL; in that case the actual location is displayed as "System data directory" when link-parser is invoked with -verbosity=4.
