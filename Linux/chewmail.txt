NAME
       chewmail - mail archiver

SYNOPSIS
       chewmail [OPTIONS] <MAILBOX> ...

DESCRIPTION
       chewmail is a program for archiving mail. It is inspired by the by the Python-based archivemail, but with more useful semantics. All mail is archived to the mailbox specified with the --output-box
       switch, in mbox format. It can read mailboxes in mbox, Maildir and MH formats.

       Internally, chewmail uses Mail::Box, so it supports file names and URLs supported by that module.

OPTIONS
       -o mailbox-format, --output-box=mailbox-format
           The  mailbox to archive messages to. The mailbox is run through the Date::Format module, so it supports all it's conversion specifiers. The date and time is relative to the messages timestamp,
           or the current time if the timestamp is impossible to determine. A sample of the conversion specifiers follows:

               %%      PERCENT
               %b      month abbr
               %B      month
               %d      numeric day of the month, with leading zeros (eg 01..31)
               %e      numeric day of the month, without leading zeros (eg 1..31)
               %D      MM/DD/YY
               %G      GPS week number (weeks since January 6, 1980)
               %h      month abbr
               %H      hour, 24 hour clock, leading 0's)
               %I      hour, 12 hour clock, leading 0's)
               %j      day of the year
               %k      hour
               %l      hour, 12 hour clock
               %L      month number, starting with 1
               %m      month number, starting with 01
               %n      NEWLINE
               %o      ornate day of month -- "1st", "2nd", "25th", etc.
               %t      TAB
               %U      week number, Sunday as first day of week
               %w      day of the week, numerically, Sunday == 0
               %W      week number, Monday as first day of week
               %x      date format: 11/19/94
               %y      year (2 digits)
               %Y      year (4 digits)

       -d days-old, --days=days-old
           Only archive messages older than than this many days.

       -D date, --date=date
           Only archive messages old than this date. The date can be any date understood by Perl's Date::Parse module.

       -R, --only-read
           Only archive messages that are marked seen or read.

       --delete-immediately
           Synchonize the mailboxes after every message is moved. This will be substantially slower but may provide better recovery for some mailbox formats in the event of a crash.

       --preserve-timestamp
           Preserve the atime and mtime of the input mailbox. This only affects file-based mailboxes, such as mbox.

       -n, --dry-run
           Go through all the motions of archiving the mail, but don't actually change any mailboxes.

       -v, --verbose
           Output more informational messages. Use multiple times for more verbosity.

       -q, --quiet
           Don't output any messages other than error messages.

       -V, --version
           Print the version number then exit.

       -h, --help
           Print usage information then exit.

EXAMPLES
       Archive two day old messages in inbox to inbox-old:

         chewmail --days 2 -o inbox-old inbox

       Archive read messages to a mailbox named the year-month of the message:

         chewmail --only-read -o %Y-%m inbox
