NAME
       xcwd - X current working directory

SYNOPSIS
       xcwd

DESCRIPTION
       xcwd  is a simple tool which prints the current working directory of the focused window.  It's useful for launching applications directly into the same directory as the focused application—for in‐
       stance, you might want to launch a new terminal in the same directory as your editor.  You can make this happen by binding something like

              urxvt -cd "$(xcwd)"

       to a keyboard shortcut within your window manager and then invoking that shortcut during editor usage.

EXIT STATUS
       xcwd exits with a nonzero status if it can't figure out the working directory associated with the currently focused window and $HOME is unset.  Otherwise, xcwd returns zero.

ENVIRONMENT
       If xcwd can't figure out the working directory associated with the currently focused window, it falls back on $HOME.

BUGS
       xcwd's algorithm fails when applied to most single-instance applications, applications with tabs, or terminal multiplexers.  lilyterm(1), screen(1), tmux(1), and urxvtc(1) are all known to fail.
