NAME
       kernel-wedge-preprocess - process a module list file

SYNOPSIS
       kernel-wedge preprocess module-list module-dir

DESCRIPTION
       Preprocesses the module-list, performing list includes and module excludes, removing blank lines and comments, and expanding wildcards.  Emits a list of filenames to stdout.

       Return 1 if a required module or directory is missing, unless $KW_CHECK_NONFATAL is non-empty.

       The supported wildcards are:

       ?    Match a single character within a path component
       *    Match any number of characters within a path component
       **   Match any number of characters including multiple path components

       On Linux, '-' and '_' also match each other since the kernel and kmod treat them as equivalent in module names.
