NAME
       MooseX::Types::LaxNum - A LaxNum type which provides the loose behavior of Moose's Num pre-2.10

VERSION
       version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
          #!/usr/bin/env perl

          use strict;
          use warnings;

          package Foo {
              use Moose;
              use MooseX::Types::LaxNum;

              has 'laxnum', is => 'rw', isa => 'LaxNum';
          }

          my $foo = Foo->new( laxnum => '1234' );

DESCRIPTION
       "LaxNum" accepts everything for which "looks_like_number" in Scalar::Util return true.  It can be used to get the old behaviour of "Moose::Util::TypeConstraints::Num", since Num has been changed
       to be more strict.
