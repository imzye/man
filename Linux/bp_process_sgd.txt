NAME
       bp_process_sgd.pl - Massage SGD annotation flat files into a version suitable for the Generic Genome Browser

SYNOPSIS
         % bp_process_sgd.pl chromosomal_features.tab > yeast.gff

DESCRIPTION
       This script massages the SGD sequence annotation flat files located at ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/data_dump/feature/chromosomal_features.tab into a version of the GFF format suitable for
       display by the generic genome browser.

       To use this script, get the SGD chromosomal_features.tab file from the FTP site listed above, and run the following command:

         % bp_process_sgd.pl chromosomal_features.tab > yeast.gff

       The yeast.gff file can then be loaded into a Bio::DB::GFF database using the following command:

         % bulk_load_gff.pl -d <databasename> yeast.gff
