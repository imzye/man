NAME
       sgmlpre - handle SGML conditionalization for SGML-tools

SYNOPSIS
       sgmlpre [options] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the sgmlpre commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page for sgmlpre.

       sgmlpre is a program that handle SGML conditionalization for SGML-tools

       It is used by other programs in sgml-tools (v1), and usually normal user does not need to use this program directly by himself.

       Following is quoted from the header in the source code.

              Filter  SGML  according  to  conditionalizing markup.  Argument/value pairs from the command line are matched against the attributes of <#if> and <#unless> tags.  Spans between <#if>/</#if> are
              passed through unaltered if there is no attribute mismatch; spans between <#unless></#unless> are passed if there is at least one attribute mismatch.  An attribute mismatch happens  if  an  at‐
              tribute  occurs  in  both the command-line arguments and the tag, but the values do not match.  Value matching is by string equality, except that "|" is interpreted as an alternation character.
              Even if a span is not passed through, its newlines are (this to avoid messing up the line  numbers in error messages).

              This lexer requires flex.  Limitations; attribute names may only be 256 chars long, values may be only 16384 (YY_BUF_SIZE) characters long.  Doesn't do checking that only </if> matches <if> and
              </unless> matches <unless> (that would need a stack and introduce another limit).

OPTIONS
       The program does not support normal command line options.
