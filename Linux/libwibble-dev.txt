NAME
       wibble-test-genrunner - Code generator for wibble testsuites.

SYNOPSIS
       wibble-test-genrunner header <file>

       wibble-test-genrunner main <files>

DESCRIPTION
       The  program generates .cpp files that are then compiled and linked into a test program for running tests from .test.h files. Examples of such .test.h files may be found among wibble headers,
       eg. /usr/include/wibble/regexp.test.h.

       In the first form, the program processes a single header file (usually of the form foo.test.h) and produces a corresponding .cpp file to be compiled. In the second form, it takes  as  <files>
       all  the  .test.h  headers  and produces a single main.cpp which contains the main() function of the test program, which then runs all the tests in all the .test.h files. The generated source
       code is always written to standard output and it is left up to the user to redirect it to a meaningful location.

       The program currently has no options other than the two forms above. The program is intended to be run as part of build process of programs or libraries using the  wibble  testing  framework.
       For  convenient  use  from  CMake, there is a test.cmake script under /usr/share/wibble, that takes care of producing all the .cpp files (both per-header and the main one), compiling them and
       linking them into a single binary which executes the testsuite.
