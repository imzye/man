NAME
       ping_pong - measures the ping-pong byte range lock latency

SYNOPSIS
       ping_pong {-r | -w | -rw} [-m] [-c] {FILENAME} {NUM-LOCKS}

DESCRIPTION
       ping_pong measures the byte range lock latency. It is especially useful
       on a cluster of nodes sharing a common lock manager as it will give
       some indication of the lock manager's performance under stress.

       FILENAME is a file on shared storage to use for byte range locking
       tests.

       NUM-LOCKS is the number of byte range locks, so needs to be (strictly)
       greater than the number of nodes in the cluster.

OPTIONS
       -r
           test read performance

       -w
           test write performance

       -m
           use mmap

       -c
           validate the locks

EXAMPLES
       Testing lock coherence

                 ping_pong test.dat N

       Testing lock coherence with lock validation

                 ping_pong -c test.dat N

       Testing IO coherence

                 ping_pong -rw test.dat N
