NAME
       autobox::List::Util - bring the List::Util functions to autobox

VERSION
       Version 20090629

SYNOPSIS
       "autobox::List::Util" brings all of the functions from List::Util to arrays as methods.

           use autobox::List::Util;

           my @array = qw/ foo bar baz /;

           print @array->first(sub { /ar/ }), "\n"; # "bar"

           print [5, 6, 3, 4]->max, "\n"; # 6

           print @array->maxstr, "\n"; # baz

           print [5, 6, 3, 4]->min, "\n"; # 3

           print @array->minstr, "\n"; # foo

           print [1 .. 10]->shuffle, "\n"; #1 to 10 randomly shuffled

           print [1 .. 10]->sum, "\n"; # 55

           print [1 .. 10]->reduce( sub { $a + $b } ), "\n"; # 55

METHODS
   first(coderef)
       This method behaves nearly the same as the first function from List::Util, but it takes a coderef not a block because methods can't use prototypes.

   reduce(coderef)
       This method behaves nearly the same as the reduce function from List::Util, but it takes a coderef not a block for the same reason.  It also has a bug (see BUGS)

   shuffle
       If called in scalar context it returns a reference to an array instead of a list.  This allows shuffle to be chained with other calls.

   max, maxstr, min, minstr, sum
       These methods behave exactly the same as their List::Util counterparts.

BUGS
       The reduce method works with $main::a and $main::b, not your current package's $a and $b, so you need to say

           print @array->reduce( sub { $main::a + $main::b } ), "\n";

       if you are not in the main package.  Reduce uses $_, so it doesn't suffer from this problem.
