Email::LocalDelivery::Maildir(3pm)                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                  Email::LocalDelivery::Maildir(3pm)

NAME
       Email::LocalDelivery::Maildir - deliver mail to a Maildir

VERSION
       version 1.201

PERL VERSION
       This code is effectively abandonware.  Although releases will sometimes be made to update contact info or to fix packaging flaws, bug reports will mostly be ignored.  Feature requests are even
       more likely to be ignored.  (If someone takes up maintenance of this code, they will presumably remove this notice.)  This means that whatever version of perl is currently required is unlikely to
       change -- but also that it might change at any new maintainer's whim.

INSTEAD...
       Instead, consider using Email::Sender::Transport::Maildir.
