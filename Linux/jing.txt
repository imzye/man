NAME
       jing - validate an XML document using a RELAX NG schema

SYNOPSIS
       jing [-cfit] [-e encoding] rng-file [xml-file...]

DESCRIPTION
       If  rng-file is a correct RELAX NG schema and each xml-file is a well-formed XML document that is valid with respect to rng-file, then jing will be silent and terminate with a status of 0.  Other‐
       wise, jing will report one or more errors to the standard output and will terminate with a status of 1.  Both rng-file and xml-file can be filenames or URIs.

OPTIONS
       -c     Uses the compact syntax for the schema.

       -e enc Uses the encoding enc to read the schema.

       -f     Checks that the document is feasibly valid. A document is feasibly valid if it could be transformed into a valid document by inserting any number of attributes and child  elements  anywhere
              in  the  tree.   This is equivalent to transforming the schema by wrapping every data, list, element and attribute element in an optional element and then validating against the transformed
              schema. This option may be useful while a document is still under construction.  This option also disables checking that for every IDREF there is a corresponding ID.

       -i     Disables checking of ID/IDREF/IDREFS. By default, Jing enforces the constraints imposed by RELAX NG DTD Compatibility with respect to ID/IDREF/IDREFS.

       -t     Prints the time used by Jing for loading the schema and for validation.
