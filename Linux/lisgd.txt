NAME
       lisgd - libinput synthetic gesture daemon

SYNOPSIS
       lisgd [-d devicepath] [-g gesturespec]...  [-t threshold] [-m timeoutms] [-o orientation] [-w width] [-h height] [-r degreesofleniency] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       lisgd  (or  libinput  synthetic gesture daemon) lets you bind gestures based on libinput touch events to run specific commands to execute. For example, dragging left to right with one finger could
       execute a particular command like launching a terminal. Directional L-R, R-L, U-D, and D-U gestures and diagnol LD-RU, RD-LU, UR-DL, UL-DR gestures are supported with 1 through n fingers  and  can
       be bound to the screen's edges and/or made sensitive to the distance of the gesture.

       Unlike  other  libinput  gesture daemons, lisgd uses touch events to recognize synthetic swipe gestures rather than using the libinput's gesture events. The advantage of this is that the synthetic
       gestures you define via lisgd can be used on touchscreens, which normal libinput gestures don't support.

       This program was built for use on the Pinephone however it could be used in general for any device that supports touch events, like laptop touchscreens or similar.  You  may  want  to  adjust  the
       threshold depending on the device you're using.

OPTIONS
       -d, -d devicepath
              Path of the dev filesystem device to monitor (like /dev/input/event1).

       -g, -g nfingers,gesture,edge,distance,actmode,command
              Allows you to bind a gesture wherein nfingers is an integer, gesture is one of {LR,RL,DU,UD,DLUR,DRUL,URDL,ULDR}, edge is one of * (any), N (none), L (left), R (right), T (top), B (bottom),
              TL  (top  left), TR (top right), BL (bottom left), BR (bottom right) and distance is one of * (any), S (short), M (medium), L (large), actmode is R (release) for normal mode and P (pressed)
              for pressed mode (but this field may be omitted entirely for backward compatibility), command is the shell command to be executed.

              The -g option can be used multiple times to bind multiple gestures.

       -m, -m timeoutms
              Number of milliseconds gestures must be performed within to be registered. After the timeoutms value; the gesture won't be registered.

       -o, -o orientation
              Number of 90-degree rotations to translate gestures by. Can be set to 0-3. For example using 1; a L-R gesture would become a U-D gesture. Meant to be used for screen-rotation.

       -r, -r degreesofleniency
              Number of degrees offset each 45-degree interval may still be recognized within.  Maximum value is 45. Default value is 15. E.g. U-D is a 180 degree gesture but with 15 degrees of  leniency
              will be recognized between 165-195 degrees.

       -t, -t distancethreshold
              Threshold in libinput units (pixels) after which a gesture registers. Defaults to 125.

       -T, -T distancethreshold_pressed
              Threshold in libinput units (pixels) after which a gesture registers when fingers are not lifted. Defaults to 60.

       -w, -w screnwidth
              Allows  you to specify the width of the screen area to be used for edge-based gestures. Should be used in conjunction with -h. If unset, and either the DISPLAY or WAYLAND_DISPLAY env var is
              set, X/Wayland dynamic screen geometry detection will be used instead.

       -h, -h screenheight
              Allows you to specify the height of the screen area to be used for edge-based gestures. Should be used in conjunction with -w. If unset, and either the DISPLAY or WAYLAND_DISPLAY env var is
              set, X/Wayland dynamic screen geometry detection will be used instead.

       -v     Enables verbose mode which prints debugging messages.
