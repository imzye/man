NAME
       git-dag - The sleek and powerful Git history browser

SYNOPSIS
       git dag [options] [<since>..<until>] [[–] [<path>…]]

DESCRIPTION
       git-dag  is a powerful Git history visualizer.  git-dag presents power‐
       ful git log features in a simple-to-use graphical interface.

OPTIONS
   –prompt
       Prompt for a Git repository instead of using the current directory.

   -r, –repo <path>
       Run git dag on the git repository in <path>.  Defaults to  the  current
       directory.

   –version
       Print the git dag version and exit.

   -h, –help
       Show usage and optional arguments.

LOG OPTIONS
       The  Log  prompt  allows you to pass arguments to git log.  This can be
       used to filter the displayed history, for example entering main – Make‐
       file  will display only commits on the main branch that touch the Make‐
       file.

CONTEXT-MENU ACTIONS
       The right-click menu can be  used  to  perform  various  actions.   All
       actions operate on the selected commit.

       You  can  create  branches and tags, cherry-pick commits, save patches,
       export tarballs, and grab files from older commits  using  the  context
       menu.

DIFF COMMITS
       You  can  diff arbitrary commits.  Select a single commit in either the
       list view or the graph view and then right-click on a second commit.

       A menu will appear allowing you to diff the two commits.

SHORTCUTS
       You can run commands using dedicated shortcuts. Select a single  commit
       and then press Ctrl-Alt-c to copy sha1 or Ctrl-d to run diff tool.

       You  can  read  more  about hotkeys from ‘keyboard shortcuts’ window or
       context menu.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
   log.date
       Set the default date-time format for the ‘Date’ field.  Setting a value
       for log.date is similar to using git log’s –date option.  Possible val‐
       ues are relative, local, default, iso, rfc, and short;  see  git-log(1)
       for details.
