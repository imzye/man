NAME
       GShisen - Shizen-sho puzzle game for GNUstep

SYNOPSIS
       GShisen

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the GShisen command.

       GShisen is a Shizen-sho puzzle game for GNUstep.  The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the field.  Only two matching tiles can be removed at a time.  Two tiles can only be removed if
       they can be connected with at most three connected lines.  Lines can be horizontal or vertical but not diagonal.  Lines may cross the empty border.

       The "Get hint" option from the menu can be used if the player is out of ideas.

OPTIONS
       Like most GNUstep applications, GShisen does not support any command-line options except the standard GNUstep ones.

SEE ALSO
       GNUstep(7).

AUTHORS
       GShisen was written by James Dessart, Enrico Sersale and Larry Coleman.  It was further improved by members of the GNUstep Application Project.

       This manual page was written by Yavor Doganov <yavor@gnu.org> for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have one.
