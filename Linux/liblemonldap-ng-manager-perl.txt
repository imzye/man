SYNOPSIS
         require Lemonldap::NG::Manager::Conf::Parser;
         my $parser = Lemonldap::NG::Manager::Conf::Parser->new(
             { tree => $new, refConf => $self->currentConf }
         );
         my $res = { result => $parser->check };
         $res->{message} = $parser->{message};
         foreach my $t (qw(errors warnings changes)) {
             push @{ $res->{details} }, { message => $t, items => $parser->$t }

DESCRIPTION
       Lemonldap::NG::Manager::Conf::Parser checks new configuration

       This package is used by Manager to examine uploaded configuration. It is currently called using check() which return a boolean.  check() looks if a newConf is available. If not, it builds it from
       uploaded JSON (using scanTree() subroutine)

       Messages are stored in errors(), warnings() and changes() as arrays.

       This interface uses Plack to be compatible with CGI, FastCGI,...
