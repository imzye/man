NAME
       ansible-inventory - Show Ansible inventory information, by default it uses the inventory script JSON format

SYNOPSIS
       usage: ansible-inventory [-h] [--version] [-v] [-i INVENTORY] [-l SUBSET]
              [--flush-cache]  [--vault-id  VAULT_IDS]  [-J  | --vault-password-file VAULT_PASSWORD_FILES] [--playbook-dir BASEDIR] [-e EXTRA_VARS] [--list] [--host HOST] [--graph] [-y] [--toml] [--vars]
              [--export] [--output OUTPUT_FILE] [group]

DESCRIPTION
       used to display or dump the configured inventory as Ansible sees it

COMMON OPTIONS
          The name of a group in the inventory, relevant when using --graph

       --export
          When doing --list, represent in a way that is optimized for export,not as an accurate representation of how Ansible has processed it

       --flush-cache
          clear the fact cache for every host in inventory

       --graph
          create inventory graph, if supplying pattern it must be a valid group name. It will ignore limit

       --host 'HOST'
          Output specific host info, works as inventory script. It will ignore limit

       --list
          Output all hosts info, works as inventory script

       --output 'OUTPUT_FILE'
          When doing --list, send the inventory to a file instead of to the screen

       --playbook-dir 'BASEDIR'
          Since this tool does not use playbooks, use this as a substitute playbook directory. This sets the relative path for many features including roles/ group_vars/ etc.

       --toml
          Use TOML format instead of default JSON, ignored for --graph

       --vars
          Add vars to graph display, ignored unless used with --graph

       --vault-id
          the vault identity to use. This argument may be specified multiple times.

       --vault-password-file, --vault-pass-file
          vault password file

       --version
          show program's version number, config file location, configured module search path, module location, executable location and exit

       -J, --ask-vault-password, --ask-vault-pass
          ask for vault password

       -e, --extra-vars
          set additional variables as key=value or YAML/JSON, if filename prepend with @. This argument may be specified multiple times.

       -h, --help
          show this help message and exit

       -i, --inventory, --inventory-file
          specify inventory host path or comma separated host list. This argument may be specified multiple times.

       -l 'SUBSET', --limit 'SUBSET'
          further limit selected hosts to an additional pattern

       -v, --verbose
          Causes Ansible to print more debug messages. Adding multiple -v will increase the verbosity, the builtin plugins currently evaluate up to -vvvvvv. A reasonable level to start is  -vvv,  connec‐
          tion debugging might require -vvvv. This argument may be specified multiple times.

       -y, --yaml
          Use YAML format instead of default JSON, ignored for --graph

ARGUMENTS
       group

       The name of a group in the inventory, relevant when using --graph

INVENTORY
       Ansible  stores the hosts it can potentially operate on in an inventory.  This can be an YAML file, ini-like file, a script, directory, list, etc.  For additional options, see the documentation on
       <https://docs.ansible.com/> .

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables may be specified.

       ANSIBLE_INVENTORY  -- Override the default ansible inventory sources

       ANSIBLE_CONFIG -- Specify override location for the ansible config file

       Many more are available for most options in ansible.cfg

       For a full list check  <https://docs.ansible.com/> . or use the ansible-config command.

FILES
       /etc/ansible/hosts -- Default inventory file

       /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg -- Config file, used if present

       ~/.ansible.cfg -- User config file, overrides the default config if present

       ./ansible.cfg -- Local config file (in current working directory) assumed to be 'project specific' and overrides the rest if present.

       As mentioned above, the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable will override all others.
