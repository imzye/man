NAME
       sxid.conf — configuration settings for sXid

DESCRIPTION
       This is the configuration file used by sXid to define it's parameters for execution. By default it is /etc/sxid.conf but can be anything using the --config command line option for sXid.

       Options in this file are in the form of

       OPTION = "VALUE"

       Note that the VALUE must be contained in double quotes.

OPTIONS
       ALWAYS_NOTIFY
               If sXid does not find any changes it will not send an email unless you specify "yes" here.

       ALWAYS_ROTATE
               Usually  sXid  will  only rotate the log files when there is a change from the last run. This is usually best, since all logs will record a change rather than just a run of the program. If
               you want to rotate the logs every time sXid is run, regardless of changes, specify "yes" here.

       EMAIL   Where to send the email containing the output of changes every time sXid is run. Example:

               EMAIL = "System Administrator <sysadmin@example.com>"

       ENFORCE
               Normally sXid only flags items which are suid or sgid and are in a FORBIDDEN directory. With this option set to "yes" sXid will remove the s[ug]id bit(s) on any  files  or  directories  it
               finds in forbidden directories and report any changes in the email. Note that directories listed in FORBIDDEN are searched regardless of whether or not they are listed in SEARCH.  However,
               EXCLUDE option still apply to directories that fall under them.

       EXCLUDE
               A  space separated list of directories to exclude from the search. Note that if a SEARCH path falls under an EXCLUDE path that it will still be searched. This is useful for excluding whole
               directories and only specifying one. Example:

               SEARCH  = "/usr /usr/src/linux"
               EXCLUDE = "/usr/src"

       EXTRA_LIST
               File that contains a list of (each on it's own line)  of other files that sXid should monitor. This is useful for files that aren't  +s,  but  relate  to  system  integrity  (tcpd,  inetd,
               apache...). Example:

               EXTRA_LIST = "/etc/sxid.list"

       FORBIDDEN
               A  space  separated  list of directories that are not supposed to contain any suid or sgid items. Items which are suid or sgid in these directories are flagged in the email separately from
               the other listings whether there are other changes or not. Example:

               FORBIDDEN = "/tmp /home"

       IGNORE_DIRS
               Ignore entries for directories in these paths. This means that only files will be recorded. You can effectively ignore all directory entries by setting this to "/".

       KEEP_LOGS
               This is a numerical value for how many log files to keep when rotating.

       LISTALL
               Forces a list of all entries to be included in th output. Implies ALWAYS_NOTIFY.

       LOG_FILE
               The full path of where to store the log files. These will be rotated, each rotated log being suffixed with a digit. The directories must already exist.  This is usually  /var/log/sxid.log.
               Rotated logs would look like /var/log/sxid.log.n where “n” is the number in the rotation. The current log has no suffix.

       MAIL_PROG
               Mail program. This changes the default compiled in mailer for reports. You only need this if you have changed it's location and don't want to recompile sXid.

       SEARCH  A space separated list of directories to search.  sXid will use these as a starting point for it's searches. Example:

               SEARCH = "/usr /bin /lib"
