NAME
       Devel::CheckBin - check that a command is available

SYNOPSIS
           use Devel::CheckBin;

DESCRIPTION
       Devel::CheckBin is a perl module that checks whether a particular command is available.

USING IT IN Makefile.PL or Build.PL
       If you want to use this from Makefile.PL or Build.PL, do not simply copy the module into your distribution as this may cause problems when PAUSE and search.cpan.org index the distro. Instead, use
       the 'configure_requires'.
