NAME
       tmperamental - avoid writing to /tmp

SYNOPSIS
       tmperamental cmd arg1 arg2 ...

DESCRIPTION
       tmperamental uses a preloaded library that intercepts filesystem writes, and causes loud failures when writes are attempted on /tmp/*

       The idea here is by setting TMPDIR and friends, it catches programs in the act of not respecting such env-vars.

USAGE
       Prefix the command you want to run with tmperamental and it should cause it to abort if it ever tries to write anywhere within /tmp.  This is pretty brutal, so you probably only want to use it for
       testing.

ENVIRONMENT
       If TMPDIR is unset, tmperamental will set it automatically to $HOME/tmp.

       tmperamental uses LD_PRELOAD to load a custom library libtmperamental.so that intercepts library calls.

LIMITATIONS
       tmperamental  only catches writes to /tmp at shared object library calls using the standard libc interface.  A statically-compiled program that makes system calls directly will be able to write to
       /tmp without being intercepted.
