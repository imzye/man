NAME
       svm-train - train one or more SVM instance(s) on a given data set to produce a model file

SYNOPSIS
       svm-train [-s svm_type ] [ -t kernel_type ] [ -d degree ] [ -g gamma ] [ -r coef0 ] [ -c cost ] [ -n nu ] [ -p epsilon ] [ -m cachesize ] [ -e epsilon ] [ -h shrinking ] [ -b probability_estimates ] ]
       [ -wi weight ] [ -v n ] [ -q ]

       training_set_file [ model_file ]

DESCRIPTION
       svm-train trains a Support Vector Machine to learn the data indicated in the training_set_file
        and produce a model_file
        to save the results of the learning optimization.  This model can be used later with svm_predict(1) or other LIBSVM enabled software.

OPTIONS
       -s svm_type
              svm_type defaults to 0 and can be any value between 0 and 4 as follows:

       0      -- C-SVC

       1      -- nu-SVC

       2      -- one-class SVM

       3      -- epsilon-SVR

       4      -- nu-SVR

       -t kernel_type
              kernel_type defaults to 2 (Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel) and can be any value between 0 and 4 as follows:

       0      -- linear: u.v

       1      -- polynomial: (gamma*u.v + coef0)^degree

       2      -- radial basis function: exp(-gamma*|u-v|^2)

       3      -- sigmoid: tanh(gamma*u.v + coef0)

       4      -- precomputed kernel (kernel values in training_set_file) --

       -d degree
              Sets the degree of the kernel function, defaulting to 3

       -g gamma
              Adjusts the gamma in the kernel function (default 1/k)

       -r coef0
              Sets the coef0 (constant offset) in the kernel function (default 0)

       -c cost
              Sets the parameter C ( cost ) of C-SVC, epsilon-SVR, and nu-SVR (default 1)

       -n nu  Sets the parameter nu of nu-SVC, one-class SVM, and nu-SVR (default 0.5)

       -p epsilon
              Set the epsilon in the loss function of epsilon-SVR (default 0.1)

       -m cachesize
              Set the cache memory size to cachesize in MB (default 100)

       -e epsilon
              Set the tolerance of termination criterion to epsilon (default 0.001)

       -h shrinking
              Whether to use the shrinking
               heuristics, 0 or 1 (default 1)

       -b probability-estimates
              probability_estimates is a binary value indicating whether to calculate probability estimates when training the SVC or SVR model.  Values are 0 or 1 and defaults to 0 for speed.

       -wi weight
              Set the parameter C (cost) of class i to weight*C, for C-SVC (default 1)

       -v n   Set n for n -fold cross validation mode

       -q     quiet mode; suppress messages to stdout.

FILES
       training_set_file must be prepared in the following simple sparse training vector format:

       <label> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> . . .

        .

        .

        .

       There is one sample per line.  Each sample consists of a target value (label or regression target) followed by a sparse representation of the input vector.  All unmentioned coordinates are assumed  to
       be  0.   For  classification,  <label> is an integer indicating the class label (multi-class is supported). For regression, <label> is the target value which can be any real number. For one-class SVM,
       it's not used so can be any number.  Except using precomputed kernels (explained in another section), <index>:<value> gives a feature (attribute) value.  <index> is an  integer  starting  from  1  and
       <value> is a real number. Indices must be in an ASCENDING order.

ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None documented; see Vapnik et al.

BUGS
       Please report bugs to the Debian BTS.
