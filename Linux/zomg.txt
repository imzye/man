NAME
       zomg - libre.fm submission and radio client

SYNOPSIS

       zomg [-n] [-z] [musicfile-or-dir...]

       zomg -r [libre.fm url]

DESCRIPTION
       For each file given on the command line, zomg will attempt to play the track then submit the requisite metadata to your last.fm profile, libre.fm profile, or any combination of servers you have
       configured in ~/.zomg/conf .

       If it fails to get a success response or if -n is used, zomg will stop attempting to make outbound TCP connections, and will cache played tracks until zomg is next invoked, at which point it will
       attempt to flush the cache (thereby submitting all tracks to the servers). Independent caches are maintained per-service.

       zomg will recurse through each directory given on the command line and add playable files within to its internal playlist. You may intersperse directories and files as you wish.

       If -z is used, zomg will shuffle the order that the tracks in the internal playlist (either passed on the command line without -t or within directories passed on the command line with -t) are
       played.

       Finally, if -r is used, zomg will enter interactive radio mode. If a last.fm-style URL is passed to zomg-r, it will tune to that station before presenting the user with its initial prompt.
