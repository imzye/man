NAME
       salloc - Obtain a Slurm job allocation (a set of nodes), execute a command, and then release the allocation when the command is finished.

SYNOPSIS
       salloc [OPTIONS(0)...] [ : [OPTIONS(N)...]] [command(0) [args(0)...]]

       Option(s) define multiple jobs in a co-scheduled heterogeneous job.  For more details about heterogeneous jobs see the document
       https://slurm.schedmd.com/heterogeneous_jobs.html

DESCRIPTION
       salloc  is  used  to allocate a Slurm job allocation, which is a set of resources (nodes), possibly with some set of constraints (e.g. number of processors per node).  When salloc successfully obtains
       the requested allocation, it then runs the command specified by the user.  Finally, when the user specified command is complete, salloc relinquishes the job allocation.

       The command may be any program the user wishes.  Some typical commands are xterm, a shell script containing srun commands, and srun (see the EXAMPLES section). If no command is specified, then  salloc
       runs the user's default shell.

       The following document describes the influence of various options on the allocation of cpus to jobs and tasks.
       https://slurm.schedmd.com/cpu_management.html

       NOTE:  The salloc logic includes support to save and restore the terminal line settings and is designed to be executed in the foreground. If you need to execute salloc in the background, set its stan‐
       dard input to some file, for example: "salloc -n16 a.out </dev/null &"

RETURN VALUE
       If salloc is unable to execute the user command, it will return 1 and print errors to stderr. Else if success or if killed by signals HUP, INT, KILL, or QUIT: it will return 0.

COMMAND PATH RESOLUTION
       If provided, the command is resolved in the following order:

       1. If command starts with ".", then path is constructed as: current working directory / command
       2. If command starts with a "/", then path is considered absolute.
       3. If command can be resolved through PATH. See path_resolution(7).
       4. If command is in current working directory.

       Current working directory is the calling process working directory unless the --chdir argument is passed, which will override the current working directory.

OPTIONS
       -A, --account=<account>
              Charge resources used by this job to specified account.  The account is an arbitrary string. The account name may be changed after job submission using the scontrol command.

       --acctg-freq
              Define the job accounting and profiling sampling intervals.  This can be used to override the JobAcctGatherFrequency parameter in Slurm's configuration file, slurm.conf.  The  supported  format
              is as follows:

              --acctg-freq=<datatype>=<interval>
                          where  <datatype>=<interval> specifies the task sampling interval for the jobacct_gather plugin or a sampling interval for a profiling type by the acct_gather_profile plugin. Multi‐
                          ple, comma-separated <datatype>=<interval> intervals may be specified. Supported datatypes are as follows:

                          task=<interval>
                                 where <interval> is the task sampling interval in seconds for the jobacct_gather plugins and for task profiling by the acct_gather_profile plugin.  NOTE:  This  frequency  is
                                 used  to  monitor memory usage. If memory limits are enforced the highest frequency a user can request is what is configured in the slurm.conf file.  They can not turn it off
                                 (=0) either.

                          energy=<interval>
                                 where <interval> is the sampling interval in seconds for energy profiling using the acct_gather_energy plugin

                          network=<interval>
                                 where <interval> is the sampling interval in seconds for infiniband profiling using the acct_gather_interconnect plugin.

                          filesystem=<interval>
                                 where <interval> is the sampling interval in seconds for filesystem profiling using the acct_gather_filesystem plugin.

              The default value for the task sampling interval
              is 30. The default value for all other intervals is 0.  An interval of 0 disables sampling of the specified type.  If the task sampling interval is 0, accounting information is  collected  only
              at job termination (reducing Slurm interference with the job).
              Smaller (non-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance, but a value of 30 seconds is not likely to be noticeable for applications having less than 10,000 tasks.

       -B --extra-node-info=<sockets[:cores[:threads]]>
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of sockets, cores per socket and/or threads per core.  NOTE: These options do not specify the resource allocation size.  Each
              value specified is considered a minimum.  An asterisk (*) can be used as a placeholder indicating that all available resources of that type are to be utilized. Values can also be  specified  as
              min-max. The individual levels can also be specified in separate options if desired:
                  --sockets-per-node=<sockets>
                  --cores-per-socket=<cores>
                  --threads-per-core=<threads>
              If  task/affinity  plugin  is enabled, then specifying an allocation in this manner also results in subsequently launched tasks being bound to threads if the -B option specifies a thread count,
              otherwise an option of cores if a core count is specified, otherwise an option of sockets.  If SelectType is configured to select/cons_res, it must have a parameter of CR_Core,  CR_Core_Memory,
              CR_Socket,  or CR_Socket_Memory for this option to be honored.  If not specified, the scontrol show job will display 'ReqS:C:T=*:*:*'. This option applies to job allocations.  NOTE: This option
              is mutually exclusive with --hint, --threads-per-core and --ntasks-per-core.

       --bb=<spec>
              Burst buffer specification. The form of the specification is system dependent.  Note the burst buffer may not be accessible from a login node, but require that salloc spawn a shell  on  one  of
              its allocated compute nodes.

       --bbf=<file_name>
              Path  of  file containing burst buffer specification.  The form of the specification is system dependent.  Also see --bb.  Note the burst buffer may not be accessible from a login node, but re‐
              quire that salloc spawn a shell on one of its allocated compute nodes.

       --begin=<time>
              Defer eligibility of this job allocation until the specified time.

              Time may be of the form HH:MM:SS to run a job at a specific time of day (seconds are optional).  (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)  You may also specify  midnight,  noon,
              fika  (3  PM)  or teatime (4 PM) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying a
              date of the form MMDDYY or MM/DD/YY YYYY-MM-DD. Combine date and time using the following format YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]. You can also  give  times  like  now  +  count  time-units,  where  the
              time-units  can  be  seconds  (default), minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell Slurm to run the job today with the keyword today and to run the job tomorrow with the keyword tomorrow.
              The value may be changed after job submission using the scontrol command.  For example:
                 --begin=16:00
                 --begin=now+1hour
                 --begin=now+60           (seconds by default)
                 --begin=2010-01-20T12:34:00

              Notes on date/time specifications:
               - Although the 'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is allowed by the code, note that the poll time of the Slurm scheduler is not precise enough to guarantee dispatch of the  job
              on  the exact second.  The job will be eligible to start on the next poll following the specified time. The exact poll interval depends on the Slurm scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds with the default
              sched/builtin).
               - If no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
               - If a date is specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current year is assumed, unless the combination of MM/DD and HH:MM:SS has already passed for that year, in which  case  the  next
              year is used.

       --bell Force  salloc  to ring the terminal bell when the job allocation is granted (and only if stdout is a tty).  By default, salloc only rings the bell if the allocation is pending for more than ten
              seconds (and only if stdout is a tty). Also see the option --no-bell.

       --cluster-constraint=<list>
              Specifies features that a federated cluster must have to have a sibling job submitted to it. Slurm will attempt to submit a sibling job to a cluster if it has at least one of the specified fea‐
              tures.

       --comment=<string>
              An arbitrary comment.

       -C, --constraint=<list>
              Nodes  can  have  features assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.  Users can specify which of these features are required by their job using the constraint option.  Only nodes having fea‐
              tures matching the job constraints will be used to satisfy the request.  Multiple constraints may be specified with AND, OR, matching OR, resource counts, etc. (some operators are not supported
              on all system types).  Supported constraint options include:

              Single Name
                     Only nodes which have the specified feature will be used.  For example, --constraint="intel"

              Node Count
                     A  request can specify the number of nodes needed with some feature by appending an asterisk and count after the feature name.  For example, --nodes=16 --constraint="graphics*4 ..."  in‐
                     dicates that the job requires 16 nodes and that at least four of those nodes must have the feature "graphics."

              AND    If only nodes with all of specified features will be used.  The ampersand is used for an AND operator.  For example, --constraint="intel&gpu"

              OR     If only nodes with at least one of specified features will be used.  The vertical bar is used for an OR operator.  For example, --constraint="intel|amd"

              Matching OR
                     If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated nodes, then use the  OR  operator  and  enclose  the  options  within  square  brackets.   For  example,  --con‐
                     straint="[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]" might be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated on a single rack of the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.

              Multiple Counts
                     Specific counts of multiple resources may be specified by using the AND operator and enclosing the options within square brackets.  For example, --constraint="[rack1*2&rack2*4]" might be
                     used to specify that two nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature of "rack1" and four nodes must be allocated from nodes with the feature "rack2".

                     NOTE:  This  construct  does  not  support  multiple  Intel  KNL  NUMA  or  MCDRAM  modes.  For  example,  while  --constraint="[(knl&quad)*2&(knl&hemi)*4]"  is  not  supported,   --con‐
                     straint="[haswell*2&(knl&hemi)*4]" is supported.  Specification of multiple KNL modes requires the use of a heterogeneous job.

              Brackets
                     Brackets   can   be   used   to   indicate   that  you  are  looking  for  a  set  of  nodes  with  the  different  requirements  contained  within  the  brackets.  For  example,  --con‐
                     straint="[(rack1|rack2)*1&(rack3)*2]" will get you one node with either the "rack1" or "rack2" features and two nodes with the "rack3" feature.  The same  request  without  the  brackets
                     will try to find a single node that meets those requirements.

              Parenthesis
                     Parenthesis  can be used to group like node features together. For example, --constraint="[(knl&snc4&flat)*4&haswell*1]" might be used to specify that four nodes with the features "knl",
                     "snc4" and "flat" plus one node with the feature "haswell" are required. All options within parenthesis should be grouped with AND (e.g. "&") operands.

       --contiguous
              If set, then the allocated nodes must form a contiguous set.

              NOTE: If SelectPlugin=cons_res this option won't be honored with the topology/tree or topology/3d_torus plugins, both of which can modify the node ordering.

       --cores-per-socket=<cores>
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of cores per socket.  See additional information under -B option above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.

       --cpu-freq =<p1[-p2[:p3]]>

              Request that job steps initiated by srun commands inside this allocation be run at some requested frequency if possible, on the CPUs selected for the step on the compute node(s).

              p1 can be  [#### | low | medium | high | highm1] which will set the frequency scaling_speed to the corresponding value, and set the frequency scaling_governor to UserSpace. See below for  defi‐
              nition of the values.

              p1  can  be  [Conservative  | OnDemand | Performance | PowerSave] which will set the scaling_governor to the corresponding value. The governor has to be in the list set by the slurm.conf option
              CpuFreqGovernors.

              When p2 is present, p1 will be the minimum scaling frequency and p2 will be the maximum scaling frequency.

              p2 can be  [#### | medium | high | highm1] p2 must be greater than p1.

              p3 can be [Conservative | OnDemand | Performance | PowerSave | UserSpace] which will set the governor to the corresponding value.

              If p3 is UserSpace, the frequency scaling_speed will be set by a power or energy aware scheduling strategy to a value between p1 and p2 that lets the job run within the site's power  goal.  The
              job may be delayed if p1 is higher than a frequency that allows the job to run within the goal.

              If the current frequency is < min, it will be set to min. Likewise, if the current frequency is > max, it will be set to max.

              Acceptable values at present include:

              ####          frequency in kilohertz

              Low           the lowest available frequency

              High          the highest available frequency

              HighM1        (high minus one) will select the next highest available frequency

              Medium        attempts to set a frequency in the middle of the available range

              Conservative  attempts to use the Conservative CPU governor

              OnDemand      attempts to use the OnDemand CPU governor (the default value)

              Performance   attempts to use the Performance CPU governor

              PowerSave     attempts to use the PowerSave CPU governor

              UserSpace     attempts to use the UserSpace CPU governor

              The following informational environment variable is set in the job
              step when --cpu-freq option is requested.
                      SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ

              This  environment  variable  can also be used to supply the value for the CPU frequency request if it is set when the 'srun' command is issued.  The --cpu-freq on the command line will override
              the environment variable value.  The form on the environment variable is the same as the command line.  See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section for a description of the  SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ  vari‐
              able.

              NOTE:  This  parameter  is treated as a request, not a requirement.  If the job step's node does not support setting the CPU frequency, or the requested value is outside the bounds of the legal
              frequencies, an error is logged, but the job step is allowed to continue.

              NOTE: Setting the frequency for just the CPUs of the job step implies that the tasks are confined to those CPUs.  If task confinement (i.e., TaskPlugin=task/affinity  or  TaskPlugin=task/cgroup
              with the "ConstrainCores" option) is not configured, this parameter is ignored.

              NOTE: When the step completes, the frequency and governor of each selected CPU is reset to the previous values.

              NOTE:  When  submitting jobs with  the --cpu-freq option with linuxproc as the ProctrackType can cause jobs to run too quickly before Accounting is able to poll for job information. As a result
              not all of accounting information will be present.

       --cpus-per-gpu=<ncpus>
              Advise Slurm that ensuing job steps will require ncpus processors per allocated GPU.  Not compatible with the --cpus-per-task option.

       -c, --cpus-per-task=<ncpus>
              Advise Slurm that ensuing job steps will require ncpus processors per task. By default Slurm will allocate one processor per task.

              For instance, consider an application that has 4 tasks, each requiring 3 processors.  If our cluster is comprised of quad-processors nodes and we simply ask for 12  processors,  the  controller
              might  give us only 3 nodes.  However, by using the --cpus-per-task=3 options, the controller knows that each task requires 3 processors on the same node, and the controller will grant an allo‐
              cation of 4 nodes, one for each of the 4 tasks.

       --deadline=<OPT>
              remove the job if no ending is possible before this deadline (start > (deadline - time[-min])).  Default is no deadline.  Valid time formats are:
              HH:MM[:SS] [AM|PM]
              MMDD[YY] or MM/DD[/YY] or MM.DD[.YY]
              MM/DD[/YY]-HH:MM[:SS]
              YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]]
              now[+count[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]]

       --delay-boot=<minutes>
              Do not reboot nodes in order to satisfied this job's feature specification if the job has been eligible to run for less than this time period.  If the job has waited for less than the specified
              period, it will use only nodes which already have the specified features.  The argument is in units of minutes.  A default value may be set by a system administrator using the delay_boot option
              of the SchedulerParameters configuration parameter in the slurm.conf file, otherwise the default value is zero (no delay).

       -d, --dependency=<dependency_list>
              Defer the  start  of  this  job  until  the  specified  dependencies  have  been  satisfied  completed.   <dependency_list>  is  of  the  form  <type:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]>  or
              <type:job_id[:job_id][?type:job_id[:job_id]]>.  All dependencies must be satisfied if the "," separator is used.  Any dependency may be satisfied if the "?" separator is used.  Only one separa‐
              tor may be used.  Many jobs can share the same dependency and these jobs may even belong to different  users. The  value may be changed after job submission using the scontrol command.   Depen‐
              dencies  on remote jobs are allowed in a federation.  Once a job dependency fails due to the termination state of a preceding job, the dependent job will never be run, even if the preceding job
              is requeued and has a different termination state in a subsequent execution.

              after:job_id[[+time][:jobid[+time]...]]
                     After the specified jobs start or are cancelled and 'time' in minutes from job start or cancellation happens, this job can begin execution. If no 'time' is given then there is  no  delay
                     after start or cancellation.

              afterany:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated.

              afterburstbuffer:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated and any associated burst buffer stage out operations have completed.

              aftercorr:job_id[:jobid...]
                     A task of this job array can begin execution after the corresponding task ID in the specified job has completed successfully (ran to completion with an exit code of zero).

              afternotok:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated in some failed state (non-zero exit code, node failure, timed out, etc).

              afterok:job_id[:jobid...]
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully executed (ran to completion with an exit code of zero).

              expand:job_id
                     Resources  allocated  to this job should be used to expand the specified job.  The job to expand must share the same QOS (Quality of Service) and partition.  Gang scheduling of resources
                     in the partition is also not supported.  "expand" is not allowed for jobs that didn't originate on the same cluster as the submitted job.

              singleton
                     This job can begin execution after any previously launched jobs sharing the same job name and user have terminated.  In other words, only one job by that name and owned by that user  can
                     be  running  or suspended at any point in time.  In a federation, a singleton dependency must be fulfilled on all clusters unless DependencyParameters=disable_remote_singleton is used in
                     slurm.conf.

       -D, --chdir=<path>
              Change directory to path before beginning execution. The path can be specified as full path or relative path to the directory where the command is executed.

       --exclusive[=user|mcs]
              The job allocation can not share nodes with other running jobs (or just other users with the "=user" option or with the "=mcs" option).  The default shared/exclusive behavior depends on  system
              configuration and the partition's OverSubscribe option takes precedence over the job's option.

       -F, --nodefile=<node file>
              Much  like  --nodelist,  but the list is contained in a file of name node file.  The node names of the list may also span multiple lines in the file.    Duplicate node names in the file will be
              ignored.  The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names will be sorted by Slurm.

       --get-user-env[=timeout][mode]
              This option will load login environment variables for the user specified in the --uid option.  The environment variables are retrieved by running something of this  sort  "su  -  <username>  -c
              /usr/bin/env"  and parsing the output.  Be aware that any environment variables already set in salloc's environment will take precedence over any environment variables in the user's login envi‐
              ronment.  The optional timeout value is in seconds. Default value is 3 seconds.  The optional mode value control the "su" options.  With a mode value of "S", "su" is executed  without  the  "-"
              option.  With a mode value of "L", "su" is executed with the "-" option, replicating the login environment.  If mode not specified, the mode established at Slurm build time is used.  Example of
              use include "--get-user-env", "--get-user-env=10" "--get-user-env=10L", and "--get-user-env=S".  NOTE: This option only works if the caller has an effective uid of "root".

       --gid=<group>
              Submit the job with the specified group's group access permissions.  group may be the group name or the numerical group ID.  In the default Slurm configuration, this option is only  valid  when
              used by the user root.

       -G, --gpus=[<type>:]<number>
              Specify  the  total  number of GPUs required for the job.  An optional GPU type specification can be supplied.  For example "--gpus=volta:3".  Multiple options can be requested in a comma sepa‐
              rated list, for example: "--gpus=volta:3,kepler:1".  See also the --gpus-per-node, --gpus-per-socket and --gpus-per-task options.

       --gpu-bind=[verbose,]<type>
              Bind tasks to specific GPUs.  By default every spawned task can access every GPU allocated to the step.  If "verbose," is specified before <type>, then print out GPU binding  debug  information
              to the stderr of the tasks. GPU binding is ignored if there is only one task.

              Supported type options:

              closest   Bind each task to the GPU(s) which are closest.  In a NUMA environment, each task may be bound to more than one GPU (i.e.  all GPUs in that NUMA environment).

              map_gpu:<list>
                        Bind  by  setting GPU masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is <gpu_id_for_task_0>,<gpu_id_for_task_1>,... GPU IDs are interpreted as decimal values unless they are pre‐
                        ceded with '0x' in which case they interpreted as hexadecimal values. If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number of elements in this list,  elements  in  the  list  will  be
                        reused  as  needed  starting  from the beginning of the list. To simplify support for large task counts, the lists may follow a map with an asterisk and repetition count.  For example
                        "map_gpu:0*4,1*4".  If the task/cgroup plugin is used and ConstrainDevices is set in cgroup.conf, then the GPU IDs are zero-based indexes relative to the GPUs  allocated  to  the  job
                        (e.g. the first GPU is 0, even if the global ID is 3). Otherwise, the GPU IDs are global IDs, and all GPUs on each node in the job should be allocated for predictable binding results.

              mask_gpu:<list>
                        Bind by setting GPU masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is <gpu_mask_for_task_0>,<gpu_mask_for_task_1>,... The mapping is specified for a node and identical mapping is
                        applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each node is mapped to the first mask specified in the list, etc.). GPU masks are always interpreted as hexadecimal val‐
                        ues  but  can  be  preceded  with  an  optional  '0x'.  To  simplify  support  for  large  task  counts, the lists may follow a map with an asterisk and repetition count.  For example
                        "mask_gpu:0x0f*4,0xf0*4".  If the task/cgroup plugin is used and ConstrainDevices is set in cgroup.conf, then the GPU IDs are zero-based indexes relative to the GPUs allocated to  the
                        job  (e.g. the first GPU is 0, even if the global ID is 3). Otherwise, the GPU IDs are global IDs, and all GPUs on each node in the job should be allocated for predictable binding re‐
                        sults.

              single:<tasks_per_gpu>
                        Like --gpu-bind=closest, except that each task can only be bound to a single GPU, even when it can be bound to multiple GPUs that are equally close.  The GPU to bind to is  determined
                        by  <tasks_per_gpu>,  where the first <tasks_per_gpu> tasks are bound to the first GPU available, the second <tasks_per_gpu> tasks are bound to the second GPU available, etc.  This is
                        basically a block distribution of tasks onto available GPUs, where the available GPUs are determined by the socket affinity of the task and the socket affinity of the GPUs  as  speci‐
                        fied in gres.conf's Cores parameter.

       --gpu-freq=[<type]=value>[,<type=value>][,verbose]
              Request  that  GPUs allocated to the job are configured with specific frequency values.  This option can be used to independently configure the GPU and its memory frequencies.  After the job is
              completed, the frequencies of all affected GPUs will be reset to the highest possible values.  In some cases, system power caps may override the requested values.  The field type can  be  "mem‐
              ory".   If type is not specified, the GPU frequency is implied.  The value field can either be "low", "medium", "high", "highm1" or a numeric value in megahertz (MHz).  If the specified numeric
              value is not possible, a value as close as possible will be used. See below for definition of the values.  The verbose option causes current GPU frequency information to be logged.  Examples of
              use include "--gpu-freq=medium,memory=high" and "--gpu-freq=450".

              Supported value definitions:

              low       the lowest available frequency.

              medium    attempts to set a frequency in the middle of the available range.

              high      the highest available frequency.

              highm1    (high minus one) will select the next highest available frequency.

       --gpus-per-node=[<type>:]<number>
              Specify  the  number  of  GPUs  required  for  the  job  on  each  node  included  in  the  job's  resource  allocation.   An  optional  GPU  type  specification  can  be supplied.  For example
              "--gpus-per-node=volta:3".  Multiple options can be requested in a  comma  separated  list,  for  example:  "--gpus-per-node=volta:3,kepler:1".   See  also  the  --gpus,  --gpus-per-socket  and
              --gpus-per-task options.

       --gpus-per-socket=[<type>:]<number>
              Specify  the  number  of  GPUs  required  for  the  job  on  each  socket  included  in  the  job's  resource  allocation.   An  optional  GPU  type  specification can be supplied.  For example
              "--gpus-per-socket=volta:3".  Multiple options can be requested in a comma separated list, for example: "--gpus-per-socket=volta:3,kepler:1".  Requires job to specify a sockets per node count (
              --sockets-per-node).  See also the --gpus, --gpus-per-node and --gpus-per-task options.

       --gpus-per-task=[<type>:]<number>
              Specify  the  number  of  GPUs  required  for  the  job  on  each  task  to  be  spawned  in  the  job's  resource  allocation.  An optional GPU type specification can be supplied.  For example
              "--gpus-per-task=volta:1". Multiple options can be requested  in  a  comma  separated  list,  for  example:  "--gpus-per-task=volta:3,kepler:1".  See  also  the  --gpus,  --gpus-per-socket  and
              --gpus-per-node options.  This option requires an explicit task count, e.g. -n, --ntasks or "--gpus=X --gpus-per-task=Y" rather than an ambiguous range of nodes with -N, --nodes.
              NOTE: This option will not have any impact on GPU binding, specifically it won't limit the number of devices set for CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.

       --gres=<list>
              Specifies a comma delimited list of generic consumable resources.  The format of each entry on the list is "name[[:type]:count]".  The name is that of the consumable resource.  The count is the
              number of those resources with a default value of 1.  The count can have a suffix of "k" or "K" (multiple of 1024), "m" or "M" (multiple of 1024 x 1024), "g" or "G" (multiple of 1024 x  1024  x
              1024),  "t"  or  "T" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024), "p" or "P" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024).  The specified resources will be allocated to the job on each node.  The
              available generic consumable resources is configurable by the system administrator.  A list of available generic consumable resources will be printed and the command will exit if the option ar‐
              gument is "help".  Examples of use include "--gres=gpu:2,mic:1", "--gres=gpu:kepler:2", and "--gres=help".

       --gres-flags=<type>
              Specify generic resource task binding options.

              disable-binding
                     Disable  filtering  of CPUs with respect to generic resource locality.  This option is currently required to use more CPUs than are bound to a GRES (i.e. if a GPU is bound to the CPUs on
                     one socket, but resources on more than one socket are required to run the job).  This option may permit a job to be allocated resources sooner than otherwise possible, but may result  in
                     lower job performance.
                     NOTE: This option is specific to SelectType=cons_res.

              enforce-binding
                     The  only CPUs available to the job will be those bound to the selected GRES (i.e. the CPUs identified in the gres.conf file will be strictly enforced). This option may result in delayed
                     initiation of a job.  For example a job requiring two GPUs and one CPU will be delayed until both GPUs on a single socket are available rather than using GPUs bound to separate  sockets,
                     however,  the  application  performance  may be improved due to improved communication speed.  Requires the node to be configured with more than one socket and resource filtering will be
                     performed on a per-socket basis.
                     NOTE: This option is specific to SelectType=cons_tres.

       -H, --hold
              Specify the job is to be submitted in a held state (priority of zero).  A held job can now be released using scontrol to reset its priority (e.g. "scontrol release <job_id>").

       -h, --help
              Display help information and exit.

       --hint=<type>
              Bind tasks according to application hints.
              NOTE: This option cannot be used in conjunction with --ntasks-per-core, --threads-per-core or -B. If --hint is specified as a command line argument, it will take precedence  over  the  environ‐
              ment.

              compute_bound
                     Select settings for compute bound applications: use all cores in each socket, one thread per core.

              memory_bound
                     Select settings for memory bound applications: use only one core in each socket, one thread per core.

              [no]multithread
                     [don't] use extra threads with in-core multi-threading which can benefit communication intensive applications.  Only supported with the task/affinity plugin.

              help   show this help message

       -I, --immediate[=<seconds>]
              exit  if  resources  are not available within the time period specified.  If no argument is given (seconds defaults to 1), resources must be available immediately for the request to succeed. If
              defer is configured in SchedulerParameters and seconds=1 the allocation request will fail immediately; defer conflicts and takes precedence over this option.  By default,  --immediate  is  off,
              and  the  command  will block until resources become available. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper parsing the single letter option must be followed immediately with the value
              and not include a space between them. For example "-I60" and not "-I 60".

       -J, --job-name=<jobname>
              Specify a name for the job allocation. The specified name will appear along with the job id number when querying running jobs on the system.  The default job name is the name of  the  "command"
              specified on the command line.

       -K, --kill-command[=signal]
              salloc always runs a user-specified command once the allocation is granted.  salloc will wait indefinitely for that command to exit.  If you specify the --kill-command option salloc will send a
              signal to your command any time that the Slurm controller tells salloc that its job allocation has been revoked. The job allocation can be revoked for a couple of reasons: someone used  scancel
              to  revoke the allocation, or the allocation reached its time limit.  If you do not specify a signal name or number and Slurm is configured to signal the spawned command at job termination, the
              default signal is SIGHUP for interactive and SIGTERM for non-interactive sessions. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper parsing the single letter option must be followed immedi‐
              ately with the value and not include a space between them. For example "-K1" and not "-K 1".

       -k, --no-kill [=off]
              Do  not  automatically  terminate a job if one of the nodes it has been allocated fails.  The user will assume the responsibilities for fault-tolerance should a node fail.  When there is a node
              failure, any active job steps (usually MPI jobs) on that node will almost certainly suffer a fatal error, but with --no-kill, the job allocation will not be revoked so the user may  launch  new
              job steps on the remaining nodes in their allocation.

              Specify an optional argument of "off" disable the effect of the SALLOC_NO_KILL environment variable.

              By default Slurm terminates the entire job allocation if any node fails in its range of allocated nodes.

       -L, --licenses=<license>
              Specification  of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) which must be allocated to this job.  License names can be followed by a colon and count (the default count
              is one).  Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g.  "--licenses=foo:4,bar").

       -M, --clusters=<string>
              Clusters to issue commands to.  Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.  The job will be submitted to the one cluster providing the earliest expected job  initiation  time.  The  default
              value is the current cluster. A value of 'all' will query to run on all clusters.  Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.

       -m, --distribution=
              arbitrary|<block|cyclic|plane=<options>[:block|cyclic|fcyclic]>

              Specify alternate distribution methods for remote processes.  In salloc, this only sets environment variables that will be used by subsequent srun requests.  This option controls the assignment
              of tasks to the nodes on which resources have been allocated, and the distribution of those resources to tasks for binding (task affinity). The first distribution method (before the  ":")  con‐
              trols  the  distribution  of resources across nodes. The optional second distribution method (after the ":") controls the distribution of resources across sockets within a node.  Note that with
              select/cons_res, the number of cpus allocated on each socket and node may be different. Refer to https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html for more information on resource  allocation,  assign‐
              ment of tasks to nodes, and binding of tasks to CPUs.

              First distribution method:

              block  The block distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such that consecutive tasks share a node. For example, consider an allocation of three nodes each with two cpus. A four-task
                     block distribution request will distribute those tasks to the nodes with tasks one and two on the first node, task three on the second node, and task four on the third node.  Block  dis‐
                     tribution is the default behavior if the number of tasks exceeds the number of allocated nodes.

              cyclic The cyclic distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such that consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive nodes (in a round-robin fashion). For example, consider an al‐
                     location of three nodes each with two cpus. A four-task cyclic distribution request will distribute those tasks to the nodes with tasks one and four on the first node, task  two  on  the
                     second  node,  and  task  three  on  the  third  node.  Note that when SelectType is select/cons_res, the same number of CPUs may not be allocated on each node. Task distribution will be
                     round-robin among all the nodes with CPUs yet to be assigned to tasks.  Cyclic distribution is the default behavior if the number of tasks is no  larger  than  the  number  of  allocated
                     nodes.

              plane  The tasks are distributed in blocks of a specified size. The number of tasks distributed to each node is the same as for cyclic distribution, but the taskids assigned to each node depend
                     on the plane size. Additional distribution specifications cannot be combined with this option.  For more details (including examples and diagrams), please see
                     https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html
                     and
                     https://slurm.schedmd.com/dist_plane.html

              arbitrary
                     The arbitrary method of distribution will allocate processes in-order as listed in file designated by the environment variable SLURM_HOSTFILE.  If this variable is listed  it  will  over
                     ride  any  other  method  specified.  If not set the method will default to block.  Inside the hostfile must contain at minimum the number of hosts requested and be one per line or comma
                     separated.  If specifying a task count (-n, --ntasks=<number>), your tasks will be laid out on the nodes in the order of the file.
                     NOTE: The arbitrary distribution option on a job allocation only controls the nodes to be allocated to the job and not the allocation of CPUs on those nodes. This option is meant primar‐
                     ily to control a job step's task layout in an existing job allocation for the srun command.

              Second distribution method:

              block  The block distribution method will distribute tasks to sockets such that consecutive tasks share a socket.

              cyclic The  cyclic  distribution  method  will distribute tasks to sockets such that consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive sockets (in a round-robin fashion).  Tasks requiring more
                     than one CPU will have all of those CPUs allocated on a single socket if possible.

              fcyclic
                     The fcyclic distribution method will distribute tasks to sockets such that consecutive tasks are distributed over consecutive sockets (in a round-robin fashion).   Tasks  requiring  more
                     than one CPU will have each CPUs allocated in a cyclic fashion across sockets.

       --mail-type=<type>
              Notify  user  by  email when certain event types occur.  Valid type values are NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, REQUEUE, ALL (equivalent to BEGIN, END, FAIL, INVALID_DEPEND, REQUEUE, and STAGE_OUT), IN‐
              VALID_DEPEND (dependency never satisfied), STAGE_OUT (burst buffer stage out and teardown completed), TIME_LIMIT, TIME_LIMIT_90 (reached 90 percent of time  limit),  TIME_LIMIT_80  (reached  80
              percent  of  time  limit),  and  TIME_LIMIT_50  (reached  50 percent of time limit).  Multiple type values may be specified in a comma separated list.  The user to be notified is indicated with
              --mail-user.

       --mail-user=<user>
              User to receive email notification of state changes as defined by --mail-type.  The default value is the submitting user.

       --mcs-label=<mcs>
              Used only when the mcs/group plugin is enabled.  This parameter is a group among the groups of the user.  Default value is calculated by the Plugin mcs if it's enabled.

       --mem=<size[units]>
              Specify the real memory required per node.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].  Default value is DefMemPerNode and the maximum  value  is
              MaxMemPerNode. If configured, both of parameters can be seen using the scontrol show config command.  This parameter would generally be used if whole nodes are allocated to jobs (SelectType=se‐
              lect/linear).  Also see --mem-per-cpu and --mem-per-gpu.  The --mem, --mem-per-cpu and --mem-per-gpu options are mutually exclusive. If --mem, --mem-per-cpu or --mem-per-gpu  are  specified  as
              command line arguments, then they will take precedence over the environment.

              NOTE:  A  memory  size specification of zero is treated as a special case and grants the job access to all of the memory on each node.  If the job is allocated multiple nodes in a heterogeneous
              cluster, the memory limit on each node will be that of the node in the allocation with the smallest memory size (same limit will apply to every node in the job's allocation).

              NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently relies upon the task/cgroup plugin or enabling of accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic basis (data  need  not  be  stored,  just  col‐
              lected). In both cases memory use is based upon the job's Resident Set Size (RSS). A task may exceed the memory limit until the next periodic accounting sample.

       --mem-per-cpu=<size[units]>
              Minimum  memory  required per allocated CPU.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].  The default value is DefMemPerCPU and the maximum value
              is MaxMemPerCPU (see exception below). If configured, both parameters can be seen using the scontrol show config command.  Note that if the job's  --mem-per-cpu  value  exceeds  the  configured
              MaxMemPerCPU,  then  the user's limit will be treated as a memory limit per task; --mem-per-cpu will be reduced to a value no larger than MaxMemPerCPU; --cpus-per-task will be set and the value
              of --cpus-per-task multiplied by the new --mem-per-cpu value will equal the original --mem-per-cpu value specified by the user.  This parameter would generally be used if individual  processors
              are allocated to jobs (SelectType=select/cons_res).  If resources are allocated by core, socket, or whole nodes, then the number of CPUs allocated to a job may be higher than the task count and
              the value of --mem-per-cpu should be adjusted accordingly.  Also see --mem and --mem-per-gpu.  The --mem, --mem-per-cpu and --mem-per-gpu options are mutually exclusive.

              NOTE: If the final amount of memory requested by a job can't be satisfied by any of the nodes configured in the partition, the job will be rejected.  This could happen if --mem-per-cpu is  used
              with the --exclusive option for a job allocation and --mem-per-cpu times the number of CPUs on a node is greater than the total memory of that node.

       --mem-per-gpu=<size[units]>
              Minimum  memory required per allocated GPU.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].  Default value is DefMemPerGPU and is available on both a
              global and per partition basis.  If configured, the parameters can be seen using the scontrol show config and scontrol show partition commands.  Also see --mem.  The  --mem,  --mem-per-cpu  and
              --mem-per-gpu options are mutually exclusive.

       --mem-bind=[{quiet,verbose},]type
              Bind  tasks to memory. Used only when the task/affinity plugin is enabled and the NUMA memory functions are available.  Note that the resolution of CPU and memory binding may differ on some ar‐
              chitectures. For example, CPU binding may be performed at the level of the cores within a processor while memory binding will be performed at the level of nodes, where the definition of "nodes"
              may  differ  from system to system.  By default no memory binding is performed; any task using any CPU can use any memory. This option is typically used to ensure that each task is bound to the
              memory closest to its assigned CPU. The use of any type other than "none" or "local" is not recommended.

              NOTE: To have Slurm always report on the selected memory binding for all commands executed in a shell, you can enable verbose mode by setting the SLURM_MEM_BIND environment  variable  value  to
              "verbose".

              The following informational environment variables are set when --mem-bind is in use:

                   SLURM_MEM_BIND_LIST
                   SLURM_MEM_BIND_PREFER
                   SLURM_MEM_BIND_SORT
                   SLURM_MEM_BIND_TYPE
                   SLURM_MEM_BIND_VERBOSE

              See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section for a more detailed description of the individual SLURM_MEM_BIND* variables.

              Supported options include:

              help   show this help message

              local  Use memory local to the processor in use

              map_mem:<list>
                     Bind  by setting memory masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is <numa_id_for_task_0>,<numa_id_for_task_1>,...  The mapping is specified for a node and identical mapping is
                     applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each node is mapped to the first ID specified in the list, etc.).  NUMA IDs are interpreted as decimal values  unless  they
                     are  preceded with '0x' in which case they interpreted as hexadecimal values.  If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number of elements in this list, elements in the list will be
                     reused as needed starting from the beginning of the list.  To simplify support for large task counts, the lists may follow a map with an  asterisk  and  repetition  count.   For  example
                     "map_mem:0x0f*4,0xf0*4".  For predictable binding results, all CPUs for each node in the job should be allocated to the job.

              mask_mem:<list>
                     Bind by setting memory masks on tasks (or ranks) as specified where <list> is <numa_mask_for_task_0>,<numa_mask_for_task_1>,...  The mapping is specified for a node and identical mapping
                     is applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each node is mapped to the first mask specified in the list, etc.).  NUMA masks are always  interpreted  as  hexadecimal
                     values.   Note  that masks must be preceded with a '0x' if they don't begin with [0-9] so they are seen as numerical values.  If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number of ele‐
                     ments in this list, elements in the list will be reused as needed starting from the beginning of the list.  To simplify support for large task counts, the lists may follow a mask with an
                     asterisk and repetition count.  For example "mask_mem:0*4,1*4".  For predictable binding results, all CPUs for each node in the job should be allocated to the job.

              no[ne] don't bind tasks to memory (default)

              p[refer]
                     Prefer use of first specified NUMA node, but permit
                      use of other available NUMA nodes.

              q[uiet]
                     quietly bind before task runs (default)

              rank   bind by task rank (not recommended)

              sort   sort free cache pages (run zonesort on Intel KNL nodes)

              v[erbose]
                     verbosely report binding before task runs

       --mincpus=<n>
              Specify a minimum number of logical cpus/processors per node.

       -N, --nodes=<minnodes[-maxnodes]>
              Request  that a minimum of minnodes nodes be allocated to this job.  A maximum node count may also be specified with maxnodes.  If only one number is specified, this is used as both the minimum
              and maximum node count.  The partition's node limits supersede those of the job.  If a job's node limits are outside of the range permitted for its associated partition, the job will be left in
              a  PENDING  state.   This  permits possible execution at a later time, when the partition limit is changed.  If a job node limit exceeds the number of nodes configured in the partition, the job
              will be rejected.  Note that the environment variable SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES will be set to the count of nodes actually allocated to the job. See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  section for more infor‐
              mation.   If  -N  is  not  specified, the default behavior is to allocate enough nodes to satisfy the requirements of the -n and -c options.  The job will be allocated as many nodes as possible
              within the range specified and without delaying the initiation of the job.  The node count specification may include a numeric value followed by a suffix of "k"  (multiplies  numeric  value  by
              1,024) or "m" (multiplies numeric value by 1,048,576).

       -n, --ntasks=<number>
              salloc  does not launch tasks, it requests an allocation of resources and executed some command. This option advises the Slurm controller that job steps run within this allocation will launch a
              maximum of number tasks and sufficient resources are allocated to accomplish this.  The default is one task per node, but note that the --cpus-per-task option will change this default.

       --network=<type>
              Specify information pertaining to the switch or network.  The interpretation of type is system dependent.  This option is supported when running Slurm on a Cray natively.  It is used to request
              using Network Performance Counters.  Only one value per request is valid.  All options are case in-sensitive.  In this configuration supported values include:

              system
                    Use  the  system-wide network performance counters. Only nodes requested will be marked in use for the job allocation.  If the job does not fill up the entire system the rest of the nodes
                    are not able to be used by other jobs using NPC, if idle their state will appear as PerfCnts.  These nodes are still available for other jobs not using NPC.

              blade Use the blade network performance counters. Only nodes requested will be marked in use for the job allocation.  If the job does not fill up the entire blade(s) allocated to the job  those
                    blade(s) are not able to be used by other jobs using NPC, if idle their state will appear as PerfCnts.  These nodes are still available for other jobs not using NPC.

              In all cases the job allocation request must specify the
              --exclusive option.  Otherwise the request will be denied.

              Also  with  any  of these options steps are not allowed to share blades, so resources would remain idle inside an allocation if the step running on a blade does not take up all the nodes on the
              blade.

              The network option is also supported on systems with IBM's Parallel Environment (PE).  See IBM's LoadLeveler job command keyword documentation about the keyword "network" for more  information.
              Multiple values may be specified in a comma separated list.  All options are case in-sensitive.  Supported values include:

              BULK_XFER[=<resources>]
                          Enable bulk transfer of data using Remote Direct-Memory Access (RDMA).  The optional resources specification is a numeric value which can have a suffix of "k", "K", "m", "M", "g" or
                          "G" for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes.  NOTE: The resources specification is not supported by the underlying IBM infrastructure as of Parallel Environment  version  2.2  and  no
                          value should be specified at this time.

              CAU=<count> Number of Collectve Acceleration Units (CAU) required.  Applies only to IBM Power7-IH processors.  Default value is zero.  Independent CAU will be allocated for each programming in‐
                          terface (MPI, LAPI, etc.)

              DEVNAME=<name>
                          Specify the device name to use for communications (e.g. "eth0" or "mlx4_0").

              DEVTYPE=<type>
                          Specify the device type to use for communications.  The supported values of type are: "IB" (InfiniBand), "HFI" (P7 Host Fabric Interface), "IPONLY" (IP-Only interfaces), "HPCE" (HPC
                          Ethernet),  and "KMUX" (Kernel Emulation of HPCE).  The devices allocated to a job must all be of the same type.  The default value depends upon depends upon what hardware is avail‐
                          able and in order of preferences is IPONLY (which is not considered in User Space mode), HFI, IB, HPCE, and KMUX.

              IMMED =<count>
                          Number of immediate send slots per window required.  Applies only to IBM Power7-IH processors.  Default value is zero.

              INSTANCES =<count>
                          Specify number of network connections for each task on each network connection.  The default instance count is 1.

              IPV4        Use Internet Protocol (IP) version 4 communications (default).

              IPV6        Use Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 communications.

              LAPI        Use the LAPI programming interface.

              MPI         Use the MPI programming interface.  MPI is the default interface.

              PAMI        Use the PAMI programming interface.

              SHMEM       Use the OpenSHMEM programming interface.

              SN_ALL      Use all available switch networks (default).

              SN_SINGLE   Use one available switch network.

              UPC         Use the UPC programming interface.

              US          Use User Space communications.

              Some examples of network specifications:

              Instances=2,US,MPI,SN_ALL
                          Create two user space connections for MPI communications on every switch network for each task.

              US,MPI,Instances=3,Devtype=IB
                          Create three user space connections for MPI communications on every InfiniBand network for each task.

              IPV4,LAPI,SN_Single
                          Create a IP version 4 connection for LAPI communications on one switch network for each task.

              Instances=2,US,LAPI,MPI
                          Create two user space connections each for LAPI and MPI communications on every switch network for each task. Note that SN_ALL is the default option so every switch network is used.
                          Also  note that Instances=2 specifies that two connections are established for each protocol (LAPI and MPI) and each task.  If there are two networks and four tasks on the node then
                          a total of 32 connections are established (2 instances x 2 protocols x 2 networks x 4 tasks).

       --nice[=adjustment]
              Run the job with an adjusted scheduling priority within Slurm. With no adjustment value the scheduling priority is decreased by 100. A negative nice value increases the priority, otherwise  de‐
              creases it. The adjustment range is +/- 2147483645. Only privileged users can specify a negative adjustment.

       --ntasks-per-core=<ntasks>
              Request the maximum ntasks be invoked on each core.  Meant to be used with the --ntasks option.  Related to --ntasks-per-node except at the core level instead of the node level.  NOTE: This op‐
              tion is not supported when using SelectType=select/linear.

       --ntasks-per-gpu=<ntasks>
              Request that there are ntasks tasks invoked for every GPU.  This option can work in two ways: 1) either specify --ntasks in addition, in which case a type-less GPU specification will  be  auto‐
              matically  determined  to  satisfy --ntasks-per-gpu, or 2) specify the GPUs wanted (e.g. via --gpus or --gres) without specifying --ntasks, and the total task count will be automatically deter‐
              mined.  The number of CPUs needed will be automatically increased if necessary to allow for any calculated task count.  This option will implicitly set --gpu-bind=single:<ntasks>, but that  can
              be  overridden  with  an  explicit  --gpu-bind specification.  This option is not compatible with a node range (i.e. -N<minnodes-maxnodes>).  This option is not compatible with --gpus-per-task,
              --gpus-per-socket, or --ntasks-per-node.  This option is not supported unless SelectType=cons_tres is configured (either directly or indirectly on Cray systems).

       --ntasks-per-node=<ntasks>
              Request that ntasks be invoked on each node.  If used with the --ntasks option, the --ntasks option will take precedence and the --ntasks-per-node will be treated as a maximum  count  of  tasks
              per  node.   Meant to be used with the --nodes option.  This is related to --cpus-per-task=ncpus, but does not require knowledge of the actual number of cpus on each node.  In some cases, it is
              more convenient to be able to request that no more than a specific number of tasks be invoked on each node.  Examples of this include submitting a hybrid  MPI/OpenMP  app  where  only  one  MPI
              "task/rank"  should be assigned to each node while allowing the OpenMP portion to utilize all of the parallelism present in the node, or submitting a single setup/cleanup/monitoring job to each
              node of a pre-existing allocation as one step in a larger job script.

       --ntasks-per-socket=<ntasks>
              Request the maximum ntasks be invoked on each socket.  Meant to be used with the --ntasks option.  Related to --ntasks-per-node except at the socket level instead of the node level.  NOTE: This
              option is not supported when using SelectType=select/linear.

       --no-bell
              Silence salloc's use of the terminal bell. Also see the option --bell.

       --no-shell
              immediately exit after allocating resources, without running a command. However, the Slurm job will still be created and will remain active and will own the allocated resources as long as it is
              active.  You will have a Slurm job id with no associated processes or tasks. You can submit srun commands against this resource allocation, if you specify the --jobid= option with the job id of
              this  Slurm  job.   Or, this can be used to temporarily reserve a set of resources so that other jobs cannot use them for some period of time.  (Note that the Slurm job is subject to the normal
              constraints on jobs, including time limits, so that eventually the job will terminate and the resources will be freed, or you can terminate the job manually using the scancel command.)

       -O, --overcommit
              Overcommit resources.  When applied to job allocation, only one CPU is allocated to the job per node and options used to specify the number of tasks per node, socket, core, etc.   are  ignored.
              When  applied  to job step allocations (the srun command when executed within an existing job allocation), this option can be used to launch more than one task per CPU.  Normally, srun will not
              allocate more than one process per CPU.  By specifying --overcommit you are explicitly allowing more than one process per CPU. However no more than MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE tasks are permitted to ex‐
              ecute per node.  NOTE: MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE is defined in the file slurm.h and is not a variable, it is set at Slurm build time.

       -p, --partition=<partition_names>
              Request  a  specific  partition for the resource allocation.  If not specified, the default behavior is to allow the slurm controller to select the default partition as designated by the system
              administrator. If the job can use more than one partition, specify their names in a comma separate list and the one offering earliest initiation will be used with no regard given to the  parti‐
              tion  name  ordering  (although higher priority partitions will be considered first).  When the job is initiated, the name of the partition used will be placed first in the job record partition
              string.

       --power=<flags>
              Comma separated list of power management plugin options.  Currently available flags include: level (all nodes allocated to the job should have identical power caps, may be disabled by the Slurm
              configuration option PowerParameters=job_no_level).

       --priority=<value>
              Request  a specific job priority.  May be subject to configuration specific constraints.  value should either be a numeric value or "TOP" (for highest possible value).  Only Slurm operators and
              administrators can set the priority of a job.

       --profile=<all|none|[energy[,|task[,|lustre[,|network]]]]>
              enables detailed data collection by the acct_gather_profile plugin.  Detailed data are typically time-series that are stored in an HDF5 file for the job or an InfluxDB database depending on the
              configured plugin.

              All       All data types are collected. (Cannot be combined with other values.)

              None      No data types are collected. This is the default.
                         (Cannot be combined with other values.)

              Energy    Energy data is collected.

              Task      Task (I/O, Memory, ...) data is collected.

              Lustre    Lustre data is collected.

              Network   Network (InfiniBand) data is collected.

       -q, --qos=<qos>
              Request  a  quality of service for the job.  QOS values can be defined for each user/cluster/account association in the Slurm database.  Users will be limited to their association's defined set
              of qos's when the Slurm configuration parameter, AccountingStorageEnforce, includes "qos" in its definition.

       -Q, --quiet
              Suppress informational messages from salloc. Errors will still be displayed.

       --reboot
              Force the allocated nodes to reboot before starting the job.  This is only supported with some system configurations and will otherwise be silently ignored. Only root, SlurmUser or  admins  can
              reboot nodes.

       --reservation=<reservation_names>
              Allocate  resources  for the job from the named reservation. If the job can use more than one reservation, specify their names in a comma separate list and the one offering earliest initiation.
              Each reservation will be considered in the order it was requested.  All reservations will be listed in scontrol/squeue through the life of the job.  In accounting the first reservation will  be
              seen and after the job starts the reservation used will replace it.

       -s, --oversubscribe
              The  job  allocation  can  over-subscribe resources with other running jobs.  The resources to be over-subscribed can be nodes, sockets, cores, and/or hyperthreads depending upon configuration.
              The default over-subscribe behavior depends on system configuration and the partition's OverSubscribe option takes precedence over the job's option.  This option may result  in  the  allocation
              being  granted  sooner than if the --oversubscribe option was not set and allow higher system utilization, but application performance will likely suffer due to competition for resources.  Also
              see the --exclusive option.

       -S, --core-spec=<num>
              Count of specialized cores per node reserved by the job for system operations and not used by the application. The application will not use these cores, but will be charged  for  their  alloca‐
              tion.   Default  value  is dependent upon the node's configured CoreSpecCount value.  If a value of zero is designated and the Slurm configuration option AllowSpecResourcesUsage is enabled, the
              job will be allowed to override CoreSpecCount and use the specialized resources on nodes it is allocated.  This option can not be used with the --thread-spec option.

       --signal=[R:]<sig_num>[@<sig_time>]
              When a job is within sig_time seconds of its end time, send it the signal sig_num.  Due to the resolution of event handling by Slurm, the signal may be sent up to 60 seconds earlier than speci‐
              fied.   sig_num  may either be a signal number or name (e.g. "10" or "USR1").  sig_time must have an integer value between 0 and 65535.  By default, no signal is sent before the job's end time.
              If a sig_num is specified without any sig_time, the default time will be 60 seconds.  Use the "R:" option to allow this job to overlap with a reservation with MaxStartDelay set.   To  have  the
              signal sent at preemption time see the preempt_send_user_signal SlurmctldParameter.

       --sockets-per-node=<sockets>
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of sockets.  See additional information under -B option above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.

       --spread-job
              Spread the job allocation over as many nodes as possible and attempt to evenly distribute tasks across the allocated nodes.  This option disables the topology/tree plugin.

       --switches=<count>[@<max-time>]
              When  a  tree  topology is used, this defines the maximum count of switches desired for the job allocation and optionally the maximum time to wait for that number of switches. If Slurm finds an
              allocation containing more switches than the count specified, the job remains pending until it either finds an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit expires.  It  there  is  no
              switch  count  limit,  there  is  no  delay  in  starting the job.  Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds", "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and
              "days-hours:minutes:seconds".  The job's maximum time delay may be limited by the system administrator using the SchedulerParameters configuration parameter with the  max_switch_wait  parameter
              option.   On  a  dragonfly  network  the only switch count supported is 1 since communication performance will be highest when a job is allocate resources on one leaf switch or more than 2 leaf
              switches.  The default max-time is the max_switch_wait SchedulerParameters.

       -t, --time=<time>
              Set a limit on the total run time of the job allocation.  If the requested time limit exceeds the partition's time limit, the job will be left in a PENDING state (possibly  indefinitely).   The
              default time limit is the partition's default time limit.  When the time limit is reached, each task in each job step is sent SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL.  The interval between signals is spec‐
              ified by the Slurm configuration parameter KillWait.  The OverTimeLimit configuration parameter may permit the job to run longer than scheduled.  Time resolution is one minute and second values
              are rounded up to the next minute.

              A  time  limit  of  zero  requests  that no time limit be imposed.  Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds", "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and
              "days-hours:minutes:seconds".

       --thread-spec=<num>
              Count of specialized threads per node reserved by the job for system operations and not used by the application. The application will not use these threads, but will be charged for their  allo‐
              cation.  This option can not be used with the --core-spec option.

       --threads-per-core=<threads>
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of threads per core. In task layout, use the specified maximum number of threads per core. NOTE: "Threads" refers to the num‐
              ber of processing units on each core rather than the number of application tasks to be launched per core.  See additional information under -B option above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.

       --time-min=<time>
              Set a minimum time limit on the job allocation.  If specified, the job may have its --time limit lowered to a value no lower than --time-min if doing so permits the job to begin execution  ear‐
              lier  than otherwise possible.  The job's time limit will not be changed after the job is allocated resources.  This is performed by a backfill scheduling algorithm to allocate resources other‐
              wise reserved for higher priority jobs.  Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds", "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes"  and  "days-hours:minutes:sec‐
              onds".

       --tmp=<size[units]>
              Specify a minimum amount of temporary disk space per node.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].

       --usage
              Display brief help message and exit.

       --uid=<user>
              Attempt  to  submit  and/or  run a job as user instead of the invoking user id. The invoking user's credentials will be used to check access permissions for the target partition. This option is
              only valid for user root. This option may be used by user root may use this option to run jobs as a normal user in a RootOnly partition for example. If run as root, salloc will drop its permis‐
              sions to the uid specified after node allocation is successful. user may be the user name or numerical user ID.

       --use-min-nodes
              If a range of node counts is given, prefer the smaller count.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the verbosity of salloc's informational messages.  Multiple -v's will further increase salloc's verbosity.  By default only errors will be displayed.

       -w, --nodelist=<node name list>
              Request  a specific list of hosts.  The job will contain all of these hosts and possibly additional hosts as needed to satisfy resource requirements.  The list may be specified as a comma-sepa‐
              rated list of hosts, a range of hosts (host[1-5,7,...] for example), or a filename.  The host list will be assumed to be a filename if it contains a "/" character.  If  you  specify  a  minimum
              node  or  processor  count larger than can be satisfied by the supplied host list, additional resources will be allocated on other nodes as needed.  Duplicate node names in the list will be ig‐
              nored.  The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names will be sorted by Slurm.

       --wait-all-nodes=<value>
              Controls when the execution of the command begins with respect to when nodes are ready for use (i.e. booted).  By default, the salloc command will return as soon  as  the  allocation  is  made.
              This default can be altered using the salloc_wait_nodes option to the SchedulerParameters parameter in the slurm.conf file.

              0    Begin execution as soon as allocation can be made.  Do not wait for all nodes to be ready for use (i.e. booted).

              1    Do not begin execution until all nodes are ready for use.

       --wckey=<wckey>
              Specify wckey to be used with job.  If TrackWCKey=no (default) in the slurm.conf this value is ignored.

       -x, --exclude=<node name list>
              Explicitly exclude certain nodes from the resources granted to the job.

       --x11[=<all|first|last>]
              Sets  up X11 forwarding on all, first or last node(s) of the allocation. This option is only enabled if Slurm was compiled with X11 support and PrologFlags=x11 is defined in the slurm.conf. De‐
              fault is all.

PERFORMANCE
       Executing salloc sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from salloc or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmctld daemon come in at once, it can
       result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do  not run salloc or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to salloc to the minimum
       necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

OUTPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       salloc will set the following environment variables in the environment of the executed program:

       SLURM_*_HET_GROUP_#
              For a heterogeneous job allocation, the environment variables are set separately for each component.

       SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
              The directory from which salloc was invoked or, if applicable, the directory specified by the -D, --chdir option.

       SLURM_SUBMIT_HOST
              The hostname of the computer from which salloc was invoked.

       SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE
              Number  of  tasks  to  be initiated on each node. Values are comma separated and in the same order as SLURM_JOB_NODELIST.  If two or more consecutive nodes are to have the same task count, that
              count is followed by "(x#)" where "#" is the repetition count. For example, "SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE=2(x3),1" indicates that the first three nodes will each execute two tasks and the  fourth  node
              will execute one task.

SIGNALS
       While salloc is waiting for a PENDING job allocation, most signals will cause salloc to revoke the allocation request and exit.

       However if the allocation has been granted and salloc has already started the specified command, then salloc will ignore most signals.  salloc will not exit or release the allocation until the command
       exits.  One notable exception is SIGHUP. A SIGHUP signal will cause salloc to release the allocation and exit without waiting for the command to finish.  Another exception is SIGTERM,  which  will  be
       forwarded to the spawned process.

EXAMPLES
       To get an allocation, and open a new xterm in which srun commands may be typed interactively:

              $ salloc -N16 xterm
              salloc: Granted job allocation 65537
              # (at this point the xterm appears, and salloc waits for xterm to exit)
              salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 65537

       To grab an allocation of nodes and launch a parallel application on one command line:

              $ salloc -N5 srun -n10 myprogram

       To create a heterogeneous job with 3 components, each allocating a unique set of nodes:

              $ salloc -w node[2-3] : -w node4 : -w node[5-7] bash
              salloc: job 32294 queued and waiting for resources
              salloc: job 32294 has been allocated resources
              salloc: Granted job allocation 32294
