NAME
       caddy-reload - Changes the config of the running Caddy instance

SYNOPSIS
       caddy reload [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       Gives  the  running  Caddy  instance  a  new configuration. This has the same effect as POSTing a document to the /load API endpoint, but is convenient for simple workflows revolving around config
       files.

       Since the admin endpoint is configurable, the endpoint configuration is loaded from the --address flag if specified; otherwise it is loaded from the given config file; otherwise the default is as‐
       sumed.

OPTIONS
       --adapter=""      Name of config adapter to apply

       --address=""      Address of the administration listener, if different from config

       --config=""      Configuration file (required)

       --force[=false]      Force config reload, even if it is the same

       -h, --help[=false]      help for reload
