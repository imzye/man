NAME
       opentracker — a free and open bittorrent tracker

SYNOPSIS
       [-f config] [-i ip-select] [-p port-bind-tcp] [-P port-bind-udp] [-A blessed-ip] [-r redirect-url] [-d chdir] [-u user] [-w| -b -accesslist]

DESCRIPTION
       is a bittorrent tracker that implements announce and scrape actions over the UDP and the plain http protocol, aiming for minimal resource usage.

       When  invoked  with  parameters,  it  binds to TCP and UDP port 6969 on all interfaces. The recommended way to configure opentracker is by providing a config file using the [-f config] option. See
       opentracker.conf(4) for details.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -f config  Parse a config file with a list of options. Consecutive command options will override options from the config file. See opentracker.conf(4) for details.

       -i ip-select
                  Select an ip address that will be used with the next [-p] or [-P] command to actually bind to this address. Setting this option without any bind options in the config file  or  [-p]  or
                  [-P] commands will limit opentracker to only bind to this address.

       -p port-bind-tcp
                  Bind to the TCP port on the last preceding ip address set with the [-i -ip-select] option or to all available addresses if none has been set. Can be given multiple times.

       -P port-bind-udp
                  Bind to the UDP port on the last preceding ip address set with the [-i -ip-select] option or to all available addresses if none has been set. Can be given multiple times.

       -A blessed-ip
                  Set an ip address in IPv4 or IPv6 or a net in CIDR notation to bless the network for access to restricted resources.

       -r redirect-url
                  Set the URL that will redirect users to when the / address is requested via HTTP.

       -d chdir   Sets the directory will chroot(2) to if ran as root or chdir(2) to if ran as unprivileged user. Note that any accesslist files need to be relative to and within that directory.

       -u user    User to run under after all operations that need privileges have finished.

       -w accesslist | -b accesslist
                  If has been compiled with the WANT_ACCESSLIST_BLACK or WANT_ACCESSLIST_WHITE options, this option sets the location of the accesslist.

EXAMPLES
       Start bound on UDP and TCP ports 6969 on IPv6 localhost.
             # ./opentracker -i ::1 -p 6969 -P 6969

       Start  bound  on UDP port 6868 and TCP port 6868 on IPv4 localhost and allow privileged access from the network 192.168/16 while redirecting HTTP clients accessing the root directory, which is not
       covered by the bittorrent tracker protocol, to https://my-trackersite.com/.
             # ./opentracker -i 192.168.0.4 -p 6868 -P 6969 -A 192.168/16 -r https://my-trackersite.com/
       The announce URLs are http://192.168.0.4:6868/announce and udp://192.168.0.4:6868/announce respectively.
