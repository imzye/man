NAME
       pasmo — Z80 assembler

SYNOPSIS
       pasmo [options]  file.asm file.bin [file.sys]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pasmo command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the html format; see below.

       pasmois  a  multiplatform  Z80 cross-assembler, easy to compile and easy to use. It can generate object code in several formats suitable for many Z80 machines and emulators.  pasmo generates fixed
       position code, can not be used to create relocatable object files for use with linkers.

       pasmo is compatible with the syntax used in several old assemblers, by supporting several styles of numeric and string literals and by providing several names of the most  used  directives.   How‐
       ever, in Pasmo the Z80 mnemonics, register and flags names and directives are reserved words, this may require changes of symbol names conflicting in some programs.

       pasmo  can also generate the 8086 equivalent to the z80 assembly code. It can create COM files for ms-dos, by using the binary generation mode, or CMD files for CP/M 86, by using the --cmd option.
       This feature is experimental, use with care.

OPTIONS
       If no options specify another, the object code format is binary without headers.

       -d        Show debug info during assembly.

       -1        Show debug info during assembly, also in first pass.

       -v        Verbose. Show progress information during assembly.

       -I        Add directory to the list for searching files in INCLUDE and INCBIN.

       --hex     Generate the object file in Intel HEX format.

       --bin     Generate the object file in pure binary format without headers.

       --prl     Generate the object file in the PRL format. Useful for CP/M Plus RSX.

       --cmd     Generate the object file in CP/M 86 CMD format.

       --plus3dos
                 Generate the object file with PLUS3DOS header (Spectrum disk).

       --tap     Generate a .tap file for Spectrum emulators (tape image).

       --tzx     Generate a .tzx file for Spectrum emulators (tape image).

       --cdt     Generate a .cdt file for Spectrum emulators (tape image).

       --tapbas  Same as --tap option but adding a Basic loader.

       --tzxbas  Same as --tzx option but adding a Basic loader.

       --cdtbas  Same as --cdt option but adding a Basic loader.

       --amsdos  Generate the object file with Amsdos header (Amstrad CPC disk).

       --msx     Generate the object file with header for use with BLOAD in MSX Basic.

       --public  The symbol table listing will include only symbols declared as PUBLIC.

       --name    Name for the header in the formats that use it. If unspecified the object file name will be used.

       --err     Direct error messages to standard ouptut instead of error output (except for errors in options).

       --nocase  Make identifiers case insensitive.

       --alocal  Autolocal mode: the labels than begins with a '_' are locals, and his ambit finishes in the next no local label or in the next PROC, LOCAL or MACRO directive.

       -B --bracket
                 Bracket only mode: parenthesis are reserved for expressions.

       -E --equ  Predefine a label.

       -8 --w8080
                 Show warnings when using Z80 instructions that does not exist in 8080.

       --86      Generate 8086 code.
