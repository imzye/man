NAME
       malaga - natural-language word and sentence analysis

SYNOPSIS
       malaga [-morphology|-syntax] [-quoted] [-input input] project-file

DESCRIPTION
       Malaga is a development environment for natural-language grammars based
       on the Left-Associative Grammar formalism.  Malaga grammars can be used
       for automatic morphological and/or syntactic analysis.

       The  program malaga is Malaga's user interface for analysing word forms
       and sentences, displaying the results and finding bugs in a grammar.

       malaga requires the name of a language-dependent project-file as a com‐
       mand-line argument.

       If  no  command  line  options  are given, malaga starts in interactive
       mode, and you can enter commands.  If you are not sure about  the  name
       of  a  command,  use  the command help to get an overview of all malaga
       commands.

       If you want to quit malaga, enter the command quit.

       See info Malaga for details.

              output stream.

       -q[uoted]
              The  input  lines  to be analysed are quoted (only valid in mor‐
              phology or syntax mode).

              from  the  standard  input stream and analysed (one sentence per
              line). The analysis result is written  to  the  standard  output
              stream.
