NAME
       dotextwrap - line-folding (text-wrapping) filter program with i18n support

SYNOPSIS
       dotextwrap [<columns> [<tabs> [<header1> [<header2>]]]]

DESCRIPTION
       dotextwrap  is  a  small  filter to wrap text or fold lines.  Text-wrapping means formatting a given text by adding newline characters at proper positions so that the text fits the given width (or
       number of columns) of the terminal.

       Since this is a filter, it reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

       Unlike other softwares, this supports internationalization.

       At first, this automatically detects the current LC_CTYPE locale and follows it.

       Next, this supports multibyte encodings such as UTF-8 and EUC-JP.  In multibyte encodings, one character consists from one or more bytes.

       Third, this supports fullwidth characters such as CJK Ideogram, Katakana, Hiragana, and Hangul.  These characters occupy two columns per one character on the terminal.

       Forth, this supports combining characters such as Thai and accents for Latin scripts.  These characters occupy zero columns per one character on the terminal.

       Fifth, this supports languages which do not use whitespaces between words.  In these languages, lines can be folded at any places with small amount of exception (such as before commas).
