DESCRIPTION
       seticons  reads  iconsfile and writes its contents to the WMWindowAttributes domain, effectively setting the icons Window Maker uses for a given class (for example, XTerm, "xterm.XTerm", "rxvt.XTerm",
       "pine.XTerm", etc)

OPTIONS
       --help print a help message with the list of options
