NAME
       chibi-ffi - generate C from Scheme stub files

SYNOPSIS
       chibi-ffi [-c] [-f cflags] input.stub [output.c]

DESCRIPTION
       chibi-ffi  reads  in  the  C function FFI definitions from an input file and outputs appropriate C wrappers into a file with the same base name and the ".c" extension (unless specified other‐
       wise).  You can then compile that C file into a shared library:

              chibi-ffi file.stub
              cc -fPIC -shared file.c -lchibi-scheme

       If the -c option is specified then chibi-ffi attempts compiling the generated C code for you in one step.  In this case, additional flags for the C compiler may be given with the -f option.

       The FFI syntax is described in the manual (/usr/share/doc/chibi-scheme/chibi.html, "C FFI" section).
