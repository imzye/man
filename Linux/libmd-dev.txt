NAME
       libmd — Message Digest functions from BSD systems

DESCRIPTION
       The libmd library provides message digest functions found on BSD systems either on their libc or libmd libraries and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port projects with
       strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same code over and over again on each project.

       The library provides a compatibility interface for the Aladding Enterprises MD5 implementation, but the interface is not exposed by default to avoid polluting the namespace.  The LIBMD_MD5_ALADDIN
       pre-processor variable needs to be defined to expose this interface.

       The library provides a pkgconf(1) entry named libmd.

HEADERS
       The libmd library provides compatibility with various BSD headers and interfaces.

       The following headers are provided for compatibility with NetBSD and OpenBSD.

       <md2.h>
       <md4.h>
       <md5.h>
       <rmd160.h>
       <sha1.h>
       <sha2.h>

       The following headers are provided for compatibility with FreeBSD and DragonFly.

       <ripemd.h>
       <sha.h>
       <sha256.h>
       <sha512.h>

HISTORY
       The  libmd  project  started  in  the  Debian GNU/kFreeBSD port as part of the libbsd library, as a way to ease porting code from FreeBSD to the GNU-based system.  It was subsequently split into a
       project created on Hadrons.Org (mirrored on FreeDesktop.Org) for other distributions and projects to use, and further extended to match the other BSD interfaces.

       It is now distributed as part of most non-BSD distributions

Debian                                                                                          Oct 05, 2021                                                                                       libmd(7)
