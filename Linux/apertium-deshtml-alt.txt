NAME
     apertium-deshtml-alt — HTML format processor for Apertium with alt-translation

SYNOPSIS
     apertium-deshtml-alt [-hino] [input_file [output_file]]

DESCRIPTION
     This tool is part of the Apertium open-source machine translation toolbox: https://www.apertium.org/.

     apertium-deshtml-alt is an HTML format processor.  Data should be passed through this processor before being piped to lt-proc(1).  The program takes input in the form of an HTML document and produces
     output suitable for processing with lt-proc(1).  HTML tags and other format information are enclosed in brackets so that lt-proc(1) treats them as whitespace between words.  Unlike apertium-deshtml(1)
     it unwraps the alt-attribute of images, letting the alt-text be translated.

OPTIONS
     -h, --help

     -i      Makes the addition of trailing sentence terminator (‘.’) unconditional, often leading to duplicates.

     -n      Suppresses the addition of a trailing sentence terminator.

     -o      Inserts a "❡" (U+2761 CURVED STEM PARAGRAPH SIGN ORNAMENT) at the end of <h[1–6]> and <title> tags.

EXAMPLES
     You could write the following to show how the word “gener” is analysed:
           echo "<b>gener</b><img alt="gener"/>" | apertium-deshtml-alt | lt-proc ca-es.automorf.bin
