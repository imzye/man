DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ::ooxml::xl_read, ::ooxml::xl_write and ::ooxml::tablelist_to_xl commands.

       This  manual  page  was  written  for  the  Debian  distribution  because  the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation on its fossil repository at https://fos‐
       sil.sowaswie.de/ooxml/home

       ::ooxml::xl_read reads an Office Open XML “XLSX” file and returns its content in key-value form suitable for storing in a Tcl array.  (For most, if not all, purposes it may be also stored in a Tcl
       dictionary)

       ::ooxml::xl_write is a swiss-army knife class that manipulate the content and format of a spreadsheet.  See the examples for more information

       ::ooxml::tablelist_to_xl works in conjunction with the tablelist widget
