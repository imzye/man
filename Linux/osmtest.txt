DESCRIPTION
       osmtest is a test program to validate  InfiniBand  subnet  manager  and
       administration (SM/SA).

       Default is to run all flows with the exception of the QoS flow.

       osmtest provides a test suite for opensm.

       osmtest has the following capabilities and testing flows:

       It  creates  an  inventory  file  of  all  available  Nodes, Ports, and
       PathRecords, including all their  fields.   It  verifies  the  existing
       inventory,  with  all  the object fields, and matches it to a pre-saved
       one.  A Multicast Compliancy test.  An Event Forwarding test.   A  Ser‐
       vice  Record  registration  test.   An  RMPP  stress  test.  A Small SA
       Queries stress test.

       It is recommended that after installing opensm,  the  user  should  run
       "osmtest  -f  c" to generate the inventory file, and immediately after‐
       wards run "osmtest -f a" to test OpenSM.

       Another recommendation for osmtest usage is  to  create  the  inventory
       when the IB fabric is stable, and occasionally run "osmtest -v" to ver‐
       ify that nothing has changed.

OPTIONS
       -f, --flow
              This option directs osmtest to run a specific flow:
               FLOW  DESCRIPTION
               c = create an inventory file with all nodes, ports and paths
               a = run all validation tests (expecting an input inventory)
               v = only validate the given inventory file
               s = run service registration, deregistration, and lease test
               e = run event forwarding test
               f = flood the SA with queries according to the stress mode
               m = multicast flow
               q = QoS info: dump VLArb and SLtoVL tables
               t = run trap 64/65 flow (this flow requires running of external
              tool)
               (default is all flows except QoS)

       -w, --wait
              This option specifies the wait time for trap 64/65 in seconds It
              is used only when running -f t - the trap 64/65 flow (default to
              10 sec)

       -d, --debug
              This  option  specifies  a  debug option.  These options are not
              normally needed.  The number  following  -d  selects  the  debug
              option to enable as follows:

               OPT   Description
               ---    -----------------
               -d0  - Ignore other SM nodes
               -d1  - Force single threaded dispatching
               -d2  - Force log flushing after each log message
               -d3  - Disable multicast support
               -d4  - Use full world path record queries

       -m, --max_lid
              This  option specifies the maximal LID number to be searched for
              during inventory file build (default to 100)

       -g, --guid
              This option specifies the  local  port  GUID  value  with  which
              OpenSM  should  bind.   OpenSM may be bound to 1 port at a time.
              If GUID given is 0, OpenSM displays  a  list  of  possible  port
              GUIDs  and waits for user input.  Without -g, OpenSM trys to use
              the default port.

       -p, --port
              This option displays a menu of possible local port  GUID  values
              with which osmtest could bind

       -i, --inventory
              This option specifies the name of the inventory file.  Normally,
              osmtest expects to find an inventory file, which osmtest uses to
              validate real-time information received from the SA during test‐
              ing If -i  is  not  specified,  osmtest  defaults  to  the  file
              ´osmtest.dat´ See -f c option for related information

       -s, --stress
              This option runs the specified stress test instead of the normal
              test suite Stress test options are as follows:

               OPT    Description
               ---    -----------------
               -s1  - Single-MAD (RMPP) response SA queries
               -s2  - Multi-MAD (RMPP) response SA queries
               -s3  - Multi-MAD (RMPP) Path Record SA queries
               -s4  - Single-MAD (non RMPP) get Path Record SA queries

              Without -s, stress testing is not performed

       -M, --Multicast_Mode
              This option specify length of Multicast test:

               OPT    Description
               ---    -----------------
               -M1  - Short Multicast Flow (default) - single mode
               -M2  - Short Multicast Flow - multiple mode
               -M3  - Long Multicast Flow - single mode
               -M4  - Long Multicast Flow - multiple mode

              Single mode - Osmtest is tested alone, with no other  apps  that
              interact with OpenSM MC

              Multiple  mode  -  Could  be  run  with other apps using MC with
              OpenSM. Without -M, default flow testing is performed

       -t, --timeout
              This option specifies the time in milliseconds used for transac‐
              tion  timeouts.  Specifying -t 0 disables timeouts.  Without -t,
              OpenSM defaults to a timeout value of 200 milliseconds.

       -l, --log_file
              This option defines the log to be the given  file.   By  default
              the log goes to stdout.

       -v, --verbose
              This  option  increases  the log verbosity level.  The -v option
              may be specified multiple times to  further  increase  the  ver‐
              bosity  level.   See  the -vf option for more information about.
              log verbosity.

       -V     This option sets the maximum  verbosity  level  and  forces  log
              flushing.  The -V is equivalent to '-vf 0xFF -d 2'.  See the -vf
              option for more information about.  log verbosity.

       -vf    This option sets the log verbosity level.  A  flags  field  must
              follow the -D option.  A bit set/clear in the flags enables/dis‐
              ables a specific log level as follows:

               BIT    LOG LEVEL ENABLED
               ----   -----------------
               0x01 - ERROR (error messages)
               0x02 - INFO (basic messages, low volume)
               0x04 - VERBOSE (interesting stuff, moderate volume)
               0x08 - DEBUG (diagnostic, high volume)
               0x10 - FUNCS (function entry/exit, very high volume)
               0x20 - FRAMES (dumps all SMP and GMP frames)
               0x40 - ROUTING (dump FDB routing information)
               0x80 - currently unused.

              Without -vf, osmtest defaults to ERROR + INFO  (0x3)  Specifying
              -vf 0 disables all messages Specifying -vf 0xFF enables all mes‐
              sages (see -V) High verbosity levels may require increasing  the
              transaction timeout with the -t option

       -h, --help
              Display this usage info then exit.
