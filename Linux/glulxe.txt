NAME
       glulxe - execute Glulx interactive fiction

SYNOPSIS
       glulxe filename [ options ]

OVERVIEW
       glulxe executes Glulx-format interactive fiction games, which typically end with .ulx, .gblorb, .glb, .blorb, or .blb.  glulxe can work with only a terminal.

       The  only  required  parameter is the filename of the game to play.  The remaining parameters are all optional, and come from the glktermw library.  Further information can be found in the libglk‐
       termw-dev package in the directory /usr/share/doc/libglktermw-dev.

OPTIONS
       -width NUM, -height NUM
              Sets the screen width or height.  Normally automatically determined.

       -ml BOOL
              Enables or disables a message line (default “yes”).  This is the bottom line of the screen.

       -revgrid BOOL
              Reverse text in grid (status) windows (default “no”).

       -historylen NUM
              Sets the number of commands to keep in the history for each window (default 20).

       -border BOOL
              Whether or not to force one-character borders between windows.  The default turns on borders unless the game switches them off.  Setting to “yes” forces them on at all times, or “no” forces
              them off at all times, ignoring the game’s request.

       -precise BOOL
              Whether to use more precise timing for timed input (default “no”).

       -version
              Display Glk library version.

       -help  Display command-line help.
