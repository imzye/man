NAME
       tpm_restrictpubek - restrict the ability to display the public portion of the Endorsement Key to the owner

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_restrictpubek [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm_restrictpubek reports the status of who can display the public portion of the Endorsement Key.  This is the default behavior and also available with the --status option.  This operation will be in
       effect until the owner is cleared and prompts for the owner passord. With the --restrict option, the ability to display the public portion of the Endorsement Key is resticted to the owner (via the
       TPM_DisablePubekRead API).  The command prompts for the owner password to complete the operation.   The --status and --restrict options are mutually exclusive and the last one on the command line will
       be carried out.
