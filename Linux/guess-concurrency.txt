NAME
       guess_concurrency.py

SYNOPSIS
       guess_concurrency.py [-h] [--detect METHOD] [--max N] [--min N] [--require-mem MEMLIST]

DESCRIPTION
       Guess a suitable concurrency level given constraints from the runtime environment. Environment variables such as DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, RPM_BUILD_NCPUS and CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL are consulted for
       initial guesses falling back to querying the operating system in order to guess a suitable concurrency level. A user may further restrict the emitted concurrency by specifying a minimum or maximum
       and by requiring sufficient memory to support a level of concurreny to be available.

OPTIONS
       --detect METHOD
              supply a processor count or select a detection method (nproc, python or cores)

       --max N
              limit the number of detected cores to a given maximum

       --min N
              limit the number of detected cores to a given minimum

       --require-mem MEMLIST
              specify per-core required memory as a comma separated list
