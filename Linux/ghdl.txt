NAME
       ghdl - VHDL compiler/simulator

SYNOPSIS
       ghdl [command] [options] files...
       ghdl-gcc [command] [options] files...
       ghdl-llvm [command] [options] files...
       ghdl-mcode [command] [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ghdl command.  This manual page was written for user of man, but is not as complete as the reference documentation.

       Instead, users should read the GHDL texinfo manual

       The  Debian  package  supports  installing  multiple GHDL backends at the same time.  The GHDL executable ghdl is actually a wrapper that will execute the first installed backend it finds in the order
       mcode, gcc, llvm.  If you want to run GHDL with a specific backend you can directly run their executable, named ghdl-mcode, ghdl-gcc and ghdl-llvm respectively.  Alternatively, you can run  ghdl  with
       the  GHDL_BACKEND  environment  variable  set  to mcode, gcc or llvm to select a backend.  If the backend in GHDL_BACKEND is not installed or invalid, the wrapper will silently revert to selecting the
       first installed backend it finds.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of the main modes and options is included below.  For a complete description, refer
       to the GHDL texinfo manual.

       Basic commands:

       -a     Analysis, i.e. ghdl -a file.vhdl

       -e     Elabortation, i.e. ghdl -e unit_name

       -r     Run: run the simulation, i.e. ghdl -r unit_name

       -s     Syntax-check, i.e. ghdl -s file.vhdl

       --clean
              Clean: remove generated files, i.e. ghdl --clean

       -h, --help
              Help, i.e. ghdl --help

       --version
              Version, i.e. ghdl --version

       Basic options:

       --work=NAME
              Name of the WORK library, i.e.  ghdl -a --work=foo foo.vhdl

       --std=STD
              Which VHDL standard (87|93|93c|00|02), i.e. ghdl -a --std=87 old.vhdl

       --ieee=VER
              Which IEEE library (none|standard|synopsys|mentor), i.e. ghdl -a --ieee=synopsys broken.vhdl

       --no-vital-checks
              Disable VITAL restriction checking, i.e. ghdl -a --no-vital-checks unsupported_vital.vhdl

       There are many more modes and options; please consult the documentation.

       Executables created by GHDL have addition simulation options. The most important ones are listed below:

       --help Show options for simulation and execution.

       --assert-level=LEVEL
              Assert level at which to stop simulation (none|note|warning|error|failure), i.e. ./touchy_design --assert-level=note

       --stop-time=TIME
              Stop simuation after TIME, i.e. ./design --stop-time=50ns

       --vcd=FILENAME
              Dump VCD to FILENAME (a waveform dump, viewable with--for instance--gtkwave), i.e. ./design --vcd=design.vcd

       --sdf=[TYPE=]PATH=FILENAME
              Back annotate SDF onto design using TYPE (min|typ|max), instance PATH, and SDF file FILENAME, i.e. ./sdf_design --sdf=typ=top/inst=inst.sdf
