DESCRIPTION
       GraphicsMagick's  gm  provides  a  suite of utilities for creating, comparing, converting, editing, and displaying images.  All of the utilities are provided as sub-commands of a single gm executable.
       The gm executable returns the exit code 0 to indicate success, or 1 to indicate failure:

       animate displays an animation (e.g. a GIF file) on any workstation display running an X server.

       batch executes an arbitary number of the utility commands (e.g. convert) in the form of a simple linear batch script in order to improve execution efficiency, and/or to allow use as a subordinate  co-
       process under the control of an arbitrary script or program.

       benchmark executes one of the other utility commands (e.g. convert) for a specified number of iterations, or execution time, and reports execution time and other profiling information such as CPU uti‐
       lization. Benchmark provides various operating modes including executing the command with a varying number of threads, and alternate reporting formats such as comma-separated value (CSV).

       compare compares two images and reports difference statistics according to specified metrics and/or outputs an image with a visual representation of the differences.  It may also be used  to  test  if
       images are similar within a particular range and specified metric, returning a truth value to the executing environment.

       composite composites images (blends or merges images together) to create new images.

       conjure interprets and executes scripts in the Magick Scripting Language (MSL).

       convert converts an input file using one image format to an output file with the same or differing image format while applying an arbitrary number of image transformations.

       display is a machine architecture independent image processing and display facility. It can display an image on any workstation display running an X server.

       identify describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files. It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.

       import reads an image from any visible window on an X server and outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.

       mogrify transforms an image or a sequence of images. These transforms include image scaling, image rotation, color reduction, and others. The transmogrified image overwrites the original image.

       montage creates a composite by combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the composite image with the name of the image optionally appearing just below the individual tile.

       time executes a subcommand and reports the user, system, and total execution time consumed.

       version reports the GraphicsMagick release version, maximum sample-depth, copyright notice, supported features, and the options used while building the software.

       The GraphicsMagick utilities recognize the following image formats:

                     w   Write
                     +   Multi-image

       Support for some of these formats require additional programs or libraries.  See README in the source package for where to find optional additional software.

       Note, a format delineated with + means that if more than one image is specified, frames are combined into a single multi-image file. Use +adjoin if you want a single image produced for each frame.

       Your installation might not support all of the formats in the list.  To get an accurate listing of the formats supported by your particular configuration, run "gm convert -list format".

       Raw  images are expected to have one byte per pixel unless gm is compiled in 16-bit quantum mode or in 32-bit quantum mode. Here, the raw data is expected to be stored two or four bytes per pixel, re‐
       spectively, in most-significant-byte-first order.  For example, you can tell if gm was compiled in 16-bit mode by typing "gm version" without any options, and looking for "Q:16" in the first  line  of
       output.

FILES AND FORMATS
       By  default, the image format is determined by its magic number, i.e., the first few bytes of the file. To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon
       (i.e.ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (i.e.image.ps).  The magic number takes precedence over the filename suffix and the prefix takes precedence over the  magic  number  and
       the suffix in input files.  When a file is read, its magic number is stored in the "image->magick" string.  In output files, the prefix takes precedence over the filename suffix, and the filename suf‐
       fix takes precedence over the "image->magick" string.

       To read the "built-in" formats (GRANITE, H, LOGO, NETSCAPE, PLASMA, and ROSE) use a prefix (including the colon) without a filename or suffix.  To read the XC format, follow the  colon  with  a  color
       specification.  To read the CAPTION format, follow the colon with a text string or with a filename prefixed with the at symbol (@).

       When you specify X as your image type, the filename has special meaning. It specifies an X window by id, name, or root. If no filename is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse in the
       desired window.

       Specify input_file as - for standard input, output_file as - for standard output.  If input_file has the extension .Z or .gz, the file is uncompressed with uncompress or gunzip respectively.  If  out‐
       put_file has the extension .Z or .gz, the file is compressed using with compress or gzip respectively.

       Use  an  optional  index enclosed in brackets after an input file name to specify a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD (e.g. "img0001.pcd[4]") or a range for MPEG images
       (e.g. "video.mpg[50-75]"). A subimage specification can be disjoint (e.g. "image.tiff[2,7,4]"). For raw images, specify a subimage with a  geometry  (e.g.  -size  640x512  "image.rgb[320x256+50+50]").
       Surround  the  image name with quotation marks to prevent your shell from interpreting the square brackets. Single images are written with the filename you specify. However, multi-part images (e.g., a
       multi-page PostScript document with +adjoin specified) may be written with the scene number included as part of the filename. In order to include the scene number in the filename, it is  necessary  to
       include a printf-style %d format specification in the file name and use the +adjoin option. For example,

           image%02d.miff

       writes  files  image00.miff, image01.miff, etc. Only a single specification is allowed within an output filename. If more than one specification is present, it will be ignored. It is best to embed the
       scene number in the base part of the file name, not in the extension, because the extension will not be a recognizeable image type.

       When running a commandline utility, you can prepend an at sign @ to a filename to read a list of image filenames from that file. This is convenient in the event you have too many  image  filenames  to
       fit on the command line.

OPTIONS
       Options  are  processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect for the set of images that follows, until the set is terminated by the appearance of any op‐
       tion or -noop.  Some options only affect the decoding of images and others only the encoding.  The latter can appear after the final group of input images.

       This is a combined list of the command-line options used by the GraphicsMagick utilities (animate, compare, composite, convert, display, identify, import, mogrify and montage).

       In this document, angle brackets ("<>") enclose variables and curly brackets ("{}") enclose optional parameters. For example, "-fuzz <distance>{%}" means you can use the option "-fuzz  10"  or  "-fuzz
       2%".

       -adjoin
              join images into a single multi-image file

              By default, all images of an image sequence are stored in the same file. However, some formats (e.g. JPEG) do not support storing more than one image per file and only the first frame in an im‐
              age sequence will be saved unless the result is saved to separate files. Use +adjoin to force saving multiple frames to multiple numbered files. If +adjoin is used,  then  the  output  filename
              must include a printf style formatting specification for the numeric part of the filename.  For example,

                  image%02d.miff

       -affine <matrix>
              drawing transform matrix

              This option provides a transform matrix {sx,rx,ry,sy,tx,ty} for use by subsequent -draw or -transform options.

       -antialias
              remove pixel aliasing

              By  default  antialiasing  algorithms are used when drawing objects (e.g. lines) or rendering vector formats (e.g. WMF and Postscript). Use +antialias to disable use of antialiasing algorithms.
              Reasons to disable antialiasing include avoiding increasing colors in the image, or improving rendering speed.

       -append
              append a set of images

              This option creates a single image where the images in the original set are stacked top-to-bottom.  If they are not of the same width, any narrow images will be expanded to fit using the  back‐
              ground color.  Use +append to stack images left-to-right.  The set of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the -append option appears after all of the input images, all im‐
              ages are appended.

        -asc-cdl <spec>
              apply ASC CDL color transform

              Applies ("bakes in") the ASC CDL, which is a format for the exchange of basic primary color grading information between equipment and software from different manufacturers. The  format  defines
              the  math  for  three functions: slope, offset and power. Each function uses a number for the red, green, and blue color channels for a total of nine numbers comprising a single color decision.
              The tenth number (optional) is for chromiance (saturation) as specified by ASC CDL 1.2.

              The argument string is comma delimited and is in the following form (but without invervening spaces or line breaks)

                  redslope,redoffset,redpower:
                  greenslope,greenoffset,greenpower:
                  blueslope,blueoffset,bluepower:
                  saturation

              with the unity (no change) specification being:

                  "1.0,0.0,1.0:1.0,0.0,1.0:1.0,0.0,1.0:1.0"

       -authenticate <string>
              decrypt image with this password

              Use this option to supply a password for decrypting an image or an image sequence, if it is being read from a format such as PDF that supports encryption.  Encrypting images  being  written  is
              not supported.

       -auto-orient
              orient (rotate) image so it is upright

              Adjusts the image orienation so that it is suitable for viewing.  Uses the orientation tag obtained from the image file or as supplied by the -orient option.

       -average
              average a set of images

              The set of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the -average option appears after all of the input images, all images are averaged.

       -backdrop
              display the image centered on a backdrop.

              This  backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for hiding other X window activity while viewing the image. The color of the backdrop is specified as the foreground color (X11
              default is black).  Refer to "X Resources", below, for details.

       -background <color>
              the background color

              The color is specified using the format described under the -fill option.

       -black-threshold red[,green][,blue][,opacity]
              pixels below the threshold become black

              Use -black-threshold to set pixels with values below the specified threshold to minimum value (black). If only one value is supplied, or the red, green, and blue values are identical, then  in‐
              tensity thresholding is used. If the color threshold values are not identical then channel-based thresholding is used, and color distortion will occur. Specify a negative value (e.g. -1) if you
              want a channel to be ignored but you do want to threshold a channel later in the list. If a percent (%) symbol is appended, then the values are treated as a percentage of maximum range.

       -blue-primary <x>,<y>
              blue chromaticity primary point

       -blur <radius>{x<sigma>}
              blur the image with a Gaussian operator

              Blur with the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).

       -border <width>x<height>
              surround the image with a border of color

              See -geometry for details about the geometry specification.

       -bordercolor <color>
              the border color

              The color is specified using the format described under the -fill option.

       -borderwidth <geometry>
              the border width

       -box <color>
              set the color of the annotation bounding box

              The color is specified using the format described under the -fill option.

              See -draw for further details.

       -channel <type>
              the type of channel

              Choose from: Red, Green, Blue, Opacity, Matte, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, or Gray.

              Use this option to extract a particular channel from the image.  Opacity, for example, is useful for extracting the opacity values from an image.

       -charcoal <factor>
              simulate a charcoal drawing

       -chop <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>{%}
              remove pixels from the interior of an image

              Width and height give the number of columns and rows to remove, and x and y are offsets that give the location of the leftmost column and topmost row to remove.

              The x offset normally specifies the leftmost column to remove.  If the -gravity option is present with NorthEast, East, or SouthEast gravity, it gives the distance leftward from the right  edge
              of  the image to the rightmost column to remove.  Similarly, the y offset normally specifies the topmost row to remove, but if the -gravity option is present with SouthWest, South, or SouthEast
              gravity, it specifies the distance upward from the bottom edge of the image to the bottom row to remove.

              The -chop option removes entire rows and columns, and moves the remaining corner blocks leftward and upward to close the gaps.

       -clip  apply the clipping path, if one is present

              If a clipping path is present, it will be applied to subsequent operations.

              For example, if you type the following command:

                  gm convert -clip -negate cockatoo.tif negated.tif

              only the pixels within the clipping path are negated.

              The -clip feature requires the XML library.  If the XML library is not present, the option is ignored.

       -coalesce
              merge a sequence of images

              Each image N in the sequence after Image 0 is replaced with the image created by flattening images 0 through N.

              The set of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the -coalesce option appears after all of the input images, all images are coalesced.

       -colorize <value>
              colorize the image with the pen color

              Specify the amount of colorization as a percentage. You can apply separate colorization values to the red, green, and blue channels of the image with a colorization value  list  delimited  with
              slashes (e.g. 0/0/50).

              The -colorize option may be used in conjunction with -modulate to produce a nice sepia toned image like:

                  gm convert input.ppm -modulate 115,0,100 \
                            -colorize 7,21,50 output.ppm.

       -colormap <type>
              define the colormap type

              Choose between shared or private.

              This  option  only  applies  when the default X server visual is PseudoColor or GRAYScale. Refer to -visual for more details. By default, a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares colors
              with other X clients.  Some image colors could be approximated, therefore your image may look very different than intended. Choose Private and the image colors appear exactly as  they  are  de‐
              fined. However, other clients may go technicolor when the image colormap is installed.

       -colors <value>
              preferred number of colors in the image

              The  actual  number  of colors in the image may be less than your request, but never more. Note, this is a color reduction option. Images with less unique colors than specified with this option
              will have any duplicate or unused colors removed. The ordering of an existing color palette may be altered. When converting an image from color to grayscale, convert the image to the gray  col‐
              orspace before reducing the number of colors since doing so is most efficient. Refer to <a href="quantize.html">quantize for more details.

              Note, options -dither, -colorspace, and -treedepth affect the color reduction algorithm.

       -colorspace <value>
              the type of colorspace

              Choices are: CineonLog, CMYK, GRAY, HSL, HWB, OHTA, RGB, Rec601Luma, Rec709Luma, Rec601YCbCr, Rec709YCbCr, Transparent, XYZ, YCbCr, YIQ, YPbPr, or YUV.

              Color  reduction,  by  default, takes place in the RGB color space. Empirical evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV or YIQ correspond to perceptual color differences more
              closely than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces may give better results when color reducing an image.  Refer to quantize for more details.  Two gray colorspaces are  supported.  The
              Rec601Luma  space  is based on the recommendations for legacy NTSC television (ITU-R BT.601-5).  The Rec709Luma space is based on the recommendations for HDTV (Rec. ITU-R BT.709-5) and is suit‐
              able for use with computer graphics, and for contemporary CRT displays. The GRAY colorspace currently selects the Rec601Luma colorspace by default for backwards compatibly reasons. This default
              may be re-considered in the future.

              Two  YCbCr colorspaces are supported. The Rec601YCbCr space is based on the recommendations for legacy NTSC television (ITU-R BT.601-5). The Rec709CbCr space is based on the recommendations for
              HDTV (Rec.  ITU-R BT.709-5) and is suitable for suitable for use with computer graphics, and for contemporary CRT displays. The YCbCr colorspace specification is equivalent toRec601YCbCr.

              The Transparent color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves the matte channel of the image if it exists.

              The -colors or -monochrome option, or saving to a file format which requires color reduction, is required for this option to take effect.

       -comment <string>
              annotate an image with a comment

              Use this option to assign a specific comment to the image, when writing to an image format that supports comments. You can include the image filename, type, width, height, or other image attri‐
              bute by embedding special format characters listed under the -format option.  The comment is not drawn on the image, but is embedded in the image datastream via a "Comment" tag or similar mech‐
              anism.  If you want the comment to be visible on the image itself, use the -draw option instead.

              For example,

                   -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image comment of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

              If the first character of string is @, the image comment is read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.  Please note that if the string comes  from  an  untrusted  source
              that it should be sanitized before use since otherwise the content of an arbitrary readable file could be incorporated in a comment in the output file (a security risk).

              If the -comment option appears multiple times, only the last comment is stored.

              In PNG images, the comment is stored in a tEXt or zTXt chunk with the keyword "comment".

       -compose <operator>
              the type of image composition

              The description of composition uses abstract terminology in order to allow the the description to be more clear, while avoiding constant values which are specific to a particular build configu‐
              ration. Each image pixel is represented by red, green, and blue levels (which are equal for a gray pixel). MaxRGB is the maximum integral value which may be stored in the red,  green,  or  blue
              channels  of  the image. Each image pixel may also optionally (if the image matte channel is enabled) have an associated level of opacity (ranging from opaque to transparent), which may be used
              to determine the influence of the pixel color when compositing the pixel with another image pixel. If the image matte channel is disabled, then all pixels in the image are  treated  as  opaque.
              The color of an opaque pixel is fully visible while the color of a transparent pixel color is entirely absent (pixel color is ignored).

              By definition, raster images have a rectangular shape. All image rows are of equal length, and all image columns have the same number of rows. By treating the opacity channel as a visual "mask"
              the rectangular image may be given a "shape" by treating the opacity channel as a cookie-cutter for the image. Pixels within the shape are opaque, while pixels outside the shape  are  transpar‐
              ent.  Pixels  on  the boundary of the shape may be between opaque and transparent in order to provide antialiasing (visually smooth edges). The description of the composition operators use this
              concept of image "shape" in order to make the description of the operators easier to understand. While it is convenient to describe the operators in terms of "shapes" they are by no means  lim‐
              ited to mask-style operations since they are based on continuous floating-point mathematics rather than simple boolean operations.

              By default, the Over composite operator is used. The following composite operators are available:

                   Over
                   In
                   Out
                   Atop
                   Xor
                   Plus
                   Minus
                   Add
                   Subtract
                   Difference
                   Divide
                   Multiply
                   Bumpmap
                   Copy
                   CopyRed
                   CopyGreen
                   CopyBlue
                   CopyOpacity
                   CopyCyan
                   CopyMagenta
                   CopyYellow
                   CopyBlack

              The behavior of each operator is described below.

               Over

                    The result will be the union of the two image shapes, with opaque areas of change-image obscuring base-image in the region of overlap.

               In

                    The result is simply change-image cut by the shape of base-image. None of the image data of base-image will be in the result.

               Out

                    The resulting image is change-image with the shape of base-image cut out.

               Atop

                    The  result is the same shape as base-image, with change-image obscuring base-image where the image shapes overlap. Note this differs from over because the portion of change-image outside
                    base-image's shape does not appear in the result.

               Xor

                    The result is the image data from both change-image and base-image that is outside the overlap region. The overlap region will be blank.

               Plus

                    The result is just the sum of the image data. Output values are cropped to MaxRGB (no overflow). This operation is independent of the matte channels.

               Minus

                    The result of change-image - base-image, with underflow cropped to zero. The matte channel is ignored (set to opaque, full coverage).

               Add

                    The result of change-image + base-image, with overflow wrapping around (mod MaxRGB+1).

               Subtract

                    The result of change-image - base-image, with underflow wrapping around (mod MaxRGB+1). The add and subtract operators can be used to perform reversible transformations.

               Difference

                    The result of abs(change-image - base-image). This is useful for comparing two very similar images.

               Divide

                    The result of change-image / base-image. This is useful for improving the readability of text on unevenly illuminated photos (by using a gaussian blurred copy of change-image as  base-im‐
                    age).

               Multiply

                    The result of change-image * base-image. This is useful for the creation of drop-shadows.

               Bumpmap

                    The result base-image shaded by change-image.

               Copy

                    The resulting image is base-image replaced with change-image. Here the matte information is ignored.

               CopyRed

                    The resulting image is the red channel in base-image replaced with the red channel in change-image. The other channels are copied untouched.

               CopyGreen

                    The resulting image is the green channel in base-image replaced with the green channel in change-image. The other channels are copied untouched.

               CopyBlue

                    The resulting image is the blue channel in base-image replaced with the blue channel in change-image. The other channels are copied untouched.

               CopyOpacity

                    The resulting image is the opacity channel in base-image replaced with the opacity channel in change-image. The other channels are copied untouched.

               CopyCyan

                    The  resulting image is the cyan channel in base-image replaced with the cyan channel in change-image. The other channels are copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that base-im‐
                    age be in CMYK(A) colorspace.

               CopyMagenta

                    The resulting image is the magenta channel in base-image replaced with the magenta channel in change-image. The other channels are copied untouched. Use of  this  operator  requires  that
                    base-image be in CMYK(A) colorspace.

               CopyYellow

                    The resulting image is the yellow channel in base-image replaced with the yellow channel in change-image. The other channels are copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that base-
                    image be in CMYK(A) colorspace.

               CopyBlack

                    The resulting image is the black channel in base-image replaced with the black channel in change-image. The other channels are copied untouched. Use of this operator requires  that  base-
                    image be in CMYK(A) colorspace. If change-image is not in CMYK space, then the change-image pixel intensities are used.

       -compress <type>
              the type of image compression

              Choices are: None, BZip, Fax, Group3, Group4, JPEG, Lossless, LZW, RLE, Zip, LZMA, JPEG2000, JPEG2000, JBIG, JBIG2, WebP, or ZSTD.

              Specify +compress to store the binary image in an uncompressed format.  The default is the compression type of the specified image file.

              "Lossless" refers to lossless JPEG, which is only available if the JPEG library has been patched to support it. Use of lossless JPEG is generally not recommended.

              Use the -quality option to set the compression level to be used by the JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, MIFF, MPEG, and TIFF encoders. Use the -sampling-factor option to set the sampling factor to be used
              by the DPX, JPEG, MPEG, and YUV encoders for downsampling the chroma channels.

       -contrast
              enhance or reduce the image contrast

              This option enhances the intensity differences between the lighter and darker elements of the image. Use -contrast to enhance the image or +contrast to reduce the image contrast.

              For a more pronounced effect you can repeat the option:

                  gm convert rose: -contrast -contrast rose_c2.png

       -convolve <kernel>
              convolve image with the specified convolution kernel

              The kernel is specified as a comma-separated list of floating point values, ordered left-to right, starting with the top row. The order of the kernel is determined by the  square  root  of  the
              number of entries.  Presently only square kernels are supported.

       -create-directories
              create output directory if required

              Use  this  option with -output-directory if the input paths contain subdirectories and it is desired to create similar subdirectories in the output directory.  Without this option, mogrify will
              fail if the required output directory does not exist.

       -crop <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>{%}
              preferred size and location of the cropped image

              See -geometry for details about the geometry specification.

              The width and height give the size of the image that remains after cropping, and x and y are offsets that give the location of the top left corner of the cropped image with respect to the orig‐
              inal image.  To specify the amount to be removed, use -shave instead.

              If  the  x  and y offsets are present, a single image is generated, consisting of the pixels from the cropping region.  The offsets specify the location of the upper left corner of the cropping
              region measured downward and rightward with respect to the upper left corner of the image.  If the -gravity option is present with NorthEast, East, or SouthEast gravity, it gives  the  distance
              leftward  from  the  right edge of the image to the right edge of the cropping region.  Similarly, if the -gravity option is present with SouthWest, South, or SouthEast gravity, the distance is
              measured upward between the bottom edges.

              If the x and y offsets are omitted, a set of tiles of the specified geometry, covering the entire input image, is generated.  The rightmost tiles and the bottom tiles are smaller if the  speci‐
              fied geometry extends beyond the dimensions of the input image.

       -cycle <amount>
              displace image colormap by amount

              Amount defines the number of positions each colormap entry isshifted.

       -debug <events>
              enable debug printout

              The  events  parameter specifies which events are to be logged.  It can be either None, All, or a comma-separated list consisting of one or more of the following domains: Annotate, Blob, Cache,
              Coder, Configure, Deprecate, Error, Exception, FatalError, Information, Locale, Option, Render, Resource, TemporaryFile, Transform, User.  Warning, or X11, For example, to log  cache  and  blob
              events, use

                  gm convert -debug "Cache,Blob" rose: rose.png

              The "User" domain is normally empty, but developers can log "User" events in their private copy of GraphicsMagick.

              Use the -log option to specify the format for debugging output.

              Use +debug to turn off all logging.

              An alternative to using -debug is to use the MAGICK_DEBUG environment variable. The allowed values for the MAGICK_DEBUG environment variable are the same as for the -debug option.

       -deconstruct
              break down an image sequence into constituent parts

              This option compares each image with the next in a sequence and returns the maximum bounding region of any pixel differences it discovers.  This method can undo a coalesced sequence returned by
              the -coalesce option, and is useful for removing redundant information from a GIF or MNG animation.

              The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the -deconstruct option appears after all of the input images, all images are deconstructed.

       -define <key>{=<value>},...
              add coder/decoder specific options This option creates one or more definitions for coders and decoders to use while reading and writing image data. Definitions may be passed to coders  and  de‐
              coders  to control options that are specific to certain image formats. If value is missing for a definition, an empty-valued definition of a flag will be created with that name. This is used to
              control on/off options. Use +define <key>,... to remove definitions previously created. Use +define "*" to remove all existing definitions.

              The following definitions may be created:

               cineon:colorspace={rgb|cineonlog}

                    Use the cineon:colorspace option when reading a Cineon file to specify the colorspace the Cineon file uses. This overrides the colorspace type implied by the DPX header (if any).

               dpx:bits-per-sample=<value>

                    If the dpx:bits-per-sample key is defined, GraphicsMagick will write DPX images with the specified bits per sample, overriding any existing depth value. If this option is  not  specified,
                    then the value is based on the existing image depth value from the original image file. The DPX standard supports bits per sample values of 1, 8, 10, 12, and 16. Many DPX readers demand a
                    sample size of 10 bits with type A padding (see below).

               dpx:colorspace={rgb|cineonlog}

                    Use the dpx:colorspace option when reading a DPX file to specify the colorspace the DPX file uses. This overrides the colorspace type implied by the DPX header (if any).

               dpx:packing-method={packed|a|b|lsbpad|msbpad}

                    DPX samples are output within 32-bit words. They may be tightly packed end-to-end within the words ("packed"), padded with null bits to the right of  the  sample  ("a"  or  "lsbpad"),  or
                    padded with null bits to the left of the sample ("b" or "msbpad"). This option only has an effect for sample sizes of 10 or 12 bits. If samples are not packed, the DPX standard recommends
                    type A padding. Many DPX readers demand a sample size of 10 bits with type A padding.

               dpx:pixel-endian={lsb|msb}

                    Allows the user to specify the endian order of the pixels when reading or writing the DPX files. Sometimes this is useful if the file is (or must be) written incorrectly so that the  file
                    header and the pixels use different endianness.

               dpx:swap-samples={true|false}

                    GraphicsMagick  strives  to adhere to the DPX standard but certain aspects of the standard can be quite confusing. As a result, some 10-bit DPX files have Red and Blue interchanged, or Cb
                    and Cr interchanged due to an different interpretation of the standard, or getting the wires crossed. The swap-samples option may be supplied when reading or writing in order to  read  or
                    write using the necessary sample order.

               gradient:direction={South|North|West|East|NorthWest|NorthEast|SouthWest|SouthEast}

                    By  default, the gradient coder produces a gradient from top to bottom ("South").  Since GraphicsMagick 1.3.35, the gradient direction may be specified to produce gradient vectors accord‐
                    ing to a gravity-like specification.  The arguments are South (Top to Bottom), North (Bottom to Top), West (Right to Left), East (Left to Right),  NorthWest  (Bottom-Right  to  Top-Left),
                    NorthEast (Bottom-Left to Top-Right), SouthWest (Top-Right Bottom-Left), and SouthEast (Top-Left to Bottom-Right).

               jp2:rate=<value>

                    Specify  the compression factor to use while writing JPEG-2000 files. The compression factor is the reciprocal of the compression ratio. The valid range is 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 indicating
                    lossless compression. If defined, this value overrides the -quality setting. The default quality setting of 75 results in a rate value of 0.06641.

               jpeg:block-smoothing={true|false}

                    Enables or disables block smoothing when reading a JPEG file (default enabled).

               jpeg:dct-method=<value>

                    Selects the IJG JPEG library DCT implementation to use. The encoding implementations vary in speed and encoding error. The available choices for value are islow, ifast, float, default and
                    fastest. Note that fastest might not necessarily be fastest on your CPU, depending on the choices made when the JPEG library was built and how your CPU behaves.

               jpeg:fancy-upsampling={true|false}

                    Enables or disables fancy upsampling when reading a JPEG file (default enabled).

               jpeg:max-scan-number=<value>

                    Specifies  an  integer  value  for  the maximum number of progressive scans allowed in a JPEG file.  The default maximum is 100 scans.  This limit is imposed due to a weakness in the JPEG
                    standard which allows small JPEG files to take many minutes or hours to be read.

               jpeg:max-warnings=<value>

                    Specifies an integer value for how many warnings are allowed for any given error type before being promoted to a hard error.  JPEG files producing excessive warnings  indicate  a  problem
                    with the file.

               jpeg:optimize-coding={true|false}

                    Selects  if huffman encoding should be used. Huffman encoding is enabled by default, but may be disabled for very large images since it encoding requires that the entire image be buffered
                    in memory. Huffman encoding produces smaller JPEG files at the expense of added compression time and memory consumption.

               jpeg:preserve-settings

                    If the jpeg:preserve-settings flag is defined, the JPEG encoder will use the same "quality" and "sampling-factor" settings that were found in the input file, if the input was in JPEG for‐
                    mat.  These  settings  are  also preserved if the input is a JPEG file and the output is a JNG file.  If the colorspace of the output file differs from that of the input file, the quality
                    setting is preserved but the sampling-factors are not.

               pcl:fit-to-page

                    If the pcl:fit-to-page flag is defined, then the printer is requested to scale the image to fit the page size (width and/or height).
               mng:maximum-loops=<value>

                    mng:maximum-loops specifies the maximum number of loops allowed to be specified by a MNG LOOP chunk. Without an imposed limit, a MNG file could request up to 2147483647 loops, which could
                    run for a very long time.  The current default limit is 512 loops.

               pdf:use-cropbox={true|false}

                    If the pdf:use-cropbox flag is set to true, then Ghostscript is requested to apply the PDF crop box.

               pdf:stop-on-error={true|false}

                    If  the  pdf:stop-on-error flag is set to true, then Ghostscript is requested to stop processing the PDF when the first error is encountered.  Otherwise it will attempt to process all re‐
                    quested pages.

               ps:imagemask

                    If the ps:imagemask flag is defined, the PS3 and EPS3 coders will create Postscript files that render bilevel images with the Postscript imagemask operator instead of the image operator.

               ptif:minimum-geometry=<geometry>

                    If the ptif:minimum-geometry key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to determine the minimum frame size to output when writing a pyramid TIFF file (a TIFF file containing a succession
                    of reduced versions of the first frame). The default minimum geometry is 32x32.

               tiff:alpha={unspecified|associated|unassociated}

                    Specify the TIFF alpha channel type when reading or writing TIFF files, overriding the normal value. The default alpha channel type for new files is unspecified alpha. Existing alpha set‐
                    tings are preserved when converting from one TIFF file to another. When a TIFF file uses associated alpha, the image pixels are pre-multiplied (i.e. altered) with the alpha channel. Files
                    with  "associated" alpha appear as if they were alpha composited on a black background when the matte channel is disabled. If the unassociated alpha type is selected, then the alpha chan‐
                    nel is saved without altering the pixels. Photoshop recognizes associated alpha as transparency information, if the file is saved with unassociated alpha, the alpha information is  loaded
                    as an independent channel.  Note that for many years, ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick marked TIFF files as using associated alpha, without properly pre-multiplying the pixels.

               tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}

                    If  the tiff:fill-order key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to determine the bit fill order used while writing TIFF files. The normal default is "msb2lsb", which matches the native
                    bit order of all modern CPUs. The only exception to this is when Group3 or Group4 FAX compression is requested since FAX machines send data in bit-reversed order and  therefore  RFC  2301
                    recommends using reverse order.

               tiff:group-three-options=<value>

                    If  the  tiff:group-three-options  key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to set the group3 options tag when writing group3-compressed TIFF.  Please see the TIFF specification for the
                    usage of this tag.  The default value is 4.

               tiff:ignore-tags=<tags>

                    If the tiff:ignore-tags key is defined, then it is used as a list of comma-delimited integer TIFF tag values to ignore while reading the TIFF file.  This is useful in order to be able  to
                    read files which which otherwise fail to read due to problems with TIFF tags.  Note that some TIFF tags are required in order to be able to read the image data at all.

               tiff:report-warnings={false|true}

                    If  the  tiff:report-warnings  key is defined and set to true, then TIFF warnings are reported as a warning exception rather than as a coder log message.  Such warnings are reported after
                    the image has been read or written.  Most TIFF warnings are benign but sometimes they may help deduce problems with the TIFF file, or help detect that the TIFF file requires a special ap‐
                    plication to read successfully due to the use of proprietary or specialized extensions.

               tiff:sample-format={unsigned|ieeefp}

                    If  the tiff:sample-format key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to determine the sample format used while writing TIFF files. The default is "unsigned". Specify "ieeefp" in order to
                    write floating-point TIFF files with float (32-bit) or double (64-bit) values. Use the tiff:bits-per-sample define to determine the type of floating-point value to use.

               tiff:max-sample-value=<value>

                    If the tiff:max-sample-value key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use the assigned value as the maximum floating point value while reading or writing IEEE floating point  TIFFs.  Otherwise
                    the  maximum  value  is 1.0 or the value obtained from the file's SMaxSampleValue tag (if present). The floating point data is currently not scanned in advance to determine a best maximum
                    sample value so if the range is not 1.0, or the SMaxSampleValue tag is not present, it may be necessary to (intelligently) use this parameter to properly read a file.

               tiff:min-sample-value=<value>

                    If the tiff:min-sample-value key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use the assigned value as the minimum floating point value while reading or writing IEEE floating point  TIFFs.  Otherwise
                    the minimum value is 0.0 or the value obtained from the file's SMinSampleValue tag (if present).

               tiff:bits-per-sample=<value>

                    If the tiff:bits-per-sample key is defined, GraphicsMagick will write images with the specified bits per sample, overriding any existing depth value. Value may be any in the range of 1 to
                    32, or 64 when the default ´unsigned' format is written, or 16/32/24/64 if IEEEFP format is written.  Please note that the baseline TIFF 6.0 specification only requires readers to  handle
                    certain powers of two, and the values to be handled depend on the nature of the image (e.g. colormapped, grayscale, RGB, CMYK).

               tiff:samples-per-pixel=<value>

                    If  the  tiff:samples-per-pixel  key is defined to a value, the TIFF coder will write TIFF images with the defined samples per pixel, overriding any value stored in the image. This option
                    should not normally be used.

               tiff:rows-per-strip=<value>

                    Allows the user to specify the number of rows per TIFF strip.  Rounded up to a multiple of 16 when using JPEG compression. Ignored when using tiles.

               tiff:strip-per-page=true

                    Requests that the image is written in a single TIFF strip. This is normally the default when group3 or group4 compression is requested within reasonable limits. Requesting a single  strip
                    for large images may result in failure due to resource consumption in the writer or reader.

               tiff:tile

                    Enable writing tiled TIFF (rather than stripped) using the default tile size. Tiled TIFF organizes the image as an array of smaller images (tiles) in order to enable random access.

               tiff:tile-geometry=<width>x<height>

                    Specify  the tile size to use while writing tiled TIFF. Width and height should be a multiple of 16. If the value is not a multiple of 16, then it will be rounded down. Enables tiled TIFF
                    if it has not already been enabled. GraphicsMagick does not use tiled storage internally so tiles need to be converted back and forth from the internal scanline-oriented storage to  tile-
                    oriented storage. Testing with typical RGB images shows that useful square tile size values range from 128x128 to 1024x1024. Large images which require using a disk-based pixel cache ben‐
                    efit from large tile sizes while images which fit in memory work well with smaller tile sizes.

               tiff:tile-width=<width>

                    Specify the tile width to use while writing tiled TIFF. The tile height is then defaulted to an appropriate size. Width should be a multiple of 16. If the value is not a multiple  of  16,
                    then it will be rounded down.  Enables tiled TIFF if it has not already been enabled.

               tiff:tile-height=<height>

                    Specify  the tile height to use while writing tiled TIFF. The tile width is then defaulted to an appropriate size. Height should be a multiple of 16. If the value is not a multiple of 16,
                    then it will be rounded down.  Enables tiled TIFF if it has not already been enabled.

               tiff:webp-lossless={TRUE|FALSE}

                    Specify a value of TRUE to enable lossless mode while writing WebP-compressed TIFF files. The WebP webp:lossless option may also be used.  The quality factor set by  the  -quality  option
                    may be used to influence the level of effort expended while compressing.

               tiff:zstd-compress-level=<value>

                    Specify  the compression level to use while writing Zstd-compressed TIFF files. The valid range is 1 to 22. If this define is not specified, then the 'quality' value is used such that the
                    default quality setting of 75 is translated to a compress level of 9 such that ´quality' has a useful range of 10-184 if used for this purpose.

               webp:lossless={true|false}

                    Enable lossless encoding.

               webp:method={0-6}

                    Quality/speed trade-off.

               webp:image-hint={default,graph,photo,picture}

                    Hint for image type.

               webp:target-size=<integer>

                    Target size in bytes.

               webp:target-psnr=<float>

                    Minimal distortion to try to achieve.

               webp:segments={1-4}

                    Maximum number of segments to use.

               webp:sns-strength={0-100}

                    Spatial Noise Shaping.

               webp:filter-strength={0-100}

                    Filter strength.

               webp:filter-sharpness={0-7}

                    Filter sharpness.

               webp:filter-type={0,1}

                    Filtering type. 0 = simple, 1 = strong (only used if filter-strength > 0 or autofilter is enabled).

               webp:auto-filter={true|false}

                    Auto adjust filter's strength.

               webp:alpha-compression=<integer>

                    Algorithm for encoding the alpha plane (0 = none, 1 = compressed with WebP lossless). Default is 1.

               webp:alpha-filtering=<integer>

                    Predictive filtering method for alpha plane. 0: none, 1: fast, 2: best. Default is 1.

               webp:alpha-quality={0-100}

                    Between 0 (smallest size) and 100 (lossless). Default is 100.

               webp:pass=[1..10]

                    Number of entropy-analysis passes.

               webp:show-compressed={true|false}

                    Export the compressed picture back.  In-loop filtering is not applied.

               webp:preprocessing=[0,1,2]

                    0=none, 1=segment-smooth, 2=pseudo-random dithering

               webp:partitions=[0-3]

                    log2(number of token partitions) in [0..3].  Default is 0 for easier progressive decoding.

               webp:partition-limit={0-100}

                    Quality degradation allowed to fit the 512k limit on prediction modes coding (0: no degradation, 100: maximum possible degradation).

               webp:emulate-jpeg-size={true|false}

                    If true, compression parameters will be remapped to better match the expected output size from JPEG compression. Generally, the output size will be similar but  the  degradation  will  be
                    lower.

               webp:thread-level=<integer>

                    If non-zero, try and use multi-threaded encoding.

               webp:low-memory={true|false}

                    If set, reduce memory usage (but increase CPU use)

               webp:use-sharp-yuv={true|false}

                    If set, if needed, use sharp (and slow) RGB->YUV conversion

               For example, to create a postscript file that will render only the black pixels of a bilevel image, use:

                   gm convert bilevel.tif -define ps:imagemask eps3:stencil.ps

       -delay <1/100ths of a second>
              display the next image after pausing

              This option is useful for regulating the animation of image sequences Delay/100 seconds must expire before the display of the next image. The default is no delay between each showing of the im‐
              age sequence. The maximum delay is 65535.

              You can specify a delay range (e.g. -delay 10-500) which sets the minimum and maximum delay.

       -density <width>x<height>
              horizontal and vertical resolution in pixels of the image This option specifies the image resolution to store while encoding a raster image or the canvas resolution  while  rendering  (reading)
              vector  formats such as Postscript, PDF, WMF, and SVG into a raster image. Image resolution provides the unit of measure to apply when rendering to an output device or raster image. The default
              unit of measure is in dots per inch (DPI). The -units option may be used to select dots per centimeter instead.
               The default resolution is 72 dots per inch, which is equivalent to one point per pixel (Macintosh and Postscript standard). Computer screens are normally 72 or 96 dots per inch while  printers
              typically support 150, 300, 600, or 1200 dots per inch. To determine the resolution of your display, use a ruler to measure the width of your screen in inches, and divide by the number of hori‐
              zontal pixels (1024 on a 1024x768 display).  If the file format supports it, this option may be used to update the stored image resolution. Note that Photoshop stores and obtains image  resolu‐
              tion from a proprietary embedded profile. If this profile is not stripped from the image, then Photoshop will continue to treat the image using its former resolution, ignoring the image resolu‐
              tion specified in the standard file header.  The density option is an attribute and does not alter the underlying raster image. It may be used to adjust the rendered size for desktop publishing
              purposes by adjusting the scale applied to the pixels. To resize the image so that it is the same size at a different resolution, use the -resample option.

       -depth <value>
              depth of the image

              This  is the number of bits of color to preserve in the image. Any value between 1 and QuantumDepth (build option) may be specified, although 8 or 16 are the most common values. Use this option
              to specify the depth of raw images whose depth is unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or to change the depth of any image after it has been read.  The depth option is applied to the pixels  im‐
              mediately so it may be used as a form of simple compression by discarding the least significant bits. Reducing the depth in advance may speed up color quantization, and help create smaller file
              sizes when using a compression algorithm like LZW or ZIP.

       -descend
              obtain image by descending window hierarchy

       -despeckle
              reduce the speckles within an image

       -displace <horizontal scale>x<vertical scale>
              shift image pixels as defined by a displacement map

              With this option, composite image is used as a displacement map.  Black, within the displacement map, is a maximum positive displacement.  White is a maximum negative  displacement  and  middle
              gray  is  neutral.  The displacement is scaled to determine the pixel shift.  By default, the displacement applies in both the horizontal and vertical directions.  However, if you specify mask,
              composite image is the horizontal X displacement and mask the vertical Y displacement.

       -display <host:display[.screen]>
              specifies the X server to contact

              This option is used with convert for obtaining image or font from this X server.  See X(1).

       -dispose <method>
              GIF disposal method

              The Disposal Method indicates the way in which the graphic is to be treated after being displayed.

              Here are the valid methods:

                  Undefined       No disposal specified.
                  None            Do not dispose between frames.
                  Background      Overwrite the image area with
                                  the background color.
                  Previous        Overwrite the image area with
                                  what was there prior to rendering
                                  the image.

       -dissolve <percent>
              dissolve an image into another by the given percent

              The opacity of the composite image is multiplied by the given percent, then it is composited over the main image.

       -dither
              apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image

              The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels.  Images which suffer from  severe  contouring
              when reducing colors can be improved with this option.

              The -colors or -monochrome option is required for this option to take effect.

              Use +dither to turn off dithering and to render PostScript without text or graphic aliasing. Disabling dithering often (but not always) leads to decreased processing time.

       -draw <string>
              annotate an image with one or more graphic primitives

              Use this option to annotate an image with one or more graphic primitives.  The primitives include shapes, text, transformations, and pixel operations.  The shape primitives are

                   point           x,y
                   line            x0,y0 x1,y1
                   rectangle       x0,y0 x1,y1
                   roundRectangle  x0,y0 x1,y1 wc,hc
                   arc             x0,y0 x1,y1 a0,a1
                   ellipse         x0,y0 rx,ry a0,a1
                   circle          x0,y0 x1,y1
                   polyline        x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
                   polygon         x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
                   Bezier          x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
                   path            path specification
                   image           operator x0,y0 w,h filename

              The text primitive is

                   text            x0,y0 string

              The text gravity primitive is

                   gravity         NorthWest, North, NorthEast, West, Center,
                                   East, SouthWest, South, or SouthEast

              The text gravity primitive only affects the placement of text and does not interact with the other primitives.  It is equivalent to using the -gravity commandline option, except that it is lim‐
              ited in scope to the -draw option in which it appears.

              The transformation primitives are

                   rotate          degrees
                   translate       dx,dy
                   scale           sx,sy
                   skewX           degrees
                   skewY           degrees

              The pixel operation primitives are

                   color           x0,y0 method
                   matte           x0,y0 method

              The shape primitives are drawn in the color specified in the preceding -stroke option. Except for the line and point primitives, they are filled with the color specified in the preceding  -fill
              option.  For unfilled shapes, use -fill none.

              Point requires a single coordinate.

              Line requires a start and end coordinate.

              Rectangle expects an upper left and lower right coordinate.

              RoundRectangle has the upper left and lower right coordinates and the width and height of the corners.

              Circle has a center coordinate and a coordinate for the outer edge.

              Use Arc to inscribe an elliptical arc within a rectangle.  Arcs require a start and end point as well as the degree of rotation (e.g. 130,30 200,100 45,90).

              Use Ellipse to draw a partial ellipse centered at the given point with the x-axis and y-axis radius and start and end of arc in degrees (e.g. 100,100 100,150 0,360).

              Finally,  polyline and polygon require three or more coordinates to define its boundaries.  Coordinates are integers separated by an optional comma.  For example, to define a circle centered at
              100,100 that extends to 150,150 use:

                   -draw 'circle 100,100 150,150'

              Paths (See Paths) represent an outline of an object which is defined in terms of moveto (set a new current point), lineto (draw a straight line), curveto (draw a curve using  a  cubic  Bezier),
              arc  (elliptical  or circular arc) and closepath (close the current shape by drawing a line to the last moveto) elements. Compound paths (i.e., a path with subpaths, each consisting of a single
              moveto followed by one or more line or curve operations) are possible to allow effects such as "donut holes" in objects.

              Use image to composite an image with another image. Follow the image keyword with the composite operator, image location, image size, and filename:

                   -draw 'image Over 100,100 225,225 image.jpg'

              You can use 0,0 for the image size, which means to use the actual dimensions found in the image header. Otherwise, it will be scaled to the given dimensions.  See -compose for a description  of
              the composite operators.

              Use  text to annotate an image with text. Follow the text coordinates with a string. If the string has embedded spaces, enclose it in single or double quotes. Optionally you can include the im‐
              age filename, type, width, height, or other image attribute by embedding special format character. See -comment for details.

              For example,

                   -draw 'text 100,100 "%m:%f %wx%h"'

              annotates the image with MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

              If the first character of string is @, the text is read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.  Please note that if the string comes from  an  untrusted  source  that  it
              should be sanitized before use (a security risk).

              Rotate  rotates  subsequent shape primitives and text primitives about the origin of the main image. If the -region option precedes the -draw option, the origin for transformations is the upper
              left corner of the region.

              Translate translates them.

              Scale scales them.

              SkewX and SkewY skew them with respect to the origin of the main image or the region.

              The transformations modify the current affine matrix, which is initialized from the initial affine matrix defined by the -affine option.  Transformations are cumulative within the -draw option.
              The  initial affine matrix is not affected; that matrix is only changed by the appearance of another -affine option.  If another -draw option appears, the current affine matrix is reinitialized
              from the initial affine matrix.

              Use color to change the color of a pixel to the fill color (see -fill). Follow the pixel coordinate with a method:

                   point
                   replace
                   floodfill
                   filltoborder
                   reset

              Consider the target pixel as that specified by your coordinate. The point method recolors the target pixel. The replace method recolors any pixel that matches the color  of  the  target  pixel.
              Floodfill recolors any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel and is a neighbor, whereas filltoborder recolors any neighbor pixel that is not the border color. Finally, reset recolors
              all pixels.

              Use matte to the change the pixel matte value to transparent. Follow the pixel coordinate with a method (see the color primitive for a description of methods).  The  point  method  changes  the
              matte  value of the target pixel. The replace method changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel. Floodfill changes the matte value of any pixel that matches
              the color of the target pixel and is a neighbor, whereas filltoborder changes the matte value of any neighbor pixel that is not the border color (-bordercolor).  Finally reset changes the matte
              value of all pixels.

              You  can  set the primitive color, font, and font bounding box color with -fill, -font, and -box respectively. Options are processed in command line order so be sure to use these options before
              the -draw option.

       -edge <radius>
              detect edges within an image

       -emboss <radius>
              emboss an image

       -encoding <type>
              specify the text encoding

              Choose from AdobeCustom, AdobeExpert, AdobeStandard, AppleRoman, BIG5, GB2312, Latin 2, None, SJIScode, Symbol, Unicode, Wansung.

       -endian <type>
              specify endianness (MSB, LSB, or Native) of image

              MSB indicates big-endian (e.g. SPARC, Motorola 68K) while LSB indicates little-endian (e.g. Intel 'x86, VAX) byte ordering.  Native indicates to use the normal ordering  for  the  current  CPU.
              This option currently only influences the CMYK, DPX, GRAY, RGB, and TIFF, formats.

              Use +endian to revert to unspecified endianness.

       -enhance
              apply a digital filter to enhance a noisy image

       -equalize
              perform histogram equalization to the image

       -extent <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>
              composite image on background color canvas image

              This  option composites the image on a new background color (-background) canvas image of size <width>x<height>. The existing image content is composited at the position specified by geometry x
              and y offset and/or desired gravity (-gravity) using the current image compose (-compose) method.  Image content which falls outside the bounds of the new image dimensions is discarded.

              For example, this command creates a thumbnail of an image, and centers it on a red color backdrop image, offsetting the canvas ten pixels to the left and five pixels up,  with  respect  to  the
              thumbnail:

                  gm convert infile.jpg -thumbnail 120x80 -background red -gravity center \
                            -extent 140x100-10-5 outfile.jpg

              This command reduces or expands a JPEG image to fit on an 800x600 display:

                  gm convert -size 800x600 input.jpg \
                            -resize 800x600 -background black \
                            -compose Copy -gravity center \
                            -extent 800x600 \
                            -quality 92 output.jpg

              If the aspect ratio of the input image isn't exactly 4:3, then the image is centered on an 800x600 black canvas.

       -file <filename>
              write annotated difference image to file

              If -file is specified, then an annotated difference image is generated and written to the specified file. Pixels which differ between the reference and compare images are modified from those in
              the compare image so that the changed pixels become more obvious.  Some images may require use of an alternative highlight style (see -highlight-style) or highlight color (see -highlight-color)
              before the changes are obvious.

       -fill <color>
              color to use when filling a graphic primitive

              Colors are represented in GraphicsMagick in the same form used by SVG. Use "gm convert -list color" to list named colors:

                  name               (named color)
                  #RGB               (hex numbers, 4 bits each)
                  #RRGGBB            (8 bits each)
                  #RRRGGGBBB         (12 bits each)
                  #RRRRGGGGBBBB      (16 bits each)
                  #RGBA              (4 bits each)
                  #RRGGBBAA          (8 bits each)
                  #RRRGGGBBBAAA      (12 bits each)
                  #RRRRGGGGBBBBAAAA  (16 bits each)
                  rgb(r,g,b)         (r,g,b are decimal numbers)
                  rgba(r,g,b,a)      (r,g,b,a are decimal numbers)

              Enclose the color specification in quotation marks to prevent the "#" or the parentheses from being interpreted by your shell.

              For example,

                  gm convert -fill blue ...
                  gm convert -fill "#ddddff" ...
                  gm convert -fill "rgb(65000,65000,65535)" ...

              The shorter forms are scaled up, if necessary by replication.  For example, #3af, #33aaff, and #3333aaaaffff are all equivalent.

              See -draw for further details.

       -filter <type>
              use this type of filter when resizing an image

              Use this option to affect the resizing operation of an image (see -geometry).  Choose from these filters (ordered by approximate increasing CPU time):

                   Point
                   Box
                   Triangle
                   Hermite
                   Hanning
                   Hamming
                   Blackman
                   Gaussian
                   Quadratic
                   Cubic
                   Catrom
                   Mitchell
                   Lanczos
                   Bessel
                   Sinc

              The  default  filter  is  automatically selected to provide the best quality while consuming a reasonable amount of time. The Mitchell filter is used if the image supports a palette, supports a
              matte channel, or is being enlarged, otherwise the Lanczos filter is used.

       -flatten
              flatten a sequence of images

              In some file formats (e.g. Photoshop's PSD) complex images may be represented by "layers" (independent images) which must be composited in order to obtain the final rendition.  The -flatten op‐
              tion  accomplishes  this  composition.   The sequence of images is replaced by a single image created by compositing each image in turn, while respecting composition operators and page offsets.
              While -flatten is immediately useful for eliminating layers, it is also useful as a general-purpose composition tool.

              The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the -flatten option appears after all of the input images, all images are flattened.  Also see -mosaic which is similar
              to -flatten except that it adds a suitably-sized canvas base image.

              For example, this composites an image on top of a 640x400 transparent black canvas image:

                  gm convert -size 640x300 xc:transparent \
                            -compose over -page +0-100 \
                            frame.png -flatten output.png

              and this flattens a Photoshop PSD file:

                  gm convert input.psd -flatten output.png

       -flip  create a "mirror image"

              reflect the scanlines in the vertical direction.

       -flop  create a "mirror image"

              reflect the scanlines in the horizontal direction.

       -font <name>
              use this font when annotating the image with text

              You can tag a font to specify whether it is a PostScript, TrueType, or X11 font.  For example, Arial.ttf is a TrueType font, ps:helvetica is PostScript, and x:fixed is X11.

       -foreground <color>
              define the foreground color

              The color is specified using the format described under the -fill option.

       -format <type>
              the image format type

              When  used  with the mogrify utility, this option will convert any image to the image format you specify.  See GraphicsMagick(1) for a list of image format types supported by GraphicsMagick, or
              see the output of 'gm -list format'.

              By default the file is written to its original name.  However, if the filename extension matches a supported format, the extension is replaced with the image format type specified with -format.
              For example, if you specify tiff as the format type and the input image filename is image.gif, the output image filename becomes image.tiff.

       -format <string>
              output formatted image characteristics

              When  used  with  the  identify  utility, or the convert utility with output written to the 'info:-' file specification, use this option to print information about the image in a format of your
              choosing.  You can include the image filename, type, width, height, Exif data, or other image attributes by embedding special format characters:

                   %b   file size
                   %c   comment
                   %d   directory

              should be sanitized before use since this may be used to incorporate any readable file on the system (a security risk).

              The values of image type (%r) which may be returned include:

              JPEG specific information (from reading a JPEG file) may be obtained like this:

                   %[JPEG-<tag>]

              Where "<tag>" may be one of the following:

                   *                 (all JPEG-related tags, in
                                      keyword=data format)
                   Quality           IJG JPEG "quality" estimate
                   Colorspace        JPEG colorspace numeric ID
                   Colorspace-Name   JPEG colorspace name
                   Sampling-factors  JPEG sampling factors

              Please  note  that  JPEG has no notion of "quality" and that the quality metric used by, and estimated by the software is based on the quality metric established by IJG JPEG 6b.  Other encoders
              (e.g. that used by Adobe Photoshop) use different encoding metrics.

              Surround the format specification with quotation marks to prevent your shell from misinterpreting any spaces and square brackets.

       -frame <width>x<height>+<outer bevel width>+<inner bevel width>
              surround the image with an ornamental border

              See -geometry for details about the geometry specification.  The -frame option is not affected by the -gravity option.

              The color of the border is specified with the -mattecolor command line option.

       -frame include the X window frame in the imported image

       -fuzz <distance>{%}
              colors within this Euclidean distance are considered equal

              A number of algorithms search for a target color. By default the color must be exact. Use this option to match colors that are close (in Euclidean distance) to the target color in RGB 3D space.
              For  example,  if you want to automatically trim the edges of an image with -trim but the image was scanned and the target background color may differ by a small amount. This option can account
              for these differences.

              The distance can be in absolute intensity units or, by appending "%", as a percentage of the maximum possible intensity (255, 65535, or 4294967295).

       -gamma <value>
              level of gamma correction

              The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look different due to differences in the display monitor. Use gamma correction to adjust for this color  difference.  Reasonable
              values extend from 0.8 to 2.3. Gamma less than 1.0 darkens the image and gamma greater than 1.0 lightens it. Large adjustments to image gamma may result in the loss of some image information if
              the pixel quantum size is only eight bits (quantum range 0 to 255).

              You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue channels of the image with a gamma value list delimited with slashes (e.g., 1.7/2.3/1.2).

              Use +gamma value to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting the image pixels. This option is useful if the image is of a known gamma but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG im‐
              ages).

       -gaussian <radius>{x<sigma>}
              blur the image with a Gaussian operator

              Use the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).

       -geometry <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>{%}{@}{!}{^}{<}{>}
              Specify dimension, offset, and resize options.

              The -geometry option is used for a number of different purposes, depending on the utility it is used with.

              For  the  X11 commands ('animate', 'display', and 'import'), it specifies the preferred size and location of the Image window.  By default, the window size is the image size and the location is
              chosen by you (or your window manager) when it is mapped.
               For the 'import', 'convert', 'mogrify' utility commands it may be used to specify the desired size when resizing an image.  In this case, symbols representing resize options may be appended to
              the geometry string to influence how the resize request is treated.

              See  later  notes  corresponding to usage by particular commands.  The following notes apply to when -geometry is used to express a resize request, taking into account the current properties of
              the image.

              By default, the width and height are maximum values. That is, the image is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.

              Append a ^ to the geometry so that the image aspect ratio is maintained when the image is resized, but the resulting width or height are treated as minimum values rather than maximum values.

              Append a ! (exclamation point) to the geometry to force the image size to exactly the size you specify. For example, if you specify 640x480! the image width is set to 640 pixels and  height  to
              480.

              If only the width is specified, without the trailing 'x', then height is set to width (e.g., -geometry 100 is the same as -geometry 100x100).  If only the width is specified but with the trail‐
              ing 'x', then width assumes the value and the height is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio of the image.  Similarly, if only the height is specified prefixed by 'x' (e.g., -geometry x256), the
              width is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio.

              To  specify a percentage width or height instead, append %. The image size is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain the final image dimensions. To increase the size of an im‐
              age, use a value greater than 100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an image's size, use a percentage less than 100.

              Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.

              Use > to change the dimensions of the image only if its width or height exceeds the geometry specification. < resizes the image only if both of its dimensions are less than the geometry  speci‐
              fication. For example, if you specify '640x480>' and the image size is 256x256, the image size does not change. However, if the image is 512x512 or 1024x1024, it is resized to 480x480.  Enclose
              the geometry specification in quotation marks to prevent the < or > from being interpreted by your shell as a file redirection.

              When used with animate and display, offsets are handled in the same manner as in X(1) and the -gravity option is not used.  If the x is negative, the offset is measured leftward from the  right
              edge of the screen to the right edge of the image being displayed.  Similarly, negative y is measured between the bottom edges.  The offsets are not affected by "%"; they are always measured in
              pixels.

              When used as a composite option, -geometry gives the dimensions of the image and its location with respect to the composite image.  If the -gravity option is present with  NorthEast,  East,  or
              SouthEast  gravity, the x represents the distance from the right edge of the image to the right edge of the composite image.  Similarly, if the -gravity option is present with SouthWest, South,
              or SouthEast gravity, y is measured between the bottom edges. Accordingly, a positive offset will never point in the direction outside of the image.  The offsets are not affected by  "%";  they
              are always measured in pixels.  To specify the dimensions of the composite image, use the -resize option.

              When used as a convert, import or mogrify option, -geometry is synonymous with -resize and specifies the size of the output image.  The offsets, if present, are ignored.

              When used as a montage option, -geometry specifies the image size and border size for each tile; default is 256x256+0+0.  Negative offsets (border dimensions) are meaningless.  The -gravity op‐
              tion affects the placement of the image within the tile; the default gravity for this purpose is Center.  If the "%" sign appears in the geometry specification, the tile size is  the  specified
              percentage of the original dimensions of the first tile.  To specify the dimensions of the montage, use the -resize option.

       -gravity <type>
              direction primitive  gravitates to when annotating the image.

              Choices are: NorthWest, North, NorthEast, West, Center, East, SouthWest, South, SouthEast.

              The  direction you choose specifies where to position the text when annotating the image. For example Center gravity forces the text to be centered within the image. By default, the image grav‐
              ity is NorthWest.  See -draw for more details about graphic primitives.  Only the text primitive is affected by the -gravity option.

              The -gravity option is also used in concert with the -geometry option and other options that take <geometry> as a parameter, such as the -crop option.  See -geometry  for  details  of  how  the
              -gravity option interacts with the <x> and <y> parameters of a geometry specification.

              When used as an option to composite, -gravity gives the direction that the image gravitates within the composite.

              When used as an option to montage, -gravity gives the direction that an image gravitates within a tile.  The default gravity is Center for this purpose.

       -green-primary <x>,<y>
              green chromaticity primary point

       -hald-clut <clut>
              apply a Hald CLUT to the image

              A  Hald  CLUT  ("Color Look-Up Table") is a special square color image which contains a look-up table for red, green, and blue.  The size of the Hald CLUT image is determined by its order.  The
              width (and height) of a Hald CLUT is the cube of the order.  For example, a Hald CLUT of order 8 is 512x512 pixels (262,144 colors) and of order 16 is 4096x4096 (16,777,216 colors).  A  special
              CLUT  is the identity CLUT which which causes no change to the input image.  In order to use the Hald CLUT, one takes an identity CLUT and adjusts its colors in some way.  The modified CLUT can
              then be used to transform any number of images in an identical way.

              GraphicsMagick contains a built-in identity CLUT generator via the IDENTITY coder.  For example reading from the file name IDENTITY:8 returns an identity CLUT of order  8.   Typical  Hald  CLUT
              identity  images  have  an  order  of between 8 and 16.  The default order for the IDENTITY CLUT generator is 8.  Interpolation is used so it is not usually necessary for CLUT images to be very
              large.  The PNG file format is ideal for storing Hald CLUT images because it compresses them very well.

       -highlight-color <color>
              pixel annotation color

              Specifies the color to use when annotating difference pixels.

       -highlight-style <style>
              pixel annotation style

              Specifies the pixel difference annotation style used to draw attention to changed pixels. May be one of Assign, Threshold, Tint, or XOR; where Assign replaces the pixel with the highlight color
              (see  -highlight-color),  Threshold replaces the pixel with black or white based on the difference in intensity, Tint alpha tints the pixel with the highlight color, and XOR does an XOR between
              the pixel and the highlight color.

       -iconGeometry <geometry>
              specify the icon geometry

              Offsets, if present in the geometry specification, are handled in the same manner as the -geometry option, using X11 style to handle negative offsets.

       -iconic
              iconic animation

       -immutable
              make image immutable

       -implode <factor>
              implode image pixels about the center

       -intent <type>
              use this type of rendering intent when managing the image color

              Use this option to affect the the color management operation of an image (see -profile).  Choose from these intents: Absolute, Perceptual, Relative, Saturation.

              The default intent is undefined.

       -interlace <type>
              the type of interlacing scheme

              Choices are: None, Line, Plane, or Partition. The default is None.

              This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw image formats such as RGB or YUV.  None means do not interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...),

              Line uses scanline interlacing (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...), and Plane uses plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).

              Partition is like plane except the different planes are saved to individual files (e.g. image.R, image.G, and image.B).

              Use Line to create an interlaced PNG or  GIF or progressive JPEG image.

       -label <name>
              assign a label to an image

              Use this option to assign a specific label to the image, when writing to an image format that supports labels, such as TIFF, PNG, MIFF, or PostScript. You can include the  the  image  filename,
              type,  width,  height,  or  other image attribute by embedding special format character.  A label is not drawn on the image, but is embedded in the image datastream via a "Label" tag or similar
              mechanism.  If you want the label to be visible on the image itself, use the -draw option.  See -comment for details.

              For example,

                   -label "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image label of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

              If the first character of string is @, the image label is read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.  Please note that if the string comes from an untrusted source  that
              it should be sanitized before use since otherwise the content of an arbitrary readable file might be incorporated into the image label (a security risk).

              If the -label option appears multiple times, only the last label is stored.

              In PNG images, the label is stored in a tEXt or zTXt chunk with the keyword "label".

              When converting to PostScript, use this option to specify a header string to print above the image. Specify the label font with -font.

              When creating a montage, by default the label associated with an image is displayed with the corresponding tile in the montage.  Use the +label option to suppress this behavior.

       -lat <width>x<height>{+-}<offset>{%}
              perform local adaptive thresholding

              Perform  local adaptive thresholding using the specified width, height, and offset.  The offset is a distance in sample space from the mean, as an absolute integer ranging from 0 to the maximum
              sample value or as a percentage.  If the percent option is supplied, then the offset is computed as a percentage of the quantum range.  It is strongly recommended to use the percent  option  so
              that results are not sensitive to pixel quantum depth.

              For example,

                   -colorspace gray -lat "10x10-5%"

              will help clarify a scanned grayscale or color document, producing a bi-level equivalent.

       -level <black_point>{,<gamma>}{,<white_point>}{%}
              adjust the level of image contrast

              Give one, two or three values delimited with commas: black-point, gamma, white-point (e.g. 10,1.0,250 or 2%,0.5,98%). The black and white points range from 0 to MaxRGB or from 0 to 100%; if the
              white point is omitted it is set to MaxRGB-black_point. If a "%" sign is present anywhere in the string, the black and white points are percentages of MaxRGB. Gamma is an exponent  that  ranges
              from 0.1 to 10.; if it is omitted, the default of 1.0 (no gamma correction) is assumed. This interface works similar to Photoshop's "Image->Adjustments->Levels..."  "Input Levels" interface.

       -limit <type> <value>
              Disk, File, Map, Memory, Pixels, Width, Height or Threads resource limit

              By  default, resource limits are estimated based on the available resources of the system. The resource limits are Disk, maximum total disk space consumed; File, maximum number of file descrip‐
              tors allowed to be open at once; Map, maximum total number of file bytes which may be memory mapped; Memory, maximum total number of bytes of heap memory used for image storage; Pixels, maximum
              absolute image size (per image); Width, maximum image pixels width; Height, maximum image pixels height; and Threads, the maximum number of worker threads to use per OpenMP thread team.

              These resource limits are used to decide if (for a given image) the decoded image ("pixel cache") should be stored in heap memory (RAM), in a memory-mapped disk file, or in a disk file accessed
              via read/write I/O.  The number of total pixels in one image, and/or the width/height, may also be limited in order to force the reading, or creation of images larger than the limit (in pixels)
              to intentionally fail. The disk limit establishes an overall limit since using the disk is the means of last resort. When the disk limit has been reached, no more images may be read.

              The  value  argument is an absolute value, but may have standard binary suffix characters applied ('K', 'M', 'G', 'T', 'P', 'E') to apply a scaling to the value (based on a multiplier of 1024).
              Any additional characters are ignored. For example, '-limit Pixels 10MP' limits the maximum image size to 10 megapixels and '-limit memory 32MB -limit map 64MB' limits memory and memory  mapped
              files to 32 megabytes and 64 megabytes respectively.

              Resource  limits  may  also be set using environment variables. The environment variables MAGICK_LIMIT_DISK, MAGICK_LIMIT_FILES, MAGICK_LIMIT_MAP, MAGICK_LIMIT_MEMORY, MAGICK_LIMIT_PIXELS, MAG‐
              ICK_LIMIT_WIDTH, MAGICK_LIMIT_HEIGHT,and OMP_NUM_THREADS may be used to set the limits for disk space, open files, memory mapped size, heap memory, per-image pixels, image width, image  height,
              and threads respectively.

              Use the option -list resource list the current limits.

       -linewidth
              the line width for subsequent draw operations

       -list <type>
              the type of list

              Choices are: Color, Delegate, Format, Magic, Module, Resource, or Type. The Module option is only available if GraphicsMagick was built to support loadable modules.

              This option lists information about the GraphicsMagick configuration.

       -log <string>
              Specify format for debug log

              This option specifies the format for the log printed when the -debug option is active.

              You can display the following components by embedding special format characters:

                   %d   domain
                   %e   event
                   %f   function
                   %l   line
                   %m   module
                   %p   process ID
                   %r   real CPU time
                   %t   wall clock time
                   %u   user CPU time
                   %%   percent sign
                   \n   newline
                   \r   carriage return

              For example:

                  gm convert -debug coders -log "%u %m:%l %e" in.gif out.png

              The default behavior is to print all of the components.

       -loop <iterations>
              add Netscape loop extension to your GIF animation

              A value other than zero forces the animation to repeat itself up to iterations times.

       -magnify
              magnify the image

              The image size is doubled using linear interpolation.

       -magnify <factor>
              magnify the image

              The displayed image is magnified by factor.

       -map <filename>
              choose a particular set of colors from this image

              [convert or mogrify]

              By  default,  color  reduction chooses an optimal set of colors that best represent the original image. Alternatively, you can choose a particular set of colors from an image file with this op‐
              tion.

              Use +map to reduce all images in the image sequence that follows to a single optimal set of colors that best represent all the images.  The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of
              any option.  If the +map option appears after all of the input images, all images are mapped.

       -map <type>
              display image using this type.

              [animate or display]

              Choose from these Standard Colormap types:

                   best
                   default
                   gray
                   red
                   green
                   blue

              The  X  server must support the Standard Colormap you choose, otherwise an error occurs. Use list as the type and display searches the list of colormap types in top-to-bottom order until one is
              located. See xstdcmap(1) for one way of creating Standard Colormaps.

       -mask <filename>
              Specify a clipping mask

              The image read from the file is used as a clipping mask.  It must have the same dimensions as the image being masked.

              If the mask image contains an opacity channel, the opacity of each pixel is used to define the mask.  Otherwise, the intensity (gray level) of each pixel is used.  Unmasked (black)  pixels  are
              modified while masked pixels (not black) are protected from alteration.

              Use +mask to remove the clipping mask.

              It is not necessary to use -clip to activate the mask; -clip is implied by -mask.

       -matte store matte channel if the image has one

              If the image does not have a matte channel, create an opaque one.

              Use +matte to ignore the matte channel and to avoid writing a matte channel in the output file.

       -mattecolor <color>
              specify the color to be used with the -frame option

              The color is specified using the format described under the -fill option.

       -maximum-error <limit>
              specifies the maximum amount of total image error

              Specifies  the  maximum  amount  of total image error (based on comparison using a specified metric) before an error ("image difference exceeds limit") is reported.  The error is reported via a
              non-zero command execution return status.

       -median <radius>
              apply a median filter to the image

       -metric <metric>
              comparison metric (MAE, MSE, PAE, PSNR, RMSE)

       -minify <factor>
              minify the image

              The image size is halved using linear interpolation.

       -mode <value>
              mode of operation

              The available montage modes are frame to place the images in a rectangular grid while adding a decorative frame with dropshadow, unframe to place undecorated images in a rectangular  grid,  and
              concatenate to pack the images closely together without any well-defined grid or decoration.

       -modulate brightness[,saturation[,hue]]
              vary the brightness, saturation, and hue of an image

              Specify  the  percent  change  in  brightness, color saturation, and hue separated by commas. Default argument values are 100 percent, resulting in no change. For example, to increase the color
              brightness by 20% and decrease the color saturation by 10% and leave the hue unchanged, use: -modulate 120,90.

              Hue is the percentage of absolute rotation from the current position. For example 50 results in a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees, 150 results in a clockwise rotation  of  90  degrees,
              with 0 and 200 both resulting in a rotation of 180 degrees.

       -monitor
              show progress indication

              A  simple  command-line progress indication is shown while the command is running. The process indication shows the operation currently being performed and the percent completed. Commands using
              X11 may replace the command line progress indication with a graphical one once an image has been displayed.

       -monochrome
              transform the image to black and white

       -morph <frames>
              morphs an image sequence

              Both the image pixels and size are linearly interpolated to give the appearance of a meta-morphosis from one image to the next.

              The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the -morph option appears after all of the input images, all images are morphed.

       -mosaic
              create a mosaic from an image or an image sequence

              The -mosaic option provides a flexible way to composite one or more images onto a solid-color canvas image. It works similar to -flatten except that a base canvas image is automatically created
              with  a suitable size given the image size, page dimensions, and page offsets of images to be composited.  The color of the base canvas image may be set via the -background option.  The default
              canvas color is 'white', but 'black' or 'transparent' may be more suitable depending on the composition algorithm requested.

              The -compose option may be used to specify the composition algorithm to use when compositing the subsequent image on the base canvas.

              The -page option can be used to establish the dimensions of the mosaic and to position the subsequent image within the mosaic.  If the -page argument does not specify width and height, then the
              canvas dimensions are evaluated based on the image sizes and offsets.

              The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the -mosaic option appears after all of the input images, all images are included in the mosaic.

              The following is an example of composing an image based on red, green, and blue layers extracted from a sequence of images and pasted on the canvas image at specified offsets:

                  gm convert -background black \
                            -compose CopyRed   -page +0-100 red.png \
                            -compose CopyGreen -page +0+40  green.png \
                            -compose CopyBlue  -page +0+180 blue.png \
                            -mosaic output.png

       -motion-blur <radius>{x<sigma>}{+angle}
              Simulate motion blur

              Simulate  motion  blur by convolving the image with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation (sigma). For reasonable results, radius should be larger than sigma. If radius
              is zero, then a suitable radius is automatically selected based on sigma. The angle specifies the angle that the object is coming from (side which is blurred).

       -name  name an image

       -negate
              replace every pixel with its complementary color

              The red, green, and blue intensities of an image are negated.  White becomes black, yellow becomes blue, etc.  Use +negate to only negate the grayscale pixels of the image.

       -noise <radius|type>
              add or reduce noise in an image

              The principal function of noise peak elimination filter is to smooth the objects within an image without losing edge information and without creating undesired structures. The central  idea  of
              the  algorithm  is to replace a pixel with its next neighbor in value within a pixel window, if this pixel has been found to be noise. A pixel is defined as noise if and only if this pixel is a
              maximum or minimum within the pixel window.

              Use radius to specify the width of the neighborhood.

              Use +noise followed by a noise type to add noise to an image.  The noise added modulates the existing image pixels. Choose from these noise types:

                   Uniform
                   Gaussian
                   Multiplicative
                   Impulse
                   Laplacian
                   Poisson
                   Random (uniform distribution)

       -noop  NOOP (no option)

              The -noop option can be used to terminate a group of images and reset all options to their default values, when no other option is desired.

       -normalize
              transform image to span the full range of color values

              This is a contrast enhancement technique based on the image histogram.

              When computing the contrast enhancement values, the histogram edges are truncated so that the majority of the image pixels are considered in the constrast enhancement, and outliers (e.g. random
              noise or minute details) are ignored.  The default is that 0.1 percent of the histogram entries are ignored.  The percentage of the histogram to ignore may be specified by using the -set option
              with the histogram-threshold parameter similar to -set histogram-threshold 0.01 to specify 0.01 percent.  Use 0 percent to use the entire histogram, with possibly diminished  contrast  enhance‐
              ment.

       -opaque <color>
              change this color to the pen color within the image

              The color is specified using the format described under the -fill option.  The color is replaced if it is identical to the target color, or close enough to the target color in a 3D space as de‐
              fined by the Euclidean distance specified by -fuzz.

              See -fill and -fuzz for more details.

       -operator channel operator rvalue[%]
              apply a mathematical, bitwise, or value operator to an image channel

              Apply a low-level mathematical, bitwise, or value operator to a selected image channel or all image channels. Operations which result in negative results are reset to zero, and operations which
              overflow the available range are reset to the maximum possible value.

              Select a channel from: Red, Green, Blue, Opacity, Matte, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, All, or Gray. All only modifies the color channels and does not modify the Opacity channel. Except for the
              threshold operators, All operates on each channel independently so that operations are on a per-channel basis.

              Gray treats the color channels as a grayscale intensity and performs the requested operation on the equivalent pixel intensity so the result is a gray image.  Select an operator from Add,  And,
              Assign,  Depth,  Divide,  Gamma,  Negate, LShift, Log, Max, Min, Multiply, Or, Pow RShift, Subtract, Threshold, Threshold-White, Threshold-White-Negate, Threshold-Black, Threshold-Black-Negate,
              Xor, Noise-Gaussian, Noise-Impulse, Noise-Laplacian, Noise-Multiplicative, Noise-Poisson, Noise-Random, and Noise-Uniform.

              Rvalue may be any floating point or integer value. Normally rvalue will be in the range of 0 to MaxRGB, where MaxRGB is the largest quantum value supported by  the  GraphicsMagick  build  (255,
              65535,  or  4294967295)  but  values outside this range are useful for some arithmetic operations.  Arguments to logical or bit-wise operations are rounded to a positive integral value prior to
              use. If a percent (%) symbol is appended to the argument, then the argument has a range of 0 to 100 percent.

              The following is a description of the operators:

               Add

                    Result is rvalue added to channel value.

               And

                    Result is the logical AND of rvalue with channel value.

               Assign

                    Result is rvalue.

               Depth

                    Result is channel value adjusted so that it may be (approximately) stored in the specified number of bits without additional loss.

               Divide

                    Result is channel value divided by rvalue.

               Gamma

                    Result is channel value gamma adjusted by rvalue.

               LShift

                    Result is channel value bitwise left shifted by rvalue bits.

               Log

                    Result is computed as log(value*rvalue+1)/log(rvalue+1).

               Max

                    Result is assigned to rvalue if rvalue is greater than value.

               Min

                    Result is assigned to rvalue if rvalue is less than value.

               Multiply

                    Result is channel value multiplied by rvalue.

               Negate

                    Result is inverse of channel value (like a film negative). An rvalue must be supplied but is currently not used. Inverting the image twice results in the original image.

               Or

                    Result is the logical OR of rvalue with channel value.

               Pow

                    Result is computed as pow(value,rvalue). Similar to Gamma except that rvalue is not inverted.

               RShift

                    Result is channel value bitwise right shifted by rvalue bits.

               Subtract

                    Result is channel value minus rvalue.

               Threshold

                    Result is maximum (white) if channel value is greater than rvalue, or minimum (black) if it is less than or equal to rvalue. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done based
                    on computed pixel intensity.

               Threshold-white

                    Result  is  maximum (white) if channel value is greater than rvalue and is unchanged if it is less than or equal to rvalue. This can be used to remove apparent noise from the bright parts
                    of an image. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done based on computed pixel intensity.

               Threshold-White-Negate

                    Result is set to black if channel value is greater than rvalue and is unchanged if it is less than or equal to rvalue. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is  done  based  on
                    computed pixel intensity.

               Threshold-black

                    Result  is  minimum  (black)  if  channel value is less than than rvalue and is unchanged if it is greater than or equal to rvalue. This can be used to remove apparent noise from the dark
                    parts of an image. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done based on computed pixel intensity.

               Threshold-Black-Negate

                    Result is set to white if channel value is less than than rvalue and is unchanged if it is greater than or equal to rvalue. If all channels are specified, then thresholding is done  based
                    on computed pixel intensity.

               Xor

                    Result is the logical XOR of rvalue with channel value. An interesting property of XOR is that performing the same operation twice results in the original value.

               Noise-Gaussian

                    Result is the current channel value modulated with gaussian noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.

               Noise-Impulse

                    Result is the current channel value modulated with impulse noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.

               Noise-Laplacian

                    Result is the current channel value modulated with laplacian noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.

               Noise-Multiplicative

                    Result is the current channel value modulated with multiplicative gaussian noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.

               Noise-Poisson

                    Result is the current channel value modulated with poisson noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.

               Noise-Random

                    Result  is  the  current  channel value modulated with random (uniform distribution) noise according to the intensity specified by rvalue.  The initial noise intensity (rvalue=1.0) is the
                    range of one pixel quantum span.

               Noise-Uniform

                    Result is the channel value with uniform noise applied according to the intensity specified by rvalue.

               As an example, the Assign operator assigns a fixed value to a channel. For example, this command sets the red channel to the mid-range value:

                   gm convert in.bmp -operator red assign "50%" out.bmp

               The following applies 50% thresholding to the image and returns a gray image:

                   gm convert in.bmp -operator gray threshold "50%" out.bmp

       -ordered-dither <channeltype> <NxN>
              ordered dither the image

              The channel or channels specified in the channeltype argument are reduced to binary, using an ordered dither method. The choices for channeltype are All, Intensity, Red, Green, Blue, Cyan,  Ma‐
              genta, Yellow, Black, and Opacity

              When  channeltype  is "All", the color samples are dithered into a gray level and then that gray level is stored in the three color channels.  Separately, the opacity channel is dithered into a
              bilevel opacity value which is stored in the opacity channel.

              When channeltype is "Intensity", only the color samples are dithered. When channeltype is "opacity" or "matte", only the opacity channel is dithered. When a color  channel  is  specified,  only
              that channel is dithered.

              The choices for N are 2 through 7. The image is divided into NxN pixel tiles.  In each tile, some or all pixels are turned to white depending on their intensity.  For each N, (N**2)+1 levels of
              gray can be represented.  For N == 2, 3, or 4, the pixels are turned to white in an order that maximizes dispersion (i.e., reduces granularity), while for N == 5, 6, and 7, they are  turned  to
              white  in  an  order that creates a roughly circular black blob in the middle of each tile.  An attractive "half-tone" looking image can be obtained by first rotating the image 45 degrees, per‐
              forming a 5x5 ordered-dither operation, then rotating it back to the original orientation and cropping to the original image dimensions.  If the original  image  is  gamma-encoded,  it  is  ad‐
              viseable to convert it to linear intensity first, e.g., with the "-gamma 0.45455" option.

       -output-directory <directory>
              output files to directory

              Use  -output-directory  to specify a directory under which to write the output files. Normally mogrify overwrites the input files, but with this option the output files may be written to a dif‐
              ferent directory tree so that the input files are preserved. The algorithm used preserves all of the input path specification in the output path so that the user-specified input path (including
              any  sub-directory  part) is appended to the output path. If the input file lacks an extension, then a suitable extension is automatically added to the output file.  The user is responsible for
              creating the output directory specified as an argument, but subdirectories will be created as needed if the -create-directories option is supplied.  This option may be used to apply transforma‐
              tions  on  files from one directory and write the transformed files to a different directory.  In conjunction with -create-directories, this option is designed to support transforming whole di‐
              rectory trees of files provided that the relative path of the input file is included as part the list of filenames.

       -orient <orientation>
              Set the image orientation attribute

              Sets the image orientation attribute.  The image orientation attribute is compatible with the TIFF orientation tag (and the EXIF orientation  tag).   Accepted  values  are  undefined,  TopLeft,
              TopRight, BottomRight, BottomLeft, LeftTop, RightTop, RightBottom, LeftBottom, and hyphenated versions thereof (e.g. left-bottom).  Please note that GraphicsMagick does not include an EXIF edi‐
              tor so if an EXIF profile is written to the output image, the value in the EXIF profile might not match the image.  It is possible for an image file to indicate its orientation in several  dif‐
              ferent ways simultaneously.

       -page <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>{%}{!}{<}{>}
              size and location of an image canvas

              Use this option to specify the dimensions of the PostScript page in dots per inch or a TEXT page in pixels. The choices for a PostScript page are:

              For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g. A4, Ledger, etc.). Otherwise, -page behaves much like -geometry (e.g.  -page letter+43+43>).

              This  option is also used to place subimages when writing to a multi-image format that supports offsets, such as GIF89 and MNG.  When used for this purpose the offsets are always  measured from
              the top left corner of the canvas and are not affected by the -gravity option.  To position a GIF or MNG image, use -page{+-}<x>{+-}<y> (e.g. -page +100+200).  When writing to  a  MNG  file,  a
              -page  option  appearing ahead of the first image in the sequence with nonzero width and height defines the width and height values that are written in the MHDR chunk.  Otherwise, the MNG width
              and height are computed from the bounding box that contains all images in the sequence.  When writing a GIF89 file, only the bounding box method is used to determine its dimensions.

              For a PostScript page, the image is sized as in -geometry and positioned relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by {+-}<xoffset>{+-}<y offset>. Use -page 612x792>, for  example,  to
              center  the  image  within the page. If the image size exceeds the PostScript page, it is reduced to fit the page.  The default gravity for the -page option is NorthWest, i.e., positive x and y
              offset are measured rightward and downward from the top left corner of the page, unless the -gravity option is present with a value other than NorthWest.

              The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.

              This option is used in concert with -density.

              Use +page to remove the page settings for an image.

       -paint <radius>
              simulate an oil painting

              Each pixel is replaced by the most frequent color in a circular neighborhood whose width is specified with radius.

       -pause <seconds>
              pause between animation loops [animate]

              Pause for the specified number of seconds before repeating the animation.

       -pause <seconds>
              pause between snapshots [import]

              Pause for the specified number of seconds before taking the next snapshot.

       -pen <color>
              (This option has been replaced by the -fill option)

       -ping  efficiently determine image characteristics

              Use this option to disable reading the image pixels so that image characteristics such as the image dimensions may be obtained very quickly. For identify, use +ping to force reading  the  image
              pixels so that the pixel read rate may be included in the displayed information.

       -pointsize <value>
              pointsize of the PostScript, X11, or TrueType font

       -preview <type>
              image preview type

              Use this option to affect the preview operation of an image (e.g.  convert file.png -preview Gamma Preview:gamma.png). Choose from these previews:

                   Rotate
                   Shear
                   Roll
                   Hue
                   Saturation
                   Brightness
                   Gamma
                   Spiff
                   Dull
                   Grayscale
                   Quantize
                   Despeckle
                   ReduceNoise
                   AddNoise
                   Sharpen
                   Blur
                   Threshold
                   EdgeDetect
                   Spread
                   Shade
                   Raise
                   Segment
                   Solarize
                   Swirl
                   Implode
                   Wave
                   OilPaint
                   CharcoalDrawing
                   JPEG

              The default preview is JPEG.

       -process <command>
              process a sequence of images using a process module

              The  command  argument has the form module=arg1,arg2,arg3,...,argN where module is the name of the module to invoke (e.g. "analyze") and arg1,arg2,arg3,...,argN are an arbitrary number of argu‐
              ments to pass to the process module.  The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.

              If the -process option appears after all of the input images, all images are processed.

       -profile <filename>
              add ICM, IPTC, or generic profile  to image

              -profile filename adds an ICM (ICC color management), IPTC (newswire information), or a generic (including Exif) profile to the image

              Use +profile icm, +profile iptc, or +profile profile_name to remove the respective profile.  Multiple profiles may be listed, separated by commas.  Profiles  may  be  excluded  from  subsequent
              listed  matches  by  preceding their name with an exclamation point.  For example, +profile '!icm,*' strips all profiles except for the ICM profile.  Use identify -verbose to find out what pro‐
              files are in the image file.  Use +profile "*" to remove all profiles.  Writing the image to a format that does not support profiles will of course also cause all profiles to be  removed.   The
              JPEG  and  PNG  formats  will store any profiles that have been read and not removed.  In JPEG they are stored in APP1 markers, and in PNG they are stored as hex-coded binary in compressed zTXt
              chunks, except for the iCC chunk which is stored in the iCCP chunk.

              To extract a profile, the -profile option is not used.  Instead, simply write the file to an image format such as APP1, 8BIM, ICM, or IPTC.

              For example, to extract the Exif data (which is stored in JPEG files in the APP1 profile), use

                  gm convert cockatoo.jpg exifdata.app1

              Note that GraphicsMagick does not attempt to update any profile to reflect changes made to the image, e.g., rotation from portrait to landscape orientation, so it is possible that the preserved
              profile may contain invalid data.

       -preserve-timestamp
              preserve the original timestamps of the file

              Use this option to preserve the original modification and access timestamps of the file, even if it has been modified.

       +progress
              disable progress monitor and busy cursor

              By  default, when an image is displayed, a progress monitor bar is shown in the top left corner of an existing image display window, and the current cursor is replaced with an hourglass cursor.
              Use +progress to disable the progress monitor and busy cursor during display operations.  While the progress monitor is disabled for all operations, the busy cursor continues to be enabled  for
              non-display operations such as image processing. This option is useful for non-interactive display operations, or when a "clean" look is desired.

       -quality <value>
              JPEG/MIFF/PNG/TIFF compression level
               For  the  JPEG  and  MPEG  image formats, quality is 0 (lowest image quality and highest compression) to 100 (best quality but least effective compression). The default quality is 75.  Use the
              -sampling-factor option to specify the factors for chroma downsampling.  To use the same quality value as that found by the JPEG decoder, use the -define jpeg:preserve-settings flag.

              For the MIFF image format, and the TIFF format while using ZIP compression, quality/10 is the zlib compression level, which is 0 (worst but fastest compression) to 9 (best but slowest). It  has
              no effect on the image appearance, since the compression is always lossless.

              For  the  JPEG-2000 image format, quality is mapped using a non-linear equation to the compression ratio required by the Jasper library. This non-linear equation is intended to loosely approxi‐
              mate the quality provided by the JPEG v1 format. The default quality value 75 results in a request for 16:1 compression. The quality value 100 results in a request for non-lossy compression.

              For the MNG and PNG image formats, the quality value sets the zlib compression level (quality / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10). Compression levels range from 0 (fastest compression) to  100
              (best but slowest). For compression level 0, the Huffman-only strategy is used, which is fastest but not necessarily the worst compression.

              If filter-type is 4 or less, the specified filter-type is used for all scanlines:

                   0: none
                   1: sub
                   2: up
                   3: average
                   4: Paeth

              If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when quality is greater than 50 and the image does not have a color map, otherwise no filtering is used.

              If filter-type is 6, adaptive filtering with minimum-sum-of-absolute-values is used.

              Only if the output is MNG, if filter-type is 7, the LOCO color transformation and adaptive filtering with minimum-sum-of-absolute-values are used.

              The  default is quality is 75, which means nearly the best compression with adaptive filtering.  The quality setting has no effect on the appearance of PNG and MNG images, since the compression
              is always lossless.

              For further information, see the PNG specification.

              When writing a JNG image with transparency, two quality values are required, one for the main image and one for the grayscale image that conveys the opacity channel.  These  are  written  as  a
              single  integer  equal to the main image quality plus 1000 times the opacity quality.  For example, if you want to use quality 75 for the main image and quality 90 to compress the opacity data,
              use -quality 90075.

              For the PNM family of formats (PNM, PGM, and PPM) specify a quality factor of zero in order to obtain the ASCII variant of the format. Note that -compress none used to be used to trigger  ASCII
              output but provided the opposite result of what was expected as compared with other formats.

              For  the TIFF format, the JPEG, WebP, Zip, and Zstd compression algorithms are influenced by the quality value.  JPEG and WebP provide lossy compression so higher quality produces a larger file
              with less degradation.  The Zip and Zstd compression algorithms (and WebP in lossless mode) are lossless and for these algorithms a higher ´quality' means to work harder to  produce  a  smaller
              file, but with no difference in image quality.

       -raise <width>x<height>
              lighten or darken image edges

              This will create a 3-D effect. See -geometry for details details about the geometry specification. Offsets are not used.

              Use -raise to create a raised effect, otherwise use +raise.

       -random-threshold <channeltype> <LOWxHIGH>
              random threshold the image

              The  channel or channels specified in the <channeltype> argument are reduced to binary, using an random-threshold method. The choices for channeltype are All, Intensity, Red, Green, Blue, Cyan,
              Magenta, Yellow, Black, and Opacity

              When channeltype is "All", the color samples are thresholded into a graylevel and then that gray level is stored in the three color channels. Separately, the opacity channel is thresholded into
              a bilevel opacity value which is stored in the opacity channel. For each pixel, a new random number is used to establish the threshold to be used. The threshold never exceeds the specified max‐
              imum (HIGH) and is never less than the specified minimum (LOW).

              When channeltype is "intensity", only the color samples are thresholded. When channeltype is "opacity" or "matte", only the opacity channel is thresholded. The other named channels only thresh‐
              old the associated channel.

       -recolor <matrix>
              apply a color translation matrix to image channels

              A user supplied color translation matrix (expressed as a text string) is used to translate/blend the image channels based on weightings in a supplied matrix which may be of order 3 (color chan‐
              nels only), 4 (color channels plus opacity), or 5 (color channels plus opacity and offset).  Values in the columns of the matrix (red, green, blue, opacity) are used as multipliers with the ex‐
              isting  channel  values  and  added  together according to the rows of the matrix.  Matrix values are floating point and may be negative.  The offset column (column 5) is purely additive and is
              scaled such that 0.0 to 1.0 represents the maximum quantum range (but values are not limited to this range). The math for the color translation matrix is similar to that used by Adobe Flash ex‐
              cept that the offset is scaled to 1.0 (divide Flash offset by 255 for use with GraphicsMagick) so that the results are independent of quantum depth.

              An identity matrix exists for each matrix order which results in no change to the image.  The translation matrix should be based on an alteration of the identity matrix.

              Identity matrix of order 3

                1 0 0
                0 1 0
                0 0 1

              which may be formatted into a convenient matrix argument similar to (comma is treated as white space):

                -recolor "1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1"

              Identity matrix of order 4

                1 0 0 0
                0 1 0 0
                0 0 1 0
                0 0 0 1

              Identity matrix of order 5.  The last row is required to exist for the purpose of parsing, but is otherwise not used.

                1 0 0 0 0
                0 1 0 0 0
                0 0 1 0 0
                0 0 0 1 0
                0 0 0 0 1

              As an example, an image wrongly in BGR channel order may be converted to RGB using this matrix (blue->red, red->blue):

                0 0 1
                0 1 0
                1 0 0

              and an RGB image using standard Rec.709 primaries may be converted to grayscale using this matrix of standard weighting factors:

                0.2126 0.7152 0.0722
                0.2126 0.7152 0.0722
                0.2126 0.7152 0.0722

              and contrast may be reduced by scaling down by 80% and adding a 10% offset:

                0.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1
                0.0 0.8 0.0 0.0 0.1
                0.0 0.0 0.8 0.0 0.1
                0.0 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.1
                0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

       -red-primary <x>,<y>
              red chromaticity primary point

       -region <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>
              apply options to a portion of the image

              The x and y offsets are treated in the same manner as in -crop.

       -remote
              perform a X11 remote operation

              The -remote command sends a command to a "gm display" or "gm animate" which is already running. The only command recognized at this time is the name of an image file to load. This capability is
              very useful to load new images without needing to restart GraphicsMagick (e.g. for a slide-show or to use GraphicsMagick as the display engine for a different GUI). Also see the  +progress  op‐
              tion for a way to disable progress indication for a clean look while loading new images.

       -render
              render vector operations

              Use +render to turn off rendering vector operations. This is useful when saving the result to vector formats such as MVG or SVG.

       -repage  <width>x<height>+xoff+yoff[!]
              Adjust image page offsets

              Adjust the current image page canvas and position based on a relative page specification.  This option may be used to change the location of a subframe (e.g. part of an animation) prior to com‐
              position.  If the geometry specification is absolute (includes a '!'), then the offset adjustment is absolute and there is no adjustment to page width and height, otherwise the page  width  and
              height values are also adjusted based on the current image dimensions.  Use +repage to set the image page offsets to default.

       -resample <horizontal>x<vertical>
              Resample image to specified horizontal and vertical resolution

              Resize  the  image so that its rendered size remains the same as the original at the specified target resolution. Either the current image resolution units or the previously set with -units are
              used to interpret the argument. For example, if a 300 DPI image renders at 3 inches by 2 inches on a 300 DPI device, when the image has been resampled to 72 DPI, it will render at 3 inches by 2
              inches on a 72 DPI device.  Note that only a small number of image formats (e.g. JPEG, PNG, and TIFF) are capable of storing the image resolution. For formats which do not support an image res‐
              olution, the original resolution of the image must be specified via -density on the command line prior to specifying the resample resolution.

              Note that Photoshop stores and obtains image resolution from a proprietary embedded profile. If this profile exists in the image, then Photoshop will continue to treat the image using its  for‐
              mer resolution, ignoring the image resolution specified in the standard file header.

              Some  image formats (e.g. PNG) require use of metric or english units so even if the original image used a particular unit system, if it is saved to a different format prior to resampling, then
              it may be necessary to specify the desired resolution units using -units since the original units may have been lost. In other words, do not assume that the resolution units are restored if the
              image has been saved to a file.

       -resize <width>x<height>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}
              resize an image

              This is an alias for the -geometry option and it behaves in the same manner. If the -filter option precedes the -resize option, the specified filter is used.

              There are some exceptions:

              When used as a composite option, -resize conveys the preferred size of the output image, while -geometry conveys the size and placement of the composite image within the main image.

              When used as a montage option, -resize conveys the preferred size of the montage, while -geometry conveys information about the tiles.

       -roll {+-}<x>{+-}<y>
              roll an image vertically or horizontally

              See -geometry for details the geometry specification.  The x and y offsets are not affected by the -gravity option.

              A negative x offset rolls the image left-to-right. A negative y offset rolls the image top-to-bottom.

       -rotate <degrees>{<}{>}
              rotate the image

              Positive angles rotate the image in a clockwise direction while negative angles rotate counter-clockwise.

              Use  > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds the height.  < rotates the image only if its width is less than the height. For example, if you specify -rotate "-90>" and the image size is
              480x640, the image is not rotated.  However, if the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.  If you use > or <, enclose it in quotation marks to prevent it from being misinterpreted  as
              a file redirection.

              Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with the color defined as background (class backgroundColor).  The color is specified using the format described under the -fill op‐
              tion.

       -sample <geometry>
              scale image using pixel sampling

              See -geometry for details about the geometry specification.  -sample ignores the -filter selection if the -filter option is present.  Offsets, if present in the geometry  string,  are  ignored,
              and the -gravity option has no effect.

       -sampling-factor <horizontal_factor>x<vertical_factor>
              chroma subsampling factors

              This  option  specifies  the  sampling factors to be used by the DPX, JPEG, MPEG, or YUV encoders for chroma downsampling. The sampling factor must be specified while reading the raw YUV format
              since it is not preserved in the file header.  Industry-standard video subsampling notation such as "4:2:2" may also be used to specify the sampling factors. "4:2:2" is equivalent to a specifi‐
              cation of "2x1"

              The  JPEG  decoder  obtains the original sampling factors (and quality settings) when a JPEG file is read. To re-use the original sampling factors (and quality setting) when JPEG is output, use
              the -define jpeg:preserve-settings flag.

       -scale <geometry>
              scale the image.

              See -geometry for details about the geometry specification.  -scale uses a simpler, faster algorithm, and it ignores the -filter selection if the -filter option is present.  Offsets, if present
              in the geometry string, are ignored, and the -gravity option has no effect.

       -scene <value>
              set scene number

              This option sets the scene number of an image or the first image in an image sequence.

       -scenes <value-value>
              range of image scene numbers to read

              Each image in the range is read with the filename followed by a period (.) and the decimal scene number.  You can change this behavior by embedding a %d, %0Nd, %o, %0No, %x, or %0Nx printf for‐
              mat specification in the file name. For example,

                  gm montage -scenes 5-7 image.miff montage.miff

              makes a montage of files image.miff.5, image.miff.6, and image.miff.7, and

                  gm animate -scenes 0-12 image%02d.miff

              animates files image00.miff, image01.miff, through image12.miff.

       -screen
              specify the screen to capture

              This option indicates that the GetImage request used to obtain the image should be done on the root window, rather than directly on the specified window.  In this way, you can obtain pieces  of
              other windows that overlap the specified window, and more importantly, you can capture menus or other popups that are independent windows but appear over the specified window.

       -set <attribute> <value>
              set an image attribute

              Set a named image attribute.  The attribute is set on the current (previously specified on command line) image.

       +set <attribute>
              unset an image attribute

              Unset a named image attribute.  The attribute is removed from the current (previously specified on command line) image.

       -segment <cluster threshold>x<smoothing threshold>
              segment an image

              Segment an image by analyzing the histograms of the color components and identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means technique.

              Segmentation  is  a  very  useful  fast  and and approximate color quantization algorithm for scanned printed pages or scanned cartoons. It may also be used as a special effect. Specify cluster
              threshold as the minimum percentage of total pixels in a cluster before it is considered valid.  For huge images containing small detail, this may need to be a tiny fraction of a percent  (e.g.
              0.015) so that important detail is not lost.  Smoothing threshold eliminates noise in the second derivative of the histogram. As the value is increased, you can expect a smoother second deriva‐
              tive. The default is 1.5. Add the -verbose option to see a dump of cluster statistics given the parameters used. The statistics may be used as a guide to help fine tune the options.

       -shade <azimuth>x<elevation>
              shade the image using a distant light source

              Specify azimuth and elevation as the position of the light source. Use +shade to return the shading results as a grayscale image.

       -shadow <radius>{x<sigma>}
              shadow the montage

       -shared-memory
              use shared memory

              This option specifies whether the utility should attempt to use shared memory for pixmaps.  GraphicsMagick must be compiled with shared memory support, and the display must support the  MIT-SHM
              extension.  Otherwise, this option is ignored.  The default is True.

       -sharpen <radius>{x<sigma>}
              sharpen the image

              Use a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).

       -shave <width>x<height>{%}
              shave pixels from the image edges

              Specify the width of the region to be removed from both sides of the image and the height of the regions to be removed from top and bottom.

       -shear <x degrees>x<y degrees>
              shear the image along the X or Y axis

              Use the specified positive or negative shear angle.

              Shearing  slides one edge of an image along the X or Y axis, creating a parallelogram. An X direction shear slides an edge along the X axis, while a Y direction shear slides an edge along the Y
              axis. The amount of the shear is controlled by a shear angle. For X direction shears, x degrees is measured relative to the Y axis, and similarly, for Y direction shears y degrees  is  measured
              relative to the X axis.

              Empty triangles left over from shearing the image are filled with the color defined as background (class backgroundColor).  The color is specified using the format described under the -fill op‐
              tion.

       -silent
              operate silently

       -size <width>x<height>{+offset}
              width and height of the image

              Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose dimensions are unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK. In addition to width and height, use -size with  an  offset  to  skip  any
              header information in the image or tell the number of colors in a MAP image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).

              For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

                   192x128
                   384x256
                   768x512
                   1536x1024
                   3072x2048

              Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).

       -snaps <value>
              number of screen snapshots

              Use this option to grab more than one image from the X server screen, to create an animation sequence.

       -solarize <factor>
              negate all pixels above the threshold level

              Specify factor as the percent threshold of the intensity (0 - 99.9%).

              This option produces a solarization effect seen when exposing a photographic film to light during the development process.

       -spread <amount>
              displace image pixels by a random amount

              Amount defines the size of the neighborhood around each pixel to choose a candidate pixel to swap.

       -stegano <offset>
              hide watermark within an image

              Use  an  offset  to  start  the image hiding some number of pixels from the beginning of the image.  Note this offset and the image size.  You will need this information to recover the stegano‐
              graphic image (e.g. display -size 320x256+35 stegano:image.png).

       -stereo
              composite two images to create a stereo anaglyph

              The left side of the stereo pair is saved as the red channel of the output image.  The right side is saved as the green channel.  Red-green stereo glasses are  required  to  properly  view  the
              stereo image.

       -strip remove all profiles and text attributes from the image

              All embedded profiles and text attributes are stripped from the image.  This is useful for images used for the web, or when output files need to be as small as possible

              Be careful not to use this option to remove author, copyright, and license information that you are required to retain when redistributing an image.

       -stroke <color>
              color to use when stroking a graphic primitive

              The color is specified using the format described under the -fill option.

              See -draw for further details.

       -strokewidth <value>
              set the stroke width

              See -draw for further details.

       -swirl <degrees>
              swirl image pixels about the center

              Degrees defines the tightness of the swirl.

       -text-font <name>
              font for writing fixed-width text

              Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style) formatted text.  The default is 14 point Courier.

              You can tag a font to specify whether it is a PostScript, TrueType, or X11 font.  For example, Courier.ttf is a TrueType font and x:fixed is X11.

       -texture <filename>
              name of texture to tile onto the image background

       -threshold <value>{%}
              threshold the image

              Modify the image such that any pixel sample with an intensity value greater than the threshold is assigned the maximum intensity (white), or otherwise is assigned the minimum intensity (black).
              If a percent prefix is applied, then the threshold is a percentage of the available range.

              To efficiently create a black and white image from a color image, use

                  gm convert -threshold 50% in.png out.png

              The optimum threshold value depends on the nature of the image.  In order to threshold individual channels, use the -operator subcommand with it's Threshold, Threshold-White, or Threshold-Black
              options.

       -thumbnail <width>x<height>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}
              resize an image (quickly)

              The  -thumbnail  command  resizes  the image as quickly as possible, with more concern for speed than resulting image quality.  Regardless, resulting image quality should be acceptable for many
              uses.  It is primarily intended to be used to generate smaller versions of the image, but may also be used to enlarge the image.  The -thumbnail geometry argument observes the same  syntax  and
              rules as it does for -resize.

       -tile <filename>
              tile image when filling a graphic primitive

       -tile <geometry>
              layout of images [montage]

       -title <string>
              assign title to displayed image [animate, display, montage]

              Use this option to assign a specific title to the image. This is assigned to the image window and is typically displayed in the window title bar.  Optionally you can include the image filename,
              type, width, height, Exif data, or other image attribute by embedding special format characters described under the -format option.

              For example,

                   -title "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image title of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

       -transform
              transform the image

              This option applies the transformation matrix from a previous -affine option.

                  gm convert -affine 2,2,-2,2,0,0 -transform bird.ppm bird.jpg

       -transparent <color>
              make this color transparent within the image

              The color is specified using the format described under the -fill option.

       -treedepth <value>
              tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

              Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A value of zero or one causes the use of an optimal tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

              An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source image with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of memory.  However, the default depth  is  inappropriate
              for some images. To assure the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this parameter.  Refer to quantize for more details.

              The -colors or -monochrome option, or writing to an image format which requires color reduction, is required for this option to take effect.

       -trim  trim an image

              This option removes any edges that are exactly the same color as the corner pixels.  Use -fuzz to make -trim remove edges that are nearly the same color as the corner pixels.

       -type <type>
              the image type

              Choose from: Bilevel, Grayscale, Palette, PaletteMatte, TrueColor, TrueColorMatte, ColorSeparation, ColorSeparationMatte, or Optimize.

              Normally,  when  a format supports different subformats such as bilevel, grayscale, palette, truecolor, and truecolor+alpha, the encoder will try to choose a suitable subformat based on the na‐
              ture of the image. The -type option may be used to tailor the output subformat. By default the output subformat is based on readily available image information and is usually similar to the in‐
              put format.

              Specify  -type  Optimize  in  order to enable inspecting all pixels (if necessary) in order to find the most efficient subformat. Inspecting all of the pixels may be slow for very large images,
              particularly if they are stored in a disk cache. If an RGB image contains only gray pixels, then every pixel in the image must be inspected in  order  to  decide  that  the  image  is  actually
              grayscale!

              Sometimes a specific subformat is desired. For example, to force a JPEG image to be written in TrueColor RGB format even though only gray pixels are present, use

                  gm convert bird.pgm -type TrueColor bird.jpg

              Similarly, using -type TrueColorMatte will force the encoder to write an alpha channel even though the image is opaque, if the output format supports transparency.

              Some  pseudo-formats (e.g. the XC format) will respect the requested type if it occurs previously on the command line.  For example, to obtain a DirectClass solid color canvas image rather than
              PsuedoClass, use

                  gm convert -size 640x480 -type TrueColor xc:red red.miff

              Likewise, specify -type Bilevel, Grayscale, TrueColor, or TrueColorMatte prior to reading a Postscript (or PDF file) in order to influence the type of image  that  Ghostcript  returns.  Reading
              performance will be dramatically improved for black/white Postscript if Bilevel is specified, and will be considerably faster if Grayscale is specified.

       -update <seconds>
               detect when image file is modified and redisplay.

              Suppose  that while you are displaying an image the file that is currently displayed is over-written.  display will automatically detect that the input file has been changed and update the dis‐
              played image accordingly.

       -units <type>
              the units of image resolution

              Choose from: Undefined, PixelsPerInch, or PixelsPerCentimeter. This option is normally used in conjunction with the -density option.

       -unsharp <radius>{x<sigma>}{+<amount>}{+<threshold>}
              sharpen the image with an unsharp mask operator

              The -unsharp option sharpens an image. The image is convolved with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation (sigma). For reasonable results, radius should be  larger  than
              sigma. Use a radius of 0 to have the method select a suitable radius.

              The parameters are:

               radius

                    The radius of the Gaussian, in pixels, not counting the center pixel (default 0).

               sigma

                    The standard deviation of the Gaussian, in pixels (default 1.0).

               amount

                    The percentage of the difference between the original and the blur image that is added back into the original (default 1.0).

               threshold

                    The threshold, as a fraction of MaxRGB, needed to apply the difference amount (default 0.05).

       -use-pixmap
              use the pixmap

       -verbose
              print detailed information about the image

              This  information  is printed: image scene number; image name; image size; the image class (DirectClass or PseudoClass); the total number of unique colors; and the number of seconds to read and
              transform the image. If the image is DirectClass, the total number of unique colors is not displayed unless -verbose is specified twice since it may take quite a long time to compute,  particu‐
              larly for deep images.  If the image is PseudoClass then its pixels are defined by indexes into a colormap. If the image is DirectClass then each pixel includes a complete and independent color
              specification.

              If -colors is also specified, the total unique colors in the image and color reduction error values are printed. Refer to quantize for a description of these values.

       -version
              print GraphicsMagick version string

       -view <string>
              FlashPix viewing parameters

       -virtual-pixel <method>
              specify contents of "virtual pixels"

              This option defines "virtual pixels" for use in operations that can access pixels outside the boundaries of an image.

              Choose from these methods:

               Constant

                    Use the image background color.

               Edge

                    Extend the edge pixel toward infinity (default).

               Mirror

                    Mirror the image.

               Tile

                    Tile the image.

               This option affects operations that use virtual pixels such as -blur, -sharpen, -wave, etc.

       -visual <type>
              animate images using this X visual type

              Choose from these visual classes:

                   StaticGray
                   GrayScale
                   StaticColor
                   PseudoColor
                   TrueColor
                   DirectColor
                   default
                   visual id

              The X server must support the visual you choose, otherwise an error occurs.  If a visual is not specified, the visual class that can display the most simultaneous colors on the  default  screen
              is chosen.

       -watermark <brightness>x<saturation>
              percent brightness and saturation of a watermark

       -wave <amplitude>x<wavelength>
              alter an image along a sine wave

              Specify amplitude and wavelength of the wave.

       -white-point <x>,<y>
              chromaticity white point

       -white-threshold red[,green][,blue][,opacity]
              pixels above the threshold become white

              Use  -white-threshold to set pixels with values above the specified threshold to maximum value (white). If only one value is supplied, or the red, green, and blue values are identical, then in‐
              tensity thresholding is used. If the color threshold values are not identical then channel-based thresholding is used, and color distortion will occur. Specify a negative value (e.g. -1) if you
              want a channel to be ignored but you do want to threshold a channel later in the list. If a percent (%) symbol is appended, then the values are treated as a percentage of maximum range.

       -window <id>
              make image the background of a window

              id can be a window id or name.  Specify root to select X's root window as the target window.

              By  default the image is tiled onto the background of the target window.   If backdrop or -geometry are specified, the image is surrounded by the background color.  Refer to X RESOURCES for de‐
              tails.

              The image will not display on the root window if the image has more unique colors than the target window colormap allows.  Use -colors to reduce the number of colors.

       -window-group
              specify the window group

       -write <filename>
              write an intermediate image [convert, composite]

              The current image is written to the specified filename and then processing continues using that image. The following is an example of how several sizes of an image may be generated in one  com‐
              mand (repeat as often as needed):

                  gm convert input.jpg -resize 50% -write input50.jpg \
                            -resize 25% input25.jpg

       -write <filename>
              write the image to a file [display]

              If filename already exists, you will be prompted as to whether it should be overwritten.

              By default, the image is written in the format that it was read in as.  To specify a particular image format, prefix filename with the image type and a colon (e.g., ps:image) or specify the im‐
              age type as the filename suffix (e.g., image.ps). Specify file as - for standard output. If file has the extension .Z or .gz, the file size is compressed using compress  or  gzip  respectively.
              Precede the image file name with | to pipe to a system command.

              Use -compress to specify the type of image compression.

              The equivalent X resource for this option is writeFilename (class WriteFilename).  See "X Resources", below, for details.

ENVIRONMENT
       COLUMNS
              Output  screen  width.  Used when formatting text for the screen. Many Unix systems keep this shell variable up to date, but it may need to be explicitly exported in order for GraphicsMagick to
              see it.

       DISPLAY
              X11 display ID (host, display number, and screen in the form hostname:display.screen).

       HOME   Location of user's home directory. For security reasons, now only observed by "uninstalled" builds of GraphicsMagick which do not have their location hard-coded or set by  an  installer.   When
              supported,  GraphicsMagick  searches for configuration files in $HOME/.magick if the directory exists. See MAGICK_CODER_MODULE_PATH, MAGICK_CONFIGURE_PATH, and MAGICK_FILTER_MODULE_PATH if more
              flexibility is needed.

       MAGICK_ACCESS_MONITOR
              When set to TRUE, command line monitor mode (enabled by -monitor) will also show files accessed (including temporary files) and any external commands which are executed. This is useful for  de‐
              bugging, but also illustrates arguments made available to an access handler registered by the MagickSetConfirmAccessHandler() C library function.

       MAGICK_CODER_STABILITY
              The  minimum coder stability level before it will be used. The available levels are PRIMARY, STABLE, UNSTABLE, and BROKEN.  The default minimum level is UNSTABLE, which means that all available
              working coders will be used. The purpose of this option is to reduce the security exposure (or apparent complexity) due to the huge number of formats supported. Coders at the PRIMARY level  are
              commonly  used  formats with very well maintained implementations. Coders at the STABLE level are reasonably well maintained but represent less used formats. Coders at the UNSTABLE level either
              have weak implementations, the file format itself is weak, or the probability the coder will be needed is vanishingly small. Coders at the BROKEN level are known to often not work  properly  or
              might not be useful in their current state at all.

       MAGICK_CODER_MODULE_PATH
              Search path to use when searching for image format coder modules.  This path allows the user to arbitrarily extend the image formats supported by GraphicsMagick by adding loadable modules to an
              arbitrary location rather than copying them into the GraphicsMagick installation directory. The formatting of the search path is similar to operating system search paths (i.e.  colon  delimited
              for Unix, and semi-colon delimited for Microsoft Windows). This user specified search path is used before trying the default search path.

       MAGICK_CONFIGURE_PATH
              Search  path  to use when searching for configuration (.mgk) files.  The formatting of the search path is similar to operating system search paths (i.e. colon delimited for Unix, and semi-colon
              delimited for Microsoft Windows). This user specified search path is used before trying the default search path.

       MAGICK_DEBUG
              Debug options (see -debug for details).  Setting the configure debug option via an environment variable (e.g. MAGICK_DEBUG=configure) is necessary to see the  complete  initialization  process,
              which includes searching for configuration files.

       MAGICK_FILTER_MODULE_PATH
              Search  path  to  use when searching for filter process modules (invoked via -process). This path allows the user to arbitrarily extend GraphicsMagick's image processing functionality by adding
              loadable modules to an arbitrary location rather than copying them into the GraphicsMagick installation directory. The formatting of the search path is similar to operating system search  paths
              (i.e. colon delimited for Unix, and semi-colon delimited for Microsoft Windows). This user specified search path is used before trying the default search path.

       MAGICK_GHOSTSCRIPT_PATH
              For  Microsoft  Windows,  specify the path to the Ghostscript installation rather than searching for it via the Windows registry.  This helps in case Ghostscript is not installed via the Ghost‐
              script Windows installer or the user wants more control over the Ghostscript used.

       MAGICK_HOME
              Path to top of GraphicsMagick installation directory. Only observed by "uninstalled" builds of GraphicsMagick which do not have their location hard-coded or set by an installer.

       MAGICK_MMAP_READ
              If MAGICK_MMAP_READ is set to TRUE, GraphicsMagick will attempt to memory-map the input file for reading. This usually substantially improves repeated read performance since the file is already
              in  memory after the first time it has been read. However, testing shows that performance may be reduced for files accessed for the first time since data is accessed via page-faults (upon first
              access) and many operating systems fail to do sequential read-ahead of memory mapped files, and particularly if those files are accessed over a network.  If many large  input  files  are  read,
              then enabling this option may harm performance by overloading the operating system's VM system as it then needs to free unmapped pages and map new ones.

       MAGICK_IO_FSYNC
              If  MAGICK_IO_FSYNC is set to TRUE, then GraphicsMagick will request that the output file is fully flushed and synchronized to disk when it is closed. This incurs a performance penalty, but has
              the benefit that if the power fails or the system crashes, the file should be valid on disk. If image files are referenced from a database, then this option helps assure that the  files  refer‐
              enced by the database are valid.

       MAGICK_IOBUF_SIZE
              The  amount of I/O buffering (in bytes) to use when reading and writing encoded files. The default is 16384, which is observed to work well for many cases. The best value for a local filesystem
              is usually the the native filesystem block size (e.g. 4096, 8192, or even 131,072 for ZFS) in order to minimize the number of physical disk I/O operations.  I/O performance  to  files  accessed
              over  a  network  may  benefit significantly by tuning this option. Larger values are not necessarily better (they may be slower!), and there is rarely any benefit from using values larger than
              32768. Use convert's -verbose option in order to evaluate read and write rates in pixels per second while keeping in mind that the operating system will try to cache files in RAM.

       MAGICK_LIMIT_DISK
              Maximum amount of disk space allowed for use by the pixel cache.

       MAGICK_LIMIT_FILES
              Maximum number of open files.

       MAGICK_LIMIT_MAP
              Maximum size of a memory mapped file allocation.  A memory mapped file consumes memory when the file is accessed, although the system may reclaim such memory when needed.

       MAGICK_LIMIT_MEMORY
              Maximum amount of memory to allocate from the heap.

       MAGICK_LIMIT_PIXELS
              Maximum number of total pixels (image rows times image colums) to allow for any image which is requested to be created or read.  This is useful to place a limit on how large an  image  may  be.
              If  the  input  image file has image dimensions larger than the pixel limit, then the image memory allocation is denied and an error is returned immediately.  This is a per-image limit and does
              not limit the total number of pixels due to multiple image frames/pages (e.g. multi-page document or an animation).

       MAGICK_LIMIT_WIDTH
              Maximum pixel width of an image read, or created.

       MAGICK_LIMIT_HEIGHT
              Maximum pixel height of an image read, or created.

       MAGICK_TMPDIR
              Path to directory where GraphicsMagick should write temporary files. The default is to use the system default, or the location set by TMPDIR.

       TMPDIR For POSIX-compatible systems (Unix-compatible), the path to the directory where all applications should write temporary files.  Overridden by MAGICK_TMPDIR if it is set.

       TMP or TEMP
              For Microsoft Windows, the path to the directory where applications should write temporary files. Overridden by MAGICK_TMPDIR if it is set.

       OMP_NUM_THREADS
              As per the OpenMP standard, this specifies the number of threads to use in parallel regions. Some compilers default the number of threads to use to the number of processor cores available while
              others default to just one thread. See the OpenMP specification for other standard adjustments and your compiler's manual for vendor-specific settings.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       GraphicsMagick uses a number of XML format configuration files:

       colors.mgk
              colors configuration file

                <?xml version="1.0"?>

GM ANIMATE
       Animate  displays a sequence of images on any workstation display running an X server. animate first determines the hardware capabilities of the workstation. If the number of unique colors in an image
       is less than or equal to the number the workstation can support, the image is displayed in an X window. Otherwise the number of colors in the image is first reduced to match the  color  resolution  of
       the workstation before it is displayed.

       This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-pixel image can display on a 8 bit pseudo-color device or monochrome device. In most instances the reduced color image closely resembles the original. Al‐
       ternatively, a monochrome or pseudo-color image sequence can display on a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-pixel device.

       To help prevent color flashing on X server visuals that have colormaps, animate creates a single colormap from the image sequence. This can be rather time consuming. You can speed this operation up by
       reducing  the colors in the image before you "animate" them. Use mogrify to color reduce the images to a single colormap. See mogrify(1) for details. Alternatively, you can use a Standard Colormap; or
       a static, direct, or true color visual.  You can define a Standard Colormap with xstdcmap. See xstdcmap(1) for details. This method is recommended for colormapped X server because  it  eliminates  the
       need to compute a global colormap.

EXAMPLES
       To animate a set of images of a cockatoo, use:

           gm animate cockatoo.*

       To animate a cockatoo image sequence while using the Standard Colormap best, use:

           xstdcmap -best
           gm animate -map best cockatoo.*

       To animate an image of a cockatoo without a border centered on a backdrop, use:

           gm animate +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.*

              Any  option you specify on the command line remains in effect for the group of images following it, until the group is terminated by the appearance of any option or -noop.  For example, to ani‐
              mate three images, the first with 32 colors, the second with an unlimited number of colors, and the third with only 16 colors, use:

                  gm animate -colors 32 cockatoo.1 -noop cockatoo.2
                           -colors 16 cockatoo.3

              Animate options can appear on the command line or in your X resources file. See X(1). Options on the command line supersede values specified in your X resources file.  Image filenames  may  ap‐
              pear  in  any order on the command line if the image format is MIFF (refer to miff(5) and the scene keyword is specified in the image. Otherwise the images will display in the order they appear
              on the command line.

X RESOURCES
       Animate options can appear on the command line or in your X resource file. Options on the command line supersede values specified in your X resource file. See X(1) for more information on X resources.

       All animate options have a corresponding X resource. In addition, the animate program uses the following X resources:

               background (class Background)

                    Specifies the preferred color to use for the Image window background. The default is #ccc.
               borderColor (class BorderColor)

                    Specifies the preferred color to use for the Image window border. The default is #ccc.
               borderWidth (class BorderWidth)

                    Specifies the width in pixels of the Image window border. The default is 2.
               font (class Font or FontList)

                    Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in normal formatted text.  The default is 14 point Helvetica.
               foreground (class Foreground)

                    Specifies the preferred color to use for text within the Image window.  The default is black.
               geometry (class geometry)

                    Specifies  the  preferred size and position of the image window. It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.  Offsets, if present, are handled in X(1) style.  A negative x offset
                    is measured from the right edge of the screen to the right edge of the icon, and a negative y offset is measured from the bottom edge of the screen to the bottom edge of the icon.
               iconGeometry (class IconGeometry)

                    Specifies the preferred size and position of the application when iconified.  It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.  Offsets, if present, are handled in the same manner  as
                    in class Geometry.
               iconic (class Iconic)

                    This resource indicates that you would prefer that the application's windows initially not be visible as if the windows had be immediately iconified by you. Window managers may choose not
                    to honor the application's request.
               matteColor (class MatteColor)

                    Specify the color of windows. It is used for the backgrounds of windows, menus, and notices. A 3D effect is achieved by using highlight and shadow colors derived from this color.  Default
                    value: #ddd.
               name (class Name)

                    This  resource specifies the name under which resources for the application should be found. This resource is useful in shell aliases to distinguish between invocations of an application,
                    without resorting to creating links to alter the executable file name. The default is the application name.
               sharedMemory (class SharedMemory)

                    This resource specifies whether animate should attempt use shared memory for pixmaps. ImageMagick must be compiled with shared memory support, and the display must support the MIT-SHM ex‐
                    tension. Otherwise, this resource is ignored. The default is True.
               text_font (class textFont)

                    Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style) formatted text. The default is 14 point Courier.
               title (class Title)

                    This  resource  specifies  the title to be used for the Image window. This information is sometimes used by a window manager to provide some sort of header identifying the window. The de‐
                    fault is the image file name.

GM BATCH
DESCRIPTION
       batch executes an arbitary number of the utility commands (e.g. convert) in the form of a simple linear batch script in order to improve execution efficiency, and/or to allow use as a subordinate  co-
       process under the control of an arbitrary script or program.

EXAMPLES
        To  drive  'gm  batch'  using a shell script (or a program written in any language), have the script/program send commands to 'gm batch' via its standard input.  Specify that standard input should be
       used by using '-' as the file name.  The following example converts all files matching '*.jpg' to TIFF format while rotating each file by 90 degrees and stripping all  embedded  profiles.   The  shell
       script syntax is standard Unix shell:

         for file in *.jpg
         do
           outfile=`basename $file .jpg`.tiff
           echo convert -verbose "'$file'" -rotate 90 \
           +profile "'*'" "'$outfile'"
         done | gm batch -echo on -feedback on -

       We can accomplish the same as the previous example by putting all the commands in a text file and then specifying the name of the text file as the script to execute:

         for file in *.jpg
         do
           outfile=`basename $file .jpg`.tiff
           echo convert -verbose "'$file'" -rotate 90 \
           +profile "'*'" "'$outfile'"
         done > script.txt
         gm batch -echo on -feedback on script.txt

OPTIONS
       Options are processed from left to right and must appear before any filename argument.

       -echo on|off
              command echo on or off

              Specify on to enable echoing commands to standard output as they are read or off to disable.  The default is off.

       -escape unix|windows
              Parse using unix or windows syntax

              Commands  must be parsed from the input stream and escaping needs to be used to protect spaces or quoting characters in the input. Specify unix to use unix-style command line parsing or windows
              for Microsoft Windows command shell style parsing. The default depends on if the software is compiled for Microsoft Windows or for a Unix-type system (including Cygwin  on  Microsoft  Windows).
              It is recommended to use unix syntax because it is more powerful and more portable.

       -fail text
              text to print if a command fails

              When feedback is enabled, this specifies the text to print when the command fails.  The default text is FAIL.

       -feedback on|off
              enable error feedback

              Print text (see -pass and -fail options) feedback after each command to indicate the result, the default is off.

       -help

              Prints batch command help.

       -pass text
              text to print if a command passes

              When feedback is enabled, this specifies the text to print when the command passes.  The default text is PASS.

       -prompt text
              Prompt text to use for command line

              If  no  filename  argument was specified, a simple command prompt appears where you may enter GraphicsMagick commands.  The default prompt is GM>.  Use this option to change the prompt to some‐
              thing else.

       -stop-on-error on|off
              Specify if command processing stops on error

              Normally command processing continues if a command encounters an error.  Specify -stop-on-error on to cause processing to quit immediately on error.

GM BENCHMARK
DESCRIPTION
       benchmark executes an arbitrary gm utility command (e.g. convert) for one or more loops, and/or a specified execution time, and reports many execution metrics.  For builds using OpenMP, a mode is pro‐
       vided  to execute the benchmark with an increasing number of threads and provide a report of speedup and multi-thread execution efficiency.  If benchmark is used to execute a command without any addi‐
       tional benchmark options, then the command is run once.

EXAMPLES
       To obtain benchmark information for a single execution of a command:

           gm benchmark convert input.ppm -gaussian 0x1 output.ppm

       To obtain benchmark information from 100 iterations of the command:

           gm benchmark -iterations 100 convert input.ppm \
             -gaussian 0x1 output.ppm

       To obtain benchmark information by iterating the command until a specified amount of time (in seconds) has been consumed:

           gm benchmark -duration 30 convert input.ppm \
             -gaussian 0x1 output.ppm

       To obtain a full performance report with an increasing number of threads (1-32 threads, stepping the number of threads by four each time):

           gm benchmark -duration 3 -stepthreads 4 convert \
             input.ppm -gaussian 0x2 output.ppm

       Here is the interpretation of the output:

           threads - number of threads used.
           iter - number of command iterations executed.
           user - total user time consumed.
           total - total elapsed time consumed.
           iter/s - number of command iterations per second.
           iter/cpu - amount of CPU time consumed per iteration.
           speedup - speedup compared with one thread.
           karp-flatt - Karp-Flatt measure of speedup efficiency.

       Please note that the reported "speedup" is based on the execution time of just one thread.  A preliminary warm-up pass is used before timing the first loop in order to ensure that the CPU  is  brought
       out of power-saving modes and that system caches are warmed up.  Most modern CPUs provide a "turbo" mode where the CPU clock speed is increased (e.g. by a factor of two) when only one or two cores are
       active.  If the CPU grows excessively hot (due to insufficient cooling), then it may dial back its clock rates as a form of thermal management.  These factors result in an under-reporting  of  speedup
       compared  to  if "turbo" mode was disabled and the CPU does not need to worry about thermal management.  The powertop utility available under Linux and Solaris provides a way to observe CPU core clock
       rates while a benchmark is running.

OPTIONS
        Options are processed from left to right and must appear before any argument.

       -duration duration
              duration to run benchmark Specify the number of seconds to run the benchmark. The command is executed repeatedly until the specified amount of time has elapsed.

       -help

              Prints benchmark command help.

       -iterations loops
              number of command iterations Specify the number of iterations to run the benchmark. The command is executed repeatedly until the specified number of iterations has been reached.

       -rawcsv
              Print results in CSV format Print results in a comma-separated value (CSV) format which is easy to parse for plotting or importing into a spreadsheet  or  database.   The  values  reported  are
              threads, iterations, user_time, and elapsed_time.

       -stepthreads step
              execute a per-thread benchmark ramp
               Execute  a per-thread benchmark ramp, incrementing the number of threads at each step by the specified value.  The maximum number of threads is taken from the standard OMP_NUM_THREADS environ‐
              ment variable.

GM COMPARE
       compare compares two similar images using a specified statistical method (see -metric) and/or by writing a difference image (-file), with the altered pixels annotated using  a  specified  method  (see
       -highlight-style) and color (see -highlight-color). Reference-image is the original image and compare-image is the (possibly) altered version, which should have the same dimensions as reference-image.

EXAMPLES
       To compare two images using Mean Square Error (MSE) statistical analysis use:

           gm compare -metric mse original.miff compare.miff

       To create an annotated difference image use:

           gm compare -highlight-style assign -highlight-color purple \
             -file diff.miff original.miff compare.miff

OPTIONS
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect only for the image that follows.  All options are reset to their default values after each im‐
       age is read.

GM COMPOSITE
       composite composites (combines) images to create new images.  base-image is the base image and change-image contains the changes.  ouput-image is the result, and normally has the  same  dimensions  as
       base-image.

       The optional mask-image can be used to provide opacity information for change-image when it has none or if you want a different mask.  A mask image is typically grayscale and the same size as base-im‐
       age. If mask-image is not grayscale, it is converted to grayscale and the resulting intensities are used as opacity information.

EXAMPLES
       To composite an image of a cockatoo with a perch, use:

           gm composite cockatoo.miff perch.ras composite.miff

       To compute the difference between images in a series, use:

           gm composite -compose difference series.2 series.1
                     difference.miff

       To composite an image of a cockatoo with a perch starting at location (100,150), use:

           gm composite -geometry +100+150 cockatoo.miff
                     perch.ras composite.miff

       To tile a logo across your image of a cockatoo, use

           gm convert +shade 30x60 cockatoo.miff mask.miff
           gm composite -compose bumpmap -tile logo.png
                     cockatoo.miff mask.miff composite.miff

       To composite a red, green, and blue color plane into a single composite image, try

           gm composite -compose CopyGreen green.png red.png
                     red-green.png
           gm composite -compose CopyBlue blue.png red-green.png
                     gm composite.png

GM CONJURE
       The  Magick  scripting  language  (MSL) will primarily benefit those that want to accomplish custom image processing tasks but do not wish to program, or those that do not have access to a Perl inter‐
       preter or a compiler.  The interpreter is called conjure and here is an example script:

           <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
           <image size="400x400" >
             <read filename="image.gif" />
             <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
             <resize geometry="%[dimensions]" />
             <get width="width" height="height" />
             <print output=
               "Image sized from %[base-width]x%[base-height]
                to %[width]x%[height].\n" />
             <write filename="image.png" />
           </image>

       invoked with

           gm conjure -dimensions 400x400 incantation.msl

       All operations will closely follow the key/value pairs defined in PerlMagick, unless otherwise noted.

OPTIONS
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect,  or  if
       it is changed by a statement in the scripting language.

       You  can  define  your  own  keyword/value pairs on the command line.  The script can then use this information when setting values by including %[keyword] in the string.  For example, if you included
       "-dimensions 400x400" on the command line, as illustrated above, then any string containing "%[dimensions]" would have 400x400 substituted.  The "%[string]" can be used either an entire  string,  such
       as geometry="%[dimensions]" or as a part of a string such as filename="%[basename].png".

       The keyword can be any string except for the following reserved strings (in any upper, lower, or mixed case variant): debug, help, and verbose, whose usage is described below.

       The  value can be any string.  If either the keyword or the value contains white space or any symbols that have special meanings to your shell such as "#", "|", or "%", enclose the string in quotation
       marks or use "\" to escape the white space and special symbols.

       Keywords and values are case dependent.  "Key", "key", and "KEY" would be three different keywords.

       For a more detailed description of each option, see Options, above.

       -debug <events>
              enable debug printout

       -define <key>{=<value>},...
              add coder/decoder specific options

       -help  print usage instructions

       -log <string>
              Specify format for debug log

       -verbose
              print detailed information about the image

       -version
              print GraphicsMagick version string

MAGICK SCRIPTING LANGUAGE
       The Magick Scripting Language (MSL) presently defines the following elements and their attributes:

               <image>

                    background, color, id, size

                    Define a new image object.  </image> destroys it. Because of this, if you wish to reference multiple "subimages" (aka pages or layers), you can embed one image element inside of  another.
                    For example:

                        <image>
                        <read filename="input.png" />
                        <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
                        <image height="base-height" width="base-width">
                        <image />
                        <write filename="output.mng" />
                        </image>

                        <image size="400x400" />

               <group>

                    Define a new group of image objects.  By default, images are only valid for the life of their <image>element.

                        <image>   -- creates the image
                        .....     -- do stuff with it
                        </image>  -- dispose of the image

                    However, in a group, all images in that group will stay around for the life of the group:

                        <group>                           -- start a group
                            <image>                       -- create an image
                            ....                          -- do stuff
                            </image>                      -- NOOP
                            <image>                       -- create another image
                            ....                          -- do more stuff
                            </image>                      -- NOOP
                            <write filename="image.mng" />  -- output
                        </group>                          -- dispose of both images

               <read>

                        filename

                    Read a new image from a disk file.

                        <read filename="image.gif" />

                    To read two images use

                        <read filename="image.gif" />
                        <read filename="image.png />

               <write>

                        filename
                    Write the image(s) to disk, either as a single multiple-image file or multiple ones if necessary.

                         <write filename=image.tiff" />

               <get>

                    Get any attribute recognized by PerlMagick's GetAttribute() and stores it as an image attribute for later use. Currently only width and height are supported.

                        <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
                        <print output="Image size is %[base-width]x%[base-height].\n" />

               <set>

                    background, bordercolor, clip-mask, colorspace, density, magick, mattecolor, opacity.  Set an attribute recognized by PerlMagick's GetAttribute().
               <profile>

                        [profilename]

                    Read one or more IPTC, ICC or generic profiles from file and assign to image

                        <profile iptc="profile.iptc" generic="generic.dat" />

                    To remove a specified profile use "!" as the filename eg

                        <profile icm="!" iptc="profile.iptc" />

GM CONVERT
       Convert converts an input file using one image format to an output file with a differing image format. In addition, various types of image processing can be performed on the converted image during the
       conversion process. Convert recognizes the image formats listed in GraphicsMagick(1).

EXAMPLES
       To make a thumbnail of a JPEG image, use:

           gm convert -size 120x120 cockatoo.jpg -resize 120x120
                   +profile "*" thumbnail.jpg

       In this example, '-size 120x120' gives a hint to the JPEG decoder that the image is going to be downscaled to 120x120, allowing it to run faster by avoiding returning full-resolution images to  Graph‐
       icsMagick  for the subsequent resizing operation.  The ´-resize 120x120' specifies the desired dimensions of the output image.  It will be scaled so its largest dimension is 120 pixels.  The ´+profile
       "*"' removes any ICM, EXIF, IPTC, or other profiles that might be present in the input and aren't needed in the thumbnail.

       To convert a MIFF image of a cockatoo to a SUN raster image, use:

           gm convert cockatoo.miff sun:cockatoo.ras

       To convert a multi-page PostScript document to individual FAX pages, use:

           gm convert -monochrome document.ps fax:page

       To convert a TIFF image to a PostScript A4 page with the image in the lower left-hand corner, use:

           gm convert -page A4+0+0 image.tiff document.ps

       To convert a raw Gray image with a 128 byte header to a portable graymap, use:

           gm convert -depth 8 -size 768x512+128 gray:raw
                   image.pgm

       In this example, "raw" is the input file.  Its format is "gray" and it has the dimensions and number of header bytes specified by the -size option and the sample depth specified by the -depth  option.
       The output file is "image.pgm".  The suffix ".pgm" specifies its format.

       To convert a Photo CD image to a TIFF image, use:

           gm convert -size 1536x1024 img0009.pcd image.tiff
           gm convert img0009.pcd[4] image.tiff

       To create a visual image directory of all your JPEG images, use:

           gm convert 'vid:*.jpg' directory.miff

       To annotate an image with blue text using font 12x24 at position (100,100), use:

           gm convert -font helvetica -fill blue
                   -draw "text 100,100 Cockatoo"
                   bird.jpg bird.miff

       To tile a 640x480 image with a JPEG texture with bumps use:

           gm convert -size 640x480 tile:bumps.jpg tiled.png

       To surround an icon with an ornamental border to use with Mosaic(1), use:

           gm convert -mattecolor "#697B8F" -frame 6x6 bird.jpg
                   icon.png

       To create a MNG animation from a DNA molecule sequence, use:

           gm convert -delay 20 dna.* dna.mng

OPTIONS
       Options  are  processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect for the set of images that follows, until the set is terminated by the appearance of any op‐
       tion or -noop.  Some options only affect the decoding of images and others only the encoding.  The latter can appear after the final group of input images.

       For a more detailed description of each option, see Options, above.

GM DISPLAY
       Display is a machine architecture independent image processing and display program. It can display an image on any workstation screen running an X server. Display can read and write many of  the  more
       popular image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNM, Photo CD, etc.).

       With display, you can perform these functions on an image:

                o  load an image from a file
                o  display the next image
                o  display the former image
                o  display a sequence of images as a slide show
                o  write the image to a file
                o  print the image to a PostScript printer
                o  delete the image file
                o  create a Visual Image Directory
                o  select the image to display by its thumbnail rather than name
                o  undo last image transformation
                o  copy a region of the image
                o  paste a region to the image
                o  restore the image to its original size
                o  refresh the image
                o  half the image size
                o  double the image size
                o  resize the image
                o  crop the image
                o  cut the image
                o  flop image in the horizontal direction
                o  flip image in the vertical direction
                o  rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise
                o  rotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
                o  rotate the image
                o  shear the image
                o  roll the image
                o  trim the image edges
                o  invert the colors of the image
                o  vary the color brightness
                o  vary the color saturation
                o  vary the image hue
                o  gamma correct the image
                o  sharpen the image contrast
                o  dull the image contrast
                o  perform histogram equalization on the image
                o  perform histogram normalization on the image
                o  negate the image colors
                o  convert the image to grayscale
                o  set the maximum number of unique colors in the image
                o  reduce the speckles within an image
                o  eliminate peak noise from an image
                o  detect edges within the image
                o  emboss an image
                o  segment the image by color
                o  simulate an oil painting
                o  simulate a charcoal drawing
                o  annotate the image with text
                o  draw on the image
                o  edit an image pixel color
                o  edit the image matte information
                o  composite an image with another
                o  add a border to the image
                o  surround image with an ornamental border
                o  apply image processing techniques to a region of interest
                o  display information about the image
                o  zoom a portion of the image
                o  show a histogram of the image
                o  display image to background of a window
                o  set user preferences
                o  display information about this program
                o  discard all images and exit program
                o  change the level of magnification
                o  display images specified by a World Wide Web (WWW) uniform resource locator (URL)

EXAMPLES
       To scale an image of a cockatoo to exactly 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height and position the window at location (200,200), use:

           gm display -geometry 640x480+200+200! cockatoo.miff

       To display an image of a cockatoo without a border centered on a backdrop, use:

           gm display +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.miff

       To tile a slate texture onto the root window, use:

           gm display -size 1280x1024 -window root slate.png

       To display a visual image directory of all your JPEG images, use:

           gm display 'vid:*.jpg'

       To display a MAP image that is 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height with 256 colors, use:

           gm display -size 640x480+256 cockatoo.map

       To display an image of a cockatoo specified with a World Wide Web (WWW) uniform resource locator (URL), use:

           gm display ftp://wizards.dupont.com/images/cockatoo.jpg

       To display histogram of an image, use:

           gm gm convert file.jpg HISTOGRAM:- | gm display -

OPTIONS
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect. For ex‐
       ample to display three images, the first with 32 colors, the second with an unlimited number of colors, and the third with only 16 colors, use:

           gm display -colors 32 cockatoo.miff -noop duck.miff
                        -colors 16 macaw.miff

       Display options can appear on the command line or in your X resources file. See X(1). Options on the command line supersede values specified in your X resources file.

       Menu  items with a indented triangle have a sub-menu. They are represented above as the indented items. To access a sub-menu item, move the pointer to the appropriate menu and press button 1 and drag.
       When you find the desired sub-menu item, release the button and the command is executed.  Move the pointer away from the sub-menu if you decide not to execute a particular command.

KEYBOARD ACCELERATORS
       Accelerators are one or two key presses that effect a particular command.  The keyboard accelerators that display understands is:

           Ctl+O     Press to load an image from a file.
           space     Press to display the next image.

       If the image is a multi-paged document such as a PostScript document, you can skip ahead several pages by preceding this command with a number.  For example to display the fourth page beyond the  cur‐
       rent page, press 4space.

           backspace Press to display the former image.

       If  the  image is a multi-paged document such as a PostScript document, you can skip behind several pages by preceding this command with a number.  For example to display the fourth page preceding the
       current page, press 4n.

           Ctl-S    Press to save the image to a file.
           Ctl-P    Press to print the image to a
                    PostScript printer.

                    the image.
           Ctl-C    Press to copy a region of
                    the image.
           Ctl-V    Press to paste a region to
                    the image.
           <        Press to halve the image size.
           .        Press to return to the original image size.

                    you specify.
           Cmd-A    Press to make any image transformations
                    permanent.
                    By default, any image size transformations are
                    applied to the original image to create the
                    image displayed on the X server.  However, the
                    transformations are not permanent (i.e. the
                    original image does not change size only the
                    X image does). For example, if you press ">"
                    the X image will appear to double in size, but
                    the original image will in fact remain the same
                    size.  To force the original image to double in
                    size, press ">" followed by "Cmd-A".

X RESOURCES
       Display options can appear on the command line or in your X resource file. Options on the command line supersede values specified in your X resource file. See X(1) for more information on X resources.

       Most display options have a corresponding X resource. In addition, display uses the following X resources:

       background (class Background)
               Specifies the preferred color to use for the Image window background. The default is #ccc.

       borderColor (class BorderColor)
               Specifies the preferred color to use for the Image window border. The default is #ccc.

       borderWidth (class BorderWidth)
               Specifies the width in pixels of the image window border. The default is 2.

       browseCommand (class browseCommand)
               Specifies the name of the preferred browser when displaying GraphicsMagick documentation. The default is netscape %s.

       confirmExit (class ConfirmExit)
               Display pops up a dialog box to confirm exiting the program when exiting the program. Set this resource to False to exit without a confirmation.

       displayGamma (class DisplayGamma)
               Specifies the gamma of the X server.  You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue channels of the image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes (i.e.  1.7/2.3/1.2).
              The default is 2.2.

       displayWarnings (class DisplayWarnings)
               Display pops up a dialog box whenever a warning message occurs.  Set this resource to False to ignore warning messages.

       font (class FontList)
               Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in normal formatted text.  The default is 14 point Helvetica.

       font[1-9] (class Font[1-9])
               Specifies the name of the preferred font to use when annotating the image window with text. The default fonts are fixed, variable, 5x8, 6x10, 7x13bold, 8x13bold, 9x15bold, 10x20, and 12x24.

       foreground (class Foreground)
               Specifies the preferred color to use for text within the image window.  The default is black.

       gammaCorrect (class gammaCorrect)
               This resource, if true, will lighten or darken an image of known gamma to match the gamma of the display (see resource displayGamma). The default is True.

       geometry (class Geometry)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the image window. It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.

              Offsets,  if  present,  are handled in X(1) style.  A negative x offset is measured from the right edge of the screen to the right edge of the icon, and a negative y offset is measured from the
              bottom edge of the screen to the bottom edge of the icon.

       iconGeometry (class IconGeometry)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the application when iconified.  It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.

              Offsets, if present, are handled in the same manner as in class Geometry.

       iconic (class Iconic)
               This resource indicates that you would prefer that the application's windows initially not be visible as if the windows had be immediately iconified by you. Window managers may choose  not  to
              honor the application's request.

       magnify (class Magnify)
               specifies an integral factor by which the image should be enlarged. The default is 3.  This value only affects the magnification window which is invoked with button number 3 after the image is
              displayed.

       matteColor (class MatteColor)
               Specify the color of windows. It is used for the backgrounds of windows, menus, and notices. A 3D effect is achieved by using highlight and shadow  colors  derived  from  this  color.  Default
              value: #697B8F.

       name (class Name)
               This resource specifies the name under which resources for the application should be found. This resource is useful in shell aliases to distinguish between invocations of an application, with‐
              out resorting to creating links to alter the executable file name. The default is the application name.

       pen[1-9] (class Pen[1-9])
               Specifies the color of the preferred font to use when annotating the image window with text. The default colors are black, blue, green, cyan, gray, red, magenta, yellow, and white.

       printCommand (class PrintCommand)
               This command is executed whenever Print is issued.  In general, it is the command to print PostScript to your printer. Default value: lp -c -s %i.

       sharedMemory (class SharedMemory)
               This resource specifies whether display should attempt use shared memory for pixmaps. GraphicsMagick must be compiled with shared memory support, and the display must support the  MIT-SHM  ex‐
              tension. Otherwise, this resource is ignored. The default is True.

       textFont (class textFont)
               Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style) formatted text. The default is 14 point Courier.

       title (class Title)
                This  resource specifies the title to be used for the image window. This information is sometimes used by a window manager to provide a header identifying the window. The default is the image
              file name.

       undoCache (class UndoCache)
               Specifies, in mega-bytes, the amount of memory in the undo edit cache.  Each time you modify the image it is saved in the undo edit cache as long as memory is available. You  can  subsequently
              undo one or more of these transformations. The default is 16 Megabytes.

       usePixmap (class UsePixmap)
               Images are maintained as a XImage by default. Set this resource to True to utilize a server Pixmap instead. This option is useful if your image exceeds the dimensions of your server screen and
              you intend to pan the image. Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a XImage. Pixmaps are considered a precious resource, use them with discretion.

              To set the geometry of the Magnify or Pan or window, use the geometry resource.  For example, to set the Pan window geometry to 256x256, use:

                  gm display.pan.geometry: 256x256

IMAGE LOADING
       To select an image to display, choose Open of the File sub-menu from the Command widget. A file browser is displayed.  To choose a particular image file, move the pointer to the filename and press any
       button.  The  filename  is  copied  to the text window. Next, press Open or press the RETURN key. Alternatively, you can type the image file name directly into the text window. To descend directories,
       choose a directory name and press the button twice quickly. A scrollbar allows a large list of filenames to be moved through the viewing area if it exceeds the size of the list area.

       You can trim the list of file names by using shell globbing characters.  For example, type *.jpg to list only files that end with .jpg.

       To select your image from the X server screen instead of from a file, Choose Grab of the Open widget.

VISUAL IMAGE DIRECTORY
       To create a Visual Image Directory, choose Visual Directory of the File sub-menu from the Command widget . A file browser is displayed. To create a Visual Image Directory from all the  images  in  the

       Choose  a  composite operation from the Operators sub-menu of the Command widget. How each operator behaves is described below. image window is the image currently displayed on your X server and image
       is the image obtained with the File Browser widget.

       over    The result is the union of the two image shapes, with image obscuring image window in the region of overlap.

       in      The result is simply image cut by the shape of image window.  None of the image data of image window is in the result.

       out     The resulting image is image with the shape of image window cut out.

       atop    The result is the same shape as image window, with image obscuring image window where the image shapes overlap. Note this differs from over because the portion of image outside image  window's
              shape does not appear in the result.

       xor     The result is the image data from both image and image window that is outside the overlap region. The overlap region is blank.

       plus    The result is just the sum of the image data. Output values are cropped to the maximum value (no overflow). This operation is independent of the matte channels.

       minus   The result of image - image window, with underflow cropped to zero. The matte channel is ignored (set to opaque, full coverage).

       add     The result of image + image window, with overflow wrapping around (mod MaxRGB+1).

       subtract
               The result of image - image window, with underflow wrapping around (mod MaxRGB+1). The add and subtract operators can be used to perform reversible transformations.

       difference
               The result of abs(image - image window). This is useful for comparing two very similar images.

       multiply
               The result of image * image window. This is useful for the creation of drop-shadows.

       bumpmap
               The result of image window shaded by window.

       replace
              The resulting image is image window replaced with image.  Here the matte information is ignored.

              The  image  compositor  requires  a matte, or alpha channel in the image for some operations. This extra channel usually defines a mask which represents a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image.
              This is the case when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside, and between zero and 255 on the boundary. If image does not have a matte channel, it is initialized
              with 0 for any pixel matching in color to pixel location (0,0), otherwise 255. See Matte Editing for a method of defining a matte channel.

              Note  that matte information for image window is not retained for colormapped X server visuals (e.g. StaticColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor).  Correct compositing behavior may require
              a TrueColor or DirectColor visual or a Standard Colormap.

              Choosing a composite operator is optional. The default operator is replace.  However, you must choose a location to composite your image and press button 1. Press and hold the button before re‐
              leasing and an outline of the image will appear to help you identify your location.

              The  actual  colors  of  the pasted image is saved. However, the color that appears in image window may be different. For example, on a monochrome screen image window will appear black or white
              even though your pasted image may have many colors. If the image is saved to a file it is written with the correct colors. To assure the correct colors are saved in the final image, any Pseudo‐
              Class image is promoted to DirectClass.  To force a PseudoClass image to remain PseudoClass, use -colors.

IMAGE CROPPING
       To begin, press choose Crop of the Transform submenu from the Command widget. Alternatively, press C in the image window.

       A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image window. You are now in crop mode. In crop mode, the Command widget has these options:

              If  you choose blend, the composite operator becomes over.  The image matte channel percent transparency is initialized to factor.  The image window is initialized to (100-factor). Where factor
              is the value you specify in the Dialog widget.

              Displace shifts the image pixels as defined by a displacement map.  With this option, image is used as a displacement map. Black, within the displacement map, is a  maximum  positive  displace‐
              ment.  White  is a maximum negative displacement and middle gray is neutral. The displacement is scaled to determine the pixel shift. By default, the displacement applies in both the horizontal
              and vertical directions. However, if you specify mask, image is the horizontal X displacement and mask the vertical Y displacement.

       The actual color you request for the pixels is saved in the image. However, the color that appears in your Image window may be different. For example, on a monochrome  screen  the  pixel  will  appear
       black  or white even if you choose the color red as the pixel color. However, the image saved to a file with -write is written with red pixels. To assure the correct color text in the final image, any
       PseudoClass image is promoted to DirectClass To force a PseudoClass image to remain PseudoClass, use -colors.

MATTE EDITING
       Matte information within an image is useful for some operations such as image compositing. This extra channel usually defines a mask which represents a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image.  This  is
       the case when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside, and between zero and 255 on the boundary.

       Setting the matte information in an image is done interactively. There is no command line argument to edit a pixel. To begin, and choose Matte of the Image Edit sub-menu from the Command widget.

       Alternatively, press m in the image window.

       A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image window. You are now in matte edit mode. To exit immediately, press Dismiss.  In matte edit mode, the Command widget has these op‐
       tions:

       Choose a matte editing method from the Method sub-menu of the Command widget. The point method changes the matte value of the any pixel selected with the pointer until the button is released. The  re‐
       place method changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the pixel you select with a button press. Floodfill changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the pixel
       you select with a button press and is a neighbor. Whereas filltoborder recolors any neighbor pixel that is not the border color. Finally reset changes the entire image to the designated  matte  value.
       Choose Matte Value and a dialog appears requesting a matte value.  Enter a value between 0 and 255. This value is assigned as the matte value of the selected pixel or pixels.  Now, press any button to
       select a pixel within the Image window to change its matte value. You can change the matte value of additional pixels by increasing the Delta value. The Delta value is first added then subtracted from
       the  red,  green,  and blue of the target color. Any pixels within the range also have their matte value updated.  If the Magnify widget is mapped, it can be helpful in positioning your pointer within
       the image (refer to button 2). Alternatively you can select a pixel to change the matte value from within the Magnify widget.  Move the pointer to the Magnify widget and position the  pixel  with  the
       cursor  control  keys. Finally, press a button to change the matte value of the selected pixel (or pixels).  Matte information is only valid in a DirectClass image. Therefore, any PseudoClass image is
       promoted to DirectClass. Note that matte information for PseudoClass is not retained for colormapped X server visuals (e.g. StaticColor, StaticColor, GrayScale,  PseudoColor)  unless  you  immediately
       save your image to a file (refer to Write). Correct matte editing behavior may require a TrueColor or DirectColor visual or a Standard Colormap.

IMAGE DRAWING
       An  image  is  drawn upon interactively. There is no command line argument to draw on an image. To begin, choose Draw of the Image Edit sub-menu from the Command widget.  Alternatively, press d in the
       image window.

       The cursor changes to a crosshair to indicate you are in draw mode. To exit immediately, press Dismiss. In draw mode, the Command widget has these options:

       Choose a drawing primitive from the Primitive sub-menu.

       Next, choose a color from the Color sub-menu. Additional colors can be specified with the color browser. You can change the menu colors by setting the X resources pen1 through  pen9.  The  transparent
       color updates the image matte channel and is useful for image compositing.

       If  you choose the color browser and press Grab, you can select the primitive color by moving the pointer to the desired color on the screen and press any button. The transparent color updates the im‐
       age matte channel and is useful for image compositing.

       Choose a stipple, if appropriate, from the Stipple sub-menu. Additional stipples can be specified with the file browser. Stipples obtained from the file browser must be on disk in the X11 bitmap  for‐
       mat.

       Choose a line width, if appropriate, from the Width sub-menu. To choose a specific width select the Dialog widget.

       Choose a point in the image window and press button 1 and hold. Next, move the pointer to another location in the image. As you move, a line connects the initial location and the pointer. When you re‐
       lease the button, the image is updated with the primitive you just drew. For polygons, the image is updated when you press and release the button without moving the pointer.

       To cancel image drawing, move the pointer back to the starting point of the line and release the button.

REGION OF INTEREST
       To begin, press choose Region of Interest of the Pixel Transform sub-menu from the Command widget.  Alternatively, press R in the image window.

       You  can  make adjustments to the region of interest by moving the pointer to one of the rectangle corners, pressing a button, and dragging. Finally, choose an image processing technique from the Com‐
       mand widget. You can choose more than one image processing technique to apply to an area. Alternatively, you can move the region of interest before applying  another  image  processing  technique.  To
       exit, press Dismiss.

IMAGE PANNING
       When  an  image exceeds the width or height of the X server screen, display maps a small panning icon. The rectangle within the panning icon shows the area that is currently displayed in the the image
       window. To pan about the image, press any button and drag the pointer within the panning icon.  The pan rectangle moves with the pointer and the image window is updated to reflect the location of  the
       rectangle within the panning icon. When you have selected the area of the image you wish to view, release the button.

       Use the arrow keys to pan the image one pixel up, down, left, or right within the image window.

       The panning icon is withdrawn if the image becomes smaller than the dimensions of the X server screen.

USER PREFERENCES
       Preferences affect the default behavior of display(1). The preferences are either true or false and are stored in your home directory as .displayrc:

                display image centered on a backdrop"

                    This  backdrop  covers  the  entire  workstation  screen and is useful for hiding other X window activity while viewing the image. The color of the backdrop is specified as the background
                    color. Refer to X Resources for details.
                confirm on program exit"

                    Ask for a confirmation before exiting the display(1) program.
                correct image for display gamma"

                    If the image has a known gamma, the gamma is corrected to match that of the X server (see the X Resource displayGamma).
                display warning messages"

                    Display any warning messages.
                apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to image"

                    The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels.  Images which suffer from  severe  con‐
                    touring when reducing colors can be improved with this preference.
                use a shared colormap for colormapped X visuals"

                    This option only applies when the default X server visual is PseudoColor or GRAYScale. Refer to -visual for more details. By default, a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares col‐
                    ors with other X clients.  Some image colors could be approximated, therefore your image may look very different than intended. Otherwise the image colors appear exactly as they  are  de‐
                    fined. However, other clients may go technicolor when the image colormap is installed.
                display images as an X server pixmap"

                    Images  are  maintained  as  a  XImage  by default. Set this resource to True to utilize a server Pixmap instead. This option is useful if your image exceeds the dimensions of your server
                    screen and you intend to pan the image. Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a XImage. Pixmaps are considered a precious resource, use them with discretion.

       GM IDENTIFY

              Identify describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files as internally supported by the software. It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.  The  information
              displayed includes the scene number, the file name, the width and height of the image, whether the image is colormapped or not, the number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in the im‐
              age, the format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the number of seconds in both user time and elapsed time it took to read and process the image.  If -verbose or +ping are provided as
              an option, the pixel read rate is also displayed. An example line output from identify follows:

                  images/aquarium.miff 640x480 PseudoClass 256c
                         308135b MIFF 0.000u 0:01

              If -verbose is set, expect additional output including any image comment:

                  Image: images/aquarium.miff
                  class: PseudoClass

GM IMPORT
       Import reads an image from any visible window on an X server and outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.  Use display
       for redisplay, printing, editing, formatting, archiving, image processing, etc. of the captured image.

       The  target  window can be specified by id, name, or may be selected by clicking the mouse in the desired window. If you press a button and then drag, a rectangle will form which expands and contracts
       as the mouse moves. To save the portion of the screen defined by the rectangle, just release the button. The keyboard bell is rung once at the beginning of the screen capture and twice  when  it  com‐
       pletes.

EXAMPLES
       To select an X window or an area of the screen with the mouse and save it in the MIFF image format to a file entitled window.miff, use:

           gm import window.miff

       To select an X window or an area of the screen with the mouse and save it in the Encapsulated PostScript format to include in another document, use:

           gm import figure.eps

       To capture the entire X server screen in the JPEG image format in a file entitled root.jpeg, without using the mouse, use:

           gm import -window root root.jpeg

       To capture the 512x256 area at the upper right corner of the X server screen in the PNG image format in a well-compressed file entitled corner.png, without using the mouse,  use:

           gm import -window root -crop 512x256-0+0 -quality 90
                  corner.png

OPTIONS
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.

       Import options can appear on the command line or in your X resources file. See X(1). Options on the command line supersede values specified in your X resources file.

       For a more detailed description of each option, see Options, above.

GM MOGRIFY
       Mogrify  transforms an image or a sequence of images. These transforms include image scaling, image rotation, color reduction, and others. Each transmogrified image overwrites the corresponding origi‐
       nal image, unless an option such as -format causes the output filename to be different from the input filename.

       The graphics formats supported by mogrify are listed in GraphicsMagick(1).

EXAMPLES
       To convert all the TIFF files in a particular directory to JPEG, use:

           gm mogrify -format jpeg *.tiff

       To convert a directory full of JPEG images to thumbnails, use:

           gm mogrify -size 120x120 *.jpg -resize 120x120 +profile "*"

       In this example, '-size 120x120' gives a hint to the JPEG decoder that the images are going to be downscaled to 120x120, allowing it to run faster  by  avoiding  returning  full-resolution  images  to
       GraphicsMagick  for  the  subsequent  resizing  operation.  The ´-resize 120x120' specifies the desired dimensions of the output images.  It will be scaled so its largest dimension is 120 pixels.  The
       ´+profile "*"' removes any ICM, EXIF, IPTC, or other profiles that might be present in the input and aren't needed in the thumbnails.

       To scale an image of a cockatoo to exactly 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height, use:

           gm mogrify -resize 640x480! cockatoo.miff

OPTIONS
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect for the set of images that follows, until the set is terminated by the appearance of  any  op‐
       tion or -noop.

       For a more detailed description of each option, see Options, above.

GM MONTAGE
       montage creates a composite image by combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the composite image with the name of the image optionally appearing just below the individual tile.

       The  composite  image is constructed in the following manner. First, each image specified on the command line, except for the last, is scaled to fit the maximum tile size. The maximum tile size by de‐
       fault is 120x120.  It can be modified with the -geometry command line argument or X resource. See Options for more information on command line arguments. See X(1) for more information on X  resources.
       Note that the maximum tile size need not be a square.

       Next  the  composite image is initialized with the color specified by the -background command line argument or X resource. The width and height of the composite image is determined by the title speci‐
       fied, the maximum tile size, the number of tiles per row, the tile border width and height, the image border width, and the label height. The number of tiles per row specifies how many images  are  to
       appear  in each row of the composite image. The default is to have 5 tiles in each row and 4 tiles in each column of the composite.  A specific value is specified with -tile. The tile border width and
       height, and the image border width defaults to the value of the X resource -borderwidth. It can be changed with the -borderwidth or -geometry command line argument or X resource. The label  height  is
       determined  by  the  font you specify with the -font command line argument or X resource. If you do not specify a font, a font is chosen that allows the name of the image to fit the maximum width of a
       tiled area.  The label colors is determined by the -background and -fill command line argument or X resource. Note, that if the background and pen colors are the same, labels will not appear.

       Initially, the composite image title is placed at the top if one is specified (refer to -fill). Next, each image is set onto the composite image, surrounded by its border color, with its name centered
       just  below it. The individual images are left-justified within the width of the tiled area.  The order of the images is the same as they appear on the command line unless the images have a scene key‐
       word. If a scene number is specified in each image, then the images are tiled onto the composite in the order of their scene number. Finally, the last argument on the command line is the name assigned
       to the composite image. By default, the image is written in the MIFF format and can be viewed or printed with display(1).

       Note,  that if the number of tiles exceeds the default number of 20 (5 per row, 4 per column), more than one composite image is created. To ensure a single image is produced, use -tile to increase the
       number of tiles to meet or exceed the number of input images.

       Finally, to create one or more empty spaces in the sequence of tiles, use the "NULL:" image format.

       Note, a composite MIFF image displayed to an X server with display behaves differently than other images. You can think of the composite as a visual image directory. Choose a particular  tile  of  the
       composite and press a button to display it. See display(1) and miff(5)

EXAMPLES
       To create a montage of a cockatoo, a parrot, and a hummingbird and write it to a file called birds, use:

           gm montage cockatoo.miff parrot.miff hummingbird.miff
                   birds.miff

       To tile several bird images so that they are at most 256 pixels in width and 192 pixels in height, surrounded by a red border, and separated by 10 pixels of background color, use:

           gm montage -geometry 256x192+10+10 -bordercolor red
                   birds.* montage.miff

       To create an unlabeled parrot image, 640 by 480 pixels, and surrounded by a border of black, use:

           gm montage -geometry 640x480 -bordercolor black
                   -label "" parrot.miff bird.miff

       To create an image of an eagle with a textured background, use:

           gm montage -texture bumps.jpg eagle.jpg eagle.png

       To join several GIF images together without any extraneous graphics (e.g.  no label, no shadowing, no surrounding tile frame), use:

           gm montage +frame +shadow +label -tile 5x1
                   -geometry 50x50+0+0 *.png joined.png

OPTIONS
       Any  option you specify on the command line remains in effect for the group of images following it, until the group is terminated by the appearance of any option or -noop.  For example, to make a mon‐
       tage of three images, the first with 32 colors, the second with an unlimited number of colors, and the third with only 16 colors, use:

           gm montage -colors 32 cockatoo.1 -noop cockatoo.2
                    -colors 16 cockatoo.3 cockatoos.miff

X RESOURCES
       Montage options can appear on the command line or in your X resource file. Options on the command line supersede values specified in your X resource file. See X(1) for more information on X resources.

       All montage options have a corresponding X resource. In addition, montage uses the following X resources:

       background (class Background)
              background color

              Specifies the preferred color to use for the composite image background.  The default is #ccc.

       borderColor (class BorderColor)
              border color

              Specifies the preferred color to use for the composite image border. The default is #ccc.

       borderWidth (class BorderWidth)
              border width

              Specifies the width in pixels of the composite image border. The default is 2.

       font (class Font)
              font to use

              Specifies the name of the preferred font to use when displaying text within the composite image. The default is 9x15, fixed, or 5x8 determined by the composite image size.

       matteColor (class MatteColor)
              color of the frame

              Specify the color of an image frame. A 3D effect is achieved by using highlight and shadow colors derived from this color. The default value is #697B8F.

       pen (class Pen)
              text color

              Specifies the preferred color to use for text within the composite image.  The default is black.

       title (class Title)
              composite image title

              This resource specifies the title to be placed at the top of the composite image. The default is not to place a title at the top of the composite image.

GM TIME
DESCRIPTION
       time executes an arbitrary gm utility command (e.g. convert) and reports the user and elapsed time.  This provides way to measure command execution times similar to the Unix ´time' command  but  in  a
       portable and consistent way.

EXAMPLES
       To obtain time information for the execution of a command:

       % gm time convert input.ppm -gaussian 0x2 output.ppm convert input.ppm -gaussian 0x2 output.ppm    22.60s user 0.00s system 2354% cpu 0.960 total

       Here is the interpretation of the above output:

           user - the total user time consumed.
           system - the total system time consumed.
           total - the total elapsed time consumed.

OPTIONS
       The time command reqires no options other than the gm command to execute.

GM VERSION
DESCRIPTION
       version  displays  the software release version, build quantum (pixel sample) depth, web site URL, copyright notice, enabled features support, configuration parameters, and final build options used to
       build the software.  The available information depends on how the software was configured and the host system.
