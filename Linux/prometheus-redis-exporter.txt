NAME
       prometheus-redis-exporter - Prometheus exporter for Valkey/Redis metrics

SYNOPSIS
       prometheus-redis-exporter [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       This Prometheus exporter retrieves monitoring data from Valkey (or Redis) servers, and exposes them via an HTTP server to be collected by Prometheus.

OPTIONS
       -check-key-groups string
              Comma separated list of lua regex for grouping keys

       -check-keys string
              Comma separated list of key-patterns to export value and length/size, searched for with SCAN.

       -check-keys-batch-size int
              Approximate  number  of keys to process in each execution, larger value speeds up scanning.  WARNING: Valkey and Redis are still single-threaded apps (unlike KeyDB), so a huge COUNT can af‐
              fect production environment (default 1000).

       -check-single-keys string
              Comma separated list of single keys to export value and length/size.

       -check-single-streams string
              Comma separated list of single streams to export info about streams, groups and consumers.

       -check-streams string
              Comma separated list of stream-patterns to export info about streams, groups and consumers, searched for with SCAN.

       -config-command string
              What to use for the CONFIG command (default "CONFIG").

       -connection-timeout string
              Timeout for connection to Valkey/Redis instance (default "15s").

       -count-keys string
              Comma separated list of patterns to count (eg: 'db0=production_*,db3=sessions:*'), searched for with SCAN.

       -disable-exporting-key-values
              Whether to disable values of keys stored in redis as labels or not when using.  -check-keys or -check-single-key.

       -exclude-latency-histogram-metrics
              Do not try to collect latency histogram metrics.

       -export-client-list
              Whether to scrape Client List specific metrics.

       -export-client-port
              Whether to include the client's port when exporting the client list.  Warning: including the port increases the number of metrics generated and will make your Prometheus server take up more
              memory.

       -include-config-metrics
              Whether to include all config settings as metrics.

       -include-system-metrics
              Whether to include system metrics like e.g.  redis_total_system_memory_bytes.

       -is-cluster
              Whether this is a Valkey/Redis cluster (enable this if you need to fetch key level data on a Valkey/Redis Cluster).

       -is-tile38
              Whether to scrape Tile38 specific metrics.

       -log-format string
              Log format, valid options are txt and json (default "txt").

       -max-distinct-key-groups int
              The maximum number of distinct key groups with the most memory utilization to present as distinct metrics per database, the leftover key groups will be aggregated in the  'overflow'  bucket
              (default 100).

       -namespace string
              Namespace for metrics (default "redis").

       -ping-on-connect
              Whether to ping the redis instance after connecting.

       -redact-config-metrics
              Whether to redact config settings that include potentially sensitive information like passwords (default true).

       -redis-only-metrics
              Whether to also export go runtime metrics.

       -redis.addr string
              Address of the Valkey/Redis instance to scrape (default "redis://localhost:6379").

       -redis.password string
              Password of the Valkey/Redis instance to scrape.

       -redis.password-file string
              Password file of the Valkey/Redis instance to scrape.

       -redis.user string
              User name to use for authentication (Valkey/Redis ACL for Valkey/Redis 6.0 and newer).

       -script string
              Path to Lua Valkey/Redis script for collecting extra metrics.

       -set-client-name
              Whether to set client name to redis_exporter (default true).

       -skip-tls-verification
              Whether to to skip TLS verification.

       -streams-exclude-consumer-metrics
              Do not collect per consumer metrics for streams (decreases cardinality).

       -tls-ca-cert-file string
              Name of the CA certificate file (including full path) if the server requires TLS client authentication.

       -tls-client-cert-file string
              Name of the client certificate file (including full path) if the server requires TLS client authentication.

       -tls-client-key-file string
