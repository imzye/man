NAME
       cvsmgdiff - uses mgdiff to display differences between any two cvs revisions.

SYNOPSIS
       cvsmgdiff [-v⎪-h⎪-g gui⎪-r rev1 [-r rev2]] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly  the cvsmgdiff program.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because the  original program does not
       have a manual page.

       This script lets you recursively diff the CVS directories you have checked out.  To use, just pass in an optional revision levels and an optional file directory name.  This script then  will  show
       you the differences you're interested in.

OPTIONS
       -v  Print version information successfully

       -h  Print help information

       -g gui
           Use the program gui as the user interface (default: /usr/bin/mgdiff)

       -r revision
           Specify  the CVS revision to view.  If just one -r option is given, view differences between that revision and the current file in the CVS working directory.  If two -r options are given, com‐
           pare those two revisions with each other.
