  NAME
      csp_helper - A collection of caspar helper scripts

  SYNOPSIS
      csp_install dir (directory) file (file)

      csp_mkdircp dir (directory) file (file)

      csp_scp_keep_mode h ([user@]host) dir (directory) file (file)

      csp_sucp h ([user@]host) dir (directory) file (file)

  DESCRIPTION
      The  scripts csp_install, csp_mkdircp, csp_scp_keep_mode and csp_sucp are helpers for caspar(7). These scripts typically are not invoked directly, but via a Makefile which uses caspar. See the notes on
      csp_PUSH in caspar(7) for information on how to link csp_install, csp_scp_keep_mode and csp_sucp to caspar.

  install DESCRIPTION
      csp_install creates the required directory (if needed) and installs the file, preserving timestamps. It uses install(1).

  install EXAMPLES
       csp_INSTALL_OPTIONS='--owner=www-data --group=www-data' \
        csp_INSTALL_MODE=ugo=r \
        csp_install /srv/www index.html

       csp_INSTALL_MODE=u=rwx,go= csp_install /usr/local/sbin mkpasswd

  install ENVIRONMENT
      csp_install honors csp_INSTALL_OPTIONS and csp_INSTALL_MODE (default is u=rw,go=r).

  mkdircp DESCRIPTION
      csp_mkdircp calls mkdir(1) and cp(1).  csp_mkdircp is used like csp_CP. use csp_mkdircp if you frequently have to bootstrap installation on a fresh system, on which needed directories don't exist  yet.
      csp_mkdircp makes sure the target directory exists before calling cp(1), by calling mkdir -p first.

  scp_keep_mode DESCRIPTION
      csp_scp_keep_mode  uses  ssh  to copy a file to a remote host, keeping its file permission mode. The trick used is a combination of mktemp(1) and mv(1).  Useful if you'd like to be sure a file gets in‐
      stalled e.g. group writable, without fiddling with permission bits on the remote host.

  scp_keep_mode EXAMPLE
        chmod g+w rc
        csp_scp_keep_mode root@gandalf /etc/uruk rc

  scp_keep_mode ENVIRONMENT
      csp_scp_keep_mode honors csp_SSH ("ssh" by default).

  sucp DESCRIPTION
      csp_sucp calls tar(1) from within sudo(1) from within ssh(1). This allows one to copy files to accounts on hosts one can only reach by calling sudo on the ssh-reachable remote host.

      Typically, one wants to install a root-owned file, but one does not want to allow access to the root-account directly from ssh. Typically sudo is used as an extra line of defense.

      NB: if your sudo prompts for a password, be sure to have line

        Defaults !tty_tickets

      in your sudoers file: we first call sudo -v, than we call sudo to write the data. Since we use ssh to get to the host, we'll use a different tty for both sudo calls.

  sucp EXAMPLES
      Some examples:

        csp_sucp rms@bilbo /etc fstab

        csp_sucp monty-python commit/ trailer.txt
