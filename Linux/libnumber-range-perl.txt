Number::Range(3pm)                                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                  Number::Range(3pm)

NAME
       Number::Range - Perl extension defining ranges of numbers and testing if a number is found in the range. You can also add and delete from this range.

SYNOPSIS
         use Number::Range;

         my $range = Number::Range->new("-10..10,12,100..120");
         if ($range->inrange("13")) {
           print "In range\n";
         } else {
           print "Not in range\n";
         }
         $range->addrange("200..300");
         $range->delrange("250..255");
         my $format = $range->range;
         # $format will be '-10..10,12,100..120,200..249,256..300'

DESCRIPTION
       Number::Range will take a description of a range, and then allow you to test on if a number falls within the range. You can also add and delete from the range.

   RANGE FORMAT
       The format used for range is pretty straight forward. To separate sections of ranges it uses a "," or whitespace. To create the range, it uses ".." to do this, much like Perl's own binary ".."
       range operator in list context.

   METHODS
       new
             $range = Number::Range->new("10..20","25..30","100");

           Creates the range object. It will accept any number of ranges as its input.

       addrange
             $range->addrange("22");

           This will also take any number of ranges as input and add them to the existing range.

       delrange
             $range->delrange("10");

           This will also take any number of ranges as input and delete them from the existing range.

       inrange
             $range->inrange("26"); my @results = $range->inrange("27","200");

           This will take one or more numbers and check if each of them exists in the range. If passed a list, and in array context, it will return a list of 0's or 1's, depending if that one was true or
           false in the list position. If in scalar context, it will return a single 1 if all are true, or a single 0 if one of them failed.

       range
             $format = $range->range; @numbers = $range->range;

           Depending on context this will return either an array of all the numbers found in the range, for list context. For scalar context it will return a range string.

       size
             $size = $range->size;

           This will return the total number of entries in the range.

       rangeList
             @rangeList = $range->rangeList;

           Returns  the  range  as  an array list where each element in the list is an array representing the start and stop points of a range. Single element ranges are returned as single element arrays
           with only on indice.

           [
             [10,20],
             [25,30],
             [100] ]

   EXPORT
       None by default.
