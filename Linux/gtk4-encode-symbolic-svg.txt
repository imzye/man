NAME
       gtk4-encode-symbolic-svg - Symbolic icon conversion utility

SYNOPSIS
       gtk4-encode-symbolic-svg [OPTION...] PATH WIDTHxHEIGHT

DESCRIPTION
       gtk4-encode-symbolic-svg converts symbolic svg icons into specially prepared png files. GTK can load and recolor these pngs, just like original svgs, but loading them is much faster.

       PATH is the name of a symbolic svg file, WIDTHxHEIGHT are the desired dimensions for the generated png file.

       To distinguish them from ordinary pngs, the generated files have the extension .symbolic.png.

OPTIONS
       -o DIRECTORY, --output DIRECTORY
           Write png files to DIRECTORY instead of the current working directory.

       --debug
           Generate png files of the various channels during the conversion. If these files are not monochrome green, they are often helpful in pinpointing the problematic parts of the source svg.
