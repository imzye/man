NAME
       globus-job-cancel - Cancel a GRAM batch job

SYNOPSIS
       globus-job-cancel [-f | -force] [-q | -quiet] JOBID

       globus-job-cancel [-help | -usage ] [ -version | -versions ]

DESCRIPTION
       The globus-job-cancel(1) program cancels the job named by JOBID. Any
       cached files associated with the job will remain until
       globus-job-clean(1) is executed for the job.

       By default, globus-job-cancel prompts the user prior to canceling the
       job. This behavior can be overridden by specifying the -f or -force
       command-line options.
