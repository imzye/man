NAME
       ipurge - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Delete mail from IMAP mailbox or partition based on age or size

SYNOPSIS
       ipurge [ -f ] [ -C config-file ] [ -x ] [ -M ] [ -X ] [ -i ] [ -s ] [ -o ] [ -n ] [ -v ]
               [ -d days | -b bytes | -k Kbytes | -m Mbytes ]
               [ mailbox-pattern... ]

DESCRIPTION
       ipurge deletes messages from the mailbox(es) specified by Imailbox-pat‐
       tern that are older or larger than specified by the -d, -b,  -k  or  -m
       options.   If  no  mailbox-pattern  is given, ipurge works on all mail‐
       boxes.  If the -x option is given, the message age and size MUST  match
       exactly  those  specified by -d, -b, -k or -m.  The are no default val‐
       ues, and at least one of -d, -b, -k or -m MUST be specified.

       Ipurge by default only deletes mail below shared folders,  which  means
       that  mails in mailbox(es) below INBOX.* and user.* stay untouched. Use
       the option -f to also delete mail in mailbox(es) below  these  folders.
       Use the -M option to not recurse into the mailboxes.

       ipurge  reads  its  configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file
       unless specified otherwise by -C.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -f     Force ipurge to examine mailboxes below INBOX.* and user.*.

       -d days
              Age of message in days.

       -b bytes
              Size of message in bytes.

       -k Kbytes
              Size of message in Kbytes (2^10 bytes).

       -m Mbytes
              Size of message in Mbytes (2^20 bytes).

       -x     Perform  an  exact  match  on  age  or size (instead of older or
              larger).

       -X     Use delivery time instead of Date: header for date matches.

       -i     Invert match logic: -x means not equal, date is for newer,  size
              is for smaller.

       -s     Skip over messages that have the \Flagged flag set.

       -o     Only purge messages that have the \Deleted flag set.

       -n     Only print messages that would be deleted (dry run).

       -v     Enable verbose output/logging.
