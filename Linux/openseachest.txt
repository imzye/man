       --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough

              Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products that do not otherwise work with the tool.  This option will enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various ATA
              Identify  commands  through  vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
              chip the command was designed for.

       --forceATA

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the drive.

       --forceATADMA
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with --forceATA

       --forceATAPIO
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with --forceATA

       --forceATAUDMA
              (SATA Only)

              Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on DMA commands).  This option can be combined with --forceATA

       --forceSCSI

              Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the drive.

       Utility Arguments =================

       -d, --device [deviceHandle | all]

              Use  this option with most commands to specify the device handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#> CSMI device handles can be specified as <error<#><#><#>> To run across
              all devices detected in the system, use the "all" argument instead of a device handle.  Example: -d all NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the

       specified options on each drive detected in the
              OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please use a script opening a separate instance for each device handle.

       -F, --scanFlags [option list]

              Use this option to control the output from scan with the options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.

       ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
              usb - show only USB devices scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices nvme - show only NVMe devices interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface interfaceUSB - show devices on a USB  interface
              interfaceSCSI  -  show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface sd - show sd device handles sgtosd - show the sd and sg device handle mapping ig‐
              noreCSMI - do not scan for any CSMI devices allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD handles

              to show up multiple times in the list

       -i, --deviceInfo

              Show information and features for the storage device

       --llInfo

              Dump low-level information about the device to assist with debugging.

       -s, --scan

              Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical /dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately after  boot‐
              ing, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

       -S, --Scan

              This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may cause
              the  OS  to re-enumerate them.  Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.  NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or all OSs.
              The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.

       --SATInfo

              Displays SATA device information on any interface using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data (translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log reported data.

       --testUnitReady

              Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc, ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable translation from  the  SPC
              spec will be displayed if one is available.

       --fastDiscovery

       Use this option
              to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.

       --prAllTargetPorts
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use this option when registering a new key to specify that it applies to all target ports.  NOTE: Not all devices will support this option

       --prClear
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use this option to clear all reservations using a key that is specified by the --prKey option.  The specified key must already be registered with the device.

       --prKey [key]
              (NVMe & SAS Only)

              Use  this  option  to specify the key to use for persistent reservation options. When registering a key, this provides the value expected for your use. It should continue to be used through
              all persistent reseve operations until unregistered or cleared.

       --prPersistThroughPowerLoss
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use this option when registering a new key to activate the persist through power loss capability.  NOTE: Not all devices will support this option

       --prPreempt [reservation key to preempt]
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use this option to preempt another reservation using a registration key

              that is specified by the --prKey option.

              The specified key must already be registered with the device.  This is used to remove a reservation from another initiator and start a new one using the specified registration key. --prType
              must also be provided to specify the type of reservation that should be active once the preempt has completed.  Use with the --prPreemptAbort option to cause the preempt to abort  all  out‐
              standing commands to the previous reservation holder.

       --prPreemptAbort
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use this option to cause a preempt to abort commands to the previous reservation holder. This must be used in combination with the --prPreempt option in order to specify the key to preempt.

       --prRegister
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use  this option to register a new key as specified by the --prKey option.  Combine this with the following options as needed: --prAllTargetPorts --prPersistThroughPowerLoss --prRegisterIg‐
              nore

       --prRegisterIgnore
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use this option when registering a new key to instruct the device to ignore any previous registration key that has already been registered from the same initiator NOTE: Not all devices will
              support this option

       --prRelease
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use this option to release reservation using a key that is specified by the --prKey option.  The specified key must already be registered with the device and must have an active reservation
              that can be released.  Use the --prType option to specifiy the reservation type to release.

       --prReserve
              (NVMe & SAS only)

              Use this option to acquire a reservation using a key that is specified by the --prKey option.  The specified key must already be registered with the device.   Use  the  --prType  option  to
              specifiy the reservation type to acquire.

       --prType [wrex | ex | wrexro | exro | wrexar | exar]
              (NVMe and SAS only)

              This option specifies the type of reservation to hold.  This is required for acquiring, preempting, and releasing reservations.  Available reservation types:
