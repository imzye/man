NAME
       Spectre - Spectre & Meltdown vulnerability/mitigation checker

DESCRIPTION
       Spectre and Meltdown mitigation detection tool v0.46

              Usage:

       Live mode (auto):
              spectre-meltdown-checker [options]

              Live  mode (manual): spectre-meltdown-checker [options] <[--kernel <kimage>] [--config <kconfig>] [--map <mapfile>]> --live Offline mode:       spectre-meltdown-checker [options] <[--kernel
              <kimage>] [--config <kconfig>] [--map <mapfile>]>

              Modes:

              Two modes are available.

              First mode is the "live" mode (default), it does its best to find information about the currently running kernel.  To run under this mode, just start the script without any option (you  can
              also use --live explicitly)

              Second  mode  is  the "offline" mode, where you can inspect a non-running kernel.  This mode is automatically enabled when you specify the location of the kernel file, config and System.map
              files:

       --kernel kernel_file
              specify a (possibly compressed) Linux or BSD kernel file

       --config kernel_config
              specify a kernel config file (Linux only)

       --map kernel_map_file
              specify a kernel System.map file (Linux only)

              If you want to use live mode while specifying the location of the kernel, config or map file yourself, you can add --live to the above options, to tell the script to run in  live  mode  in‐
              stead of the offline mode, which is enabled by default when at least one file is specified on the command line.

              Options:

       --no-color
              don't use color codes

       --verbose, -v
              increase verbosity level, possibly several times

       --explain
              produce an additional human-readable explanation of actions to take to mitigate a vulnerability

       --paranoid
              require  IBPB to deem Variant 2 as mitigated also require SMT disabled + unconditional L1D flush to deem Foreshadow-NG VMM as mitigated also require SMT disabled to deem MDS vulnerabilities
              mitigated

       --no-sysfs
              don't use the /sys interface even if present [Linux]

       --sysfs-only
              only use the /sys interface, don't run our own checks [Linux]

       --coreos
              special mode for CoreOS (use an ephemeral toolbox to inspect kernel) [Linux]

       --arch-prefix PREFIX
              specify a prefix for cross-inspecting a kernel of a different arch, for example "aarch64-linux-gnu-", so that invoked tools will be prefixed with this (i.e. aarch64-linux-gnu-objdump)

       --batch text
              produce machine readable output, this is the default if --batch is specified alone

       --batch short
              produce only one line with the vulnerabilities separated by spaces

       --batch json
              produce JSON output formatted for Puppet, Ansible, Chef...

       --batch nrpe
              produce machine readable output formatted for NRPE

       --batch prometheus
              produce output for consumption by prometheus-node-exporter

       --variant VARIANT
              specify which variant you'd like to check, by default all variants are checked.  can be used multiple times (e.g. --variant 3a --variant l1tf) for a list of  supported  VARIANT  parameters,
              use --variant help

       --cve CVE
              specify which CVE you'd like to check, by default all supported CVEs are checked can be used multiple times (e.g. --cve CVE-2017-5753 --cve CVE-2020-0543)

       --hw-only
              only check for CPU information, don't check for any variant

       --no-hw
              skip CPU information and checks, if you're inspecting a kernel not to be run on this host

       --vmm [auto,yes,no]
              override the detection of the presence of a hypervisor, default: auto

       --allow-msr-write
              allow probing for write-only MSRs, this might produce kernel logs or be blocked by your system

       --cpu [#,all]
              interact with CPUID and MSR of CPU core number #, or all (default: CPU core 0)

       --update-fwdb
              update our local copy of the CPU microcodes versions database (using the awesome MCExtractor project and the Intel firmwares GitHub repository)

       --update-builtin-fwdb
              same as --update-fwdb but update builtin DB inside the script itself

       --dump-mock-data
              used to mimick a CPU on an other system, mainly used to help debugging this script

              Return codes:

              0 (not vulnerable), 2 (vulnerable), 3 (unknown), 255 (error)

              IMPORTANT: A false sense of security is worse than no security at all.  Please use the --disclaimer option to understand exactly what this script does.

SEE ALSO
       The full documentation for Spectre is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the info and Spectre programs are properly installed at your site, the command

              info Spectre

       should give you access to the complete manual.
