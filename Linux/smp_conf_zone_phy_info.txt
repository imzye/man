SMP_CONF_ZONE_PHY_INFO(8)                                                                          SMP_UTILS                                                                          SMP_CONF_ZONE_PHY_INFO(8)

NAME
       smp_conf_zone_phy_info - invoke CONFIGURE ZONE PHY INFORMATION function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_conf_zone_phy_info [--expected=EX] [--help] [--hex] [--interface=PARAMS] --pconf=FN [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--save=SAV] [--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a  SAS  Serial Management Protocol (SMP) CONFIGURE ZONE PHY INFORMATION function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the --sa=SAS_ADDR. Depending on the
       interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between  HBAs  if  there
       are multiple present.

       Each  zone  phy  configuration descriptor is 4 bytes long. The first byte is a (expander) phy identifier. The second byte has 3 modifiable bits: bit 5 is "inside ZPSDS persistent"; bit 4 is "requested
       inside ZPSDS"; and bit 2 is "zone group persistent". The other bits in the second byte are reserved and should be 0. The third byte is reserved and should be 0. The fourth byte is the zone group.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -E, --expected=EX
              set the 'expected expander change count' field in the SMP request.  The value EX is from 0 to 65535 inclusive with 0 being the default value. When EX is greater than  zero  then  if  the  value
              doesn't match the expander change count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when the request arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a function result of "invalid expander change
              count" in the response.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -p, --pconf=FN
              FN is a file containing zone phy configuration descriptors in ASCII hexadecimal; either as bytes separated by space, tab, comma or newline, or as longer strings of hexadecimal  bytes  in  which
              every 2 digits represents a byte. Empty lines and those starting with "#" are ignored.  Since each zone phy configuration descriptor is 4 bytes long, the number of bytes in FN is expected to be
              a multiple of 4.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. The mpt interface needs this option and it will typically be an expander's SAS address. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS addresses are
              shown in hexadecimal.  To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -S, --save=SAV
              set  the  'save'  field in the SMP request. SAV may take these values: 0 for updating the shadow values (default), 1 for updating the saved values, 2 for updating shadow values and if available
              the saved values, 3 for updating both saved and shadow values.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

NOTES
       The expander phys that make up a wide port (2 or more attached to phys with the same SAS address) must be set to the same zone phy configuration settings (other than the phy id).

       Zone phy information can be read back from an expander and placed in a file with the smp_discover_list utility's --zpi=FN option. The format  of  that  file  should  be  suitable  for  this  utility's
       --pconf=FN option.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP CONFIGURE ZONE PHY INFORMATION function was introduced in SAS-2 .
