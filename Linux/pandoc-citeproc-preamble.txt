PANDOC-CITEPROC-PREAMBLE.1(1)                                                                  User Commands                                                                  PANDOC-CITEPROC-PREAMBLE.1(1)

NAME
       pandoc-citeproc-preamble - insert a preamble before Pandoc's bibliography

SYNOPSIS
       pandoc-citeproc-preamble

DESCRIPTION
       pandoc-citeproc-preamble is a JSON filter for pandoc(1) which inserts a preamble before the output that Pandoc's citeproc filter appends to the document.  This preamble might include a heading
       (e.g. "Bibliography") and/or raw markup to format the bibliography for the output format.

USAGE
       Add --filter pandoc-citeproc-preamble somewhere after --citeproc, e.g.

           % pandoc -s --citeproc --bibliography=~/doc/mine.bib \
               --filter pandoc-citeproc-preamble \
               ~/doc/my_essay.mdwn -o ~/my_essay.pdf

FILES
       ~/.pandoc/citeproc-preamble/default.FORMAT
           Default citeproc preamble for Pandoc output format FORMAT (e.g. "latex").

       To override this, you can set document metadata like this:

           % pandoc ... --filter pandoc-citeproc-preamble \
               -M citeproc-preamble=~/mypreamble.tex ...

RATIONALE
       One motivation for authoring with Pandoc is that one's input files are agnostic with regard to the output format to which they will eventually be compiled.  For example, it should not be necessary
       to include LaTeX code in one's input file in order to format the bibliography.  The input file might also be compiled to HTML.

       However,  when compiling to PDF, formatting code is usually required in order to have the entries of Pandoc's bibliography line up with each other; by default, all entries except the first will be
       indented.  Another common customisation is to set up a hanging indent for bibliography entries.

       Since Pandoc's citeproc filter doesn't provide any facility to add formatting control code to its output, pandoc-citeproc-preamble is necessary to avoid the user being forced to add their  control
       code to the end of their input files, thereby losing the input file's agnosticity with regard to output format.
