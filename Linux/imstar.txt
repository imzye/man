Name
       imstar - Find stars in FITS and IRAF image files

Synopsis
       imstar  [options] [FITS or IRAF filename] or [@file of image file names]

Description
Options
       <hh:mm:ss> <dd:mm:ss> [J2000, B1950]
              Coordinates for center (or reference pixel if -x is used).

       -a <angle>
              Image rotation angle in degrees (default 0).  If multiple of 90, rotate image before search and set WCS angle to zero; if not, put in WCS.

       -b     Output B1950 (FK4) coordinates (default=image equinox)

       -d <catalog name>
              Read  this  DAOFIND  style  catalog of X, Y, and magnitude instead of searching for stars in the image.  The format is simply white-space-separated numbers on a line, with # at the beginning of
              comment lines.

       -e <num>
              Number of pixels to ignore around image edge

       -f     Write a simple ASCII catalog file instead of tab table or DAOFIND format (number RA DEC mag ... per line, with two lines of header info)

       -h     Print heading, else do not

       -i <num>
              Minimum peak value for star in image (<0=-sigma) Setting this to reject all but 10-15 stars is a good way to speed up the star-finding process.  If num is less than zero, the  minimum  peak  is
              -num image pixel standard deviations.  Setting this number rejects faint stars early in the selection process for a significant saving in computing time.

       -j     Output J2000 (FK5) coordinates (default=image equinox)

       -k     Print each star as it is found for debugging

       -l     Reflect the image left <-> right before rotating (-a) and searching for stars.

       -m <magnitude>
              Magnitude offset

       -n     Number of brightest stars to print

       -o     Output  star  list  in  DAOFIND  format.   The first three numbers on each line of the output file are X, Y, and magnitude, separated by one or more blanks or a tab.  Lines beginning with # are
              ignored.

       -p <num>
              Plate scale in arcsec per pixel (default 0)

       -q <c|d|o|s|x|v|+>
              Output region file shape for SAOimage (default o) Characters mean: c>ross, d>iamond, s>quare, o>circle, x=X, v>ary with GSC type, +>cross.

       -r     Maximum radius for star in pixels

       -s     Sort by RA instead of flux

       -t     Output in Starbase tab table format

       -v     Verbose listing of processing intermediate results

       -w     Write output to a file in addition to standard out.  If DAO format (-o), create the name by adding .dao to the image file name.  If Starbase format (-t), create the name by adding .tab  to  the
              image file name.  If ASCII format (-f), create the name by adding .stars to the image file name.

       -x <X> <Y>
              X and Y coordinates of reference pixel (if not in header or image center)

       -z     Use AIPS classic projection code (for "-SIN", "-TAN", "-ARC", "-NCP", "-GLS", "-MER", "-AIT" and "-STG" only) instead of WCSLIB proposed standard projection code.
