NAME
       Test::Database::Handle - A class for Test::Database handles

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::Database;

           my $handle = Test::Database->handle(@requests);
           my $dbh    = $handle->dbh();

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Database::Handle is a very simple class for encapsulating the information about a test database handle.

       Test::Database::Handle objects are used within a test script to obtain the necessary information about a test database handle.  Handles are obtained through the "Test::Database->handles()" or
       "Test::Database->handle()" methods.

METHODS
       Test::Database::Handle provides the following methods:

   new
       Return a new Test::Database::Handle with the given parameters ("dsn", "username", "password").

       The only mandatory argument is "dsn".

ACCESSORS
       The following accessors are available.

   dsn
       Return the Data Source Name.

   username
       Return the connection username. Defaults to "undef".

   password
       Return the connection password. Defaults to "undef".

   connection_info
       Return the connection information triplet ("dsn", "username", "password").

           my ( $dsn, $username, $password ) = $handle->connection_info;

   dbh
           my $dbh = $handle->dbh;
           my $dbh = $handle->dbh( $attr );

       Return the DBI database handle obtained when connecting with the connection triplet returned by "connection_info()".

       The optional parameter $attr is a reference to a hash of connection attributes, passed directly to DBI's "connect()" method.

   name
       Return the database name attached to the handle.

   dbd
       Return the DBI driver name, as computed from the "dsn".

   driver
       Return the Test::Database::Driver object attached to the handle.
