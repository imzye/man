NAME
       textrr - rewrite rules compiler

SYNOPSIS
          $ textrr file.rr > file.pl

DESCRIPTION
       Text::RewriteRules converts rules into Perl on the fly. For efficiency purposes, you can compile the rules into Perl code, removing the overhead of parsing them when starting the script, and
       removing the dependency to this module.
