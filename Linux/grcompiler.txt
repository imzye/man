NAME
       grcompiler - Compile GDL into a TrueType Font

SYNOPSIS
       grcompiler [-c] [-d] [-D] [-g] [-n number] [-v number] [-w number] [-wall] [-q] gdl-file font-file [output-file] [output-fontname]

DESCRIPTION
       Grcompiler compiles a Graphite Description Language description of the smarts for a font along with a TrueType Font to create a graphite font with graphite tables in it.

       -c     Enable compression of Graphite tables.  This forces a version 5.0 Silf and version 3.0 Glat.

       -d     Generate XML debugger file.

       -D     Generate all debugger files.

       -g     Permit and ignore invalid glyph definitions.

       -n number
              Set name table start location.

       -q     Quiet mode (no messages except on error).

       -v number
              Set Silf table version number.

       -w number
              Ignore warning with the given number. This option may be repeated.

       -wall  Display all warnings.

ENVIRONMENT
       grcompiler makes use of the following environment variables

       GDLPP  Specifies the command to execute to run the GDL preprocessor

FILES
       gdlerr.txt
              Warnings and errors are output to this file.

       dbg_classes.txt
              Debug file that specifies the classes stored in the font in terms of their GDL source and containing glyph ids in hex.

       dbg_cmap.txt
              Debug file giving Unicode to glyph mapping of all the glyphs in the font and vice versa.

       dbg_enginecode.txt
              Debug file containing the action code and constraint code associated with each pass and rule in a pass.

       dbg_fsm.txt
              Debug file that gives the finite state machines of each pass and the rules referenced. For each pass, a mapping is given between glyph and column number.

       dbg_glyphattrs.txt
              Debug file containing all the glyph attributes and their names, along with values specified for each glyph.

       dbg_parsetree.txt
              Debug file giving the complete parse tree of the GDL source file.

       dbg_ruleprec.txt
              Debug file that lists the rules in precedence order (order in which they will be tested) for each pass.

       $_temp.gdl
              Debug file containing the output of gdlpp
