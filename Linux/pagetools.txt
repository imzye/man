NAME
       tiff_findskew - determine text skew angle

SYNOPSIS
       tiff_findskew [-options] TIFF_file

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  file in TIFF format as input.  Writes out the skew angle (in degrees, floating-point decimal).  The skew angle is defined as the angle by which the image must be rotated counterclockwise
       to obtain a normally oriented text with horizontal lines.

OPTIONS
       -options
              So far no options are implemented. In the future, tiff_findskew might accept options.

       TIFF_file
              Name of a TIFF file containing a black/white bitmap.  (The file should be readable by libtiff tools.)
