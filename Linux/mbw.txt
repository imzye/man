NAME
       mbw - Memory BandWidth benchmark

SYNOPSIS
       mbw [options] arraysize_in_MiB

DESCRIPTION
       mbw determines available memory bandwidth by copying large arrays of data in memory.

OPTIONS
       -q     Quiet; suppress informational messages.

       -a     Suppress printing the average of each test.

       -n <number>
              Select number of loops per test

       -t <number>
              Select tests to be run. If no -t parameters are given the default is to run all tests. -t0: memcpy() test, -t1: dumb (b[i]=a[i] style) test, -t2: memcpy() with arbitrary block size

       -b <bytes>
              Block size in bytes for -t2.

       -h     Show quick help.

USAGE
       mbw will allocate two arraysize arrays in memory and copy one to the other.  Reported 'bandwidth' is the amount of data copied over the time this operation took.

       Obviously  mbw  needs twice arraysize MiBytes (1024*1024 bytes) of physical memory - you'd better switch off swap or otherwise make sure no paging occurs. Needless to say that it should not be run
       on a busy system.

TODO
       Multiple thread support.  Better configurability, including using getopt() for parsing arguments.
