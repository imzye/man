NAME
       HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter::standard - An internal filter to respect RFC2616

DESCRIPTION
       This is an internal filter used by HTTP::Proxy to enforce behaviour compliant with RFC 2616.

METHOD
       This filter implements a single method that is called automatically:

       filter()
           Enforce  RFC  2616-compliant  behaviour, by adding the "Via:" and "X-Forwarded-For:" headers (except when the proxy was instructed not to add them), decrementing the "Max-Forwards:" header and
           removing the hop-by-hop and LWP::UserAgent headers.

           Note that the filter will automatically remove the "Accept-Encoding" headers if the proxy has at least one HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter filter.  (This is to ensure that  the  filters  will  receive
           uncompressed data.)
