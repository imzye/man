NAME
       Sub::Accessor::Small - small toolkit for generating getter/setter methods

SYNOPSIS
         package MyClass;
         use Sub::Accessor::Small;
         use Types::Standard qw( Int );

         sub new {
           my $class = shift;
           my $self  = bless \$class, $class;
           my %args  = @_ == 1 ? %{ $_[0] } : @_;

           # Simple way to initialize each attribute
           for my $key ( sort keys %args ) {
             $self->$key( $args{$key} );
           }

           return $self;
         }

         'Sub::Accessor::Small'->new(
           package  => __PACKAGE__,
           name     => "foo",
           is       => "rw",
           isa      => Int,
         )->install_accessors();

         package main;

         my $obj = MyClass->new( foo => 42 );

DESCRIPTION
       This is a small toolkit for generating Moose-like attribute accessors.  It does not generate a constructor.

       It stores attribute values inside-out, but it is designed for Sub::Accessor::Small to be subclassed, making it easy to store attributes in other ways.
