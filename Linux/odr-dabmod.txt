NAME
       odr-dabmod - DAB modulator compliant to ETSI EN 300 401

SYNOPSIS
       odr-dabmod <configuration_file>

       odr-dabmod input (-f filename -F format | -u uhddevice -F frequency) [-o offset][-G txgain] [-T filter_taps_file] [-a gain] [-c clockrate] [-g gainMode] [-m dabMode] [-r samplingRate] [-l] [-h]

       Where input is:

              ETI input filename (default: stdin), or

              tcp://source:port for ETI-over-TCP input, or

              zmq+tcp://source:port for ZMQ input, or

              udp://:port for EDI input.

DESCRIPTION
       ODR-DabMod  is a software-defined DAB modulator that receives or reads ETI, and generates modulated I/Q data usable for transmission. It can directly interface the Ettus USRP devices, and can also
       be used with other SDR signal sources.

       This I/Q data which is encoded as complex floats (32bits per complex sample) can be written to a file or pipe, sent to a USRP device using the integrated output for the open-source  USRP  Hardware
       Driver (UHD) or to other software-defined radio (SDR) devices using the SoapySDR5 library.

       The output of the modulator can also be sent to a GNURadio flow-graph for further processing, conversion or analysis using a ZeroMQ network connection.

OPTIONS
       -f     Use file output with given filename. (use /dev/stdout for standard output)

       -F     Set the output format (see doc/example.ini for formats) for the file output.

       -o     Set the timestamp offset added to the timestamp in the ETI. The offset is a double.

              Specifying this option has two implications: It enables synchronous transmission, requiring an external REFCLK and PPS signal and frames that do not contain a valid timestamp get muted.

       -u     Use UHD output with given device string. (use  for default device)

       -F     Set the transmit frequency when using UHD output. (mandatory option when using UHD)

       -G     Set the transmit gain for the UHD driver (default: 0)

       -T     Enable filtering before the output, using the specified file containing the filter taps.

              Use 'default' as taps_file to use the internal taps.

       -a     Apply digital amplitude gain.

       -c     Set the DAC clock rate and enable Cic Equalisation.

       -g     Set computation gain mode: fix, max or var

       -m     Set DAB mode: (0: auto, 1-4: force).

       -r     Set output sampling rate (default: 2048000).

       -l     Loop file when reach end of file.

       -h     Print this help.
