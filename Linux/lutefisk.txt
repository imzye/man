NAME
       lutefisk - software for the de novo interpretation of peptide CID spectra

SYNOPSIS
       lutefisk [-q ] [ -m ] [ -d] [ -p ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -v] [ -h]  [-o ] <infile>

DESCRIPTION
       lutefisk  is  a software for the de novo interpretation of peptide CID spectra. It takes peptide CID data and some ancillary data files (of which the location is specified on the command line) and
       outputs a results file containing all the sequences hypothetically matching the CID data.

       When you invoke lutefisk with the -h option, the program lists to the command line all the options that are available.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print a list of options

       -q     Run in quiet mode

       -m     Precursor ion mass

       -d     Pathname to the details file

       -p     Pathname to the params file

       -r     Pathname to the residues file

       -s     Pathname to the file with database sequences to score

       -v     Run in verbose mode

       -o     Output file

       <infile>
              CID data file

PROGRAM DATA
       The data required to run the program are located in /usr/share/lutefisk.

EXAMPLE DATA
       Example data are located in /usr/share/doc/lutefisk/examples.
