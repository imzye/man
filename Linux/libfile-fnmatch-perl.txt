NAME
       File::FnMatch - simple filename and pathname matching

SYNOPSIS
         use File::FnMatch qw(:fnmatch);    # import everything

         # shell-style: match "/a/bc", but not "/a/.bc" nor "/a/b/c"
         fnmatch("/a/*", $fn, FNM_PATHNAME|FNM_PERIOD);

         # find our A- executables only
         grep { fnmatch("A-*.exe", $_) } readdir SOMEDIR;

DESCRIPTION
       File::FnMatch::fnmatch() provides simple, shell-like pattern matching.

       Though considerably less powerful than regular expressions, shell patterns are nonetheless useful and familiar to a large audience of end-users.

   Functions
       fnmatch ( PATTERN, STRING [, FLAGS] )
           Returns true if PATTERN matches STRING, undef otherwise.  FLAGS may be the bitwise OR'ing of any supported FNM_* constants (see below).

   Constants
       FNM_NOESCAPE
           Do not treat a backslash ('\') in PATTERN specially.  Otherwise, a backslash escapes the following character.

       FNM_PATHNAME
           Prohibit wildcards from matching a slash ('/').

       FNM_PERIOD
           Prohibit wildcards from matching a period ('.') at the start of a string and, if FNM_PATHNAME is also given, immediately after a slash.

       Other  possibilities  include at least FNM_CASEFOLD (compare "qr//i"), FNM_LEADING_DIR to restrict matching to everything before the first '/', FNM_FILE_NAME as a synonym for FNM_PATHNAME, and the
       rather more exotic FNM_EXTMATCH.  Consult your system documentation for details.

   EXPORT
       None by default.  The export tag ":fnmatch" exports the fnmatch function and all available FNM_* constants.

PATTERN SYNTAX
       Wildcards are the question mark ('?') to match any single character and the asterisk ('*') to match zero or more characters.  FNM_PATHNAME and FNM_PERIOD  restrict  the  scope  of  the  wildcards,
       notably supporting the UNIX convention of concealing "dotfiles":

       Bracket  expressions,  enclosed  by  '['  and  ']',  match  any  of  a  set  of  characters specified explicitly ("[abcdef]"), as a range ("[a-f0-9]"), or as the combination these ("[a-f0-9XYZ]").
       Additionally, many implementations support named character classes such as "[[:xdigit:]]".  Character sets may be negated with an initial '!' ("[![:space:]]").

       Locale influences the meaning of fnmatch() patterns.

CAVEATS
       Most UNIX-like systems provide an fnmatch implementation.  This module will not work on platforms lacking an implementation, most notably Win32.
