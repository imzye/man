NAME
       crontab - tables for driving cron

DESCRIPTION
       A crontab file contains instructions to the cron(8) daemon of the general form: “run this command at this time on this date”. Each user has their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab
       will be executed as the user who owns the crontab. Uucp and News will usually have their own crontabs, eliminating the need for explicitly running su(1) as part of a cron command.

       Note that comments on the same line as cron commands are not interpreted as comments in the cron sense, but are considered part of the command and passed to the shell. This is similarly true for
       comments on the same line as environment variable settings.

       An active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or a cron command. An environment setting is of the form,

           name = value

       where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any subsequent non-leading spaces in value will be part of the value assigned to name. The value string may be placed in quotes (single
       or double, but matching) to preserve leading or trailing blanks. To define an empty variable, quotes can be used.

       The value string is not parsed for environmental substitutions or replacement of variables or tilde(~) expansion, thus lines like

           PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
           PATH=~/bin:/usr/bin

       will not work as you might expect. And neither will this work.

           A=1
           B=2
           C=$A $B

       There will not be any substitution for the defined variables in the last value. However, with most shells you can also try e.g.,:

           P=PATH=/a/b/c:$PATH
           33 22 1 2 3 eval $P && some commands

       Several environment variables are set up automatically by the cron(8) daemon.  SHELL is set to /usr/bin/sh, and LOGNAME and HOME are set from the /etc/passwd line of the crontab's owner.  HOME and
       SHELL may be overridden by settings in the crontab; LOGNAME may not.

       (Another note: the LOGNAME variable is sometimes called USER on BSD systems... on these systems, USER will be set also.)

       In addition to LOGNAME, HOME, and SHELL, cron(8) will look at MAILTO if it has any reason to send mail as a result of running commands in “this” crontab. If MAILTO is defined (and non-empty), mail
       is sent to the user so named. If MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=""), no mail will be sent. Otherwise mail is sent to the owner of the crontab. This option is useful if you decide on
       /usr/bin/mail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail as your mailer when you install cron -- /usr/bin/mail doesn't do aliasing, and UUCP usually doesn't read its mail.

       The format of a cron command is very much the V7 standard, with a number of upward-compatible extensions. Each line has five time and date fields, followed by a command, followed by a newline
       character ('\n'). The system crontab (/etc/crontab) uses the same format, except that the username for the command is specified after the time and date fields and before the command. The fields
       may be separated by spaces or tabs. The maximum permitted length for the command field is 998 characters.

       Commands are executed by cron(8) when the minute, hour, and month of year fields match the current time, and when at least one of the two day fields (day of month, or day of week) match the
       current time (see “Note” below).  cron(8) examines cron entries once every minute. The time and date fields are:
       ┌──────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐
       │ field        │ allowed values                    │
       ├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
       │ minute       │ 0-59                              │
       ├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
       │ hour         │ 0-23                              │
       ├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
       │ day of month │ 0-31                              │
       ├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
       │ month        │ 0-12 (or names, see below)        │
       ├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
       │ day of week  │ 0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names) │
       └──────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘

       A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for “first-last”.

       Ranges of numbers are allowed. Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen. The specified range is inclusive. For example, 8-11 for an “hours” entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and
       11.

       Lists are allowed. A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas. Examples: “1,2,5,9”, “0-4,8-12”.

       Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a range with “/<number>” specifies skips of the number's value through the range. For example, “0-23/2” can be used in the hours field
       to specify command execution every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard is “0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22”). Steps are also permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say “every two
       hours”, just use “*/2”.

       Names can also be used for the “month” and “day of week” fields. Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case doesn't matter). Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.

       The “sixth” field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be run. The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or % character, will be executed by /usr/bin/sh or by the shell
       specified in the SHELL variable of the cronfile. Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will
       be sent to the command as standard input.

       Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two fields — day of month, and day of week. If both fields are restricted (i.e., aren't *), the command will be run when either field
       matches the current time. For example, “30 4 1,15 * 5” would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday. One can, however, achieve the desired result
       by adding a test to the command (see the last example in EXAMPLE CRON FILE below).

       Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may appear:
       ┌───────────┬────────────────────────────────┐
       │ string    │ meaning                        │
       ├───────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
       │ @reboot   │ Run once, at startup.          │
       ├───────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
       │ @yearly   │ Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".  │
       ├───────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
       │ @annually │ (same as @yearly)              │
       ├───────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
       │ @monthly  │ Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *". │
       ├───────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
       │ @weekly   │ Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".  │
       ├───────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
       │ @daily    │ Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".   │
       ├───────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
       │ @midnight │ (same as @daily)               │
       ├───────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
       │ @hourly   │ Run once an hour, "0 * * * *". │
       └───────────┴────────────────────────────────┘

       Please note that startup, as far as @reboot is concerned, is the time when the cron(8) daemon startup. In particular, it may be before some system daemons, or other facilities, were startup. This
       is due to the boot order sequence of the machine.

EXAMPLE CRON FILE
           # use /usr/bin/sh to run commands, no matter what /etc/passwd says
           SHELL=/usr/bin/sh
           # mail any output to `paul', no matter whose crontab this is
           MAILTO=paul
           #
           # run five minutes after midnight, every day
           5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1
           # run at 2:15pm on the first of every month -- output mailed to paul
           15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
           # run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
           0 22 * * 1-5    mail -s "It's 10pm" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
           23 0-23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
           5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every Sunday"
           0 */4 1 * mon   echo "run every 4th hour on the 1st and on every Monday"
           0 0 */2 * sun   echo "run at midn on every Sunday that's an uneven date"
           # Run on every second Saturday of the month
           0 4 8-14 * *    test $(date +\%u) -eq 6 && echo "2nd Saturday"
           # Same thing, efficient too:
           0 4 * * * Sat   d=$(date +e) && test $d -ge 8 -a $d -le 14 && echo "2nd Saturday"
           #Execute early the next morning following the first
           #Thursday of each month
           57 2 * * 5 case $(date +d) in 0[2-8]) echo "After 1st Thursday"; esac

       All the above examples run non-interactive programs. If you wish to run a program that interacts with the user's desktop you have to make sure the proper environment variable DISPLAY is set.

           # Execute a program and run a notification every day at 10:00 am
           0 10 * * *  $HOME/bin/program | DISPLAY=:0 notify-send "Program run" "$(cat)"

EXAMPLE SYSTEM CRON FILE
       The following lists the content of a regular system-wide crontab file. Unlike a user's crontab, this file has the username field, as used by /etc/crontab.

           # /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
           # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
           # command to install the new version when you edit this file
           # and files in /etc/cron.d.  These files also have username fields,
           # that none of the other crontabs do.

           SHELL=/bin/sh
           PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

           # Example of job definition:
           # .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
           # |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
           # |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
           # |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
           # |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
           # m h dom mon dow usercommand
           17 * * * *  root  cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
           25 6 * * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
           47 6 * * 7  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
           52 6 1 * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
           #

       Note that all the system-wide tasks will run, by default, from 6 am to 7 am. In the case of systems that are not powered on during that period of time, only the hourly tasks will be executed
       unless the defaults above are changed.

YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE
       In that example one can see that numbers can be prepended some 0, in order to line up columns.

           17  * * * *  root  cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
           25 16 * * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
           47 06 * * 7  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
           52 06 1 * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )

EXTENSIONS
       When specifying day of week, both day 0 and day 7 will be considered Sunday. BSD and AT&T seem to disagree about this.

       Lists and ranges are allowed to co-exist in the same field. "1-3,7-9" would be rejected by AT&T or BSD cron -- they want to see "1-3" or "7,8,9" ONLY.

       Ranges can include "steps", so "1-9/2" is the same as "1,3,5,7,9".

       Names of months or days of the week can be specified by name.

       Environment variables can be set in the crontab. In BSD or AT&T, the environment handed to child processes is basically the one from /etc/rc.

       Command output is mailed to the crontab owner (BSD can't do this), can be mailed to a person other than the crontab owner (SysV can't do this), or the feature can be turned off and no mail will be
       sent at all (SysV can't do this either).

       All of the “@” commands that can appear in place of the first five fields are extensions.

LIMITATIONS
       The cron daemon runs with a defined timezone. It currently does not support per-user timezones. All the tasks: system's and user's will be run based on the configured timezone. Even if a user
       specifies the TZ environment variable in his crontab this will affect only the commands executed in the crontab, not the execution of the crontab tasks themselves. If one wants to specify a
       particular timezone for crontab tasks, one may check the date in the child script, for example:

           # m h  dom mon dow   command

           TZ=UTC
           0 * * * * [ "$(date +\%R)" = 00:00 ] && run_some_script

       POSIX specifies that the day of month and the day of week fields both need to match the current time if either of them is a *. However, this implementation only checks if the first character is a
       *. This is why "0 0 */2 * sun" runs every Sunday that's an uneven date while the POSIX standard would have it run every Sunday and on every uneven date.

       The crontab syntax does not make it possible to define all possible periods one can imagine. For example, it is not straightforward to define the last weekday of a month. To have a task run in a
       time period that cannot be defined using crontab syntax, the best approach would be to have the program itself check the date and time information and continue execution only if the period matches
       the desired one.

       If the program itself cannot do the checks then a wrapper script would be required. Useful tools that could be used for date analysis are ncal(1) or calendar(1). For example, to run a program the
       last Saturday of every month you could use the following wrapper code:

           0 4 * * Sat   [ "$(date +\%e)" = "$(LANG=C ncal | sed -n 's/^Sa .* \([0-9]\+\) *$/\1/p')" ] && echo "Last Saturday" && program_to_run

USING EVAL TO WRAP MISC ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS
       The following tip is kindly provided by 積丹尼 Dan Jacobson:

           CONTENT_TYPE="text/plain; charset=UTF-8"
           d=eval LANG=zh_TW.UTF-8 w3m -dump
           26 22 16 1-12 * $d https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/transgender/index.html

       it won't work without the eval. Saying

           d=LANG=zh_TW.UTF-8 w3m -dump

       will get

           /bin/sh: LANG=zh_TW.UTF-8: command not found

DIAGNOSTICS
       cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character. If the last entry in a crontab is missing a newline (i.e. terminated by EOF), cron will consider the crontab (at least
       partially) broken. A warning will be written to syslog.
