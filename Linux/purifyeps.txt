NAME
       purifyeps - make an Encapsulated PostScript file work with both dvips and pdflatex

SYNOPSIS
       purifyeps --help

       purifyeps --version

       purifyeps [--fontmap=.fmp file] [.eps input file [.eps output file]]

       purifyeps --make-man[=filename] [--section=section]

       purifyeps --make-ps-man[=filename] [--section=section]

DESCRIPTION
       While pdflatex has a number of nice features, its primary shortcoming relative to standard latex+dvips is that it is unable to read ordinary Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files, the most common
       graphics format in the LaTeX world.  pdflatex can read only the following types of graphics files:

       PDF Most  people  who use pdflatex convert their documents to PDF using a utility such as epstopdf.  This works well and preserves the vector nature of the original EPS.  Unfortunately, dvips does
           not read PDF, so two versions of the graphic must be maintained if the document is to be processed with both latex+dvips and pdflatex.

       PNG PNG is a bitmap format and therefore scales poorly.  Also, dvips does not read PNG, so two versions of the graphic must be maintained if the document is to be processed with  both  latex+dvips
           and pdflatex.

       JPEG
           JPEG is a bitmap format and therefore scales poorly.  Also, dvips does not read JPEG, so two versions of the graphic must be maintained if the document is to be processed with both latex+dvips
           and pdflatex.

       MPS This  is  probably  the  least-used pdflatex-compatible graphics format.  MPS is actually a stylized version of EPS that MetaPost outputs.  Like PDF, MPS is a vector format and remains as such
           when imported into a pdflatex document.  Also like PDF, dvips does not read MPS, so two versions of the graphic must be maintained if the document is to be processed with both latex+dvips  and
           pdflatex.

       The  insight  behind  purifyeps  is that there are only a few, small differences between MPS and EPS and that a file can be converted into a format that matches both the MPS and EPS specifications
       simultaneously.  purifyeps inputs an EPS file, uses pstoedit's "mpost" filter to convert the file to MetaPost (.mp), runs mpost on the file to convert it to MPS, and finally performs some touchups
       on the result to convert the file back to EPS, while preserving its ability to be parsed by pdflatex.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display "Usage" and "Options" from the purifyeps documentation.

       -V, --version
           Display the purifyeps version number, copyright, and license.

       --fontmap=.fmp file
           Specify the name of a file that tells purifyeps how to map from TeX font names to PostScript font names.  [Default: mpost.fmp]

       --make-man [=filename]] [--section=section]
           Automatically create a Unix man page for purifyeps.  section specifies the section [default: 1 (User Commands)].  filename defaults to purifyeps.1  or  an  analogous  filename  if  section  is
           specified.

       --make-ps-man [=filename]] [--section=section]
           Automatically  create  a  PostScript  version of the purifyeps documentation.  The documentation is formatted like a Unix man page.  section specifies the section [default: 1 (User Commands)].
           filename defaults to purifyeps.ps.

       In normal operation (i.e., when not run with "--help", "--make-man", or "--make-ps-man"), purifyeps takes the name of an input file and output file.  The same filename can safely be used for  both
       files.  If the output filename is omitted, output will go to the standard output device.  If the input filename is omitted, purifyeps will read from the standard input device.

EXAMPLES
       Create a PostScript version of the purifyeps documentation, but call it happydoc.ps instead of the default, purifyeps.ps:

           purifyeps --make-ps-man=happydoc.ps

       Create a Unix man page for purifyeps (in the usual roff format), but indicate that it belongs in section "LOCAL" instead of the default of section 1:

           purifyeps --make-man --section=LOCAL

       Purify sample.eps (mpost.fmp is in the current directory):

           purifyeps sample.eps sample.eps

       Purify sample.eps (mpost.fmp is in a different location):

           purifyeps --fontmap=/usr/share/pstoedit/mpost.fmp sample.eps sample.eps

       Rename the purified version while purifying:

           purifyeps sample.eps sample-pure.eps

       Do the same, but in a Unix pipeline:

           cat sample.eps | purifyeps > sample-pure.eps

       When you run purifyeps, you should see the output from both pstoedit and mpost, followed by a success message from purifyeps:

           % cat sample.eps | purifyeps > sample-pure.eps
           pstoedit: version 3.30 / DLL interface 107 (build Mar 14 2002) :
           Copyright (C) 1993 - 2001 Wolfgang Glunz
           Interpreter finished. Return status 0
           This is MetaPost, Version 0.641 (Web2C 7.3.1)
           (/tmp/purifyeps-jdeGPkh9.mp [1] )
           1 output file written: purifyeps-jdeGPkh9.1
           Transcript written on purifyeps-jdeGPkh9.log.

           File seems to have been purified successfully.

FILES
       mpost.fmp
           File containing mappings between TeX and PostScript font names.  See "NOTES" for a description of this file's contents.

BUGS
       Error  reporting  could  definitely  stand to be improved.  Error messages produced by pstoedit and mpost are sometimes silently ignored.  Also, errors sometimes cause purifyeps to leave temporary
       files (purifyeps-#####) lying around.

       purifyeps is subject to all of the limitations that affect pstoedit and especially the "mpost" backend to pstoedit.   As  a  result,  purifyeps  ignores  certain  PostScript  constructs,  such  as
       nonuniformly scaled text.

NOTES
       purifyeps needs a file that tells it how to map from TeX font names to PostScript font names.  This file must contain two, space-separated columns.  The first lists a PostScript font name, and the
       second lists the TeX equivalent.  Blank lines and lines that start with "%" are ignored.  The following is a sample .fmp file:

           % This is a sample font map for purifyeps.
           Times-Bold                           ptmb
           Times-Italic                         ptmri
           Times-Roman                          ptmr
           Helvetica                            phvr
           Helvetica-Bold                       phvb
           Helvetica-Oblique                    phvro
           Courier                              pcrr
           Courier-Bold                         pcrb
           Courier-Oblique                      pcrro

       Note  that  this  is  exactly  the same format that pstoedit uses.  By default, purifyeps looks in the current directory for a font map called mpost.fmp.  The "--fontmap" command-line option tells
       purifyeps to use a different font map, which will typically be the mpost.fmp file that comes with pstoedit.

       Once you create purified EPS files with purifyeps, you need to instruct pdflatex to use them.  The pdfLaTeX configuration of the "graphics" and "graphicx" packages  (pdftex.def)  normally  ignores
       .eps files.  Putting the following LaTeX code in your document's preamble tells pdflatex that all .eps files are in MPS format:

           % Tell pdfLaTeX that all .eps files were produced by MetaPost.
           \usepackage{graphicx} % or graphics
           \usepackage{ifpdf}
           \ifpdf
             \DeclareGraphicsRule{.eps}{mps}{*}{}
             \makeatletter
               \g@addto@macro\Gin@extensions{,.eps}
             \makeatother
           \fi
