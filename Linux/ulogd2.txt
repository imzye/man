NAME
       ulogd - netfilter/iptables logging daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ulogd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ulogd  is  a logging daemon that reads event messages coming from the Netfilter connection tracking, the Netfilter packet logging subsystem and from the Netfilter accounting subsystem. You have to
       enable support for connection tracking event delivery; ctnetlink and the NFLOG target in your Linux kernel 2.6.x or load their respective modules. The deprecated ULOG target (which has been super‐
       seded by NFLOG) is no longer supported.

       The received messages can be logged into files or into a mySQL, sqlite3 or PostgreSQL database. IPFIX and Graphite output are also supported.
