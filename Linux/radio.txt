NAME
       radio - console radio application

SYNOPSIS
       radio [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       radio is a interactive, ncurses-bases console radio application.

OPTIONS
       -h     print a short help text.

       -d     enable debug output.

       -q     quit after processing the cmd line options, don't enter interactive ncurses mode.  Only useful together with other options for obvious reasons ...

       -m     mute radio.

       -f freq
              tune the specified radio frequency (and unmute the radio).

       -c dev specify radio device (default is /dev/radio0).

       -s     Do a scan for radio stations.

       -S     Same as above + write a radio.fmmap with the signal for every frequency.  You can get a graph for it with gnuplot (plot "radio.fmmap" w lin).

       -i     Scan, write a initial ~/.radio file to stdout and quit.  So you can create a config file where you only have to fill in the correct station names later this way: "radio -i > ~/.radio".  See
              below for the config file syntax.

CONFIGURATION
       radio  picks  up  station  names  and  present  stations  from  a  config  file.   It  can  parse  kradio (KDE radio app) config files, therefore it first tries the usual KDE config file location:
       ~/.kde/share/config/kradiorc. Failing that, radio tries ~/.radio (which makes things a bit easier for people who don't use kradio).

       The format looks like this:

       # KDE Config File
       [Buttons]
       1=95800000
       2=91400000
       [Stations]
       100600000=Hundert,6
       95800000=Radio eins
       102600000=Fritz
       94300000=r.s.2
       91400000=Berliner Rundfunk

       The [Buttons] section can have up to eight entries.  That are the present stations, they get mapped to F1-F8.  The [Stations] section maps frequencies to station names.  The  frequencies  in  both
       sections are specified in Hz.

KEYS
       X         exit
       ESC,Q,E      mute and exit.
       up/down      inc/dec frequency
       pgup/pgdown  next/previous station.  This one uses the
                    stations from the config file by default.
                    When started with the -s option these keys
                    will cycle througth the stations found during
                    the scan.
       F1-F8, 1-8   preset buttons.
       Ctrl+L       redraw screen.
