NAME
       minidlna.conf — MiniDLNA server configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/minidlna.conf

DESCRIPTION
       minidlnad(1)  reads  configuration  options from the system-wide configuration file /etc/minidlna.conf, or the file specified with -f on the command line. The file contains keyword-argument pairs,
       one per line.  Lines starting with ‘#’ and empty lines are interpreted as comments.

       The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows:

       album_art_names
               List of filenames to check for when searching for album art cache, separated by forward slashes (‘/’).  This option can be specified more than once.

       db_dir  Path to the directory minidlnad should use to store its database and album art cache. Uses /var/lib/minidlna by default.

       enable_tivo
               Support for streaming .jpg and .mp3 files to a TiVo supporting HMO. Set to “yes” to enable support for streaming JPEG and mp3 files to a TiVo supporting HMO.  Set to “no” (default)  other‐
               wise.

       friendly_name
               Customize the name that the minidlnad server sends to clients. Defaults to “hostname: username”.

       force_sort_criteria
               Always set SortCriteria to this value, regardless of the SortCriteria passed by the clien t. ( E.g. force_sort_criteria=+upnp:class,+upnp:originalTrackNumber,+dc:title )

       inotify
               Set to “yes” to enable inotify monitoring of the files under media_dir to automatically discover new files. Set to “no” to disable inotify.

       network_interface
               Comma separated list of network interfaces to bind to. Default is empty which means bind to all.

       log_dir
               Path to the directory where the log file should be stored. Defaults to /var/log/minidlna.  Not used when "systemd" mode is activated with -S switch.

       log_level
               Defines the type of messages that should be logged, and down to which level of importance they should be considered.

               The possible types are “artwork”, “database”, “general”, “http”, “inotify”, “metadata”, “scanner”, “ssdp” and “tivo”.

               The  levels are “off”, “fatal”, “error”, “warn”, “info” and “debug”, listed here in order of decreasing importance.  “off” turns off logging messages entirely, “fatal” logs the most criti‐
               cal messages only, and so on down to “debug” that logs every single messages.

               The types are comma-separated, followed by an equal sign (‘=’), followed by a level that applies to the preceding types. This can be repeated, separating each of these  constructs  with  a
               comma.

               Defaults to “general,artwork,database,inotify,scanner,metadata,http,ssdp,tivo=warn” which logs every type of message at the “warn” level.

       max_connections
               Specify maximum number of simultaneous connections. Note: many clients open several simultaneous connections while streaming.

       media_dir
               Path  to  the  directory containing the media files the minidlnad server should share. Use this option several times if you have more than one directory to share. To restrict a path to one
               specific media type, you can use the following syntax: the letter ‘A’, ‘V’ or ‘P’, followed by a comma (‘,’) followed by the path. The meaning of the first letter is as follows:
                     •   ‘A’ for audio files;
                     •   ‘V’ for video files;
                     •   ‘P’ for image files.

               For example, if you want to include only video files located in /srv/multimedia/videos directory, and only music in /srv/multimedia/music, then you would use
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/videos
                      media_dir=A,/srv/multimedia/music

               Another example would be
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/videos
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/movies
                      media_dir=A,/srv/multimedia/music

               Or, if you did not care what type it finds, then you could use
                      media_dir=/srv/multimedia/videos
                      media_dir=/srv/multimedia/movies
                      media_dir=/srv/multimedia/music

               You can mix it up, find anything in music, but only Videos, in videos and movies
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/videos
                      media_dir=V,/srv/multimedia/movies
                      media_dir=/srv/multimedia/music

       merge_media_dirs
               Merge all media_dir base contents into the root container. The default value is no.

       minissdpdsocket
               Path to the MiniSSDPd socket, if you want to use minidlnad together with MiniSSDPd. Defaults to /run/minissdpd.sock.

       model_name
               Set the model name reported to clients.  Defaults to “Windows Media Connect compatible (MiniDLNA)”.

       model_number
               Set the model number reported to clients. Defaults to the version number of minidlnad.

       network_interface
               Network interface(s) to bind to (e.g. eth0), comma delimited. This option can be specified more than once. If unspecified or empty, minidlnad binds to  all  the  valid  network  interfaces
               (except loopback).

       notify_interval
               Set the notify interval, in seconds. The default is 895 seconds.

       port    Port number for HTTP traffic (descriptions, SOAP, media transfe).  This option is mandatory, unless the port number is specified on the command-line using -p (see minidlnad(1)).

       presentation_url
               Define the URL presented to clients (e.g. “http://example.com:80”).  The default is ‘/’.

       root_container
               Use a different container as the root of the tree exposed to clients. The possible values
                     •   ‘.’ to use the standard container (this is the default);
                     •   ‘B’ to use the “Browse Directory” container;
                     •   ‘M’ to use the “Music” container;
                     •   ‘V’ to use the “Video” container;
                     •   ‘P’ to use the “Pictures” container.
               If you specify ‘B’ and the client device is audio only, then “Music/Folders” will be used as the root container.

       serial  Set the serial number reported to clients. Defaults to MAC address od network interface.

       strict_dlna
               Set  to “yes” to strictly adhere to DLNA standards. This will allow server-side downscaling of very large JPEG images, which may hurt JPEG serving performance on (at least) Sony DLNA prod‐
               ucts. Set to “no” otherwise.

       tivo_discovery
               Which method to use for registering in TiVo. By default “bonjour” is used. You can switch to legacy “beacon” method.

       user    Specify the user name or UID to run as. Beware that if you are using an init system to start  minidlnad,  then  this  option  has  no  effect  and  you  should  override  default  user  in
               minidlna.service for systemd or set USER in /etc/default/minidlna for sysV init.

       uuid    Specify device's UPnP UUID minidlna should use. By default MAC address is used to build uniq UUID.

       wide_links
               Set to “yes” to allow symlinks that point outside user-defined media_dir. By default, wide symlinks are not followed.

       enable_subtitles
               Set to “no” to disable subtitles support for unknown clients.

       enable_thumbnail
               Set  to “yes” to enable thumbnails generation for video files.  To use this option, thumbnail generation must be enable at compile time. See the following options to set thumbnails parame‐
               ters.

       thumbnail_width
               The width of the thumbnail image in pixels. Large images takes more time to generate. The default width is 160.

       thumbnail_quality
               Thumbnail Image quality. The default value is 8.

       enable_thumbnail_filmstrip
               Set to “yes” to make thumbnails have a film strip.
