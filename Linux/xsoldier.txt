SYNOPSIS
       xsoldier [-dwcsh] [-displayname] [-waitnumber] [-cmap] [-score] [-help] [-maxlevel]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       xsoldier is a space-based shoot'em up game. You fly around and try to kill everything that moves... and everything that doesn't move... You get the idea.

OPTIONS

              The (X window) display on which you want to play the game.

       -w, -wait number
              Set the speed of the game. A higher number means the game runs slower. If you use this option the ranking mode is turned off.

       -c, -cmap
              Do nothing (only for backward compatibility).

       -s, -score
              Show the TOP10 soldiers, i.e. the highscore.

       -h, -help
              Show a short help text and exit.

       -maxlevel
              Force max level enemy attack, making your life really harder.

       -nopausemessage
              Don't show "Press [p] to resume game." message when the game is paused.  Useful for capturing a screen snapshot.
