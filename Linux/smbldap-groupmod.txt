SYNOPSIS
       smbldap-groupmod [-g gid [-o]] [-a] [-r rid] [-s sid] [-t group type] [-n group_name ] [-m members(,)] [-x members (,)] group

DESCRIPTION
       The smbldap-groupmod command modifies the system account files to reflect the changes that are specified on the command line. The options which apply to the smbldap-groupmod command are

       -g gid The numerical value of the group's ID. This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used. The value must be non negative. Any files which the old group ID is the file roup ID must have
       the file group ID changed manually.

       -n group_name
          The name of the group will be changed from group to group_name.

       -m members
          The members to be added to the group in comma-delimeted form.

       -x members
          The members to be removed from the group in comma-delimted form.

       -a
          add an automatic Security ID for the group (SID).

       -s sid
          set the group SID.
          The SID must be unique and defined with the domain Security ID ($SID) like sid=$SID-rid where rid is the group rid.

       -r rid
          set the group rid.
          The SID is then calculated as sid=$SID-rid where $SID is the domain Security ID.

       -t group type
          set the NT Group type for the new group. Available values are 2 (domain group), 4 (local group) and 5 (builtin group). The default group type is 2.
