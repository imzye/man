NAME
       gox - simple cross compilation tool for Go

USAGE EXAMPLE
       $ gox -osarch="freebsd/386" github.com/foo/bar

DESCRIPTION
       Gox  is a cross compiling build tool for Go which makes it possible to produce binaries for foreign platforms without having to install Go on the targeted system. Several operating systems and ar‐
       chitectures are supported, while parallel building on multiple cores is possible.

       Gox supports several target operating systems and architectures, as they are supported by the current version of the Go compiler.  Currently, choices for (-os) are: darwin (Mac OS 10.7 and above),
       windows, linux, freebsd, openbsd, netbsd, and plan9.  Choices for (-arch) are: amd64 (64-bit X86), 386 (32-bit x86), arm (32-bit ARM), and arm64 (64-bit ARM).  If no options are given, gox  builds
       all available pairs (-osarch) in parallel on all available cores.

       Note: for the use of gox the environment variable $GOPATH must be set correctly to /usr/share/gocode. See $ go help gopath for information on this issue.

OPTIONS
       Please run gox -h for a complete list of options and additional information.
