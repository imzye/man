NAME
       aalib-config - script to get information about the installed version of aalib

SYNOPSIS
       aalib-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--static-libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       aalib-config  is  a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use aalib. It is also used internally to the .m4
       macros for GNU autoconf that are included with aalib.

OPTIONS
       aalib-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of aalib on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a aalib program.

       --static-libs
               Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a aalib program statically.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a aalib program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that aalib was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for  the  exec
               prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that aalib was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified be‐
               fore any --libs or --cflags options.
