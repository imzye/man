NAME
       xmms2-mdns-avahi - announces XMMS2 via mDNS

SYNOPSIS
       xmms2-mdns-avahi

DESCRIPTION
       XMMS2  is  a redesign of the XMMS (http://xmms2.org) music player. It features a client-server model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual and graphical. All common
       audio formats are supported using plugins. On top of this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.

       xmms2-mdns-avahi is the Avahi mDNS announcing client for XMMS2.  xmms2-mdns-avahi is designed to announce the presence of an accessible XMMS2 TCP socket if one is available.

       xmms2-mdns-avahi offers a _xmms2._tcp service if, and only if, the XMMS_PATH_FULL enviornmental variable contains a TCP socket. This allows clients that support mDNS discovery to easily locate and
       connect to this xmms2d(1) instance.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
       XMMS_PATH_FULL
              A complete list of URL paths separated by ';' pointed to the xmms2d(1).  See IPC SOCKET in xmms2d(1) for details of possible values for this variable
