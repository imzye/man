NAME
       zebra - a routing manager for use with associated Quagga components.

SYNOPSIS
       zebra [ -bdhklrv ] [ -f config-file ] [ -i pid-file ] [ -P port-number ] [ -A vty-address ] [ -u user ] [ -g group ]

DESCRIPTION
       zebra is a routing manager that implements the zebra route engine.  zebra supports RIPv1, RIPv2, RIPng, OSPF, OSPF6, IS-IS, BGP4+, and BGP4-.

OPTIONS
       Options available for the zebra command:

       -b, --batch
              Runs in batch mode, zebra parses its config and exits.

       -d, --daemon
              Runs in daemon mode, forking and exiting from tty.

       -f, --config-file config-file
              Specifies the config file to use for startup. If not specified this option will likely default to /usr/local/etc/zebra.conf.

       -g, --group group
              Specify the group to run as. Default is quagga.

       -h, --help
              A brief message.

       -i, --pid_file pid-file
              When zebra starts its process identifier is written to pid-file.  The init system uses the recorded PID to stop or restart zebra.  The likely default is /var/run/zebra.pid.

       -k, --keep_kernel
              On startup, don't delete self inserted routes.

       -P, --vty_port port-number
              Specify the port that the zebra VTY will listen on. This defaults to 2601, as specified in /etc/services.

       -A, --vty_addr vty-address
              Specify the address that the zebra VTY will listen on. Default is all interfaces.

       -u, --user user
              Specify the user to run as. Default is quagga.

       -r, --retain
              When the program terminates, retain routes added by zebra.

       -s, --nl-bufsize netlink-buffer-size
              Set netlink receive buffer size. There are cases where zebra daemon can't handle flood of netlink messages from kernel. If you ever see "recvmsg overrun" messages in zebra log, you are in trou‐
              ble.

              Solution is to increase receive buffer of netlink socket. Note that kernel < 2.6.14 doesn't allow increasing it over the maximum value defined in /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max. If you want to  do
              it, you have to increase maximum before starting zebra.

              Note that this affects Linux only.

       -v, --version
              Print the version and exit.

FILES
       /usr/local/sbin/zebra
              The default location of the zebra binary.

       /usr/local/etc/zebra.conf
              The default location of the zebra config file.

       $(PWD)/zebra.log
              If the zebra process is config'd to output logs to a file, then you will find this file in the directory where you started zebra.

WARNING
       This man page is intended to be a quick reference for command line options. The definitive document is the Info file Quagga.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The zebra process may log to standard output, to a VTY, to a log file, or through syslog to the system logs. zebra supports many debugging options, see the Info file, or the source for details.
