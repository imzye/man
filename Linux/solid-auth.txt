ENVIRONMENT
       SOLID_WEBID
           Your WebId.

       SOLID_REMOTE_BASE
           The Base URL that is used for all delete, get, head, options post, put, patch requests.

       SOLID_CLIENT_ID
           The  URL  to  a  static  client  configuration.  See  "etc/web-solid-auth.jsonld"  for  an example.  This file, edited for your own environment, needs to be published on some public accessible
           webserver.

CONFIGURATION
       --webid
           Your WebId.

       --base
           The Base URL that is used for all delete, get, head, options post, put, patch requests.

       --clientid
           The URL to a static client configuration. See "etc/web-solid-auth.jsonld" for an example.  This file, edited for your  own  environment,  needs  to  be  published  on  some  public  accessible
           webserver.

       --skip
           Skip resources that already exist (mirror).

       --delete
           Delete local files that are not in the remote container (mirror).

       --keep
           Keep containers when cleaning data (clean).

       --etag=STRING
           Only update the data when the 'Etag' header matches the given string (put,patch). E.g.  use the "head" command to find the ETag of a resource :

               $ solid_auth head /demo/LICENSE
               ...
               ETag: "189aa19989dc47eab46c9f2e8c47d0836bb08cb09f7863cbf3cd3bb9a751be27"
               ...

           Now update the resource with ETag protection

               $ solid_auth \
                   --etag=189aa19989dc47eab46c9f2e8c47d0836bb08cb09f7863cbf3cd3bb9a751be27 \
                   put /demo/LICENSE LICENSE
