NAME
       pvfs2-mkdir – create directory in an OrangeFS volume

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-mkdir  [-m  mode]  [-i  initial]  [-x maximum] [-s split] [-pVvh]
       directory

DESCRIPTION
       The pvfs2-mkdir utility creates a directory in an  OrangeFS  volume  at
       directory.

       The options are as follows:

       -m     Set permission mode as three or four digit octal number mode.

       -i     Set initial number of dirdata handles.

       -x     Set maximum number of dirdata handles.

       -s     Set number of directory entries stored before split.

       -p     Create parent directories as needed within OrangeFS.

       -V     Display verbose messages.

       -v     Print version number and exit.

       -h     Display synopsis.

ENVIRONMENT
       PVFS2_DEBUGFILE
              If set to the path of a local file, redirect debug output to it.

       PVFS2_DEBUGMASK
              Set  the  OrangeFS debug mask.  Possible masks are documented in
              pvfs2-set-debugmask(1).

       PVFS2TAB_FILE
              If set, the full pathname for an alternate pvfs2tab file

FILES
       /etc/pvfs2tab

EXAMPLES
       Create a directory.

             pvfs2-mkdir /mnt/foo

       Create a directory  whose  entries  are  always  distributed  across  4
       servers.  In  this  case a split will never need to occur, so the split
       size is irrelevant.

             pvfs2-mkdir -i 4 -x 4 /mnt/foo

       Create a directory whose entries initially reside on 1 server, but  may
       eventually grow so that entries are distributed across 4 servers.  When
       any single server reaches the  maximum  of  10,000  directory  entries,
       another  of  the available servers becomes active and entries are split
       across active servers, up to a maximum of 4 servers.

             pvfs2-mkdir -i 1 -x 4 -s 10000 /mnt/foo
