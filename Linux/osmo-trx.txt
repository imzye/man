NAME
       osmo-trx-uhd - SDR transceiver that implements Layer 1 of a GSM BTS

SYNOPSIS
       osmo-trx [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the osmo-trx-uhd command.

       osmo-trx-uhd is a software-defined radio transceiver that implements the Layer 1 physical layer of a BTS comprising the following 3GPP specifications:

       For quickly getting started with a default configuration, run:

                            osmo-trx-uhd -C /usr/share/doc/osmo-trx/examples/osmo-trx.cfg

       TS 05.01 "Physical layer on the radio path"
       TS 05.02 "Multiplexing and Multiple Access on the Radio Path"
       TS 05.04 "Modulation"
       TS 05.10 "Radio subsystem synchronization"

       In this context, BTS is "Base transceiver station". It's the stations that connect mobile phones to the mobile network.

       3GPP is the "3rd Generation Partnership Project" which is the collaboration between different telecommunication associations for developing new generations of mobile phone networks. (post-2G/GSM)
