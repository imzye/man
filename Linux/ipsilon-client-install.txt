NAME
       ipsilon-client-install - Configure an Ipsilon client

SYNOPSIS
       ipsilon-client-install [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Configures a server to be used as a Service Provider (SP) in federation with an Ipsilon instance as its Identity Provider (IdP).

       By default, Apache is configured using mod_auth_mellon to handle the SAML 2 Federation.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help Show help message and exit

       --version
              Show program's version number and exit

       --hostname HOSTNAME
              Machine's fully qualified host name

       --port PORT
              Port number that SP listens on. The default is to not set a specific listen port. The --saml-secure-setup option can affect this.

       --admin-user ADMIN_USER

       --admin-password ADMIN_PASSWORD
              File containing the password for the account used to create a SP (- to read from stdin).  You can also provide the password in the IPSILON_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable.

       --httpd-user HTTPD_USER
              Web server account used. Some files created by the installation will be chown(1) to this user. The default is apache.

       --saml Boolean value whether to install a saml2 SP or not. Default is True.

       --saml-idp-url SAML_IDP_URL
              An URL of the Ipsilon instance to register the SP with.

       --saml-idp-metadata SAML_IDP_METADATA
              An URL pointing at the IDP Metadata (FILE or HTTP)

       --saml-no-httpd
              Do not configure httpd. The default is False.

       --saml-base SAML_BASE
              Where saml2 authdata is available (default: /)

       --saml-auth SAML_AUTH
              Where saml2 authentication is enforced. The default is /protected. This only applies when configuring Apache.

       --saml-sp SAML_SP
              Where saml communication happens. The default is /saml2.

       --saml-sp-logout SAML_SP_LOGOUT
              Single Logout URL. The default is /saml2/logout.

       --no-saml-soap-logout
              Disable Single Logout using SOAP.

       --saml-sp-post SAML_SP_POST
              Post response URL. The default is /saml2/postResponse.

       --saml-secure-setup
              Turn on all security checks. The default is True.

       --saml-nameid
              The saml2 NameID format that this SP will use. Must be one of: x509,transient,persistent,windows,encrypted,kerberos,email,unspecified,entity. The default is unspecified.

       --saml-sp-name SAML_SP_NAME
              The SP name to register with the IdP.

       --debug
              Turn on script debugging

       --uninstall
              Uninstall the ipsilon client

CERTIFICATES
       Two levels of SSL certificates may be used in an Ipsilon instalation.

       An  X509  signing  certificate  is  used  by  Ipsilon  to sign SAML 2 messages. The public key of the certificate is passed in the SAML metadata exchanged between the Identity Provider and the Service
       Provider. This certificate and key are automatically generated.

       Any page on the SP that will use the authentication provided by the IdP will need to be protected by SSL in order to access the secure cookie that the IdP provides. Ipsilon does not provide this  cer‐
       tificate.

EXAMPLES
       Install a SAML 2 SP using the  IdP instance idp on idp.example.com.

          # ipsilon-client-install --saml-idp-metadata https://idp.example.com/idp/saml2/metadata --saml-auth /protected

       Any unauthenticated request to /protected will trigger a redirect to the IdP for authentication.

       Once the SP has been generated it needs to be registered with the IdP.

EXIT STATUS
       0 if the installation was successful

       1 if an error occurred
