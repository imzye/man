NAME
       xmms2 - The official XMMS2 command line interface

SYNOPSIS
       xmms2 [command] [arguments]
       xmms2 help [command]

DESCRIPTION
       XMMS2  is a redesign of the XMMS (http://legacy.xmms2.org) music player. It features a client-server model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual and graphical. All com‐
       mon audio formats are supported using plugins. On top of this, there is a flexible media library to organise your music.

       xmms2 is the official CLI XMMS2 client.

INVOCATION
   Inline mode
       If xmms2 is passed a command as an argument, that command will be interpreted and xmms2 will exit after it is finished.

   Interactive mode
       xmms2 features a powerful shell-like environment via readline that allows the user to enter commands at a prompt and have the usual cool features such as pathname expansion and line editing.

COMMANDS
       All commands accept the option -h/--help which displays the command's help.

       pattern refers to a collection definition. (See PATTERN below.)

       position is a pattern to match playlist positions. (See POSITION PATTERN below.)

   General Commands
       add [ -f [-N] [-P] [-A key=value]... ] [-p playlist] [-n | -a position] [-o prop[,...]] arguments...
       add [-p playlist] [-n | -a position] [-o prop[,...]] pattern...

           Add media to a playlist. It will attempt to guess whether arguments constitute a pattern or represent file paths. This behaviour can be overridden by forcing the type with -f and -t. If file paths
           contain * or ?  characters, it will attempt to expand them. Failing to find a match the * and ? characters will be attempted to be added as a part of the URL.

           -f, --file
               Force treating arguments as file paths.

           -P, --pls
               Force treating arguments as playlist files. This option implies -f.

           -t, --pattern
               Force treating arguments as a pattern.

           -N, --non-recursive
               Do not add directories recursively.

           -p, --playlist playlist
               Add media to playlist instead of the active playlist.

           -n, --next
               Add media after the current track.

           -a, --at position
               Add media at the given position.

           -A, --attribute key=value
               Add media with given key=value attribute. May occur multiple times. Only valid when adding new files to the media library.

           -o, --order prop[,...]
               Add media sorted by the given comma-separated list of properties. If a property is prefixed by -, media are sorted in reverse order on that property.

       exit

           Exit the shell-like interface.

           vided, set the new value of the property.

           By default, set operations use source "client/xmms2-cli", while list and display operations use source-preference.  Use the --source option to override this behaviour.

           By default, the value will be used to determine whether it should be saved as a string or an integer.  Use the --int or --string flag to override this behaviour.

       server volume [-c name] [value]

           Get  or set the audio volume (in a range of 0-100).  If a value is provided, set the volume to value. Otherwise, display the current volume.  By default, the command applies to all audio channels.
           Use the --channel flag to override this behaviour.  Relative changes to the volume are possible by prefixing value by + or -.

           -c, --channel
               Get or set the volume only for the named channel.

PATTERN
       Patterns are used to search for songs in the media library, some of these patterns may require escaping (with '\') depending on what shell is used. The properties can be found in the output  of  xmms2
       info.

       <property>:<string>

           Match songs whose property matches the string. A ? in the string indicates a single wildcard character, and a * indicates multiple wildcard characters.

       <property>~<string>

           Match songs whose property fuzzily matches the string. Equal to matching by <property>:*<string>*.

       <property><operation><number>

           The operation can be <, <=, > or >=, the pattern will match songs whose property is a numerical value smaller, smaller or equal, bigger, bigger or equal in comparison to the number.

       +<property>

           Match songs which has the property.

       NOT <pattern>

           Match the complement of the pattern.

       <pattern> <pattern>
       <pattern> AND <pattern>

           Match songs that are matched by both patterns.

       <pattern> OR <pattern>

           Match songs that are matched by at least one of the two pattern.

       ( <pattern> )

           Match songs matched by the pattern, used for grouping AND and OR matches.

       <string>

           Match songs whose artist, title or album match the string.

       #<number>

           Match a specific media library id.

POSITION PATTERN
       Position patterns are used together with commands that operate on playlist content.

       M_N

           Select playlist entries ranging from M positions before the current song, to N positions after. Both M and N may be omitted and will then default to 0.

       -N

           Select the song N positions before the current song.

       +N

           Select the song N positions after the current song.

       pos0,pos1,...,posN

           Select one to many playlist positions.

FORMAT STRING
       Commands that output formatted metadata can be customized with the help of user-defined format strings like the following:

       ´${artist} - ${title}´

       When  passed  metadata the name of the artist and the title will be inserted into the resulting string. In addition to the metadata supplied from the media library the following list of properties are
       also available:

       position

           The current playlist position.

       playback_status

           The playback status as a string (Stopped, Playing, Paused, Unknown).

       playtime

           The playtime of the currently playing song.

       duration

           The duration of the current song, as zero-padded minutes:seconds

       minutes

           The minutes part, zero-padded, of the current song duration.

       seconds

           The seconds part, zero-padded, of the current song duration.

ALIASES
       A list of command aliases are read from the configuration file in the section [alias] at runtime. The syntax of xmms2 aliases are somewhat similar to bash and other shells. An alias is  defined  by  a
       list of semi-colon separated commands and arguments. Parameter expansion is supported (see Expansion below).

       The default configuration includes the following aliases:

       addpls

           add -f -P $@

       clear

           playlist clear

       status

           current -f $1

       ls

           list

       mute

           server volume 0

       quit

           server shutdown

       repeat

           seek 0

       scap

           stop ; playlist clear ; add $@ ; play

   Expansion
       Positional Parameters
           An alias can use positional parameters, for example:

           foo = add -f $1 $3

           foo ctkoz.ogg and slre.ogg

           Will result in:

           add -f ctkoz.ogg slre.ogg

       Special Parameters
           $@
               This expands to all parameters passed to the alias.

CONFIGURATION
       All control characters are interpreted as expected, including ANSI escape sequences.

       AUTO_UNIQUE_COMPLETE
           Boolean, complete an abbreviation of a command and it's arguments. For example: `serv vol 42' will complete to `server volume 42'. (Note: Abbreviations must be non-ambiguous)
