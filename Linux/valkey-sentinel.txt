NAME
       valkey-sentinel - Persistent key-value database (cluster mode)

SYNOPSIS
       valkey-sentinel configfile

DESCRIPTION
       Valkey is a key-value database. It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile and other datatypes (such as lists and sets) are natively supported.

OPTIONS
       configfile
              Read options from specified configuration file.

NOTES
       On  Debian GNU/Linux systems, valkey-sentinel is typically started via the /etc/init.d/valkey-sentinel initscript, not manually. This defaults to using /etc/valkey/sentinel.conf as a configuration
       file.
