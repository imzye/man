NAME
       81voltd - Server-side implementation of the QMI IMS Data service

SYNOPSIS
       81voltd

DESCRIPTION
       81voltd  is  a  simple  implementation  of the IMS Data service on QMI/QRTR. It handles the known and important requests to start and stop a connection through the ModemManager D-Bus API, treating
       other requests as no operation.  The IMS Data service is mandatory to support voice call on 4G/5G mobile network.

BUGS
       Stopping the implementation does not release or disconnect any bearers. This makes it hard to debug, requiring the modem be set to low-power, then back online.

       ModemManager errors are not communicated to the modem.
