NAME
       X11::Keyboard - Keyboard support functions for X11

SYNOPSIS
        use X11::Protocol;
        use X11::Keyboard;

        $x = X11::Protocol->new();
        $k = X11::Keyboard->new($x);
        $keysym = $k->StringToKeysym("plus");
        print $k->KeysymToKeycode($keysym);

        # or, more simply
        print $k->KeysymToKeycode("plus");

DESCRIPTION
       This module is meant to provide access to the keyboard functions of X11.  Whilst the functions names are essentially identical to those used in xlib (minus the prepended X), the parameter lists
       and return values are different as specified in this document.

METHODS
       An object oriented interface is provided as follows:

   new <x-connection>
       Used to initialise the system, this method requires a handle to an X connection (typically generated using the X11::Protocol module) and returns an object instance.

   keysym-num = StringToKeysym [keysym-name = $_]
       This method requires a keysym name and returns its corresponding numeric value.  If no name is provided, $_ is used.

       - exempli gratia -

        $c = $k->StringToKeysym("Backspace");
        # $c now contains 65288

   keycode [state] = KeysymToKeycode [keysym-[num|name] = $_]
       This method returns the keycode corresponding to the passed-in keysym name or number (if neither is passed $_ is used).  In such cases where the keysym name evaluates to a numeric value e.g.
       [0-9], the caller is responsible for first converting the value to a true keysym-num.

       The method can also return the associated state.  If the calling context is a list it is returned, if scalar, only the keycode is returned.
