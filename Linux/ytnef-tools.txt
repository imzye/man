DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ytnef program.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       ytnef is a command line utility which allows parsing and extracting the files contained in TNEF attachments, also known as winmail.dat attachments.

       -f|+f   Enables/disables saving of attachments.

       -v|+v   Enables/disables verbose output. This option can be specified multiple times to increase/decrease the verbosity level of output.

       -F|+F   Enables/disables saving of the message body as RTF.

       -h      Displays a brief help message.
