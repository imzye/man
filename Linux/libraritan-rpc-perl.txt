NAME
       px2_configure - deploy and configure Raritan PX2/PX3 power distribution units

SYNOPSIS
       px2_configure COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       PX2 deployment and configuration utility.

COMMANDS
       configure LIST IPS
           Configure some or all devices (network settings, unit name and SNMP settings).

           The behavior of this command is different depending on whether concrete IP addresses or the 'all' keyword is specified:

           • If  IP  addresses  are  specified  the  program  will contact each device, read its serial number and search for a matching entry in the device list. It will then change the device's network
             settings to the values from the device list. The initial IP addresses do not have to match the values from the device list, they might as well be dynamically assigned by a DHCP server.

           • If the 'all' keyword is specified the IP addresses are taken from the device list. The devices' network settings are expected to  be  properly  configured  at  this  point,  so  the  network
             configuration part will be skipped.

       verify LIST IPS
           Verify device settings and SNMP access.

       identify LIST IPS
           Identify some or all devices (show a distinctive string for two seconds in each unit's display).

       reboot LIST IPS
           Reboot some or all devices.

       fetch_fitness LIST OUTFILE IPS
           Fetch fitness data from some or all devices and write them to a file in CSV format.

       update LIST IMAGE IPS
           Device firmware update. The firmware image will be sequentially uploaded to each device, then all devices will be instructed to perform the firmware update in parallel.

       print_timezones IP
           Print list of supported timezones with its IDs.

       set_timezone LIST TZID IPS
           Set the timezone of all devices.

ARGUMENTS
       LIST
           Device list in CSV format.

       IPS Device IP addresses; use 'all' to run on all IPs in the CSV file.

       IP  Device IP address.

       OUTFILE
           Output file name.

       IMAGE
           Firmware image file.

       TZID
           Timezone ID as printed by the "print_timezones" command.

EXAMPLES
       px2_configure configure devices.csv 192.168.2.3
           Connect to the device at 192.168.2.3, read its serial number and look it up in the device list file named devices.csv. Configure the device's network, PDU name and SNMP settings.

       px2_configure verify devices.csv all
           Verify the network settings, PDU name and SNMP access for all devices in the list file.

       px2_configure update devices.csv pdu-px2-020106-26030.bin all
           Update all devices to firmware version 2.1.6.

DEVICE LIST FORMAT
       The device list file contains a list of PX2 devices in CSV format. It could e.g. be exported from an inventory spreadsheet. Each device line contains four or five fields, separated by commas:

       1. Unit serial number (exactly 10 characters)
       2. PDU name
       3. IP address with prefix length (e.g. 192.168.99.1/24)
       4. Gateway IP address
       5. Optional comment; the line is ignored if "ignore" is included here

       Lines with less than four fields are silently ignored. Likewise, lines that do not contain a valid serial number are disregarded.

REQUIREMENTS
       The following Perl modules are required to run this script:

       • Raritan PX2 RPC bindings (distributed along with this script)

       • libwww-perl <https://metacpan.org/release/libwww-perl>

       • LWP::Protocol::https <https://metacpan.org/release/LWP-Protocol-https>

       • JSON <https://metacpan.org/release/JSON>

       • JSON-RPC-Common <https://metacpan.org/release/JSON-RPC-Common>

       • perl-Error <https://metacpan.org/release/Error>

       • Test-Simple <https://metacpan.org/release/Test-Simple>

       Additionally, the verify command uses the snmpget utility to verify SNMP access.

perl v5.40.1                                                                                     2025-08-30                                                                               px2_configure(1p)
