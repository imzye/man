NAME
       gambas3 - Integrated Development Environment

SYNOPSIS
       gambas3 [options] [<project directory>]

DESCRIPTION
       Gambas  is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions, a mix of Java(tm) and Visual Basic(tm).  With Gambas, you can quickly design your program GUI with Qt
       or GTK+, access database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQlite or ODBC databases, pilot applications with DBus, translate your program into many languages, create GStreamer, OpenGL or SDL  appli‐
       cations, and so on...

       A  program  written  with  Gambas  is a set of files. Each file describes a class, in terms of object programming. The class files are compiled, then executed by an interpreter. From this point of
       view, it is very inspired by Java.

       Gambas is made up of the following programs:

           * A compiler.
           * An interpreter.
           * An archiver.
           * A graphical user interface component.
           * A development environment.

       The development environment is written with Gambas itself, following the "eat your own sh..." paradigm, and showing the abilities of the language.

       gambas3 starts the Integrated Development Environment.
