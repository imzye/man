CONTAINER-STORAGE-SETUP(1)                          CONTAINER-STORAGE-SETUP(1)

NAME
       container-storage-setup  -  Tool  for  setting up storage for container
       runtimes.

SYNOPSIS
       container-storage-setup [OPTIONS]

       container-storage-setup [OPTIONS] COMMAND [args]

DESCRIPTION
         container-storage-setup configures storage for use by container
         runtimes.

         container-storage-setup without specifying a command defaults to
         using docker config files /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup for
         input and /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage for output.

         container-storage-setup with a commnad creates and manages storage
         configurations.

         container-storage-setup can configure multiple backends:
         devicemapper, overlay, and overlay2.

OPTIONS
       --help
         Print usage statement

       --reset
         Reset your container storage to init state. Reset does not remove
         volume groups or remove any of the disks added previously.

         Note: The --reset command is not always sufficient to cleanup your
         container runtime environment. Other tools (atomic storage reset)
         use this command to cleanup all storage.

       --version
         Print version information

COMMANDS
       Following commands are supported.

       create Create storage configuration

       remove    Remove storage configuration

       list List currently created storage configurations

       activate Activate storage configuration

       deactivate Deactivate storage configuration

       add-dev Add block device to storage configuration

       export Export file which can be used to set environment  variables  for
       use by container runtimes

EXAMPLES
       Run  container-storage-setup after setting up your configuration in the
       INPUTFILE  or  /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup.  One  can  look  at
       /usr/share/container-storage-setup/container-storage-setup  for various
       options and their default settings. Anything that  the  user  wants  to
       change, should be changed in the INPUTFILE. This is the file which will
       override  any  settings  specified   in   /usr/share/container-storage-
       setup/container-storage-setup.

       Create storage configuration example-config.

       container-storage-setup create -o OUTPUTFILE example-config INPUTFILE

       Above will create a storage configuration named example-config as spec‐
       ified in INPUTFILE and will put the output in OUTPUTFILE. OUTPUTFILE is
       a  file which can be parsed by container runtime for various config op‐
       tions. In a typical form, output file can be passed in the Environment‐
       File  directive  of container runtime systemd unit file.  That will set
       STORAGE_OPTIONS environment variable which in turn  can  be  parsed  by
       container runtime process.

       To cleanup storage configuration, execute remove command.

       container-storage-setup remove example-config

       lvm2  version  should be same or higher than lvm2-2.02.112 for lvm thin
       pool functionality to work properly.

       Supported options for the configuration file:

       STORAGE_DRIVER:
             Specify a storage driver to be used with container runtime.
             Default: "devicemapper".
             Valid values are overlay, overlay2 and "".
             "" tells  container-storage-setup  to  not  perform  any  storage
       setup.

       CONTAINER_THINPOOL:
             Specify the thinpool name for the lvm thinpool. This is required
             when using the devicemapper STORAGE_DRIVER.  CONTAINER_THINPOOL
             is logical volume name passed to lvcreate when creating
             the thin pool volume.

       EXTRA_STORAGE_OPTIONS:
             A set of extra options that should be passed to the container
             runtime daemon.
             Note: EXTRA_STORAGE_OPTIONS replaces EXTRA_DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS
             which has been deprecated

       DEVS: A quoted, space-separated list of devices to be used.
             If a drive is partitioned and contains a ${dev}1 partition,
             that partition will be configured for use. Unpartitioned
             drives will be partitioned and configured for use. If "VG"
             is not specified, then use of the root disk's extra space
             is implied.

       VG:   The volume group to use for container storage.  Defaults to the
             volume group where the root filesystem resides.  If VG is
             specified and the volume group does not exist, it will be
             created (which requires that "DEVS" be nonempty, since we don't
             currently support putting a second partition on the root disk).

       Note:  lvm2  needs to be lvm2-2.02.112 or later for lvm thin pool func‐
       tionality to work properly.

       GROWPART:
             One can use this option to enable/disable growing of partition
             table backing root volume group. This is intended for
             virtualization and cloud installations. By default it is
             disabled. Use GROWPART=true to enable automatic partition
             table resizing.

       AUTO_EXTEND_POOL:
             Enable automatic extension of pool by lvm. lvm can monitor
             the pool and automatically extend it when pool is getting full.

       POOL_AUTOEXTEND_THRESHOLD:
             Determines the pool extension threshold in terms of percentage
             of pool size. For example, if threshold is 60, that means when
             pool is 60% full, threshold has been hit.

       POOL_AUTOEXTEND_PERCENT:
             Determines the amount by which pool needs to be grown. This is
             specified in terms of % of pool size. So a value of 20 means
             that when threshold is hit, pool will be grown by 20% of existing
             pool size.

       CHUNK_SIZE:
             Controls the chunk size/block size of thin pool. CHUNK_SIZE value
             must be suitable for passing to lvconvert --chunk-size.

       DEVICE_WAIT_TIMEOUT:
             Specifies a device wait timeout value in seconds. In certain
             cases required devices might not be immediately available and
             container-storage-setup might decide to wait for it. This timeout
             specifies how long one should wait for the device.
             Default is 60 seconds. 0 disables wait.

       WIPE_SIGNATURES:
             Wipe any signatures found on disk. Valid values are
             true/false and default value is false. By default if any
             signatures are found on disk operation is aborted. If this value
             is set to true, then signatures will either be wiped or
             overwritten as suitable. This also means that if there is any
             data on disk, it will be lost.

       CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_NAME:
            Name of the logical volume that will be mounted on
            CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_MOUNT_PATH. If a user is setting
            CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_MOUNT_PATH, he/she must set
            CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_NAME.

       CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_MOUNT_PATH:
            Creates a logical volume named CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_NAME and mounts
            it at the specified path. By default no new logical volume will
            be created. For example:
            CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_MOUNT_PATH=/var/lib/containers/container-runtime
            would carve out a logical volume, format it with an XFS filesystem
            and mount it on /var/lib/containers/container-runtime.

            Note: DOCKER_ROOT_VOLUME is deprecated. Specifying
            DOCKER_ROOT_VOLUME and CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_MOUNT_PATH at the same
            time is not allowed.

       CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_SIZE:
            Specify the desired size for CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_MOUNT_PATH
            root volume. It defaults to 40% of all free space.

            CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_SIZE can take values acceptable to
            lvcreate -L as well as some values acceptable to
            lvcreate -l. If user intends to pass values acceptable
            to lvcreate -l, then only those values which contains "%"
            in syntax are acceptable.  If value does not contain "%" it
            is assumed value is suitable for lvcreate -L.

            Note: If both STORAGE_DRIVER=devicemapper and
            CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_MOUNT_PATH is set, container-storage-setup
            would set up the thin pool for devicemapper first,
            followed by extra volume. e.g if free space in the
            volume group is 10G, devicemapper thin pool size
            would be 4G (40% of 10G) and extra volume would be
            2.4G (40% of 6G).

            Note: DOCKER_ROOT_VOLUME_SIZE is deprecated. Specifying
            DOCKER_ROOT_VOLUME_SIZE and CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_SIZE at the same
            time is not allowed.

       Options below should be specified as values acceptable to lvextend -L.

       ROOT_SIZE: The size to which the root filesystem should be grown.

            ROOT_SIZE can take values acceptable to lvcreate  -L  as  well  as
            some  values  acceptable  to  lvcreate -l. If user intends to pass
            values acceptable to lvcreate -l, then  only  those  values  which
            contains  "%" in syntax are acceptable.  If value does not contain
            "%" it is assumed value is suitable for lvcreate -L.

       DATA_SIZE: The desired size for container runtime thin  pool  data  LV.
            Defaults: 40% free space in the VG after the root LV and container
            runtime metadata LV have been allocated/grown.

            DATA_SIZE can take values acceptable to lvcreate  -L  as  well  as
            some  values  acceptable  to  lvcreate -l. If user intends to pass
            values acceptable to lvcreate -l, then  only  those  values  which
            contains  "%" in syntax are acceptable.  If value does not contain
            "%" it is assumed value is suitable for lvcreate -L.

       MIN_DATA_SIZE: Specifies the minimum size of the thin pool data LV.  If
            sufficient  free  space  is  not available, the pool creation will
            fail.

            Value should be a number followed by a optional suffix.       "bB‐
       sSkKmMgGtTpPeE" are valid suffixes. If no suffix is specified      then
       value will be considered as megabyte unit.

            Both upper and lower case suffix  represent  same  unit  of  size.
            Use  suffix  B  for  Bytes,  S  for  sectors  as  512 bytes, K for
            kibibytes (1024 bytes), M for mebibytes (1024  kibibytes),  G  for
            gibibytes, T for tebibytes, P for pebibytes and E for exbibytes.

       POOL_META_SIZE:  Specifies  the  size  of  thin  pool  metadata  LV. If
            sufficient free space is not available,  the  pool  creation  will
            fail.

            Value should be a number followed by a optional suffix.       "bB‐
       sSkKmMgGtTpPeE" are valid suffixes. If no suffix is specified      then
       value will be considered as megabyte unit.

            Both  upper  and  lower  case  suffix represent same unit of size.
            Use suffix B for  Bytes,  S  for  sectors  as  512  bytes,  K  for
            kibibytes  (1024  bytes),  M for mebibytes (1024 kibibytes), G for
            gibibytes, T for tebibytes, P for pebibytes and E for exbibytes.
