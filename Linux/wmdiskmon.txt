NAME
       wmdiskmon - A dockapp to monitor disks usage.

SYNOPSIS
       wmdiskmon [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmdiskmon command.

       WMDiskMon is a program to monitor disks usage. It is a dockapp that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment.

       The dockapp has two modes. The default displays three devices at a time in a bargraph manner. The other displays only one device, but with numeric percentage and a longer name over three lines.

       In  default  mode,  clicking on the arrows scrolls the devices list up and down.  In single mode, it cycles through the list. In both modes, clicking with left button on the background toggles the
       back light. Clicking on the background with the middle button toggles displays of entries (devices or mount points).  With the control key, the same action toggles mode.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

       -d, --display <string>
              Attempt to open a window on the named X display. In the absence of  this option, the  display  specified  by the DISPLAY environment variable is used.

       -bl, --backlight
              turn on back-light.

       -lc, --light-color <color>
              back-light color. (rgb:6E/C6/3B is default)

       -i, --interval <number>
              number of secs between updates. (1 is default)

       -h, --help
              show help text and exit.

       -v, --version
              show program version and exit.

       -w, --windowed
              run the application in windowed mode

       -bw, --broken-wm
              activate broken window manager fix

       -p, --partition <device>
              monitor the <device> partition (may be used more than once), a NFS device can also be specified (in fact all that is in the 1rst column of df -P, the POSIX df behavior)

       -n, --device
              show device instead of mount point

       -s, --single
              show only one device at a time (default behavior is to display 3)

BUGS
       The program uses the POSIX command df -P. If your system does not support this command, then you should send me a mail telling me with command give the same result for your OS.
