NAME
       websocketd - turns any program that uses STDIN/STDOUT into a WebSocket server.

SYNOPSIS
       websocketd [options] COMMAND [command args]

       or

       websocketd [options] --dir=SOMEDIR

DESCRIPTION
       websocketd is a command line tool that will allow any executable program that accepts input on stdin and produces output on stdout to be turned into a WebSocket server.

OPTIONS
       A summary of the options supported by websocketd is included below.

       --port=PORT
           HTTP port to listen on.

       --address=ADDRESS
           Address to bind to (multiple options allowed). Use square brackets to specify IPv6 address. Default: "" (all)

       --sameorigin={true,false}
           Restrict (HTTP 403) protocol upgrades if the Origin header does not match to requested HTTP Host. Default: false.

       --origin=host[:port][,host[:port]...]
           Restrict  (HTTP  403) protocol upgrades if the Origin header does not match to one of the host and port combinations listed. If the port is not specified, any port number will match.  Default:
           "" (allow any origin)

       --ssl --sslcert=FILE --sslkey=FILE
           Listen for HTTPS socket instead of HTTP. All three options must be used or all of them should be omitted.

       --passenv VAR[,VAR...]
           Lists environment variables allowed to be passed to executed scripts.

       --reverselookup={true,false}
           Perform DNS reverse lookups on remote clients. Default: true

       --dir=DIR
           Allow all scripts in the local directory to be accessed as WebSockets. If using this, option, then the standard program and args options should not be specified.

       --staticdir=DIR
           Serve static files in this directory over HTTP.

       --cgidir=DIR
           Serve CGI scripts in this directory over HTTP.

       --help
           Print help and exit.

       --version
           Print version and exit.

       --license
           Print license and exit.

       --devconsole
           Enable interactive development console. This enables you to access the websocketd server with a web-browser and use a user interface to quickly test WebSocket endpoints. For example,  to  test
           an endpoint at ws://[host]/foo, you can visit http://[host]/foo in your browser. This flag cannot be used in conjunction with --staticdir or --cgidir.

       --loglevel=LEVEL
           Log level to use (default access). From most to least verbose: debug, trace, access, info, error, fatal

BUGS
       The  only known condition so far is that certain applications in programming languages that enforce implicit STDOUT buffering (Perl, Python, etc.) would be producing unexpected data passing delays
       when run under websocketd. Such issues could be solved by editing the source code of those applications (prohibiting buffering) or modifying their environment to trick  them  into  autoflush  mode
       (e.g. pseudo-terminal wrapper "unbuffer").

       Active issues in development are discussed on GitHub: https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd/issues.
