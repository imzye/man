NAME
       clamtk - Graphical user interface (gui) for Clam AntiVirus

SYNOPSIS
       clamtk
       clamtk file
       clamtk directory

DESCRIPTION
       clamtk is a frontend for Clam AntiVirus. It is designed to be a lightweight, easy-to-use, on-demand GUI virus scanner.

       clamtk is written using Perl, Python, and the Gtk+ libraries.

OPTIONS
       There are currently no commandline options except for those noted in the synopsis. There is no point in commandline options since one can use clamscan for that.  However, clamtk does accept a file
       or directory as an argument so one can right-click on it to have the object scanned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       You may have to edit freshclam.conf and clamd.conf prior to attempting signature updates. See your distribution's documentation for more.

SEE ALSO
       clamscan(1), freshclam(1), sigtool(1).
