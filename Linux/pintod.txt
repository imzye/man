NAME
       pintod - Web interface to a Pinto repository

VERSION
       version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
         pintod --root=/path/to/repository [--auth key=value] [--port=N]

DESCRIPTION
       "pintod" provides a web API to a Pinto repository.  Clients (like pinto) can use this API to manage and inspect the repository.  In addition, "pintod" serves up the distributions within the
       repository, so you can use it as the backend for cpan or cpanm.

       Before running "pintod" you must first create a Pinto repository.  For example:

         pinto --root=/path/to/repository init

       See pinto for more information about creating a reposiotry.

ARGUMENTS
       --root PATH
       -r PATH
           The path to the root directory of the Pinto repository you wish to serve.  Alternatively, you may set the "PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT" environment variable.

OPTIONS
       --auth KEY=VALUE
           Sets an option for the authentication scheme (default is no authentication).  Each time this is used, a key=value pair must follow; one of them must be 'backend', which should correspond to a
           class in the Authen::Simple namespace. The remaining options will be passed as-is to the authentication backend.

           See "USING BASIC HTTP AUTHENTICATION" for more guidance on enabling authenticaion with minimal fuss, or see "USING OTHER AUTHENTICATION SCHEMES" for more complex options.

       --port INTEGER
       -p INTEGER
           Specifies the port number that the server will listen on.  The default is 3111.  If you specify a different port, all clients will also have to specify that port.  So you probably don't want to
           change the port unless you have a very good reason.

       other options
           All other options supported by plackup are supported too, such as "--server", "--daemonize", "--access-log", "--error-log" etc.  These will be passed to Plack::Runner.  By default, "pintod" uses
           on the Starman for the server backend.  Be aware that not all servers support the same options.

USING BASIC HTTP AUTHENTICATION
       "pintod" ships with Authen::Simple::Passwd, so the easiest way to run the server with basic HTTP authentication is to create a password file using the "htpasswd" utility:

         htpasswd -c /path/to/htpasswd USER

       You will be prompted to enter the password for "USER" twice.  Then repeat that command without the -c option for each additional user.   You may want to put the htpasswd file inside the top of your
       repository.

       Then launch pintod like this:

         pintod --root path/to/repository --auth backend=Passwd --auth path=path/to/htpasswd

       If you already have an htpasswd file somewhere, you may just point to it directly, or create a symlink.  In any case, the htpasswd file needs to be readable by the user that will be running "pintod".

USING OTHER AUTHENTICATION SCHEMES
       If you wish to use a different authenticaion scheme, then you'll first need to install the appropriate Authen::Simple backend module.  Then configure pintod accordingly.  For example, this would be a
       valid configuration for Kerberos:

         --auth backend=Kerberos --auth realm=REALM.YOUR_COMPANY.COM

       and this is how the authentication backend will be constructed:

         my $auth = Authen::Simple::Kerberos->new(
           realm => 'REALM.YOUR_COMPANY.COM'
         );

DEPLOYMENT
       "pintod" is PSGI compatible, running under Plack::Runner by default.  It will use whatever backend you specify on the command line or have configured in your environment (defaults to Starman).

       If you wish to add your own middleware and/or customize the backend in other ways, you can use Pinto::Server in a custom .psgi script like this:

           # my-pintod.psgi

           my %opts   = (...);
           my $server = Pinto::Server->new(%opts);
           my $app    = $server->to_app;

           # wrap $app with middlewares here and/or
           # insert code customized for your backend
           # which operates on the $app

       Then you may directly launch my-pintod.psgi using plackup.
