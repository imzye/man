NAME
       plaympeg - MPEG audio (MP3) and video (MPEG-1) player

SYNOPSIS
       plaympeg [options] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       plaympeg  is  an  MPEG audio and video player that uses the SDL MPEG Player Library.  It can play back MPEG audio (layer 1, 2 and 3), MPEG video (MPEG-1) and MPEG system (audio and video combined)
       files. MPEG-2 video files (as found on DVDs) are not supported.

       The video player works best on a 16 bit color depth X11 display, it works on other color depths with reduced speed as well. You'll need a CPU with 300 MHz or more  to  play  back  an  MPEG  system
       stream with 25 frames per seconds (fps) at full speed.
