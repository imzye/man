              Warning:

              This  file is a shell script, and as such is subject to a string variable assignment syntax. No space is allowed between the variable name, the equal (=) sign, and the value(s) assigned. If
              multiple values are to be assigned, the list must be space-delimited with surrounding quotes.

       Two directives can be used in this file: types and skip. Both can be defined multiple times.

       types     This describes the classes of hardware that should be scanned and queried.

       skip      These modules should never be loaded. See the ``Files'' section for details on the mechanism for generating these entries automatically.

Files
       /var/lib/discover/crash
                 A crash file written and erased each time discover-modprobe attempts to load a module. If the file lingers, the computer is assumed to have crashed while loading  that  module,  and  the
                 module name is added to discover-modprobe.conf as a module to skip in the future.
