NAME
       airstrike - 2d dogfight game in the tradition of 'Biplanes' and 'BIP'

DESCRIPTION
       Airstrike is a 2d biplane dogfight game in the tradition of the Intellivision and Amiga games 'Biplanes' and 'BIP'. It features a robust physics engine and several other extensions of the original
       games.

SYNOPSIS

       --nosound
              Runs the game without sound.

       --noalpha
