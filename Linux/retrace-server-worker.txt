NAME
       retrace-server-worker - Executes the retrace job.

SYNOPSIS
       retrace-server-worker task_id.

DESCRIPTION
       The tool uses mock to prepare a virtual environment for the retrace, runs GDB, saves backtrace and cleans up the virtual environment. The task_id argument is a number derived from the name of the
       directory where crash data is saved (by default /var/spool/retrace-server/task_id).
