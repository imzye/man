DESCRIPTION
       The ax25mond.conf file specifies the internet- and unix-sockets which ax25mond(8) will provide. Example:

       # Create an internet socket on port 1234 where all the
       # AX.25 traffic will be transmitted
       rxtx *:1234
       # Create an unix socket where only the received AX.25
       # traffic will be transmitted
       rx unix:/var/spool/ax25/monitor

       You may specify up to 5 sockets (definable in ax25mond.c) and ax25mond will accept up to 50 connects (also definable in ax25mond.c).
