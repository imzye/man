NAME
       MooseX::AttributeShortcuts::Trait::Method::Builder - Trait for inline builder method metaclasses

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.037 of MooseX::AttributeShortcuts::Trait::Method::Builder - released November 20, 2017 as part of MooseX-AttributeShortcuts.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a method metaclass trait that allows inline builder methods to be associated with their attribute, and to take on a definition context.  This additional information will allow inline
       builders to be more readily identified and associated with their owning attributes.

ATTRIBUTES
   associated_attribute
       Read only, required, weak, must be a Moose::Meta::Attribute or descendant.

       Contains the attribute this builder is associated with.
