NAME
       mkbootdisk - creates a stand-alone boot floppy for the running system

SYNOPSIS
       mkbootdisk [--version] [--noprompt] [--verbose]
                  [--device devicefile] [--size size]
                  [--kernelargs <args>] [--iso] kernel

DESCRIPTION
       mkbootdisk creates a boot floppy appropriate for the running system. The boot disk is entirely self-contained, and includes an initial ramdisk image which loads any necessary SCSI modules for the sys‐
       tem. The created boot disk looks for the root filesystem on the device suggested by /etc/fstab.  The only required argument is the kernel version to put onto the boot floppy.

OPTIONS
       --device devicefile
              The boot image is created on devicefile. If --device is not specified, /dev/fd0 is used. If devicefile does not exist mkinitrd creates a 1.44Mb floppy image using devicefile as the filename.

       --noprompt
              Normally, mkbootdisk instructs the user to insert a floppy and waits for confirmation before continuing. If --noprompt is specified, no prompt is displayed.

       --verbose
              Instructs mkbootdisk to talk about what it's doing as it's doing it. Normally, there is no output from mkbootdisk.

       --iso  Instructs mkbootdisk to make a bootable ISO image as devicefile.

       --version
              Displays the version of mkbootdisk and exits.

       --kernelargs args
              Adds args to the arguments appended on the kernel command line. If this is not specified mkbootdisk uses grubby to parse the arguments for the default kernel from grub.conf, if possible.

       --size size
              Uses size (in kilobytes) as the size of the image to use for the boot disk.  If this is not specified, mkbootdisk will assume a standard 1.44Mb floppy device.
