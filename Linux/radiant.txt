       mgrast_table
              A table exported from MG-RAST. It can be from organism or functional analysis, but all tables being imported should be consistent. By default, separate datasets will be created for each in‐
              put (see [-c]).

       name   A name to show in the list of datasets in the Krona chart (if multiple input files are present and [-c] is not specified). By default, the basename of the file will be used.

       [-o <string>]
              Output file name. [Default: 'mg-rast.krona.html']

       [-n <string>]
              Name of the highest level. [Default: 'all']

       [-c]   Combine data from each file, rather than creating separate datasets within the chart.

       [-d <integer>]
              Maximum depth of wedges to include in the chart.

       [-x <integer>]
              Hue (0-360) for "bad" scores. [Default: '0']

       [-y <integer>]
              Hue (0-360) for "good" scores. [Default: '120']

       [-p]   Use percent identity for average scores instead of log[10] e-value.

       [-u <string>]
              URL  of  Krona resources to use instead of bundling them with the chart (e.g. "http://krona.sourceforge.net"). Reduces size of charts and allows updates, though charts will not work without
              access to this URL.
