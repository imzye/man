NAME
       fastep - Adjust python project to use fastentrypoints

SYNOPSIS
       fastep [dir1] [dir2] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       fastep will make sure fastentrypoints is included in MANIFEST.in and present in setup.py.

       Using entry_points in your setup.py makes scripts that start really slowly because it imports pkg_resources, which is a horrible thing to do if you want your trivial script to execute more or
       less instantly.

       fastentrypoints make entry_points specified in setup.py load more quickly.
