NAME
       nodeunit -- simple node.js unit testing tool

SYNOPSIS
       nodeunit [options] <file-or-directory> [<file-or-directory> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Nodeunit is a simple unit testing tool based on the node.js assert module.

       •   Simple to use

       •   Just export the tests from a module

       •   Helps you avoid common pitfalls when testing asynchronous code

       •   Easy to add test cases with setUp and tearDown functions if you wish

       •   Allows the use of mocks and stubs
