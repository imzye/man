NAME
       zita-a2j, zita-j2a - Use ALSA device as a Jack client, with resampling.

SYNOPSIS
       zita-a2j [options]
       zita-j2a [options]

DESCRIPTION
       These  two  programs  allow  one  to  use an ALSA device as a Jack client, to provide additional capture (zita-a2j) or playback (zita-j2a) channels. Functionally they are equivalent to alsa_in and
       alsa_out that come with Jack, but they will provide much better audio quality.

       The resampling ratio will typically be stable within a few parts per million and change only very smoothly. Delay will be stable as well even under worse case conditions, e.g. the Jack client run‐
       ning near the end of the cycle.

       The ALSA device should be a 'hw:' one, i.e. direct access to a soundcard and not an ALSA 'plug' device. A well-working Jack system is assumed, running in real-time mode.

       The sample rate can be the same as Jack's one, or different.  Minimum delay is obtained by running the alsa device at a lower period size than Jack. This can be done safely as the alsa thread will
       run at a higher priority, and apart from copying to an internal buffer no work is done there. There are no restrictions on the product of period_size and number_of_periods as there are for alsa_in
       and alsa_out.

       Resampling is performed using the zita-resampler library. The -Q option sets the resampling quality. The parameter value is half the length (i.e. the delay) of the multiphase filter used  for  re‐
       sampling,  expressed  in  samples at the lower of the two sample rates. This mainly affects the shape of the frequency response near the Nyquist frequency. It is normally not necessary to use this
       option as an optimum value depending both the sample rates is chosen automatically. The available range is 16..96.

       The -S option disables resampling. This requires that the device is synced via word-clock to the one used by Jack.

       The -L option forces the ALSA interface to 2 channels and 16-bit sample format. This may be required when a2j or j2a is used with ALSA's 'loop' device, if the other end doesn't accept more than  2
       channels or floating point samples. This option must not be used otherwise.

       Both  programs  will  optionally  print  some  information four times per second. The first number is the average loop error over the last quarter second, in samples. It should be reduced to small
       randowm values close to zero after 15 seconds or so. The second is the dynamic correction factor of the nominal resampling ratio. This should converge to a value close to one and not move much.

       Small variations in these numbers will be seen when Jack apps are started or stopped. This is normal. Anything else isn't - please report.

       When starting, and in case of major trouble, the 'Starting synchronisation' message will be printed. A restart can happen if there is a timeout on the Jack server, e.g. when a  client  crashed  or
       terminated in a dirty way.

       Jack1 will skip one or more cycles when new apps are started, or when a large number of port connections is done in a short time. This may interrupt the audio signal, but should otherwise not have
       any ill consequences nor require a restart.

       Both zita-a2j and zita-j2a will suspend operation while Jack is in 'freewheeling' mode.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print command line and options summary.

       -j <name>
              Jack client name [zita-a2j or zita-j2a].

       -d <device>
              ALSA device [none].

       -r <rate>
              Sample rate [48000].

       -p <period>
              Period size [256].

       -n <nfrags>
              Number of fragments [2].

       -c <nchannels>
              Number of channels [2].

       -Q <quality>
              Resampling quality [auto].

       -S     Word clock sync, disable resampling.

       -I <samples> [0]
              (zita-a2j only) Latency correction. The value is added to the latency property set on the Jack ports.

       -O <samples> [0]
              (zita-j2a only) Latency correction. The value is added to the latency property set on the Jack ports.

       -L     Force 2 channels and 16-bit sample format.

       -v     Print tracing information.
