NAME
       deb2solv - convert one or more Debian package files into a solv file

SYNOPSIS
       deb2solv [OPTIONS] PKG1.deb ...

DESCRIPTION
       The deb2solv tool converts the meta data from one or more Debian packages into the solv file written to standard output.

       -m MANIFESTFILE
           Read the rpm file names from the specified MANIFESTFILE. You can use - to read the manifest from standard input.

       -0
           Use a null byte as line terminator for manifest files instead of a newline. This is useful if the file names can contain newlines. See also the -print0 option in find.
