NAME
       reposdump - utility for dumping SBLIM Data Gatherer online metric repository

SYNOPSIS
       reposdump [age] [interval] [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       The reposdump program is used to dump the metrics from the reposd(8) daemons online repository. The metric data is exported into a flat text file. The file contains sections seperated by lines with
       the following format.

           ===metricdefs <pluginname>===

           ===metricvals <pluginname>===

       Each section contains a list of comma seperated records containing the defined metric or metric values. A sample perl script /usr/share/reposd2csv.pl is included which demonstrates converting the dump
       data into a comma seperated value list (CSV) suitable for import into a spreadsheet.

OPTIONS
       age
           Maximum sample age in seconds to be dumped.

       interval
           Sample interval granularity in seconds to be dumped.

       directory
           Directory in which to dump metric file.
