NAME
       spm - Salt Package Manager Command

       Salt Package Manager

SYNOPSIS
          spm <command> [<argument>]

DESCRIPTION
       spm  is the frontend command for managing Salt packages. Packages normally only include formulas, meaning a group of SLS files that install into the file_roots on the Salt Master, but Salt modules can
       also be installed.

OPTIONS
       -y, --assume-yes
              Assume yes instead of prompting the other whether or not to proceed with a particular command. Default is False.

       -f, --force
              When presented with a course of action that spm would normally refuse to perform, that action will be performed anyway. This is often destructive, and should be used with caution.

   Logging Options
       Logging options which override any settings defined on the configuration files.

       -l LOG_LEVEL, --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
              Console logging log level. One of all, garbage, trace, debug, info, warning, error, quiet. Default: warning.

       --log-file=LOG_FILE
              Log file path. Default: /var/log/salt/spm.

       --log-file-level=LOG_LEVEL_LOGFILE
              Logfile logging log level. One of all, garbage, trace, debug, info, warning, error, quiet. Default: warning.
