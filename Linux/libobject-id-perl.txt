NAME
       Object::ID::ConfigData - Configuration for Object::ID

SYNOPSIS
         use Object::ID::ConfigData;
         $value = Object::ID::ConfigData->config('foo');
         $value = Object::ID::ConfigData->feature('bar');

         @names = Object::ID::ConfigData->config_names;
         @names = Object::ID::ConfigData->feature_names;

         Object::ID::ConfigData->set_config(foo => $new_value);
         Object::ID::ConfigData->set_feature(bar => $new_value);
         Object::ID::ConfigData->write;  # Save changes

DESCRIPTION
       This module holds the configuration data for the "Object::ID" module.  It also provides a programmatic interface for getting or setting that configuration data.  Note that in order to actually
       make changes, you'll have to have write access to the "Object::ID::ConfigData" module, and you should attempt to understand the repercussions of your actions.

METHODS
       config($name)
           Given a string argument, returns the value of the configuration item by that name, or "undef" if no such item exists.

       feature($name)
           Given a string argument, returns the value of the feature by that name, or "undef" if no such feature exists.

       set_config($name, $value)
           Sets  the  configuration  item  with the given name to the given value.  The value may be any Perl scalar that will serialize correctly using "Data::Dumper".  This includes references, objects
           (usually), and complex data structures.  It probably does not include transient things like filehandles or sockets.

       set_feature($name, $value)
           Sets the feature with the given name to the given boolean value.  The value will be converted to 0 or 1 automatically.

       config_names()
           Returns a list of all the names of config items currently defined in "Object::ID::ConfigData", or in scalar context the number of items.

       feature_names()
           Returns a list of all the names of features currently defined in "Object::ID::ConfigData", or in scalar context the number of features.

       auto_feature_names()
           Returns a list of all the names of features whose availability is dynamically determined, or in scalar context the number of such features.  Does not include such features that have later been
           set to a fixed value.

       write()
           Commits any changes from "set_config()" and "set_feature()" to disk.  Requires write access to the "Object::ID::ConfigData" module.
