NAME
       bournal - When nobody else cares what you have to say!

SYNOPSIS
       bournal [options]

DESCRIPTION
       bournal  is  a program that allows you to write personal, password-pro‐
       tected journal entries, as well as search through and edit old entries.
       Bournal  has no internet capabilities, so if you're looking for a blog‐
       ging app, boy, did you install the wrong package.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long  op‐
       tions starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included
       below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options

       -i     Interactive mode--Open a bournal shell to run several operations
              without  having  to  reenter your password. Readline editing op‐
              tions are supported.

       -lst   List and edit entries made today. You will be prompted to choose
              a subject.

       -ls [MONTH] [YEAR]
              List  and edit archived entries. Month and year arguments filter
              out superfluous entries, which will prompt you first with a list
              of days within the given timeframe, then a list of subjects made
              on the chosen day. If no month or year arguments are given,  all
              days  containing  entries  are listed, followed by a list of en‐
              tries made on the chosen day.

       -d [MONTH] [YEAR]
              List and delete archived entries. Month and year arguments  fil‐
              ter  out superfluous entries, which will prompt you first with a
              list of days within the given time frame, then a  list  of  sub‐
              jects  made on the chosen day. If no month or year arguments are
              given, all days containing entries are  listed,  followed  by  a
              list of entries made on the chosen day, then a prompt to confirm
              deletion.

       -f [PATTERN] [MONTH]
              Find text within entries. Protect space-separated  search  terms
              with  quotes.  Regular  expression  searches are accepted, using
              egrep syntax.

       -fi [PatTerN] [MONTH]
              Find case-insensitive text within entries.  Protect  space-sepa‐
              rated  search terms with quotes. Regular expression searches are
              accepted, using egrep syntax.

       -r     Read all entries at once

       -p     Change the encryption password

       -v, --version
              Show version information

       --hack_the_gibson
              Hack the planet (for updates)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       ccrypt a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams

       Linux  or something similar with basic *NIX utils

       Vim    or Nano or Jed , or some other editor that is not as awesome  as
              Vim.

NOTES
       Files  encrypted with ccrypt WILL work between computers (assuming it's
       installed), so taking Bournal and all its entries with you on  a  flash
       drive  will  work just peachy. You can have entries automatically saved
       to the flash drive by changing the DIR variable to  the  path  of  your
       flashdrive,  (e.g.  `  DIR=/media/USB_VOL_NAME  `). However, if you run
       Bournal from a USB drive, you will need to  predeed  it  with  a  shell
       (e.g. ` bash bournal `)

FILES
       ~/.bournal/
              Default directory where entries are stored.

       ~/.bournal/.passwd.cpt
              Default password file.

       ~/.bournalrc
              Default configuration file.
