NAME
       minimac4 - Fast Imputation Based on State Space Reduction HMM

DESCRIPTION
       Minimac4 is a lower memory and more computationally efficient implementation of "minimac2/3".

       It is an algorithm for genotypic imputation that works on phased genotypes (say from MaCH).  Minimac4 is designed to handle very large reference panels in a more computationally efficient way with
       no  loss  of  accuracy. This algorithm analyzes only the unique sets of haplotypes in small genomic segments, thereby saving on time-complexity, computational memory but no loss in degree of accu‐
       racy.

OPTIONS
   Reference Haplotypes
       --refHaps
              M3VCF file containing haplotype data for reference panel.

       --passOnly
              This option only imports variants with FILTER = PASS.

       --rsid This option only imports RS ID of variants from ID column (if available).

   GWAS Haplotypes
       --haps File containing haplotype data for target (gwas) samples. Must be VCF file.  Zipped versions allowed.

   Output Parameters
       --prefix
              Prefix for all output files generated. By default: [Minimac4.Output]

       --processReference
              This option will only convert an input VCF file to M3VCF format (currently de-activated in minimac4). If this option is ON, no imputation would be performed.

       --nobgzip
              If ON, output files will NOT be gzipped.

       --format
              Specifies which fields to output for the FORMAT field in output VCF file.  Available handles: GT,DS,HDS,GP [Default: GT,DS].

       --allTypedSites
              If ON, sites available ONLY in GWAS panel will also be output [Default: OFF].

   Subset Parameters
       --chr  Chromosome number for which to carry out imputation.

       --start
              Start position for imputation by chunking.

       --end  End position for imputation by chunking.

       --window
              Length of buffer region on either side of --start and --end.

   Other Parameters
       --log  If ON, log will be written to $prefix.logfile.

       --help If ON, detailed help on options and usage.

       --cpus Number of cpus for parallel computing. Works only with Minimac4-omp.
