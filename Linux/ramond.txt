NAME
       ramond.conf - Configuration file for ramond(8)

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ramond.conf configuration file.

       ramond.conf is an XML file containing the rules for Router Advertisement processing by ramond(8).

       The rules are processed in the order they are defined in the file.

SYNTAX
       One may refer to the DTD given in /usr/share/doc/ramond/examples/ramond.conf.dtd.

       The root element, <ramond>, contains one optional attribute, logfile, giving the path to the logfile for the daemon.

       This element may contain one or more <mac-list>s, and one or more <rule>s.

       The <mac-list> must have a name attribute, and contains one or more <entry>elements.

       The <rule> may contain a few attributes :

       prefix An IPv6 prefix used for matching RA packets

       mac    A <mac-list> name used for matching source MAC addresses of the RA packets

       lifetime
              This attribute, when having a “0” value, is used for matching routes that are being cleared

       interface
              The interface which the RA packet came from

       The <rule> may contain :
         • one or more <execute> elements containing the path of the scripts to run when a packet is matched
         • a <clear/> element, so that the matched route will be cleared by ramond(8)
         • or no element, indicating an “ignore” rule.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variables the configured scripts are run with are listed in the ramond(8) manpage.

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE
       Set the logfile to be /var/log/ramond.log.

        <ramond logfile="/var/log/ramond.log">

         Define a router mac-list.

          <mac-list name="router">
            <entry>00:11:22:33:44:55</entry>
            <entry>00:22:44:66:88:00</entry>
          </mac-list>

         Define a rule checking if the router routes are being cleared.

          <rule mac="router" lifetime="0">
            <execute>/usr/local/sbin/routenotify route-cleared</execute>
          </rule>

         Define a rule ignoring our router announcing routes for prefix 2001:dead:cafe:babe::/52.

          <rule mac="router" prefix="2001:dead:cafe:babe::/52">
            <!-- do nothing -->
          </rule>

         Clear the 6to4 routes coming on interface eth0.

          <rule prefix="2002::/16" interface="eth0">
            <execute>/usr/local/sbin/routenotify 6to4-advertised</execute>
            <clear/>
          </rule>

         Match on all advertised prefixes

          <rule prefix="::/0">
            <execute>/usr/local/sbin/routenotify route-advertised</execute>
          </rule>

         Match on all RA packets (even those not advertising a prefix)

          <rule>
            <execute>/usr/local/sbin/routenotify route-advertised</execute>
          </rule>

        </ramond>
