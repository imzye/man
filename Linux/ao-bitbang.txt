NAME
       ao-bitbang - Low-level cc1111 interface diagnostic tool

SYNOPSIS
       ao-bitbang

DESCRIPTION
       ao-bitbang  connects  through  a CP2103 usb-to-serial converter and uses the GPIO pins to communicate with the debug port on a cc1111 device. It provides raw access to the debug pins to help debug the
       lowest level communication path.

USAGE
       ao-bitbang reads a sequence of bit manipulations from stdin, sends them to the device and reports status on stdout.

       Each line on stdin should contain a single letter command for each of the three debug lines on the cc1111 -- clock, data and reset. Each bit can be in one of three states -- on (C, D or R), off (.) or
       tri-state  (-) for input. Empty lines, or lines starting with '#' are ignored. Anything beyond the last bit in a line is also ignored. The bits must be listed in the correct order, and the 'on' values
       must match the desired bit.

EXAMPLE
       Reset the target device
