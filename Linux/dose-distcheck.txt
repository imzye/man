NAME
       distcheck - check installability of packages according to metadata

SYNOPSIS
       distcheck [option] ... uri
       debcheck [option] ... [file]
       rpmcheck [option] ... [file]
       eclipsecheck [option] ... [file]

DESCRIPTION
       distcheck  determines,  for  a  set of package control stanzas, called the repository, whether packages of the repository can be installed relative to the repository according to the inter-package
       relationsships expressed in the package control stanzas.  The exact set of relevant control fields and their meaning depends on the type of the repository.  The  constraint  solving  algorithm  is
       complete,  that  is it finds a solution whenever there exists one, even for multiple disjunctive dependencies and deep package conflicts. This problem is computationally infeasible in theory (that
       is, NP-complete), but can be solved very efficiently for package repositories that actually occur in practice.

       Packages are split into foreground and background: only packages in the foreground are checked for installability, but dependencies may be  satisfied  by  foreground  packages  and  by  background
       packages. By default, all packages are in the foreground.

Input Specification
       Currently supported input types are debian, rpm, and eclipse. The distcheck tool expects its input specifiations in the form type://pathname where type is one of deb, synthesis, hdlist or eclipse,
       and pathname is the pathname of a file containing the input. The package metadata found in that file must correspond to the type given in the URI.

       When  invoked as typecheck then the type of input is assumed to be type, and repositories (in positional arguments or in the values of options --fg and --bg) are simply given in form of a pathname
       of a file containing the repository. If no positional argument is given then input is read from standard input. distcheck also accepts compressed files (.gz , .bz2) as positional arguments.  Input
       read on standard input cannot be in compressed form.

Input Formats
   Debian
       The  input  file  has  to  contain  stanzas  in  the format of deb-control(5), separated by one blank line. For instance, the Packages files as found on a Debian mirror server, or in the directory
       /var/lib/apt/lists/ of a Debian system, are suitable as input to debcheck. Installability of packages is analyzed according to their Depends, Conflicts, and Provides fields with their  meaning  as
       of Debian policy version 3.9.0. Pre-depends are treated like Depends, and Breaks are treated like Conflicts.

       If the input contains several packages with the same values of name, version, and architecture than only the last of these is taken into account, and a warning is issued.

       In the case of Debian, it is not possible to install at the same time two packages with the same name but different versions.

   Rpm
       The  input  file can be either a synthesis file or a hdlist file.  By default rpmcheck expects a synthesis file as input. To specify a hdlist file distcheck must be invoked with a file argument of
       the form hdlist://

   Npm
       The input file is a 822 encoding of an npm repository.

   Opam
       The input file is a 822 encoding of an opam repository.

   Pef
       The input is a generic 822 file. Versions are compared by default using the debian comparing function, or if provided the function specified by --compare

   Eclipse
       The input is a 822 file containing the encoding of OSGi plugins  content.xml files.

OPTIONS
   MISC OPTIONS
       --version
               Show program version and exit.

       -h, --help
               Display this list of options.

       -v, --verbose
               Enable info / warnings / debug messages.  This option may be repeated up to three times in order to increase verbosity.

       --progress
               Show progress bars.

       --timers
               Show timing information.

       --quiet Do not print warning messages

   DISTCHECK OPTIONS
       -e, --explain
               Give explanations. If used together with --failures then the explanation consists of dependency chains leading to a conflict or a dependency on a missing package.  If  used  together  with
               --successes then the explanation consists of an installation set.

       -m, --explain-minimal
               For  all packages P that are found installable, and when used in conjunction with --successes, prints a reduced installation set containing only those packages in the dependency cone of P.
               When used with Debian repositories, all essential packages and their dependencies that are not in the cone of P are omitted.  When used in conjunction with --failures, and  --explain,  all
               dependencies chains are not printed.

       -c, --explain-condense
               Compress explanation graph

       -f, --failures
               List all packages that are found not to be installable.

       -s, --successes
               List  all  packages  that  are found to be installable. May be used together with --failures, in this case the value of the status field in the output allows one to distinguish installable
               from non-installable packages.

       --summary
               Gives a more detailed summary of the findings.

       --coinst  package [,package] ...
               Takes a comma-separated list of package names, each of them possibly with a version constraint, as argument. If this list consists of n expressions, then co-installability will be  checked
               independently  for  each  set of n packages where the i-th element of the set matches the i-th expression. The initial distinction between foreground and background is ignored. This option
               must not be combined with --checkonly.

               Example: --coinst "a (>1), b"

               If we have package a in versions 1, 2 and 3, and package b in versions 11 and 12, then this will check 4 pairs of packages for co-installability, namely (a=2,b=11), (a=2,b=12),  (a=3,b=11)
               and (a=3,b=12).

       --fields=strlst
               Print additional fields if available

       --lowmem
               Serialise multiple distcheck runs to save memory. This might take more time.

   INPUT OPTIONS
       -t input-spec
               Select the input type. Possible values are:

       .       cudf for cudf files

       .       csw

       .       opam

       .       deb for Debian binary package files, also known as Packages files. Possibly compressed with gzip(1), bzip2(1) or xz(1), depending on compile-time options for dose3.

       .       debsrc for Debian source package files, also knows as Sources files.  Possibly compressed with gzip(1), bzip2(1) or xz(1), depending on compile-time options for dose3.

       .       edsp for apt-get External Dependency Solver Protocol

       .       eclipse for Eclipse (p2) package files

       .       hdlist for RPM hdlists

       .       synthesis for urpmi synthesis hdlists

       .       pef

       --checkonly package [,package] ...
               Takes  a  comma-separated  list  of  package  names,  each  of  them  possibly  with  a version constraint, as argument. The foreground is constituted of all packages that match any of the
               expressions, all other packages are pushed into the background. The initial distinction between foreground and background is ignored. This option must not be combined with --coinst.

               Example: --checkonly "libc6 , 2ping (= 1.2.3-1)"

       --latest n
               Consider only the latest -n most recent versions of each package, older versions of packages are ignored.

       --fg=file
               Add packages in file to the foreground.

       --bg=file
               Add packages in file to the background.

       --compare
               When    specified    with    a    pef    file,    select    the    comparison    function    used    by    the     pef     ->     cudf     encoding.     Possible     values     are     deb
               (<https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version>) , semver (<http://semver.org/>) , npm (<https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver>)

   OUTPUT OPTIONS
       -o, --outfile= file
               Send output to file.

       -d, --outdir= directory
               Set the output directory (default current directory).

       --dot   Save the explanation graph (one for each package) in dot format.

   DEBIAN SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Multi-arch annotations are correctly considered by distcheck. Packages whose's architecture is neither the native architecture nor in the list of foreign architectures (see below) are ignored.

       --deb-native-arch=name
               Specify the native architecture. The default behavior is to deduce the native architecture from the first package stanza in the input that has an architecture different from all.

       --deb-foreign-archs=name [,name] ...
               Specify a comma-separated list of foreign architectures. The default is an empty list of foreign architectures.

       --deb-ignore-essential
               Do  not  consider  essential  packages as part of the installation problem.  By default all essential package are considered as part of the installation problem for all packages, that is a
               package is installable if and only if it is co-installable with all essential packages. This option allows the user to test the installability with no essential packages installed.

       --deb-builds-from
               Add builds-from relationship of binary packages on source packages as dependency. This allows one to create graphs for bootstrapping purposes.

EXIT CODES
       Exit codes 0-63 indicate a normal termination of the program, codes 64-127 indicate abnormal termination of the program (such as parse errors, I/O errors).

       In case of normal program termination:

       - exit code 0 indicates that all foreground packages are found installable;

       - exit code 1 indicates that at least one foreground package is found uninstallable.

EXAMPLE
       Check which packages in a particular distribution are not installable and why:

        dose-distcheck -v -f -e \
        --bg deb:///var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_binary-amd64_Packages\
        --bg deb:///var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_non-free_binary-amd64_Packages\
        --fg deb:///var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_contrib_binary-amd64_Packages

       where Packages is the file pertaining to that distribution, as for instance found in the directory /var/lib/apt/lists.

       Check which packages in contrib are not installable when dependencies may be satisfied from main:

         debcheck --failures --bg=main_Packages contrib_Packages

NOTE
       Distcheck is a complete reimplementation of edos-debcheck, written for the EDOS project.
