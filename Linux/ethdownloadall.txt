NAME
       ethdownloadall

       Copies  one  or  more files to a group of hosts from a system. Since the file contents to copy may be different for each host, a separate directory on this system is used for the source files for each
       host. This can also be used in conjunction with ethuploadall to upload a host-specific configuration file, edit it for each host, and download the new version to all the hosts.

       NOTE: The tool ethdownloadall can only copy from this system to a group of hosts in the cluster. To copy files from hosts in the cluster to this host, use ethuploadall.

Syntax
       ethdownloadall [-rp] [-f  hostfile] [-d  download_dir] [-h 'HOSTS']
       [-u  user] source_file ...  dest_file

Options
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -r

                 Performs recursive download of directories.

       -p

                 Performs copy in parallel on all hosts.

       -f hostfile

                 Specifies the file with hosts in cluster. Default is /etc/eth-tools/hosts.

       -d download_dir

                 Specifies the directory to download files from. Default is downloads. If not specified, the environment variable DOWNLOADS_DIR is used. If that is not exported, the default is used.

       -h HOSTS

                 Specifies the list of hosts to download files to.

       -u user

                 Specifies the user to perform the copy. Default is the current user code.

       NOTE: The user@ style syntax cannot be used in the arguments to ethdownloadall.

       source_file

                 Specifies the list of source files to copy from the system.

                 The option  source_file is relative to  download_dir/hostname. A local directory within download_dir/ must exist for each host being downloaded to. Each downloaded file is copied from  down‐
                 load_dir/hostname/source_file.

       dest_file

                 Specifies the name of the file or directory on the destination hosts to copy to.

                 If more than one source file is specified, dest_file is treated as a directory name. The given directory must already exist on the destination host. The copy fails for hosts where the direc‐
                 tory does not exist.

Example
       ethdownloadall -h 'arwen elrond' irqbalance vncservers /etc

       # Copies two files to 2 hosts

       ethdownloadall -p irqbalance vncservers /etc

       # Copies two files to all hosts

                 List of hosts; used if -h option not supplied.

       HOSTS_FILE

                 File containing list of hosts; used in absence of -f and -h.

                 When the -p option is used, the maximum concurrent operations are performed.
