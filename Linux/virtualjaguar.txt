FILES
       virtualjaguar.log
              Virtualjaguar  log  file.  Only  written  if  the log option (-l or --log) is given. If the file cannot be opened, the log it sent to standard output instead. The log file is overwritten on
              startup. Note that the file is written to the current directory.

       ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/virtualjaguar/eeproms/ (typically ~/.local/share/data/virtualjaguar/eeproms/)
              Some Atari Jaguar cartridges feature a small writable EEPROM, used for saving game state and score lists. If this directory exists, virtualjaguar will emulate the EEPROM by saving the state
              in file in this directory.

       ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/virtualjaguar/software/ (typically ~/.local/share/data/virtualjaguar/software/)
              The virtualjaguar GUI for loading software scans this directory, and shows the loadable files, along with information about the program, and a label image  if  one  is  included  in  a  zip
              archive of the software.
