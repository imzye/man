NAME
       img2cif - filter to convert detector images to CBF format

SYNOPSIS
       img2cif [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       img2cif  is a program that converts an image file from a MAR180, MAR300, MAR345 or ADSC CCD detector to CBF format. In addition, img2cif includes code to process files from stdin and to stdout, so
       the program can be used in a pipe.

OPTIONS
       -i input_image
              (default: stdin) the input_image file in MAR300, MAR345 or ADSC CCD detector format is given.  If no input_image file is specified or is given as "-", an image is copied  from  stdin  to  a
              temporary file.

       -o output_cif
              (default:  stdout)  the output cif (if base64 or quoted-printable encoding is used) or cbf (if no encoding is used).  if no output_cif is specified or is given as "-", the output is written
              to stdout

       -c compression_scheme
              (packed, canonical or none, default packed)

       -m [no]headers
              (default headers for cifs, noheaders for cbfs) selects MIME (N. Freed, N. Borenstein, RFC 2045, November 1996) headers within binary data value text fields.

       -d [no]digest
              (default md5 digest [R. Rivest, RFC 1321, April 1992 using"RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"] when MIME headers are selected)

       -e encoding
              (base64, quoted-printable, decimal, hexadecimal, octal or none, default: base64) specifies one of the standard MIME encodings (base64 or quoted-printable) or a non-standard decimal,  hexam‐
              decimal or octal encoding for an ascii cif or "none" for a binary cbf

       -b direction
              (forward  or  backwards,  default:  natural  direction) specifies the direction of mapping of bytes into words for decimal, hexadecimal or octal output, marked by '>' for forward or '<' for
              backwards as the second character of each line of output, and in '#' comment lines.
