NAME
       ibprintrt.pl - print either only the router specified or a list of routers from the ibnetdiscover output

SYNOPSIS
       ibprintrt.pl [-R -l -C <ca_name> -P <ca_port>] [<rt_guid|node_name>]

DESCRIPTION
       Faster  than  greping/viewing with an editor the output of ibnetdiscover, ibprintrt.pl will parse out and print either the router information for the specified IB router or a list of all IB routers in
       the subnet.

       Finally, ibprintrt.pl will also reuse the cached ibnetdiscover output from some of the other diag tools which makes it a bit faster than running ibnetdiscover from scratch.

OPTIONS
       -l     List the Rts (simply a wrapper for ibrouters).

       -R     Recalculate the ibnetdiscover information, ie do not use the cached information.  This option is slower but should be used if the diag tools have not been used for some time  or  if  there  are
              other reasons to believe that the fabric has changed.

       -C <ca_name>    use the specified ca_name for the search.

       -P <ca_port>    use the specified ca_port for the search.
