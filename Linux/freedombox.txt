NAME
       plinth - a web front end for administering FreedomBox

SYNOPSIS

       plinth [-h, --help] [--server_dir {SERVER_DIR}] [--develop] [--diagnose] [--setup [application...]] [--setup-no-install [application...]] [--list-dependencies [application...]]

DESCRIPTION
       FreedomBox is a community project to develop, design and promote personal servers running free software for private, personal communications. It is a networking appliance designed to allow
       interfacing with the rest of the Internet under conditions of protected privacy and data security. It hosts applications such as blog, wiki, website, social network, email, web proxy and a Tor
       relay on a device that can replace a wireless router so that data stays with the users.

       Plinth is a web interface to administer the functions of the FreedomBox. It is extensible and is made of modules. Each module provides a simplified user interface to control the underlying
       functionality of a specific application of FreedomBox. As FreedomBox can act as a wireless router, it is possible to configure networking from Plinth. Plinth allows configuration of basic system
       parameters such as time zone, hostname and automatic upgrade settings.

OPTIONS
       --server_dir SERVER_DIR
           This the URL fragment under which Plinth will provide its services. Plinth is shipped with a default value of /plinth. This means that Plinth will be available as http://localhost:8000/plinth
           by default.

       --develop
           Enable development mode. Use develop.config and action scripts from the current working directory. Enables extra debug messages, enable Django debug mode for detailed error pages and turn off
           Django security features. Monitor source files for changes and restart Plinth on modifications. Die if there is an error during module initialization.

       --diagnose
           If provided, Plinth loads modules, performs initialization but does start the web server. Instead it runs diagnostic tests on each module and exits.

       --setup
           Perform application setup operations and exit. Setting up an application involves installing packages required for that application and performing pre and post install configuration setups. If
           no application is provided, setup all applications which describe themselves as essential. If a list of applications is provided, setup only those applications.

       --setup-no-install
           Same as --setup but no new Debian packages are installed during setup. When a package needs to be installed, a check is done to make sure the package is already installed. If the package is
           already installed, no upgrade is performed and setup skips this step and proceeds to next operation. If the package is not installed an error is raised and setup process halts. This is option
           is useful for running setup during post installation script of a Debian package. Essential packages are added as dependencies for the Debian package and then setup process is executed from
           post install script of the Debian package.

       --list-dependencies
           For the list of provided applications, print the list of packages needed by the applications. If no application is provided as additional argument, then print list of packages needed by all
           essential applications. If '*' is provided in the list of the applications, then list of packages needed by all applications will be printed. Although, packages are installed when the
           application is first accessed, this list will be useful for adding list of dependencies to a Debian package and to get a list of all interesting packages. Other output may be printed on stderr
           and should be ignored.

       --version
           Show the version of FreedomBox and exit.

CONFIGURATION
       Plinth reads various configuration options from the files /usr/share/freedombox/freedombox.config, /usr/share/freedombox/freedombox.config.d/*.config, /etc/plinth/plinth.config,
       /etc/plinth/plinth.config.d/*.config, /etc/freedombox/freedombox.config and /etc/freedombox/freedombox.config.d/*.config in that order. Options in a file read later override options specified
       earlier.  /etc/plinth/ locations are deprecated.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1. Start Plinth with default options

           $ plinth

       Run Plinth as guided by configuration file.

       Example 2. Run Plinth with different URL prefix

           $ plinth --server_dir='/myurl'

       Run Plinth with the '/myurl' prefix. Note that Apache forwards requests to '/plinth' by default, so /myurl is not accessible outside of your FreedomBox without adapting the apache configuration.

       Example 3. Run Plinth in development mode

           $ plinth --develop

       Run in development mode on the terminal. Enable auto-reloading and more extensive debugging.
