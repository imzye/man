NAME
       ghextris - Hextris game for GNOME

SYNOPSIS
       ghextris

DESCRIPTION
       ghextris is a Python/GNOME reimplementation of the semi-free Xhextris by David Markley. The object of the game is basically the same as in Tetris; use the pieces that fall down from the top of the
       game  area to construct fully filled lines, which will then disappear to make room for more pieces.  The twist, as first introduced by Markley, is that the pieces are composed of hexagonal blocks,
       so your visualization skills will get an extra workout.

RULES
       The pieces can be moved left and right with the respective arrow keys and rotated with the up and down arrow keys. If you're satisfied with where a piece is going, it can be  dropped  by  pressing
       the space bar.  Fully formed lines will disappear from the playing field.  The game will end when the pile of pieces reaches the top of the game area.

   Score
       You get 1 point for every line that you drop a piece, and 100, 200, 400 or 800 points for 1, 2, 3 or 4 simultaneously destroyed lines, respectively.
