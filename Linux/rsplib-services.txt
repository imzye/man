NAME
       scriptingserviceexample — Example client script for the Scripting Service

SYNOPSIS
       scriptingserviceexample [ID]

DESCRIPTION
       scriptingserviceexample is a small shell script providing an example of how to use the scripting service PU and PE: it first creates a temporary directory with a name created from the given unique
       ID. In this directory, an input directory is created containing two files: an example input file "my-input.data" and a run script "ssrun" (the run script is written by echo commands within script‐
       ingserviceexample).  The  input  directory is archived by Tar/GZip and provided to scriptingclient as input file. scriptingclient distributes the input to a Scripting PE, which unpacks the archive
       and executes "ssrun".  "ssrun" gets the name of an output archive as its first argument; this archive is created by the example script and contains an example  output  file  "my-output.data".  The
       output archive is transferred back to the PU. Finally, scriptingserviceexample dumps the content of "my-output.data".
       scriptingserviceexample  can be taken as an example to do something more useful with the scripting service: for example, simulation input could be packaged with a script actually executing a simu‐
       lation program on the input and archiving the results. Then, the scripting service can be used to distribute a set of simulation runs to a pool of processing nodes.
       Important note on security: the scripting service does not include any security features yet. That is, arbitrary scripts will be executed. Without modifications (for example  signatures),  do  NOT
       use it outside of a controlled environment!

ARGUMENTS
       The following options are available:

       ID      Gives an unique identifier for the example run, for example: 1234.
