NAME
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Dist::Zilla::Develop - create bare-bones Makefile.PL files for use with dzil

VERSION
       version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
         # Makefile.PL
         use ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Dist::Zilla::Develop;
         WriteMakefile(NAME => 'Foo::Bar');

DESCRIPTION
       Dist::Zilla makes developing modules much easier by generating all kinds of boilerplate files, saving authors from having to write them by hand, but in some cases this can make developing more
       inconvenient. The most prominent example of this is with "Makefile.PL" files - although the majority of distributions can be hacked on just by editing the files in a source control checkout and
       using "prove" for testing, for some this isn't sufficient. In particular, distributions which use an auto-generated test suite and distributions which use XS both need special handling at build
       time before they will function, and with Dist::Zilla, this means running "dzil build" and rebuilding after every change. This is tedious!

       This module provides an alternative. Create a minimal "Makefile.PL" in source control which handles just enough functionality for basic development (it can be as minimal as just what is in the
       "SYNOPSIS", but can also contain commands to generate your test suite, for example), and tell Dist::Zilla to replace it with a real "Makefile.PL" when you're actually ready to build a real
       distribution. To do this, make sure you're still using the MakeMaker plugin, either directly or through a pluginbundle like @Basic, and add the "exclude_filename = Makefile.PL" option to your
       dist.ini where you use "[GatherDir]".

       In addition, this module also intercepts the "install" and "dist" rules in the generated Makefile to run the appropriate Dist::Zilla commands ("dzil install" and "dzil build"). This allows users
       to continue to use the "perl Makefile.PL && make && make install" set of commands, and have the correct thing continue to happen.

       Note that if you're using this module to ease testing of an XS distribution, you'll need to account for your module not containing a $VERSION statement (assuming you're using the PkgVersion
       plugin). To do this, you should use an XSLoader invocation similar to this:

         BEGIN {
             XSLoader::load(
                 'Foo::Bar',
                 $Foo::Bar::{VERSION} ? ${ $Foo::Bar::{VERSION} } : ()
             );
         }

       This ensures that the $Foo::Bar::VERSION glob isn't created if it didn't exist initially, since this can confuse XSLoader.
