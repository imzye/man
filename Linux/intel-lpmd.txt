NAME
       intel_lpmd_config.xml - Configuration file for intel_lpmd

SYNOPSIS
       $(TDCONFDIR)/etc/intel_lpmd/intel_lpmd_config.xml

DESCRIPTION
       intel_lpmd_config.xml  is  a configuration file for the Intel Low Power Mode Daemon.  It is used to describe the lp_mode_cpus to use in Low Power Mode, as well as the way to restrict work to those
       CPUs. It also describes if and how the HFI monitor and utilization monitor works. The location of this file depends on the configuration option used during build time.

       lp_mode_cpus is a set of active CPUs when system is in Low Power Mode.  This usually equals a group of most power efficient CPUs on a platform to achieve best power saving. When not specified, in‐
       tel_lpmd tool can detect this automatically. E.g. it uses an E-core Module on Intel Alderlake platform, and it uses the Low Power E-cores on SoC Die on Intel Meteorlake platform.

       Mode specifies the way to migrate the tasks to the lp_mode_cpus.

       • Mode 0: set cpuset to the lp_mode_cpus for systemd. All tasks created by systemd will run on these CPUs only. This is supported for cgroup v2 based systemd only.

       • Mode 1: Isolate the non-lp_mode_cpus so that tasks are scheduled to the lp_mode_cpus only.

       • Mode 2: Force idle injection to the non-lp_mode_cpus and leverage the scheduler to schedule the other tasks to the lp_mode_cpus.

       PerformanceDef specifies the default behavior when power setting is set to Performance.

       • -1 : Never enter Low Power Mode.

       • 0 : opportunistic Low Power Mode enter/exit based on HFI/Utilization request.

       • 1 : Always stay in Low Power Mode.

       BalancedDef specifies the default behavior when power setting is set to Balanced.

       PowersaverDef specifies the default behavior when power setting is set to Power saver.

       HfiLpmEnable specifies if the HFI monitor can capture the HFI hints for Low Power Mode.

       HfiSuvEnable specifies if the HFI monitor can capture the HFI hints for survivability mode.

       WLTHintEnable Enable use of hardware Workload type hints.

       WLTProxyEnable Enable use of Proxy Workload type hints.

       util_entry_threshold specifies the system utilization threshold for entering Low Power Mode.  The system workload is considered to fit the lp_mode_cpus capacity when system  utilization  is  under
       this threshold.  Setting to 0 or leaving this empty disables the utilization monitor.

       util_exit_threshold  specifies the CPU utilization threshold for exiting Low Power Mode.  The system workload is considered to not fit the lp_mode_cpus capacity when the utilization of the busiest
       lp_mode_cpus is above this threshold.  Setting to 0 or leaving this empty disables the utilization monitor.

       EntryDelayMS specifies the sample interval used by the utilization Monitor when system wants to enter Low Power Mode based on system utilization.  Setting to 0 or leaving this empty will cause the
       utilization Monitor to use the default interval, 1000 milli seconds.

       ExitDelayMS specifies the sample interval used by the utilization Monitor when system wants to exit Low Power Mode based on CPU utilization.  Setting to 0 or leaving this empty will cause the uti‐
       lization Monitor to use the adaptive value. The adaptive interval is based on CPU utilization.  The busier the CPU is, the shorter interval the utilization monitor uses.

       EntryHystMS specifies a hysteresis threshold when system is in Low Power Mode.  If set, when the previous average time stayed in Low Power Mode is lower than this  value,  the  current  enter  Low
       Power Mode request will be ignored because it is expected that the system will exit Low Power Mode soon.  Setting to 0 or leaving this empty disables this hysteresis algorithm.

       ExitHystMS  specifies  a  hysteresis threshold when system is not in Low Power Mode.  If set, when the previous average time stayed out of Low-Power-Mode is lower than this value, the current exit
       Low Power Mode request will be ignored because it is expected that the system will enter Low Power Mode soon.  Setting to 0 or leaving this empty disables this hysteresis algorithm.

       IgnoreITMT Avoid changing scheduler ITMT flag. This means that during transition to low power mode, ITMT flag is not changed. This reduces latency during switching. This flag is not used when con‐
       figuration uses "State" based configuration, where this flag can be defined per state.

       States Allows one to define per platform low power states. Each state defines has an entry condition and set of parameters to use.

State Definition
       There can be multiple State configuration can be present. Each configuration is valid for a platform. A State header defines parameters, which are used to match a platform.  CPUFamily CPU  genera‐
       tion to match.

       CPUModel CPU model to match.

       CPUConfig  Define  a  configuration of CPUs and TDP to match different skews for the same CPU model and family. CPU configuration string format is: xPyEzL-tdpW. For example: 12P8E2L-28W, defines a
       platform with 6 P-cores with hyper threading enabled, 8 E cores, 2 LPE cores and the TDP is 28W.  This configuration allows wildcard "*" to match any combination.

Per State Definition
       Each "State" defines entry criteria and parameters to use.  ID A unique ID for the state.

       Name A name for the state.

       EntrySystemLoadThres System Entry load threshold in percent. System utilization is different based on the number of CPUs are active in a configuration. This value  is  calculated  from  /proc/stat
       sysfs. To enter into this state, the system utilization must be less or equal to this value.

       EnterCPULoadThres  CPU  Entry  load  threshold  in  percent. Per CPU utilization is also obtained from /proc/stat. To enter into this state any active CPU utilization must be less or equal to this
       value.  EnterCPULoadThres is checked before EntrySystemLoadThres to match a state.

       WLTType Workload type value to enter into this state. If this value is defined then utilization based entry triggers are not used. To use this WLTHintEnable must be enabled, so that hardware noti‐
       fications are enabled.

       ActiveCPUs Active CPUs in this state. The list can be comma separated or use "-" for a range. This is optional to have active CPUs in a state.

       EPP EPP to apply for this state. -1 to ignore.

       EPB EPB to apply for this state. -1 to ignore.

       ITMTState Set the state of ITMT flag. -1 to ignore.

       IRQMigrate Migrate IRQs to the active CPUs in this state. -1 to ignore.

       MinPollInterval Minimum polling interval in milli seconds.

       MaxPollInterval Maximum polling interval in milli seconds. This is optional, if there is no maximum is desired.

       PollIntervalIncrement Polling interval increment in milli seconds. If this value is -1, then polling increment is adaptive based on the utilization.

FILE FORMAT
       The configuration file format conforms to XML specifications.
