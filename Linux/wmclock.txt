NAME
       wmclock - A dockable clock for the Window Maker window manager

SYNOPSIS

       wmclock [{-12|-24|-year}] [-noblink] [-version] [-exe program] [-led color] [-monthxpm filename] [-weekdayxpm filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Wmclock  is an applet which displays the date and time in a dockable tile in the same style as the clock from the NEXTSTEP(tm) operating system.  Wmclock is specially designed for the Window Maker
       window manager, by Alfredo Kojima, and features multiple language support, twenty-four-hour and twelve-hour (am/pm) time display, and, optionally, can run  a  user-specified  program  on  a  mouse
       click.  Wmclock is derived from asclock, a similar clock for the AfterStep window manager.

OPTIONS
       -12 or -24
              Display the time in either twelve-hour format (with am/pm) or twenty-four-hour format.  Defaults to twenty-four-hour display.

       -year  Display the current year in the LED display instead of the time.

       -noblink
              The separator between the hours and minutes in the time display blinks by default.  This option turns off the blinking and displays a steadily lit separator instead.

       -interval n
              Set the blink cycle to n seconds.  The default is 2 (1 second on, 1 second off).

       -version
              Displays the version of Wmclock.

       -exe command
              Run command in the background when a mouse button is pressed over wmclock.  See below for details.

       -led color
              Use  color  as the foreground color of the LED display.  Color may be either a named color from the rgb.txt database (for example, `red' or `chartreuse') or a numeric color specification in
              any of the usual X11 formats (for example, `#ff0000' or `rgb:7f/ff/00').  See the X(1) man page for more information.

       -monthxpm filename
              Get month abbreviations from filename, which is expected to be in the XPM format.  See below for details.

       -weekdayxpm filename
              Get weekday abbreviations from filename, which is expected to be in the XPM format.  See below for details.

INVOCATION AND EXAMPLES
       The simplest way to start wmclock is:

              wmclock

       Wmclock displays in its own appicon, which you can place in Window Maker's dock by holding down the [Alt] or [Meta] key and dragging wmclock to the dock with the primary mouse button (usually  the
       left one).

       For a more complicated example:

              wmclock -12 -led gold -exe /usr/GNUstep/Apps/WPrefs.app/WPrefs

       This displays 12-hour time in an amber-colored LED display, and starts Window Maker's preferences utility when you click on wmclock.

DETAILS
   Running Commands
       When  you  use wmclock with the -exe option, wmclock will run the command you specify whenever you press a mouse button while the mouse cursor is over wmclock.  Wmclock uses the system(3) function
       from the C library (and ultimately /bin/sh) to run the command; hence, the command must be in Bourne-shell syntax.

   Using Alternate Month and Weekday Abbreviations
       You can use the -monthxpm and -weekdayxpm options to convince wmclock to display month and day-of-week abbreviations in a language besides the one it was compiled with, or to  display  them  in  a
       language that wmclock does not yet support.  The files you specify must be in the XPM format, and they must follow the same strict size and placement as the month and weekday XPMs that come in the
       wmclock  source  package.   Each  weekday  abbreviation must be 21 pixels wide and 6 pixels high; each month abbreviation must be 22 pixels wide and 6 pixels high.  The month abbreviations must be
       arranged vertically, beginning with January at the top and continuing down to December at the bottom.  The weekday abbreviations must also be arranged vertically, beginning with Monday at the  top
       and continuing to Sunday at the bottom.

       You can find XPM files for a variety of languages in:

              /usr/share/wmclock

       For example, to have a French display, you could use the following command line:

              wmclock -monthxpm /usr/share/wmclock/lang.french/month.xpm -weekdayxpm /usr/share/wmclock/lang.french/weekday.xpm

   Obsolete Options
       In  order  to maintain command-line compatibility (mostly) with asclock, wmclock accepts a few options on the command line without complaining, even though they don't have any effect.  The options
       which wmclock accepts in this manner are -shape and -iconic.  Some dockable versions of asclock required one or both of these options to become properly dockable.  However, Since  wmclock  is  de‐
       signed for Window Maker's dock, it already displays in a shaped window in its own dockable appicon.

BUGS
       Wmclock shouldn't run a command on a single click; should use a double click instead.

       Wmclock should use Alfredo Kojima's libdockapp library instead of inventing its own wheel.
