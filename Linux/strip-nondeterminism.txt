NAME
       strip-nondeterminism - strip nondeterministic information from files

SYNOPSIS
        strip-nondeterminism [-t filetype] filename ...

DESCRIPTION
       strip-nondeterminism is a tool to strip bits of nondeterministic information, such as timestamps, from files.  It can be used as a post-processing step to make a build reproducible, when the build
       process itself cannot be made deterministic.

OPTIONS
       -t filetype, --type filetype
           Use the normalizer for the given file type (ar, gzip, jar, zip).  If this option is not specified, the file type is detected automatically based on the file name extension.

       -T seconds, --timestamp seconds
           Instead of stripping timestamps from files, set them to the given number of seconds since January 1, 1970.

       --clamp-timestamp
           Only  replace timestamps if they are later than the time specified to --timestamp.  You can use this option to ensure that only timestamps introduced as part of the build process are replaced.
           NOT YET IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL FILE FORMATS.

       --normalizers SPEC
           Enable or disable specific normalizers separated by a comma (eg. +foo,-bar.  The magic values +all and -all will enable and disable all normalizers.

       -h, --help
           Display this help message.

       -V, --version
           Print only the version string and then quit.
