ASTRIBANK_ALLOW(8)                                                                                                                                                                           ASTRIBANK_ALLOW(8)

NAME
       astribank_allow - License Xorcom Astribank (xpp) capabilities.

SYNOPSIS
       astribank_allow -D device-path [ options ]

       astribank_allow [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       Modern Astribanks (with USB product id's 116x) contain capabilities that may be licensed.

       astribank_allow is used to upload/download the licensing information to/from the device.

       Uploading  a  valid  license  file  to  an Astribank, changes its capabilities.  The change becomes effective after a firmware reset (either by powering the device off and on again, or via the astrib‐
       ank_tool full reset option).

       Downloading license from the device, produces a valid license file for its current capabilities. This may be backed up, so the device may be later restored to its previous capabilities.

       The license file contains both a human readable description of the device capabilities for the end user and a hash of the licensing information used by Xorcom to generate/modify licensed capabilities.

OPTIONS
       -D device-path
              Required. The device to read from/write to. This is bus_num/device_num, where bus_num and device_num are the first two numbers in the output of lsusb(8) or dahdi_hardware(8).  On older versions
              of this tool you needed a complete path to the device, which would be /dev/bus/usb/bus_num/device_num, or /proc/bus/usb/bus_num/device_num.

       -w
              Write capabilities to EEPROM, otherwise read capabilities

       -f filename
              License filename (stdin/stdout if not specified)

       -m num
              Choose the numeric code of license markers to generate.  This code select the type of BEGIN.../END... strings that delimit the license body.

              Valid marker codes are listed with the -h option.  The default (and first) code is 1. Zero is illegal value.

       -v
              Increase verbosity. May be used multiple times.

       -d mask
              Set debug mask to mask. Default is 0, 0xFF is "everything".

       -h
              Displays usage message.
