NAME
       stressapptest - stress test application for simulating high load situations

SYNOPSIS
       stressapptest [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the stressapptest command.

       stressapptest  (unix name for Stressful Application Test) is a program that tries to maximize randomized traffic to memory from processor and I/O, with the intent of creating a realistic high load
       situation in order to test the existing hardware devices in a computer.

OPTIONS
       This program supports the following options:

       -A     Run in degraded mode on incompatible systems.

       -C <threads>
              Number of memory CPU stress threads to run.

       -d <device>
              Add a direct write disk thread with block device (or file) 'device'.

       -f <filename>
              Add a disk thread with tempfile 'filename'.

       -F     Don't result check each transaction.

       -i <threads>
              Number of memory invert threads to run.

       -l <logfile>
              Log output to file 'logfile'.

       -m <threads>
              Number of memory copy threads to run.

       -M <mbytes>
              Megabytes of RAM to test.

       -n <ipaddr>
              Add a network thread connecting to system at 'ipaddr'.

       -p <pagesize>
              Size in bytes of memory chunks.

       -s <seconds>
              Number of seconds to run.

       -v <level>
              Verbosity (0-20), default is 8.

       -W     Use more CPU-stressful memory copy.

       --blocks-per-segment <number>
              Number of blocks to read/write per segment per iteration (-d).

       --cache-size <size>
              Size of disk cache (-d).

       --cc_inc_count <number>
              Number of times to increment the cacheline's member.

       --cc_line_count <number>
              Number of cache line sized datastructures to allocate for the cache coherency threads to operate.

       --cc_line_size <number>
              Size of cache line to use as the basis for cache coherency test data structures.

       --cc_test
              Do the cache coherency testing.

       --destructive
              Write/wipe disk partition (-d).

       --filesize <size>
              Size of disk IO tempfiles.

       --findfiles
              Find locations to do disk IO automatically.

       --force_errors
              Inject false errors to test error handling.

       --force_errors_like_crazy
              Inject a lot of false errors to test error handling.

       --listen
              Run threads that listen for incoming net connections.

       --local_numa
              Choose memory regions associated with each CPU to be tested by that CPU.

       --max_errors <number>
              Exit early after finding specified number of errors.

       --monitor_mode
              Only do ECC error polling, no stress load.

       --no_errors
              Run without checking for ECC or other errors.

       --paddr_base <address>
              Allocate memory starting from this address.

       --pause_delay <seconds>
              Delay (in seconds) between power spikes.

       --pause_duration <seconds>
              Duration (in seconds) of each pause.

       --random-threads <number>
              Number of random threads for each disk write thread (-d).

       --read-block-size <size>
              Size of block for reading (-d).

       --read-threshold <time>
              Maximum time (in us) a block read should take (-d).

       --remote_numa <time>
              Choose memory regions not associated with each CPU to be tested by that CPU.

       --segment-size <size>
              Size of segments to split disk into (-d).

       --stop_on_errors
              Stop after finding the first error.

       --write-block-size <size>
              Size of block for writing (-d). If not defined, the size of block for writing will be defined as the size of block for reading.

       --write-threshold <time>
              Maximum time (in us) a block write should take (-d).
