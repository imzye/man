GIMPLUT(1)                       User commands                      GIMPLUT(1)

NAME
       gimplut - convert GIMP gradient (ggr) files to binary lookup tables
       (lut).

SYNOPSIS
       gimplut [-h] [-o file] [-s samples] [-v] [-V] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The gimplut utility converts gradient files from the GIMP(1), the GNU
       Image Manipulation Program, to a binary lookup table format commonly
       used by medical imaging software; in particular the Medcon(1) package.

       The LUT format consists of n red, n green and n blue bytes, interpreted
       as integers from 0 to 255.

       The program will read from stdin if a file is not specified as the
       final argument, and write to stdout if the -o option is not specified.

OPTIONS
       --backtrace-file path
           Specify a file to which to write a formatted backtrace. The file
           will only be created if there is a backtrace created, typically
           when an error occurs.

       --backtrace-format format
           Specify the format of the backtrace written to the files specified
           by --backtrace-file, one of plain, xml or json.

       -h, --help
           Brief help.

       -o, --output file
           Write the output to file, rather than stdout.

       -s, --samples number
           Use the specified number of samples rather than 256.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose operation.

       -V, --version
           Version information.

CAVEATS
       The alpha channel of the input is completely ignored in the output.

       At some point in the future the functionality of this program will be
       transferred to the svgx(1) program.
