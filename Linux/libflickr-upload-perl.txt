NAME
       flickr_upload - Upload photos to "flickr.com"

SYNOPSIS
       flickr_upload [--auth] --auth_token <auth_token> [--title <title>]      [--description description] [--public <0|1>] [--friend <0|1>]      [--family <0|1>] [--tag <tag>] [--option key=value]
       [--progress]
           <photos...>

DESCRIPTION
       Batch image uploader for the Flickr.com service.

       flickr_upload may also be useful for generating authentication tokens against other API keys/secrets (i.e. for embedding in scripts).

OPTIONS
       --auth
           The  "--auth"  flag will cause flickr_upload to generate an authentication token against it's API key and secret (or, if you want, your own specific key and secret).  This process requires the
           caller to have a browser handy so they can cut and paste a url. The resulting token should be kept somewhere like "~/.flickrrc" since it's necessary for actually uploading images.

       --auth_token <auth_token>
           Authentication token. You must get an authentication token using "--auth" before you can upload images. See the EXAMPLES section.

       --oauth
           Interactively perform OAuth authorization with Flickr. The user will get a URL to visit at Flickr at which Flickr::Upload must be granted write permissions. After granting permission, the user
           will be redirected to a dummy URL that contains an OAuth token and verifier. This user will  paste  this  URL  at  the  prompt,  and  flickr_upload  will  save  the  resulting  credentials  in
           "~/.flickroauth.st".

       --title <title>
           Title to use on all the images. Optional.

       --description <description>
           Description to use on all the images. Optional.

       --public <0|1>
           Override the default "is_public" access control. Optional.

       --friend <0|1>
           Override the default "is_friend" access control. Optional.

       --family <0|1>
           Override the default "is_family" access control. Optional.

       --tag <tag>
           Images  are  tagged with "tag". Multiple "--tag" options can be given, or you can just put them all into a single space-separated list. If you want to define a tag with spaces, the quotes have
           to be part of the tag itself.  The following works in bash:

             flickr_upload --tag='"tag one"' --tag='"tag two"' image.jpg

       --reverse
           Reverse the list of supplied images. Useful when uploading contents of directory with sorted filenames. Following example will upload the last glob expanded file as first and vice  versa.  The
           last file will appear first in target photo stream.

             flickr_upload --reverse *.jpg

       --set <NAME>
           After successfully uploading all photos, create a new set named "NAME", and add the photos into the set. One (random) photo will be the set's thumbnail.

       --option key=value
           Flickr  periodically  adds  new  features  to  the  uploading API, and these are almost always implemented as new key/value pairs. Rather than waiting for a new Flickr::Upload release, you can
           specify any of the upload API's optional arguments using "--option".

             flick_upload --option content_type=1 --tag='cats' two_cats.jpg

           You may also use "--option" rather than flickr_upload's command-line options:

             flickr_upload --option is_public=1 --option title='cats' two_cats.jpg

           While Flickr may add new options at any time (see <https://www.flickr.com/services/api/upload.api.html> for the most up-to-date list), currently known options include:

           --option safety_level=<1|2|3>
               Override the default "safety_level" notation.  Set to 1 for Safe, 2 for Moderate, or 3 for Restricted.  Refer to <https://www.flickr.com/help/filters/>.

           --option content_type=<1|2|3>
               Override the default "content_type" notation.  Set to 1 for Photo, 2 for Screenshot, or 3 for Art/Illustration.  Refer to <https://www.flickr.com/help/filters/>.

           --option hidden=<1|2>
               Override the default "hidden" notation.  Set to 1 to keep the photo in global search results, 2 to hide from public earches.

           Note that options unknown to Flickr will result in undefined behaviour.

       --check
           Checks the authentication token via the flickr.auth.checkToken API call.  This can be used to verify API keys and credentials without trying to upload an image. The output is the  raw  results
           of the API call.

       --progress, --no-progress
           Display a progress bar for each upload with Term::ProgressBar. That optional module will have to be installed on the system.

           The default is not to display a progress bar. That can be changed in the configuration file:

               echo progress=1 >~/.flickrrc

       --report, --no-report
           Report the status of each upload ticket after uploading the batch via Flickr::Upload's check_upload method. On by default. Checking the status can be canceled by pressing ctrl-C.

           The default is to display a report after each upload. That can be changed in the configuration file:

               echo report=0 >~/.flickrrc

       --key <api_key>
       --secret <secret>
           Your  own  API  key  and  secret.  This is useful if you want to use flickr_upload in auth mode as a token generator. You need both "key" and "secret". Both "key" and "secret" can be placed in
           "~/.flickrrc", allowing to mix flickr_upload with your own scripts using the same API key and authentication token. Getting  your  own  API  key  and  secret  is  encouraged  if  you're  tying
           flickr_upload to some automated process.

           Note  that  if  you  do  get  an  authentication  token  against  your own API key and secret, you'll need to specify the key and secret along with the token when uploading images. The default
           flickr_upload API key and token won't work in that case.

       <photos...>
           List of photos to upload. Uploading stops as soon as a failure is detected during the upload. The script exit code will indicate the number  of  images  on  the  command  line  that  were  not
           uploaded.  For  each  uploaded  image, a Flickr URL will be generated. flickr_upload uses asynchronous uploading so while the image is usually transferred fairly quickly, it might take a while
           before it's actually available to users. flickr_upload will wait around for that to complete, but be aware that delays of upwards of thirty minutes have (rarely) been know to occur.

EXAMPLES
       First, you need to get an authentication token. This is a requirement driven by how Flickr manages third-party applications:

          cpb@earth:~$ flickr_upload --auth
               1. Enter the following URL into your browser

               https://www.flickr.com/services/auth?api_sig=<...>&frob=<...>&perms=write&api_key=<...>

               2. Follow the instructions on the web page
               3. Hit <Enter> when finished.
               Your authentication token for this application is
               <token>

       Unless you like typing long numbers on the command-line, you should keep the "<token"> somewhere handy, like a configuration file:

          echo auth_token=<token> >~/.flickrrc

       Uploading a bunch of images is then as easy as:

          flickr_upload --tag 'dog' 'kernel in a window.jpg' 'sad in sunbeam.jpg'

CONFIGURATION
       To avoid having to remember authentication tokens and such (or have them show up in the process table listings), default values will be read from "$HOME/.flickrrc" if it exists. Any field  defined
       there can, of course, be overridden on the command line. For example:

               # my config at $HOME/.flickrrc
               auth_token=334455
               is_public=0
               is_friend=1
               is_family=1

       Note, however, that these defaults override the defaults you've assigned in your Flickr profile. You may want to do all that stuff in one place.

BUGS
       Error handling could be better.
