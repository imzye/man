NAME
       Trinity - RNA-Seq De novo Assembly

DESCRIPTION
       Trinity represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity combines three independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis,
       and  Butterfly,  applied  sequentially  to process large volumes of RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de Bruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional
       complexity at a given gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently to extract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.

OPTIONS
       Required:

              --seqType <string> type of reads: ( fa, or fq )

              --max_memory <string> suggested max memory to use by Trinity where limiting can be enabled. (jellyfish, sorting, etc) provied in Gb of RAM, ie.  '--max_memory 10G'

       If paired reads:

              --left  <string> left reads, one or more (separated by space)

              --right <string> right reads, one or more (separated by space)

       Or, if unpaired reads:

              --single <string> single reads, one or more (note, if single file contains pairs, can use flag: --run_as_paired )

       Misc:

              --SS_lib_type <string> Strand-specific RNA-Seq read orientation.  if paired: RF or FR, if single: F or R.   (dUTP method = RF) See web documentation.

              --CPU <int> number of CPUs to use, default: 2

              --min_contig_length <int> minimum assembled contig length to report (def=200)

              --long_reads <string> fasta file containing error-corrected or circular consensus (CCS) pac bio reads

              --genome_guided_bam <string> genome guided mode, provide path to coordinate-sorted bam file.  (see genome-guided param section under --show_full_usage_info)

              --jaccard_clip option, set if you have paired reads and you expect high gene density with UTR overlap (use FASTQ input file format for reads).  (note: jaccard_clip is  an  expensive  opera‐
              tion, so avoid using it unless necessary due to finding excessive fusion transcripts w/o it.)

              --trimmomatic run Trimmomatic to quality trim reads see '--quality_trimming_params' under full usage info for tailored settings.

              --normalize_reads run in silico normalization of reads. Defaults to max. read coverage of 50.  see '--normalize_max_read_cov' under full usage info for tailored settings.

              --no_distributed_trinity_exec do not run Trinity phase 2 (assembly of partitioned reads), and stop after generating command list.

              --output <string> name of directory for output (will be created if it doesn't already exist) default(your current working directory)

              --full_cleanup only retain the Trinity fasta file, rename as ${output_dir}.Trinity.fasta

              --cite show the Trinity literature citation

              --version reports Trinity version (Trinity_v2.0.2) and exits.

              --show_full_usage_info show the many many more options available for running Trinity (expert usage).

EXAMPLES
       A typical Trinity command might be:

              Trinity --seqType fq --max_memory 50G --left reads_1.fq  --right reads_2.fq --CPU 6

       and for Genome-guided Trinity:

              Trinity --genome_guided_bam rnaseq_alignments.csorted.bam --max_memory 50G
                      --genome_guided_max_intron 10000 --CPU 6
