NAME
       autopkgtest-virt-chroot - autopkgtest virtualisation server using a chroot

SYNOPSIS
       autopkgtest [...] -- chroot [options] [-rgain-root-cmd] /path/to/chroot

DESCRIPTION
       autopkgtest-virt-chroot provides an autopkgtest virtualisation server using a chroot install (or similar).

       Normally autopkgtest-virt-chroot will be invoked by autopkgtest.

       The chroot directory to use must be specified.

OPTIONS
       --gain-root|-r gain-root-cmd
              Specifies  that  autopkgtest-virt-chroot  can become root (on the host) by prefixing its commands with gain-root-cmd.  The command may consist of several words separated by whitespace, in which
              case words other than the first are supplied as additional arguments to the command; other shell (or other) metacharacters in gain-root-cmd are not interpreted or modified by  autopkgtest-virt-
              chroot.  The actual command to be run as root, and its arguments, are supplied as additional (separate) arguments to gain-root-cmd.

              Root privilege is needed, to successfully run chroot(8), if the chroot to use is specified as an absolute path.  The default is not to take any special action when root will be needed, in which
              case for an absolute path chroot, autopkgtest-virt-chroot must be started as root.

       -d | --debug
              Enables debugging output.  Probably not hugely interesting.

INPUT, OUTPUT AND EXIT STATUS
       The behaviour of autopkgtest-virt-chroot is as described by the AutomatedTesting virtualisation regime specification.
