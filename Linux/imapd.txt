NAME
       IMAPd - Internet Message Access Protocol server

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/imapd

DESCRIPTION
       imapd  is  a server which supports the IMAP4rev1 remote mail access protocol as documented in RFC-3501.  imapd is invoked by the internet server (see inetd(8)), normally for requests to connect to the
       IMAP port as indicated by the /etc/services file (see services(5)).  Normally, this is port 143 for plaintext IMAP and 993 for SSL IMAP.

       This daemons contains CRAM-MD5 support.  See the md5.txt documentation file for additional information.

       imapd can also be accessed via rsh(1) by many Unix-based clients.  To do this, the imapd binary must have a link to /etc/rimapd since this is where this software expects it to be located.
