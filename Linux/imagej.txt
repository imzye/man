NAME
       imagej - A Java image processing program inspired by NIH Image.

SYNTAX
       imagej [option] <filename>
       imagej [-i image] [-b|-m] [arg1 ... argN]

DESCRIPTION
       Imagej  is  a  Java-based  image  processing  program developed at the National Institutes of Health. ImageJ was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins and
       recordable macros.  Custom acquisition, analysis and processing plugins can be developed using ImageJ's built-in editor and a Java compiler.  User-written plugins make it possible  to  solve  many
       image processing and analysis problems, from 3-dimensional live-cell imaging,
        to  radiological image processing, multiple imaging system data comparisons to automated hematology systems.  ImageJ's plugin architecture and built in development environment has made it a popu‐
       lar platform for teaching image processing.

       ImageJ can be run as an online applet, a downloadable application, or on any computer with a Java 1.1 or later virtual machine.

OPTIONS
       -h     Output help information and exit.

       -x <MB>
              Set available memory.

       -c     Enable plugin compilation within imagej.

       -v     Be verbose (vv or vvv increases verbosity).
