NAME
       botch-graph-tred - find the transitive reduction of a graph in GraphML or dot format

SYNOPSIS
       botch-graph-tred [options] [ingraph] [outgraph]

DESCRIPTION
       Create a graph with as few edges as possible while maintaining the same reachability relationships.

       Calculating the transitive reduction particularly helps to facilitate rendering of dense graphs as it removes the clutter of extra edges.

       This tool is the does the same as tred(1) from the graphviz suite but for the GraphML and dot input instead of only for dot input. It is also orders of magnitude faster (for unknown reasons).

       If either (or both) of the positional arguments is/are omitted, then read GraphML or dot from standard input and/or write GraphML or dot to standard output, respectively.  Passing a '-' as either
       argument, explicitly specifies to read the input from standard input and write the output to standard output, respectively.

       The input graph type will be determined automatically. If the output graph is given as a filename, then the output type will be GraphML if the filename ends with .xml and dot if the filename ends with
       .dot. If the output is done on standard output then it will happen in the same format as the input graph.
