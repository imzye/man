SYNOPSIS
       sndfile-spectrogram [options] <sound file> <img width> <img height> <png name>

DESCRIPTION
       sndfile-spectrogram reads a single channel sound file and generates a spectrogram which is written to a PNG file with specified image height and width.

       The  optional parameters allow the user to specify the dynamic range of the spectrogram plot and/or to disable the drawing of borders, scales, heat map and title.  Run "sndfile-spectrogram --help"

       The input file is read using libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), the spectrogram is calculated with the help of libfftw and the spectrogram is rendered and  written  to  the  output
       file using libcairo.
