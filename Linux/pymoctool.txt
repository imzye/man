NAME
       pymoctool - manipulate Multi-Order Coverage maps

SYNOPSIS
       pymoctool [INPUT] [COMMAND [FILE]] [--output OUTPUT]

DESCRIPTION
       pymoctool  can  be used to manupulate Multi-Order Coverage (MOC) tools for the Virtual Observatory.  It is a command-line tool and can handle files encoded as FITS, JSON, or ASCII.  The tool main‐
       tains builds up a MOC stack using union, intersection and subtraction, with the pipeline processed in the order it is passed on the command-line.

       Internally pymoctool uses and exposes the the PyMOC library found in the python-pymoc Debian package.

COMMANDS
       --catalog coords.txt [order NN] [radius NN]
              Render a circles using the flood-fill method on top of the MOC stack.  The input text file should be whitespace records containing either RA+Dec pairs or Lat+Lon pairs.

       --help, -h
              Show top-level help

       --id   Set new identifier for MOC stack

       --info, -i
              Display information about the MOC stack

       --intersection
              Intersect another MOC with the existing MOC stack

       --name Set new name for the MOC stack

       --normalize 0-29
              Set the maximum depth order of a MOC in the range 0-29

       --output, -o
              Output filename MOC

       --plot Project and render the MOC as a flattened all-sky map

       --subtract
              Subtract the a MOC from the existing MOC stack

       --version
              Show the backend PyMOC library version number

       Detailed help for individuals commands can be found with pymoctool --help COMMAND

EXAMPLES
       pymoctool foo.fits --output foo.json bar.txt --output both.fits
              Load foo.fits then convert and the save a copy to foo.json perform a union merge with a text-format MOC called bar.txt and save the result both.fits
