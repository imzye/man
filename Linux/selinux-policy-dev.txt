NAME
       policygentool - Interactive SELinux policy generation tool

SYNOPSIS
       policygentool [options] <Module Name> <full path for application binary file>

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool  generate three files for policy development, A Type Enforcement (te) file, a File Context (fc), and a Interface File(if).  Most of the policy rules will be written in the te file.  Use
       the File Context file to associate file paths with security context.  Use the interface rules to allow other protected domains to interact with the newly defined domains.

       The tool prompts for locations of pidfiles, any logfiles, files in /var/lib, and any init scripts, and whether any network access is desirable for the application. The tool then generates the  ap‐
       propriate  policy rules for the module.  After these files have been generated, the make files for the appropriate SELinux policy, namely, /usr/share/selinux/refpolicy-targeted/include/Makefile or
       /usr/share/selinux/refpolicy-strict/include/Makefile can be used to compile the SELinux policy policy package.  The resulting policy package can be loaded using semodule.

         # /usr/bin/policygentool myapp /usr/bin/myapp
         # cat >Makefile
         > HEADERDIR:=/usr/share/selinux/refpolicy-targeted/include
         > include $(HEADERDIR)/Makefile
         > ^D
         # make
         # semodule -l myapp.pp
         # restorecon -R -v /usr/bin/myapp "all files defined in myapp.fc"
         # setenforce 0
         # /etc/init.d/myapp start
         # audit2allow -R -i /var/log/audit/audit.log
