NAME
       zip2st - convert directory or .zip archive to .st disk image

SYNOPSIS
       zip2st <directory|srcname.zip> [dstname.st]

DESCRIPTION
       zip2st can be used to generate Atari .st disk image from directory and .zip archive contents.

       If  the  destination filename is not given, it's based on the source name, with the .zip extension removed and .st prefix added. If basename tool is present, file is saved to current directory, other‐
       wise to the directory where the source directory/archive is.

       Any single directories (other than 'auto') within the source zip / directory hierarchy are traversed down, to avoid adding redundant intermediate directories to the generated disk image.

       The .st disk image is a raw disk image, and can be written to a floppy using dd(1), or converted to a .msa disk image with hmsa(1).

       The contents of the uncompressed zip file needs to be smaller than 2.88MB (the largest floppy image size supported by Hatari).

       If the source file names are longer than 8+3, use atari-convert-dir script to convert them into Atari compatible ones.  If the files are within a .zip archive, you need to extract them before  conver‐
       sion.
