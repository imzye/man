       quitcount

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the quitcount command.

       quitcount is a simple counter that shows what you spared since
        you quit smoking. Once you tell it the date you quit, how much
        you smoked, and how much it cost, it'll tell you how many
        cigarettes you didn't smoke since, and how much it makes in
        terms of money, tar, and life expectancy.

OPTIONS
