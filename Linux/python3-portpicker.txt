PORT SERVER
       A  port  server is intended to be run as a daemon, for use by all processes running on the host. It coordinates uses of network ports by anything using a portpicker library. If you are using hosts
       as part of a test automation cluster, each one should run a port server as a daemon. You should set the PORTSERVER_ADDRESS=@unittest-portserver environment variable on all of your test runners  so
       that portpicker makes use of it.

       A  port server listens on a unix socket, reads a pid from a new connection, tests the ports it is managing and replies with a port assignment port for that pid. A port is only reclaimed for poten‐
       tial reassignment to another process after the process it was originally assigned to has died. Processes that need multiple ports can simply issue multiple requests and are  guaranteed  they  will
       each be unique.

TYPICAL USAGE
        1) Run one instance of this process on each of your unittest farm hosts.
        2) Set the PORTSERVER_ADDRESS environment variable in your test runner
           environment to let the portpicker library know to use a port server
           rather than attempt to find ports on its own.

        $ /path/to/portserver.py &
        $ export PORTSERVER_ADDRESS=@unittest-portserver
        $ # ... launch a bunch of unittest runners using portpicker ...
