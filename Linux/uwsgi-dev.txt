DH_UWSGI(1)                                                                         User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                         DH_UWSGI(1)

NAME
       dh_uwsgi - Add dependency on the ABI version of uWSGI

       When writing a package that builds an uWSGI plugin and is not built with uWSGI itself (and hence depends on the exact binary version), add ${uwsgi:Depends} to the package's Depends: field in
       debian control and run dh_uwsgi.

       If you use dh, you can run dh_uwsgi using:

         dh --with uwsgi

       Otherwise run it in debian/rules after installing the plugins.

SYNOPSIS
       dh_uwsgi [debhelper options] [-V[version]] [-- file]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_uwsgi is a debhelper program that is responsible for correctly setting the dependency on uwsgi-abi-uwsgi-ABI-version for a package.

OPTIONS
       No special options of its own. Use standard debhelper options.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent.  dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command.  Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer
       scripts.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(1)

       This program is part of the Debian uWSGI package.
