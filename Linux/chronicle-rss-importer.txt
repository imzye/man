ABOUT
         Chronicle is a simple tool to convert a collection of text files,
        located within a single directory, into a blog consisting of static
        HTML files.

         This importer script will create a directory of input files from a
        given RSS feed, by downloading it and writing out each entry to a single
        text file.

         The output files will be named after the entries titles, or if
        B<--sequential> was used each entry will be numbered numerically.
