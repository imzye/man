NAME
       mgettydefs - speed and terminal settings used by mgetty

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/gettydefs file contains information used by mgetty(1) to set up the speed and terminal settings for a line.  It also supplies information on what the login prompt should look like.

       Many  versions  of  UNIX have a version of getty(1) that also reads /etc/gettydefs.  Both mgetty and getty expect similar formats in /etc/gettydefs except that, when used by mgetty, extended func‐
       tionality is available.  Even so, the additional functions are simply ignored by standard getty, so they can co-exist using the same file.  Note, however, that mgetty can be compiled to use a file
       different from /etc/gettydefs if your getty gets upset about the extensions.  This manual page documents /etc/gettydefs and describes the extended functionality available when used  by  mgetty(1).
       This document will refer to getty(1) except where mgetty's behaviour is different.

       Each entry in /etc/gettydefs has the following format:

              label# initial-flags # final-flags # login-prompt #next-label

       Each entry is followed by a blank line.  The login prompt field can contain quoted characters which will be converted to other values.  The sequences and their substitutions are:

       \n             newline

       \r             carriage return

       \g             beep

       \b             backspace

       \v             vertical tab (VT)

       \f             formfeed

       \t             tab

       \L             portname

       \C             time in ctime(3) format.

       \N             number of users currently logged in

       \U             number of users currently logged in

       \D             date in DD/MM format

       \T             time in hh:mm:ss format

       \I             modem CONNECT attributes

       \sequence      where "sequence" is a valid strtol format, such as: \0nnn (octal), \0xnnn (hex), or \nnn (decimal).

       Note that standard getty usually only supports \b, \r and \n.

       The various fields are:

       label          This  is  the  string against which getty tries to match its second argument.  It is often the speed, such as 1200, at which the terminal is supposed to run, but it need not be (see
                      below).

       initial-flags  These flags are the initial ioctl(2) settings to which the terminal is to be set if a terminal type is not specified to getty.  The flags that getty understands are the ones  listed
                      in termio(7)).  mgetty is usually compiled for termios(7) and often has a more complete set than getty.

       Normally only the speed flag is required in the
                      initial-flags.   getty  automatically sets the terminal to raw input mode and takes care of the other flags.  If the "-s" option is used with mgetty(1) the speed setting is ignored.
                      The initial-flag settings remain in effect until getty executes login(1).

       final-flags    These flags take the same values as the initial-flags and are set just before getty executes login.  The speed flag is again required, except with mgetty if the  -s  flag  was  sup‐
                      plied.  Two other commonly specified final-flags are TAB3, so that tabs are sent to the terminal as spaces, and HUPCL, so that the line is hung up on the final close.

       login-prompt   This  entire  field  is  printed  as the login-prompt.  Unlike the above fields where white space (a space, tab or new-line) is ignored, they are included in the login-prompt field.
                      This field is ignored if the "-p" option has been specified to mgetty(1).

       next-label     specifies the label to use if the user user types a <break> character, or getty detects a reception error.  Getty searches for the entry with next-label as its label field  and  set
                      up  the  terminal for those settings.  Usually, a series of speeds are linked together in this fashion, into a closed set; for instance, 2400 linked to 1200, which in turn is linked
                      to 300, which finally is linked to 2400.  next-label is ignored with mgetty(1).

       Several additional composite settings are available for initial-flags and final-flags.  The following composite flags are supported by mgetty and are usually supported by getty:

       SANE                equivalent to ``stty sane''.  (BRKINT, IGNPAR, ISTRIP, ICRNL, IXON, OPOST, CS8, CREAD, ISIG, ICANON, ECHO, ECHOK)

       ODDP                Odd parity (CS7, PARENB, PARODD)

       PARITY,EVENP        even parity (CS7, PARENB)

       -ODDP,-PARITY,-EVENP
                           no parity (resets PARENB, PARODD, and sets CS8)

       RAW                 raw I/O (no canonical processing) (turns off OPOST, ICANON)

       -RAW,COOKED         enable canonical processing (turns on OPOST, ICANON)

       NL                  Ignore newlines.  (ICRNL, ONLCR)

       -NL                 Respect newlines (turns INLCR, IGNCR, ICRNL, ONLCR, OCRNL, ONLRET off)

       LCASE               Ignore case - treat all as lowercase.  (IUCLC, OLCUC, XCASE) Is set if mgetty believes login is entirely uppercase.

       -LCASE              Repect case (turns off IUCLC, OLCUC and XCASE)

       TABS                output tabs as tabs

       -TABS,TAB3          output tabs as spaces

       EK                  Sets VERASE to "#" and VKILL to CKILL respectively.  (note that while many gettys default VERASE to "#".  mgetty defaults VERASE to backspace.)

       Additionally, mgetty (but not getty) can set any of the control characters listed in the c_cc termio(termios) structure by the use of two tokens:

       <character name> <value>

       Eg:

       VERASE ^h

       The value can be set as ``^<character>'', ``\nnn'' or ``\<character>'' (normal UNIX \ escapes).

       See the termio(7) or termios(7) manual pages to a list of which ``V'' variables can be changed.  Note that many of these can be changed in the c_cc array, but won't have any effect.

       If getty is called without a second argument, the first entry of /etc/gettydefs is used by getty, thus making the first entry of /etc/gettydefs the default entry.  It is also used if getty  cannot
       find  the specified label.  Mgetty use a default label of ``n'', but this can be changed in the configuration.  If /etc/gettydefs itself is missing, there is one entry built into the command which
       brings up a terminal at 300 (configuration parameter in mgetty) baud.

       It is strongly recommended that after making or modifying /etc/gettydefs, it be run through getty with the check option to be sure there are no errors.

EXAMPLES
       The following two lines show an example of 300/1200 baud toggle, which is useful for dial-up ports:

              1200# B1200 HUPCL # B1200 SANE IXANY TAB3 #login: #300
              300# B300 HUPCL # B300 SANE IXANY TAB3 #login: #1200

       The following line shows a typical 9600 baud entry for a hard-wired connection (not currently supported for mgetty):

              9600# B9600 # B9600 SANE IXANY IXANY ECHOE TAB3 #login: #9600

       The following line is a typical smart-modem setup, suitable for mgetty:

              19200mg#
                  B19200 #
                  B19200 SANE VERASE \b VINTR \003 HUPCL #
                  \n\D \T \N Users @!login: #19200mg
