NAME
       drat-trim - DRAT-trim Satisfiability Proof Checker

DESCRIPTION
       usage: drat-trim [INPUT] [<PROOF>] [<option> ...]

       where <option> is one of the following

       -h     print this command line option summary

       -c CORE
              prints the unsatisfiable core to the file CORE (DIMACS format)

       -a ACTIVE
              prints the active clauses to the file ACTIVE (DIMACS format)

       -l LEMMAS
              prints the core lemmas to the file LEMMAS (DRAT format)

       -L LEMMAS
              prints the core lemmas to the file LEMMAS (LRAT format)

       -r TRACE
              resolution graph in the TRACE file (TRACECHECK format)

       -t <lim>
              time limit in seconds (default 40000)

       -u     default unit propatation (i.e., no core-first)

       -f     forward mode for UNSAT

       -v     more verbose output

       -b     show progress bar

       -O     optimize proof till fixpoint by repeating verification

       -C     compress core lemmas (emit binary proof)

       -D     delete proof file after parsing

       -I     force ASCII proof parse mode

       -i     force binary proof parse mode

       -w     suppress warning messages

       -W     exit after first warning

       -p     run in plain mode (i.e., ignore deletion information)

       -R     turn off reduce mode

       -S     run in SAT check mode (forward checking)

       -U     only allow RUP additions

       and input and proof are specified as follows

       INPUT  input file in DIMACS format

       PROOF  proof file in DRAT format (stdin if no argument)
