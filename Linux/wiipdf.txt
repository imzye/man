NAME
       wiipdf - present using xpdf and your wiimote

SYNOPSIS
       wiipdf bluetooth-id pdf-file

DESCRIPTION
       wiipdf  is  a tiny tool to present a PDF using xpdf and your wiimote. You start it by providing it the bluetooth ID of your wiimote (use hcitool scan to get it) and the path to the PDF you want to
       present.

       wiipdf then tries to connect to your wiimote (press buttons 1 and 2 at the sime time on your wiimote to enter discoverable mode). As soon as the connection is established (takes 3-4  seconds  usu‐
       ally), wiipdf launches xpdf with the given filename.

       You  can  now  press  A or B on your wiimote to go forward one slide or go backward one slide. Pressing the home button on your wiimote ends the presentation. Each keypress is confirmed by a short
       rumble of your wiimote.

BUGS
       wiipdf does not know how many slides your PDF consists of. Therefore, you can press A as many times as you want, even if you are at the end of the PDF. The internal slide counter will just be  in‐
       creased.
