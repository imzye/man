NAME
       ifmetric - An IPv4 route metrics manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       ifmetric INTERFACE [METRIC]

DESCRIPTION
       ifmetric  is  a Linux tool for setting the metrics of all IPv4 routes attached to a given network interface at once. This may be used to change the priority of routing IPv4 traffic over the inter‐
       face. Lower metrics correlate with higher priorities.

       ifmetric uses the Linux NETLINK interface to manipulate the routes. Because of that it is compatible with routes created with the new iproute2 utility.

OPTIONS
       You should specify the interface name as first parameter. The second parameter should be the new metric. If omitted the metric 0 (highest) is used.

RETURN VALUES
       0 Success

       1 Failure
