NAME
       Welcome2L - Linux ANSI boot logo

SYNOPSIS
       Welcome2L [ -scr xx ] [ -getty ] [ -gettps ] [ -msg message ] [ -cpu name ] [ -scrrand ] [ -xmas ] [ -xmasauto ] [ -lcol xx ] [ -nolf ] [ -private ] [-notime ]

DESCRIPTION
       Welcome2L  is  a little program that may run at login time to produce a BBS like ANSI login logo. It's very similar to Linux_Logo. But where Linux_Logo intends to be portable, Welcome2L intends to
       produce the best looking ANSI screens by making full usage of PC graphic characters. Therefore an architecture able to display those characters (i386, Alpha with TGA adapter, ... ) is required  to
       use it.  And, even if it will work on larger screens, it will only produce 80 column ANSI screens.

OPTIONS
       -getty will display more accurate information when launched at boot time.

       -gettps
              Like -getty but works with gettyps(8) program.

       -nolf  will not add an empty line to the ansi screen produced.

       -msg message
              will show the message given as the distribution info.

       -cpu name
              will show the name given as the CPU name.

       -scr xx
              will display screen number xx.

       -scrrand
              will display a random screen.

       -xmas  will display an Xmas screen.

       -xmasauto
              will automatically display an Xmas screen in December and January.

       -lcol xx
              will change the prompt color to the color number xx. Use the help command to see what number is attributed to a color.

       -private
              Display an "Unauthorized access is prohibited" line at the bottom of the ANSI screen.

       -notime
              When displaying date information, do not display time.

       -noblink
              Turn blinking off. Useful with -xmas or -xmasauto on framebuffer devices, which do not support blinking.

       -help  will display usage information.

EXAMPLE
       /usr/bin/Welcome2L -getty -msg "Gentoo Linux" -lcol 14 -scr 02

RESTRICTIONS
       Welcome2L is not intended to run in a xterm.

CAVEAT
       Because  "A  'welcome'  page has been proven to be an invitation to come your system, thus making it legal to hack into your box.", you may want to use the "-private" arg when running Welcome2L to
       display an "Unauthorized access is prohibited" line at the bottom of the ANSI screen.

       Welcome2L is released under the terms of the GNU GPL.
