       dh_phppear(1) is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the ${phppear:*} substitutions and adding them to substvars files. See the corresponding manpage.

       dh_phpcomposer(1) is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the ${phpcomposer:*} substitutions and adding them to substvars files. See the corresponding manpage.
