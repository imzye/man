NAME
       precious tidy - Tidy/fix path(s) using tidiers

SYNOPSIS
       precious tidy [OPTIONS] <--all|--git|--staged|--git-diff-from <REF>|--staged-with-stash|PATHS>

DESCRIPTION
       Tidy/fix path(s) using tidiers

   Arguments:
       [PATHS]...
              A list of paths on which to operate

OPTIONS
       --command <COMMAND>
              The command to run. If specified, only this command will be run. This should match the command name in your config file

       -a, --all
              Run against all files in the current directory and below

       -g, --git
              Run against files that have been modified according to git

       -s, --staged
              Run against files that are staged for a git commit

       -d, --git-diff-from <REF>
              Run  against  files  that  are  different  as compared with the given `<REF>`. This can be a branch name, like `master`, or an ref name like `HEAD~6` or `master@{2.days.ago}`. See `git help
              rev-parse` for more options. Note that this will _not_ see files with uncommitted changes in the local working directory

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output

       --debug
              Enable debugging output

       --staged-with-stash
              Run against file content that is staged for a git commit, stashing all unstaged content first. The stash push/pop tends to do weird things to the working directory, and is  not  recommended
              for scripting

       --label <LABEL>
              If this is set, then only commands matching this label will be run. If this isn't set then commands without a label or with the label "default" will be run

       --trace
              Enable tracing output (maximum logging)

       -h, --help
              Print help

       -V, --version
              Print version
