NOTICE
       MMB units are nm, kJ/mol, ps, and daltons (g/mol). In MMB 2.10 and earlier, we took some lengths and ground locations in Å (atomSpring, springToGround, atomTether, applyContactsWithin,
       applyMobilizersWithin, etc.). As of MMB 2.11 all such lengths and locations are in nm. Please update your older scripts if you plan to reuse them in MMB 2.11 and later.
