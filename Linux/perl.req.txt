NAME
       perl.req - list requirements for Perl scripts and libraries

SYNOPSIS
       perl.req [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-m|--method=strict|normal|relaxed] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       perl.req calculates prerequisites for each Perl source file specified on a command line; alternatively, a list of files is obtained from standard input, one file per line.  "use", "require" and "do"
       statements are processed.  The output of perl.req is suitable for automatic dependency tracking (e.g. for RPM packaging).

       For example, /usr/lib/perl5/File/Temp.pm requires, in particular, "perl(Fcntl.pm) >= 1.030" (as of perl-5.8.6).

       perl.req is basically a wrapper for B::PerlReq Perl compiler backend.

OPTIONS
       -m, --method=method
           Use particular method for dependency tracking.  Alternatively, RPM_PERL_REQ_METHOD environement variable can be used to set the method.

           The following methods are available:

           strict
               Search thoroughly and list all requirements.  In particular, list platform-specific (non-UNIX) requirements and requirements found inside "eval" blocks.

           normal (default)
               Enable moderate search most acceptable for RPM packaging.  That is, skip files known to be platform-specific; skip platform-specific requirements and those found inside "eval" blocks; skip
               most common requirements (e.g. "strict.pm").

           relaxed
               Enable relaxed mode.  That is, tolerate B::PerlReq failures; in addition to normal method, skip conditional requirements (e.g. "require" statements inside subroutines); skip "do FILE"
               statements; list only essential dependencies.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity.

HISTORY
       Initial version of perl.req (part of RPM 3.0) done by Ken Estes in 1999.  Regular expressions were used to extract dependencies.  (Later a part of ALT Linux Master 2.0, with modifications from Mikhail
       Zabaluev.)

       Reworked in November 2002: complicated regular expressions were added to enhance search; methods added.  (Later a part of ALT Linux Master 2.2.)

       Reworked in September 2003: B::Deparse was utilized to re-format Perl code before dependency extraction; hence more simple and accurate.  Decoupled from rpm-build package into rpm-build-perl.  (Later
       a part of ALT Linux Master 2.4.)

       Reworked in December 2004: B::PerlReq was developed.  Released on CPAN, see <http://search.cpan.org/dist/rpm-build-perl/>.
