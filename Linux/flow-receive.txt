NAME
       flow-receive - Receive flow data with the NetFlow protocol.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-receive [ -h ]  [ -b big|little ]  [ -C comment ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -o output_file ]  [ -S stat_interval ]  [ -V pdu_version ]  [ -z z_level ]  localip/remoteip/port

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-receive utility is used to receive flows in NetFlow format. When the remoteip is configured only flows from that exporter will be processed, this is the most secure and recommended configura‐
       tion. When the localip is configured flow-receive will only process flows sent to the  localip IP address. If remoteip is 0 (not configured) flows from any source IP address are accepted. Multiple non
       aggregated  PDU versions may be accepted at once to support Cisco's Catalyst 6500 NetFlow implementation which exports from both the supervisor and MSFC with the same IP address and same port but dif‐
       ferent export versions. In this case the exports will be stored in the format specified by the -V flag or whichever export type is received first.

OPTIONS
       -b big|little
              Byte order of output.

       -C Comment
              Add a comment.

       -d debug_level
              Enable debugging.

       -h     Display help.

       -o file
              Write to file instead of the standard out.

       -S stat_interval
              When configured flow-receive will emit a timestamped message on stderr every stat_interval minutes indicating counters such as the number of flows received, packets processed, and lost flows.

       -V pdu_version
              Use pdu_version format output.

       -z z_level
              Configure compression level to  z_level. 0 is disabled (no compression), 9 is highest compression.

EXAMPLES
       Listen on port 9800 on any local interface for exports from IP address 10.0.0.1, store the exports in flows

       flow-receive 0/10.0.0.1/9800 > flows

       Listen on port 9800 on any local interface from any IP address, display the received flows with flow-print.

       flow-receive 0/0/9800 | flow-print

BUGS
       It is not currently possible to convert between the aggregated formats (8.x) and the non aggregated formats (1,5,6,7).
