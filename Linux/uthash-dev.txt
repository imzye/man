NAME
       uthash-dev - Hash map and linked list implementation

SYNOPSIS

       #include <uthash.h>

       #include <utlist.h>

       #include <utarray.h>

       #include <utstring.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The uthash-dev Debian package build from the uthash source package contains the uthash, utlist, utarray, utstring and utvector headers. They can be included in any C source code and provide hash
       map, linked list, etc implementations as C preprocessor macros.

       The documentation is available in the documentation directory of the package (/usr/share/doc/uthash-dev/) in HTML format. Additionally, some examples are also included that have been provided as
       test cases in the upstream release.
