NDPPD.CONF(5)                                                                             NDP Proxy Daemon Manual                                                                             NDPPD.CONF(5)

NAME
       ndppd.conf - configuration file for ndppd

DESCRIPTION
       The syntax is as follows:

       proxy eth0 {
          rule 1234:5678::/96 {
          }
       }

       The configuration file must contain one or more proxy sections, and each of these section must contain one or more rule sections.

       The  ndppd  daemon listens on the interface specified as an argument to the proxy section. Once a Neighbor Solicitation message arrives, it will try to match the target address against the address
       specified as the argument of the rule section.

OPTIONS
       proxy <interface>
              Adds a proxy and binds it to the specified interface.  See below for information about proxy options.

PROXY OPTIONS
       rule <address>
              Adds a rule with the specified address to the proxy. It may be a an IP such as 1234::1 or a subnet such as 1111::/96. See below for information about rule options.

       ttl <value>
              Controls how long ndppd will cache an entry. This is in milliseconds, and the default value is 30000 (30 seconds).

       timeout <value>
              Controls how long ndppd will wait for a Neighbor Advertisement message after forwarding a Neighbor Solicitation message according to the rule. This is in milliseconds, and the default value
              is 500 (.5 second).

       router <yes|no>
              Controls if ndppd should send the router bit when sending Neighbor Advertisement messages. The default value here is yes.

RULE OPTIONS
       Specify a method here. See below.

METHOD
       One of the following options must be specified in the rule section. All of these are mutually exclusive options, and cannot be combined.

       iface <interface>
              Specify which interface the Neighbor Solicitation message will be sent out through.

       auto   (NEW) If this option is specified ndppd will attempt to detect which interface to use in order to forward Neighbor Solicitation Messages, by reading the routing table /proc/net/ipv6_route.

       static (NEW) This option tells ndppd that it should immediately respond to a Neighbor Solicitation Message without querying an internal interface.  Note that it's recommended that you use this op‐
              tion sparingly, and with as high prefix length as possible. This is to make sure upstream routers are not polluted with spurious neighbor entries.

              If no rule option has been specified, it will default to static in order to be compatible with 0.2.1.  This will, however, produce a warning, and most likely not work in future versions  of
              ndppd.
