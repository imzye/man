NAME
       rpmelfsym - list symbols from object files in RPM packages

SYNOPSIS
       rpmelfsym [-h] [-a] [-p] [FILE...] [DIR...]

DESCRIPTION
       rpmelfsym produces three-column output: file name, symbol type, and symbol name, as determined by nm(1).  Only dynamically linked executable files and shared libraries are processed, and only dynamic
       symbols are listed.  When processing a directory, an additional column is prepended to the output, which is typically RPM file basename.

OPTIONS
       -a  Process all Sisyphus packages.

       -p  When processing a directory, list package names, not file names; furthermore, enable special treatment of packages with the same name; that is, process only the one with the latest version.

       -h  Display this help and exit.
