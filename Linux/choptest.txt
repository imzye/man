NAME
       choptest - HylaFAX page chopping test program

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/choptest [ options ] input.tif

DESCRIPTION
       choptest  is  a program for testing the page chopping support in the HylaFAX software (specifically, in the faxq(8) program).  choptest analyzes a TIFF/F (TIFF Class F) file with 1-D MH- or 2-D MR-en‐
       coded data and reports what the automatic page chopping logic would do if the file were submitted for transmission.  Options are provided for controlling whether choptest checks the last page  or  all
       pages of the document, and what whitespace threshold to use in deciding if a page should be chopped.

OPTIONS
       -a        Chop  all  pages  in  the document.  This is equivalent to setting the PageChop configuration parameter to ``all''; c.f.  hylafax-config(5).  By default only the last page of the document is
                 considered.

       -t inches Set the minimum whitespace threshold that must be present on a page for it to be chopped.  This is equivalent to the PageChopThreshold configuration parameter; c.f.   hylafax-config(5).   By
                 default choptest requires that at least 3 inches of trailing whitespace be present.

EXAMPLES
       The following shows a multi-page, high-resolution document.  Each page has insufficient whitespace for it to be chopped.

       hyla% ./choptest -a ~/tiff/pics/faxix.tif
       Chop pages with >=3" of white space at the bottom.
       Don't chop, found 67 rows, need 588 rows
       Don't chop, found 67 rows, need 588 rows
       Don't chop, found 67 rows, need 588 rows
       Don't chop, found 53 rows, need 588 rows
       Don't chop, found 91 rows, need 588 rows
