NAME
       scala - Run code in the Scala 2 language

SYNOPSIS
       scala  [ <option> ]... [ <torun> <argument>... ]

PARAMETERS
       <compiler-option>
              Any scalac option.  See scalac(1).

       -howtorun:<how>
              How to execute <torun>, if it is present. Options for <how> are guess (the default), script, jar, and object.

       -i <file>
              Requests that a file be pre-loaded.  It is only meaningful for interactive shells.

       -e <string>
              Requests that its argument be executed as Scala code.

       -savecompiled
              Save  this compiled version of scripts in order to speed up later executions of the same script.  When running a script, save the compiled version in a file with the same name as the script but
              with an extension of .jar.  On subsequent runs of the same script, the pre-compiled .jar file will be used if it is newer than the script file.

       -nocompdaemon
              Do not use the fsc offline compiler.

       -nc    Same as -nocompdaemon.

       -Dproperty=value
              Set a Java system property.  If no value is specified, then the property is set to the empty string.

       <torun>
              A top-level object or a script file to run.

       <argument>
              An arguments to pass to <torun>.

DESCRIPTION
       The scala utility runs Scala code using a Java runtime environment.  The Scala code to run is specified in one of three ways:

          1.  With no arguments specified, a Scala shell starts and reads commands interactively.

          2.  With -howtorun:object specified, the fully qualified name of a top-level Scala object may be specified.  The object should previously have been compiled using scalac(1).

          3.  With -howtorun:script specified, a file containing Scala code may be specified.

       If -howtorun: is left as the default (guess), then the scala command will check whether a file of the specified name exists.  If it does, then it will treat it as a script file; if it does  not,  then
       it will treat it as the name of an object.

       In all three cases, arbitrary scalac options may be specified. The most common option is to specify a classpath with -classpath, but see the scalac(1) page for full details.

       If an object is specified to run, then that object must be a top-level Scala object with the specified name.  The object must define a method main with the following signature:

       def main(args: Array[String]): Unit

       The method must return a Unit value, and it must accept a String array as a parameter.  All arguments specified on the command line will be passed as arguments to the main method.

       If  a  script  file is specified to run, then the file is read and all Scala statements and declarations in the file are processed in order. Any arguments specified will be available via the argsvari‐
       able.

       Script files may have an optional header that is ignored if present.  There are two ways to format the header: either beginning with #! and ending with !#, or beginning with ::#! and ending with ::!#.

       Such a header must have each header boundary start at the beginning of a line.  Headers can be used to make stand-alone script files, as shown in the examples below.

       When running a script or using -e, an already running compilation daemon (fsc) is used, or a new one started on demand.  The -nocompdaemon or -nc option can be used to prevent this.

       If scala is run from an sbaz(1) directory, then it will add to its classpath any jars installed in the lib directory of the sbaz directory.  Additionally, if no -classpath option  is  specified,  then
       scala will add ".", the current directory, to the end of the classpath.

OPTIONS
       If any compiler options are specified, they must be first in the command line and must be followed by a bare hypen ("-") character. If no arguments are specified after the optional compiler arguments,
       then an interactive Scala shell is started.  Otherwise, either a script file is run, or a pre-compiled Scala object is run.  It is possible to distinguish the last two cases by using an explicit  -ob‐
       ject or -script flag, but usually the program can guess correctly.

ENVIRONMENT
       JAVACMD
              Specify  the  java  command to be used for running the Scala code.  Arguments may be specified as part of the environment variable; spaces, quotation marks, etc., will be passed directly to the
              shell for expansion.

       JAVA_HOME
              Specify JDK/JRE home directory. This directory is used to locate the java command unless JAVACMD variable set.

       JAVA_OPTS
              Specify the options to be passed to the java command defined by JAVACMD.

              With Java 1.5 (or newer) one may for example configure the memory usage of the JVM as follows: JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx512M -Xms16M -Xss16M"

EXAMPLES
       Here are some examples of running Scala code:

       Execute a Scala program generated in the current directory
              scala hello.HelloWorld

       Execute a Scala program generated in a user-defined directory classes
              scala -classpath classes hello.HelloWorld

       Execute a Scala program using a user-defined java command
              env JAVACMD=/usr/local/bin/cacao scala -classpath classes hello.HelloWorld

       Execute a Scala program using JVM options
              env JAVACMD=java JAVA_OPTS="-Dmsg=hello -enableassertions" scala -classpath classes hello.HelloWorld

       Here is a complete Scala script for Unix:

       #!/bin/sh
       exec scala "$0" "$@"
       !#
       Console.println("Hello, world!")
       args.toList foreach Console.println

       Here is a complete Scala script for MS Windows:

       ::#!
       @echo off
       call scala %0 %*
       goto :eof
       ::!#
       Console.println("Hello, world!")
       args.toList foreach Console.println

       If you want to use the compilation cache to speed up multiple executions of the script, then add -savecompiled to the scala command:

       #!/bin/sh
       exec scala -savecompiled "$0" "$@"
       !#
       Console.println("Hello, world!")
       args.toList foreach Console.println

EXIT STATUS
       The scala command returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is returned in case of any error.  If a script or top-level object is executed and returns a value,  then  that  return  value  is
       passed on to scala.
