NAME
       nycheck - tool to check syntax of specialized-format patches

SYNOPSIS
       nycheck pam options [ print ] [ .go ]

DESCRIPTION
       nycheck  is  a tool in the Nypatchy suite of programs for working with Patchy Master Files (PAM files); see nypatchy(1).  Specifically, it is a syntax checker for these files which is more strict than
       nypatchy itself.

USAGE
       The parameter pam is the name of the PAM file (a default extension of ".car" is assumed), print is the output file to write to (the default is standard output if omitted), and options is a sequence of
       single-character flags.

       The command should be ended with ".go" unless one wants to enter the Nypatchy interactive shell.

OPTIONS
       Note  that  options  should be given as a single string of characters with no space separation and no use of the - character (except that it can be used in place of the options field if no options are
       desired).  Alphabetic options are not case-sensitive.

       H      Print help information only.

       U      Print a warning if user-defined types occur.

       n      For n a number from 0 to 4 inclusive, assume 58, 62, 74, 84, or 98 lines per page in the output.  (The default is 110 lines per page.)  For n a number greater than or equal to 20, use that spe‐
              cific number of lines per page.

       +      Inhibit the initial page-eject.

       Running the command "nycheck help .no" also gives some brief help on usage.
