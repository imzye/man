NAME
       gpxlogger - Tool to connect to gpsd and generate a GPX file

SYNOPSIS
       gpxlogger [-D debug-level] [-d] [-e export-method] [-f filename] [-l]
                 [-m minmove] [-h] [-V] [-i track timeout] [server [:port
                 [:device]]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program collects fixes from gpsd and logs them to standard output
       in GPX, an XML profile for track logging.

       The output may be composed of multiple tracks. A new track is created
       if there's no fix written for an interval specified by the -i and
       defaulting to 5 seconds.

       gpxlogger can use any of the export methods that gpsd supports. For a
       list of these methods, use the -l. To force the method, give the -e one
       of the colon-terminated method names from the -l table.

OPTIONS
       The -h option causes gpxlogger to emit a summary of its options and
       then exit.

       The -V option causes gpxlogger to dump the package version and exit.

       The -D option sets a debug level; it is primarily for use by GPSD
       developers. It enables various progress messages to standard error.

       The -d option tells gpxlogger to run as a daemon in background. It
       requires the -f option, which directs output to a specified logfile.

       The -m option sets a minimum move distance in meters (it may include a
       fractional decimal part). Motions shorter than this will not be logged.

       The -r option tells gpxlogger to retry when GPSd loses the fix. Without
       -r, gpxlogger would quit in this case.

       If D-Bus support is available on the host, GPSD is configured to use
       it, and -e dbus is specified, this program listens to DBUS broadcasts
       from gpsd via org.gpsd.fix.

       With -e sockets, or if sockets is the method defaulted to, you may give
       a server-port-device specification as arguments.

       The sockets default is to all devices on the localhost, using the
       default GPSD port 2947. An optional argument to any client may specify
       a server to get data from. A colon-separated suffix is taken as a port
       number. If there is a second colon-separated suffix, that is taken as a
       specific device name to be watched. However, if the server
       specification contains square brackets, the part inside them is taken
       as an IPv6 address and port/device suffixes are only parsed after the
       trailing bracket. Possible cases look like this:

       localhost:/dev/ttyS1
           Look at the default port of localhost, trying both IPv4 and IPv6
           and watching output from serial device 1.

       example.com:2317
           Look at port 2317 on example.com, trying both IPv4 and IPv6.

       71.162.241.5:2317:/dev/ttyS3
           Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv4 address, collecting data
           from attached serial device 3.

       [FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:2317:/dev/ttyS5
           Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv6 address, collecting data
           from attached serial device 5.
