NAME
       pgxwin_server - X-window sever for pgplot plotting subroutine library

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pgxwin_server command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       pgplot  is  a  large collection of plotting routines callable from C, as well as FORTRAN (also perl, see below).  Many drivers are included to render the plots on devices.  To use PGPLOT, you must
       set the environment variable, PGPLOT_DIR to "/usr/lib/pgplot".   That is , under csh, type setenv PGPLOT_DIR /usr/lib/pgplot .  Under bash, type PGPLOT_DIR="/usr/lib/pgplot";export PGPLOT_DIR;

       The default device to be used for the plots can be specified by the PGPLOT_DEV environment variable.

       pgxwin_server is the server program for the /xwindow and /xserve devices for pgplot.  pgxwin_server is automatically started by the /xw and /xs driver when first called  upon.  pgxwin_server  then
       continues  to  serve  windows  to subsequent PGPLOT programs and remains running indefinitely. In order that it be possible to kill the server, an icon window for it is displayed. Window  managers
       generally provide a way to interactively kill windows, and if this is applied to the server window, then the server will close any inactive /xserve windows, and if no active /xw or /xs windows re‐
       main, then the server will shut itself down cleanly. Note that inactive windows are distinguishable from active windows by the appearance of a  skull-and-crossbones cursor.

       If your default display is correctly set then simply typing:

       pgxwin_server

       with no arguments should start the server, and the server icon should appear on the display. If an alternate display is desired then the default display can be overridden with the  -display  argu‐
       ment. Other options to override selected X resources from the command-line are also available. To see them type:

       pgxwin_server -help

       Documentation  on  the  library  can be found in the directory, /usr/share/doc/pgplot .  There exists a perl interface to pgplot, pgperl, also available for Debian.  Extensive documentation can be
