MUTTPROFILE(1)                                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                      MUTTPROFILE(1)

NAME
       muttprofile - Choose a Mutt Profile

SYNOPSIS
       muttprofile [-a⎪--active string] [-d⎪--dir directory] [-h⎪--help] [-p⎪--profile regexp] [-v⎪--view] [-V⎪--Version] [profile]

DESCRIPTION
       muttprofile  is  a  simple utility to choose a profile to be used with Mutt email-client.  It has two operating modes: command-line and interactive. Muttprofile goes to interactive mode if no com‐
       mand-line arguments are present or option -v⎪--view is present without profile name.

       Muttprofile looks for profile files in the Mutt directory, opens them and looks for NAME and DESC definitions. It then creates a symbolic link to the profile chosen by the user.  The rest  of  the
       work is done with a Mutt macro.

USAGE
       Interactive mode:

       Type the name of the profile and the program creates a symlink to load the profile.  Press <tab> to complete, <ctrl-d> to see list of choices.

       Command-line options:

       -a ⎪ --active Set the name for active profile symlink, default is profile.active

       -d ⎪ --dir Set the Mutt directory, default is ~/.mutt

       -h ⎪ --help prints a short help and exits

       -p ⎪ --profile (Perl) Regexp to match profile files in Mutt directory

       -v ⎪ --view Instead of creating a symlink, view profile contents

       -V ⎪ --version prints the version information and exits (use --version for long and -V for short version)

       profile if profile exits, create the symlink to load it from Mutt, otherwise exit with error

INSTALL
       Muttprofile requires no installation, but you might have to check the first line of the file ("#!/usr/bin/perl -w") and change the path to perl if needed ('which perl' might be useful here :-)

SETTING UP PROFILES
       Muttprofile checks the profile files for the following information:

       # NAME: name for your profile

       # DESC: description of your profile

       This information is used for choosing and displaying available profiles.  DESC is optional, but if NAME is missing, filename is used instead.

USING MUTTPROFILE FROM MUTT
       Perhaps the easiest way to invoke muttprofile from mutt is to bind a key with mutt macro command. For example, adding this to your muttrc-file

       macro     index     <F10>     "!muttprofile\n:source ~/.mutt/profile.active\nm" "New message with profile"

       binds the function key <F10> to start muttprofile, load the profile and start a new message

EXIT CODES
       The default exit codes for muttprofile are:

           0 OK
           1 PROFILE ALREADY ACTIVE
           2 ERROR

       These codes can be used in shell scripts etc.
