NAME
       IO::LCDproc - Perl extension to connect to an LCDproc ready display.

SYNOPSIS
               use IO::LCDproc;

               my $client      = IO::LCDproc::Client->new(name => "MYNAME");
               my $screen      = IO::LCDproc::Screen->new(name => "screen");
               my $title       = IO::LCDproc::Widget->new(
                               name => "date", type => "title"
                               );
               my $first       = IO::LCDproc::Widget->new(
                               name => "first", align => "center", xPos => 1, yPos => 2
                               );
               my $second      = IO::LCDproc::Widget->new(
                               name => "second", align => "center", xPos => 1, yPos => 3
                               );
               my $third       = IO::LCDproc::Widget->new(
                               name => "third", xPos => 1, yPos => 4
                               );
               $client->add( $screen );
               $screen->add( $title, $first, $second, $third );
               $client->connect() or die "cannot connect: $!";
               $client->initialize();

               $title->set( data => "This is the title" );
               $first->set( data => "First Line" );
               $second->set( data => "Second line" );

               $client->flushAnswers();

DESCRIPTION
       Follow the example above. Pretty straight forward. You create a client, assign a screen, add widgets, and then set the widgets.

   IO::LCDproc::Client
       It is the back engine of the module. It generates the connection to a ready listening server.

       METHODS

       new( name => 'Client_Name' [, host => $MYHOSTNAME] [, port => $MYPORTNUMBER] )
                   Constructor. Takes the following possible arguments (arguments must be given in key => value form):
                   host, port, and name. name is required.

       add( SCREENREF )
                   Adds the screens that will be attached to this client.

       connect()
                   Establishes connection to LCDproc server (LCDd).

       initialize()
                   Initializes client, screen and all the widgets  with the server.

       answer()
                   Reads an answer from the server

       flushAnswers()
                   Flushes all answers from the server (should be called regulary if you don't need the answers)

   IO::LCDproc::Screen
       METHODS

       new( name => 'MYNAME')
                   Constructor. Allowed options:
                   heartbeat => 1 or 0.

       add( @WIDGETS )
                   Adds the given widgets to this screen.

       set_prio( $prio )
                   Sets the screen priority with $prio one of

                   hidden          The screen will never be visible
                   background      The screen is only visible when no normal info screens exists
                   info            normal info screen, default priority
                   foreground      an active client
                   alert           The screen has an important message for the user.
                   input           The client is doing interactive input.

   IO::LCDproc::Widget
       METHODS

       new( name => 'MYNAME' )
                   Constructor. Allowed arguments:
                   align (left, center, rigth), type (string, title, vbar, hbar, ...), xPos, yPos, data

       set()
