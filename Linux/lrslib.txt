   Name
       redund|minrep  -   Remove redundant inequalities from an H-representation or redundant vertices (non-extreme points) from a V-representation. minrep also identifies hidden linearities.

   Synopsis

       redund [input-file] [output-file]

       minrep [input-file] [output-file]

       mpirun -np [procs] mplrs -minrep [input-file] [output-file] [option...]

   Description
       redund and minrep are aliases to lrs which is part of the C library lrslib(5).  This functionality can also be performed by lrs directly by using the options described below.  All computations are
       done in exact arithmetic. For input file descriptions see lrs(1).  A parallel version of minrep is given by mplrs -minrep.  The -redund option performs the same function and is retained for
       legacy.  (see mplrs(1))

       redund
       H-representation: redundant inequalities in an input H-representation are removed and the remaining inequalities output.  Hidden linearities are not detected unless the testlin option is included,
       in which case the output is a minimum representation and the dimension is reported.
       V-representation: outputs all extreme points and extreme rays, often called the convex hull problem.  The testlin option cause linearities to be detected and explicitly output.
       Outputs can be piped directly into lrs.  redund is a link to lrs which can also perform these functions via the testlin, redund and redund_list options.  mplrs -redund always sets the testlin
       option, so always produces minimum representations.

       minrep
       Equivalent to redund with the testlin option.

       With no options minrep|redund will process the entire input file.

       redund start end
       Check input lines with line numbers from start to end and remove any redundant lines.
       redund 0 0  will check all input lines.

       redund_list k   i_1 i_2 ... i_k
       Check the k input line numbers with indices i_1 i_2 ... i_k and remove any redundant lines.

       testlin      (before the begin line only)   (new 7.3)
       redund An LP test will be made for hidden linearities at the beginning of the run and is reported.  If there are no hidden linearities one LP per constraint tests for redundancy.  If hidden
       linearities exist two LPs per constraint search for hidden linearities and remove redundancies.  In both cases the run ends with a minimum set of linearities and inequalities (ie. no hidden
       inequalities or duplicates) and the dimension is reported.
       lrs If neither redund or redund_list options are present the initial LP test is made, reported and the run halted.  Otherwise as above for redund.
       mplrs This option is ignored. In redund/minrep mode a minimum representation is always found.

       verbose
       As each input line is checked a message is printed telling its status
        *nr :non-redundant
        *re :redundant
        *sr :strongly redundant
       For an H-representation strongly redundant means the feasible region lies in its open half-space. For a V-representation it means that the point lies in the (relative) interior of the convex hull.
       In addition minrep may report
        *li :linearity
