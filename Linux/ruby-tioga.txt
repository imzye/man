NAME
       tioga - toolbox for irb-like tioga scripts

SYNOPSIS
       tioga file.rb [actions]

DESCRIPTION
       tioga is a toolbox to work with 'irb-like' Tioga graphics, such as the ones provided in the libtioga-ruby-examples package. Here are typical uses:

       tioga plots.rb -l
              gives a list of plots available in the file plots.rb.

       tioga plots.rb -0
              runs the first plot of the plots.rb file and displays it using xpdf as a viewer.

       You really should consider giving a look at the /usr/share/doc/libtioga-ruby/html/classes/Tioga/Tutorial/CommandLine.html page found in the libtioga-ruby-doc package.
