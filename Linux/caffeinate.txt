NAME
       caffeinate - inhibit desktop idleness while a command runs

SYNOPSIS
       caffeinate COMMAND [ARGUMENT...]

DESCRIPTION
       Caffeinate runs the given command and prevents the desktop becoming idle while it is run, hence stops screen savers or power-saving activating even if the machine is not being used.

       It  is  usually more convenient to use the fully-automatic caffeine(1); caffeinate may be useful when it is impractical or impossible to run a program in full-screen mode, or to prevent automatic sus‐
       pend kicking in during a long-running unattended command, such as a system update.
