Devel::ArgNames(3pm)                                                                User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                Devel::ArgNames(3pm)

NAME
       Devel::ArgNames - Figure out the names of variables passed into subroutines.

SYNOPSIS
               use Devel::ArgNames;

               sub foo {
                       warn "foo() called with arguments: "
                               . join(", ", map { defined() ? $_ : "<unknown>" } arg_names(@_) );
               }

               foo($bar, $gorch, $blah[4]);

DESCRIPTION
       When print-debugging code, you will often ind yourself going:

               print "\$foo is $foo, \$bar is $bar"

       With this module, you can write a reusable subroutine easily:

               sub my_print_vars {
                       my %vars;

                       @vars{arg_names()} = @_;

                       foreach my $var ( keys %vars ) {
                               warn "$var is $vars{$var}\n";
                       }
               }

               my_print_vars($foo, $bar);

       This module doesn't provide dumping facilities because there are too many to choose from. This is a DIY kit ;-)

EXPORTS
       arg_names [ $level ]
           This  function will return the names associated with the variables found on @_, at the level $level. If $level is not provided "arg_names"'s caller's caller will be used ("$level == 2" in that
           case).
