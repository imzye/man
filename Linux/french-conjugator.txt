NAME
       french-conjugator - conjugate French verbs

SYNOPSIS
       echo aimer | french-conjugator > result.txt

DESCRIPTION
       french-conjugator reads the infinitive form of French verbs from the command line or from standard input and writes (to standard output) the complete conjugation of those verbs, if they are known.

       The standard input is not read if verbs are passed as command-line arguments.

       Each  mode  and tense is introduced by a line that starts with a hyphen and a space, and ends with a colon.  The mode and tense in that line are always in English, regardless of the user's current lo‐
       cale.  (This is meant to facilitate automatic parsing of the output.  For a French user interface, see the GNOME application and applet.)  The conjugation is ended with a line that only contains a hy‐
       phen.  If the given verb is unknown or not in the infinitive form, only this line is written.

       The command flushes its output buffer after finishing each answer.  This allows the command to be easily called from another program through two pipes.

       The command starts by loading its database from XML files (stored typically in /usr/share/verbiste-0.1).  This takes some time, so it is a good idea to have the command answer many requests instead of
       running it for each request.

       The verbiste library's source archive contains Perl and Java example programs that illustrate this technique.

       There must not be any leading or trailing white spaces on the lines read by the command.

       In the past participle tense, four lines are written: they correspond in order to the masculine singular, masculine plural, feminine singular and feminine plural.
