NAME
       gworldclock - Displays time and date in specified time zones.

SYNOPSIS
       gworldclock [ -f FILE ]

DESCRIPTION
       gworldclock displays the time and date of specified time zones using a GTK+ interface. It also allows the zones to be "rendezvoused" or "synchronised" to a time other than the current time.

       The  time zones may be chosen from the list given in the GUI user interface.  The zones available are generated from the data in /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab.  The chosen set of zones is stored in
       ${HOME}/.tzlist by default, but an alternate file may be specified at the command line via -f. Alternatively this file may be created by hand in TZ format. The zone list is kept in a  format  con‐
       sistent  with  the shell script tzwatch, currently found in twclock.  The format consists of one TZ string per line, optionally followed by a human-friendly string enclosed in inverted commas ("),
       providing a name for the zone.

OPTIONS
       -f FILE
              Read zone list from FILE instead of ${HOME}/.tzlist.

SEE ALSO
       tzwatch (1)
