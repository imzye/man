SYNOPSIS
       AirInvClient [--prefix] [-v|--version] [-h|--help] [-b|--builtin] [-f|--for_schedule] [-i|--inventory <path-to-inventory-input-file>] [-s|--schedule <path-to-schedule-input-file>] [-o|--ond <path-to-

DESCRIPTION
       AirInvClient is a small program sending and receiving simple JSON-formatted messages to the ZeroMQ-based server (AirInvServer). The aim of that client is to test that the AirInv server is up and
       running, and that it receives and sends JSON requests.

       AirInvClient does not accept any option for now. Do not hesitate to contribute!
