NAME
       pcsc-spy - A PC/SC spy command

SYNOPSIS
       pcsc-spy [-n|--nocolor] [-d|--diffable] [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [-t|--thread] [fifo_filename]

DESCRIPTION
       pcsc-spy displays PC/SC calls of an application. It must be used with the libpcscspy.so.0 library.

       To be able to spy the PC/SC layer, the application flow must be modified using "LIBPCSCLITE_DELEGATE" so that all PC/SC calls are redirected.

OPTIONS
       -d, --diffable
           Remove the variable parts (like handler values) from the output so that two execution can be more easily compared.

       -h, --help
           Display a short help text.

       -n, --nocolor
           Disable the output colorization (if you want redirect the output in a file for example).

       -v, --version
           Print the version of the pcsc-spy program plus a copyright, a list of authors.

       -t, --thread
           Add a thread number before each line of log to identify the calls from the same threads.

EXAMPLES
       We will use the "LIBPCSCLITE_DELEGATE" environment variable to load our spying library.

       Example:

        sh /usr/share/doc/libpcsclite-dev/setup_spy.sh
        export LIBPCSCLITE_DELEGATE=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcscspy.so.0

        LIBPCSCLITE_DELEGATE=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcscspy.so.0 my_application

   Starting the spy tool
        pcsc-spy

       If a command argument is passed we use it instead of the default ~/pcsc-spy FIFO file. It is then possible to record an execution log and use pcsc-spy multiple times on the same log.

       To create the log file just do:

        mkfifo ~/pcsc-spy
        cat ~/pcsc-spy > logfile

       and run your PC/SC application.

FILES
       ~/pcsc-spy FIFO file is used by libpcscspy.so.0 to send the raw log lines
