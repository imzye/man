       ufoai - UFO: Alien Invasion client

SYNOPSIS
       ufoai [+<internal command> option value] ...

DESCRIPTION
       ufoai is the client for the strategy game UFO: Alien Invasion.

              Display this help

              Disable console output

       +<internal command>
              Options  passed  by  "+<internal command>" are the same as the in-game console understands. For the in-game console press SHIFT+ESC.  Use the in-game cvarlist to get a list of all available
              options for the game.

   Internal commands
       snd_init
              Set this to 0 to start without sound.

       vid_fullscreen
              Set this to 1 to start in fullscreen mode.

FILES
       All data files are part of a pk3 file in /usr/share/games/ufoai/base/. You can extract them (pk3 files are just zip files) and place them in the home directory of the user running  the  game.  Use
       the  path  ~/.ufoai/<VERSION>/base/ to place these files. The files that are not located in the pk3 files have a higher priority than the files that are stored in the pk3 files. So you are able to
       replace any file you want like this. You can also add new maps and other game content to the base/ directory in your users home directory to be able to use new game content.

       ~/.ufoai/<VERSION>/base/config.cfg
              Game configuration.

       keys.cfg
              Game key bindings.

EXAMPLES
       ufoai +snd_init 0 +vid_fullscreen 1
              Start ufoai without sound and in fullscreen mode.
