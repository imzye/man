                        $keyword,
                        (ref($value) eq 'ARRAY' ?
                            join(', ',@{$value}) : ($value||''))

            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
METHODS
   new
       Create a new struture handle object. This is called by Parse::DMIDecode's parse() (and indirectly by probe()) methods.

   raw
        my $raw_data = $handle->raw;

       Returns the raw data as generated by dmidecode that was parsed to create this handle object.

   bytes
        my $bytes = $handle->bytes;

   address
        my $address = $handle->address;

       Returns the address handle of the structure.

   handle
       Alias for address.

   dmitype
        my $dmitype = $handle->dmitype;

   type
       Alias for dmitype.

   description
        my $description = $handle->description;

   keywords
        my @keywords = $handle->keywords;

       Returns a list of keyword data pairs available for retreival from this handle object.

   keyword
        for my $keyword ($handle->keywords) {
            printf("Keyword \"%s\" => \"%s\"\n",
                    $keyword,
                    $handle->keyword($keyword)
                );
        }

   parsed_structures
        use Data::Dumper;
        my $ref = $handle->parsed_structures;
        print Dumper($ref);

       Returns a copy of the parsed structures. This should be used with care as this is a cloned copy of the parsed data structures that the Parse::DMIDecode::Handle object uses internally, and as such
       may change format in later releases without notice.
