NAME
       tabbed-user - tabbed reconfiguration helper and launcher script

SYNOPSIS
       tabbed-user

DESCRIPTION
       tabbed-user is a helper script for running and reconfiguring tabbed if neccessarry.

       Running  tabbed-user  starts  the  Fedora build by default.  If you wish to customize your configuration, put your tabbed configuration header file to $HOME/.tabbed/config.h and adjust it according to
       your needs. The official Fedora configuration file might be a useful template.  See the FILES section of this manual.

       Every time the user configuration file has changed or new patches have been added, tabbed-user will rebuild the user tabbed binary prior to its execution.

       Fedora utilizes alternatives to choose whether the system build, also installed as tabbed-fedora, or the custom build is run.  If available, custom builds are preferred.
