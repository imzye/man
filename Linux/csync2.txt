NAME
       csync2-compare - simulate a directory sync between two hosts

SYNOPSIS
       csync2-compare [-v] host1 host2 basedir

DESCRIPTION
       csync2-compare  compares  the  synchronization for the directory basedir in one direction (host1 -> host2) with the synchronization in the other direction (host2 -> host1).  Only files that differ
       between the hosts are reported.

       This command uses ssh for starting csync2 on hosts and works best when public key authentication is in place.

OPTIONS
       -v     Produce a more verbose output.
