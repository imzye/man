NAME
       sendmsg - send a message via Internet

SYNOPSIS
       sendmsg [ -46vVfrmMl ] [ -u 'from' ] [ -s 'message' ] recipient

DESCRIPTION
       sendmsg sends a one line text message to the terminal(s) of the specified recipient.

       On the receiving site there must be a SAFT-server (Simple Asynchronous File Transfer) installed, like the sendfiled and the recipients terminal must be writeable.

       The recipient address can be specified as:

       user
           a local user or a sendfile alias (see below), e.g.: framstag

       user@host
           an user on a remote host, e.g.: framstag@bofh.belwue.de

       saft://host/user
           like above, but in URL-syntax, e.g.: saft://bofh.belwue.de/framstag

       saft://host:port/user
           like above, but with alternate SAFT-port, e.g.: saft://bofh.belwue.de:4870/framstag

OPTIONS
       -4, -6  Explicitly  force   IPv4  or  IPv6 connections.  By default, the program will try to resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol automatically. If resolving a host name returns
               both IPv4  and  IPv6  addresses, sendmsg will try to use the adresses in the order they are returned by the resolver.

       -v      Verbose mode: show SAFT protocol messages.

       -V      Show version information and exit.

       -f      Force sending of messages and ignore tty (re)settings.

       -r      Reply to last received message.

       -m      Receive messages only on this tty. This is the default.

       -M      Allow receiving messages on other ttys.

       -l      Allow sending of multiline messages messages.

       -s 'message'
               Send directly message.

       -u 'from'
               Set sender to from instead of $LOGNAME.

       -q      Quiet mode: print no transfer messages.

       sendmsg neg@linux.rus.uni-stuttgart.de
       message: how about lunch?
