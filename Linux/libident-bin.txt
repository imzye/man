NAME
       in.identtestd - a small daemon that can be used to test Ident servers

SYNOPSIS
       in.identtestd

DESCRIPTION
       in.identtestd is a small daemon (to be started from inetd) that does an ident lookup on you if you telnet into it. Can be used to verify that your Ident server is working correctly.

       The source code can be found in the libident source tarball, as ident-tester.c.

EXAMPLE
       A typical entry in /etc/inetd.conf would be:

       9999 stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/in.identtestd in.identtestd

       With the above entry in place and active, execute "telnet hostname 9999" from either this system, or another system. It should show something like:

           Trying hostname...
           Connected to hostname.
           Escape character is '^]'.
           Welcome to the IDENT server tester, version 2.0

           (Linked with libident 0.30)

           Connecting to Ident server at 192.168.1.1...
           Querying for lport 1109, fport 9999....
           Reading response data...
           Userid response is:
              Lport........ 1109
              Fport........ 9999
              Opsys........ UNIX
              Charset...... <not specified>
              Identifier... paul
           Connection closed by foreign host.
