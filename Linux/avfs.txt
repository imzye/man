NAME
       aview - A high quality ASCII art image viewer

SYNOPSIS
       aview [options] filename.p[ngbp]m
       asciiview [options] filename.xxx

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       aview/asciiview is an image viewer which displays the images in ASCII art...

       aview  supports  zooming/unzooming,  three  dithering modes, inversion, contrast, brightness, gamma control and can save into many formats (html, text, ansi,
       more/less etc.).

       aview can only show files in the PNM file format. But asciiview automatically converts the file formats to PNM (with extern  programs  like  NetPBM  and  Im‐
       ageMagic) and then runs aview.

       It supports the usual aalib drivers (e.g. slang, x11 and stdout) as well as the mousedrivers X11 and gpm.
