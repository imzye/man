FLOW-RPT2RRD(1)                                                FLOW-RPT2RRD(1)

NAME
       flow-rpt2rrd - Convert flow-report CSV output to RRDtool format.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-rpt2rrd [ -nv ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -k keys ]  [ -K keys_file ]
       [ -f fields ]  [ -p rrd_path ]  [ -P rrd_postfix ]  [ -r rrd_storage ]

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-rpt2rrd utility processes the CSV output of  flow-report  into
       RRDtool format. The aggregates for a key are each stored as a DS in RRD
       filename {rrd_path,"/",key,rrd_postfix,".rrd"}.  By  default  a  DS  is
       created  for flows, octets, and packets. The key must be specified, for
       example an ip-port report could use smtp,nntp,ssh,telnet  as  the  keys
       which would create a separate RRD for each key.

OPTIONS
       -d debug_level
              Set debug level to debug_level (debugging code)

       -h     Help.

       -k keys|html
              Comma  separated  list  of key values. If the report has symbols
              then the key must be the symbol, ie smtp not  25.  The  totals_*
              lines may be used if they are enabled in the report. There is no
              default, keys must be specified with -k or -K.

       -K keys_file
              Load keys from keys_file. See -k.

       -f     Comma separated list of columns to store. Each column maps to  a
              DS in the RRD. Defaults to flows,octets,packets

       -n     Enable  symbol  table  lookups.  For example TCP port 25 = smtp.
              This will result in RRD file names with the  symbolic  names  if
              symbol lookups were not enabled in the report.

       -p rrd_path
              Set path to RRD files. Defaults to ".".

       -P rrd_postfix
              Set RRD file name postfix. Defaults to "".

       -r rrd_storage
              Set RRD storage for 5 minute, 30 minute, 2 hour, and 1 day data‐
              bases. List items are : seperated. Defaults to 600:600:600:732.

       -v     Enable verbose output.

EXAMPLES
       The following example shows the combined use of flow-nfilter (inline),
       flow-report, and flow-rpt2rrd to create an RRD depicting traffic
       from clmbo-r4 to AS 10796 and 6478 for 2004-11-08.  rrdtool graph is
       then used to create a .png.

BUGS
       Hard coded to expect 5 minute flow file intervals.  Does  not  properly
       parse flow-report time-series output.
