NAME
       audisp-remote - plugin for remote logging

SYNOPSIS
       audisp-remote

DESCRIPTION
       audisp-remote  is a plugin for the audit event dispatcher that preforms
       remote logging to an aggregate logging server.

TIPS
       If you are aggregating multiple machines, you should  edit  auditd.conf
       to  set  the  name_format to something meaningful and the log_format to
       enriched. This way you can tell where the event came from and have  the
       user  name and groups resolved locally before it is sent off of the ma‐
       chine.

SIGNALS
       SIGUSR1
              Causes the audisp-remote program to write the value of  some  of
              its  internal flags to syslog. The suspend flag tells whether or
              not logging has been suspended. The remote_ended flag  tells  if
              the  connection  was  broken  by  the server saying it can't log
              events. The transport_ok flag tells whether or not  the  connec‐
              tion  to  the remote server is healthy. The queue_size tells how
              many records are enqueued to be sent to the remote server.

       SIGUSR2
              Causes the audisp-remote program to resume logging  if  it  were
              suspended due to an error.
