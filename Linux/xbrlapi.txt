NAME
       xbrlapi - X11 BrlAPI helper for Linux/Unix

SYNOPSIS
       xbrlapi [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       xbrlapi  connects  to a BrlAPI server in order to provide it with the ID of the X11 window which currently has focus.  It also simulates X keysyms from braille key presses (else brltty would simu‐
       late them using a qwerty keyboard). By default, it puts itself in the background, unless option -n is given.

OPTIONS
       Options are processed sequentially from left to right.  If an option is specified more than once, or in case of a conflict, the rightmost specification takes precedence.

       The following options are supported:

       -b [host][:port] (--brlapi=)
              The BrlAPI server to connect to.

       -a string (--auth=)
              The BrlAPI authorization/authentication string.

       -d display (--display=)
              The X display to connect to.  If not specified, the content of the DISPLAY environment variable is used.

       -n (--no-daemon)
              Keep xbrlapi in the foreground.

       -q (--quiet)
              Do not write any text to the braille device.

       -h (--help)
              Print a command line usage summary and then exit.

       -H (--full-help)
              Print a thorough command line usage summary and then exit.
