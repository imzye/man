NAME
       dar_cp - 'cp' clone command that is able to copy data located after an I/O error

SYNOPSIS
       dar_cp <source file> <destination file>

       dar_cp -h

       dar_cp -V

DESCRIPTION
       dar_cp  is similar to the standard 'cp' command, except it does not stop copying when an I/O error is met. Instead, it skips a bit further and continues to copy the rest of the file, as much as possi‐
       ble, filling the gaps by zeroed bytes.

       dar_cp only accepts full filename (not directory) as argument. The reason of its existence in dar package is that you need it if you use Parchive with dar and have a corruption on a CD-R or any  other
       read-only medium. You need to copy the corrupted slice on a read-write filesystem, for Parchive be able to repair it using slice associated redundancy files.

OPTIONS
       -h                  Displays help usage.

       -V                  Displays version information.

EXIT CODES
       dar_cp exists with the following codes:

       0         upon normal execution (be some corrupted parted skipped or not)

       1         syntax error on command-line

       2         could not open source or destination files

       3         any other system error met during the copy

       5         when some data could not be copied due to I/O error

SIGNALS
       Any signal sent to dar_cp will abort the program immediately, there is no way to have a proper termination before the end of the process
