NAME
       Locale::Hebrew - Bidirectional Hebrew support

VERSION
       This document describes version 1.05 of Locale::Hebrew, released May 27, 2010.

SYNOPSIS
           use Locale::Hebrew;
           $visual = hebrewflip($logical);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is based on code from the Unicode Consortium.

       The charset on their code was bogus, therefore this module had to work the real charset from scratch.  There might have some mistakes, though.

       One function, "hebrewflip", is exported by default.

NOTES
       The input string is assumed to be in "iso-8859-8" encoding by default.

       On Perl version 5.8.1 and above, this module can handle Unicode strings by transparently encoding and decoding it as "iso-8859-8".  The return value should still be a Unicode string.

SEE ALSO
       Text::Bidi, which implements related algorithms based on the "fribidi" library.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       Lots of help from Raz Information Systems, <http://www.raz.co.il/>.

       Thanks to Oded S. Resnik for suggesting Unicode support and exporting "hebrewflip" by default.
