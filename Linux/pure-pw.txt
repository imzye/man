DESCRIPTION
       Virtual  users  is  a  simple  mechanism to store a list of users, with
       their password, name, uid, directory, etc. It's just like  /etc/passwd.
       But it's not /etc/passwd. It's a different file, only for FTP.
       It  means  that you can easily create FTP-only accounts without messing
       your system accounts.
       Additionnaly, virtual users files can store individual quotas,  ratios,
       bandwidth, etc. System accounts can't do this.
       Thousands  of  virtual users can share the same system user, as long as
       they all are chrooted, and they have their own home directory.

FILES
       /etc/pure-ftpd/pureftpd.passwd
       /etc/pure-ftpd/pureftpd.pdb

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PURE_PASSWDFILE If this variable is defined, this is the default  value
       for   the   text  password  file.  Without  this  variable,  /etc/pure-
       ftpd/pureftpd.passwd is assumed.
       PURE_DBFILE If this variable is defined, this is the default value  for
       the   PureDB   password   file.   Without   this  variable,  /etc/pure-
       ftpd/pureftpd.pdb is assumed.
