NAME
       nxconvert - convert a NeXus file between different on disk file formats

SYNOPSIS
       nxconvert [-x|-h 4|-h 5|-d|-o keepws|-o table] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
       NeXus supports different file formats for physical storage on disk or other media.  nxconvert allows the user to convert a file to a different backend.

       If no output file is supplied on the command line, the program asks for one interactively. Same if the input file is not given.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -x     create XML output

       -h 4   create HDF4 output

       -h 5   create HDF5 output

       -d     make a XML based definition file used for validating NeXus files (i.e. remove the data).

       -o keepws
              the XML file created should preserve whitespace.

       -o table
              the XML file created should write the data in a table format where the columns and rows are easily imported into spreadsheet programs.
