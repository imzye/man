NAME
       xphoon - displays the PHase of the mOON on the root window

SYNOPSIS
       xphoon [-b] [-t interval [-i]] [-s] [-display name]

DESCRIPTION
       Xphoon sets the X root window to a picture of the moon in its current phase, including the partial lighting of the dark side by reflected earthlight.

OPTIONS
       -b     Defeats the earthlight feature, forcing the dark side to be black.

       -t     Have xphoon keep running and update the picture every interval minutes.  (Normally, xphoon just sets the root picture and exits.)

       -i     Forks a background process and prints the process-id to stdout.  Useful if you want to make menu commands to refresh or kill xphoon.

       -s     Rotate the whole picture 180 degrees, resulting in a moon picture as viewed fom the Southern hemisphere.

       -demo  Demonstrate xphoon by rapidly stepping through moon phases.

NOTES
       The  original  motivation for this program was that xsetroot was too slow.  Loading a full-screen bitmap took about 15 seconds.  We made a trivial program that had fullmoon.bitmap compiled in, and
       it ran in less than a second.  (And incidentally, the executable was smaller than fullmoon.xbm.)  Then later we came up with the phase hacking, the earthlight, and the auto-scaling.
