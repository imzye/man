NAME
       cyradm - Cyrus IMAP documentation

NAME
       Cyrus::IMAP::Shell - Perl version of cyradm

SYNOPSIS
          $ cyradm [--user authid] [--authz authzid] [--[no]rc] [--systemrc file] [--userrc file] \
          > [--port n] [--auth mechanism] [--server] server

       but possibly

          $ perl -MCyrus::IMAP::Shell -e 'run("myscript")'

       or even (not recommended)

          use Cyrus::IMAP::Admin::Shell;

          run('myscriptname');

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements cyradm in Perl.  It is a shell around Cyrus::IMAP::Admin.  Commands are provided in both Tcl-compatible forms and GNU-style long option forms.

       The ``cyradm`` utility is a simple command line for performing common administrative tasks on a Cyrus IMAP server, written in Perl.

       The cyradm utility can either be executed from a client where it has been installed and connect to the server via IMAP or it can be executed locally via a shell on the server.

       cyradm  understands  /bin/sh-style redirection: any command can have its standard or error output redirected, with all sh-style redirections (except <>) supported. It does not currently understand
       pipes or backgrounding.

       If the Term::Readline::Perl or Term::Readline::GNU modules are available, cyradm will use it.

COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS
       • --u, --user user
          Authenticate with the specified username.

       • --authz user
          Authorize the connection as being the specified username.

       • --norc, --rc
          (Do not) load the configuration files.

       • --systemrc file
          Use the system configuration file specified.

       • --userrc file
          Use the user configuration file specified.

       • --port port
          Connect to the *server* specified on the port specified.

       • --auth mechanism
          Use the mechanism specified to authenticate. One of PLAIN, LOGIN, etc.

       • --help
          Show a help message about these command-line options.

       • --version
          Display the version of Cyrus IMAP the current ``cyradm`` command is a part of.

       • --server server
          The server address to connect to.

COMMANDS
   authenticate
       authenticate [--minssf N] [--maxssf N] [--mechanisms list] [--service name] [--tlskey keyfile] [--notls] [--cafile cacertfile] [--capath cacertdir] user

       Authenticate to server.  You must already be connected to a server and Cyrus imapd will refuse to allow you to re-authenticate once you have authenticated once.

       aliases: auth, login

   chdir
       chdir directory

       Change directory.  A pwd builtin is not provided, but the default command action will run pwd from a shell if invoked.

       aliases: cd

   createmailbox
       createmailbox [--partition partition] [--specialuse specialuse] mailbox

       createmailbox [--specialuse specialuse] mailbox partition

       Create a mailbox on the default or a specified partition.  Both old-style and getopt-style usages are accepted (combining them will produce an error).  Optionally assign a special use to the mail‐
       box.

       New mailboxes inherit the ACL permissions of their parent mailbox, except for top-level mailboxes such as the user's INBOX. Mailboxes that are the user's INBOX are assigned all to the  correspond‐
       ing user.

       • Example Usage

              localhost> :command:`cm user.john`
              localhost> :command:`lm`
              user.john (\HasNoChildren)
              localhost> :command:`lam user.john`
              john lrswipkxtecda

          Note  that  in the above example, the unixhierarchysep setting in imapd.conf is set to 0. When using the UNIX hierarchy separator, the / (forward slash) character would be used as the hierarchy
          separator, and the example would look as follows:

       • Example Usage with unixhierarchysep: 1

              localhost> :command:`cm user/john`
              localhost> :command:`lm`
              user/john (\HasNoChildren)
              localhost> :command:`lam user/john`
              john lrswipkxtecda

       • Note
          The above examples use the unqualified, shorthand user identifier john as the mailbox name.

          With the use of virtual domains, controlled through the virtdomains setting in imapd.conf(5).

       aliases: cm, create

   deleteaclmailbox
       deleteaclmailbox mailbox id [...]

       Remove ACLs from the specified mailbox.

       aliases: delteacl, dam

   deletemailbox
       deletemailbox mailbox

       Delete the specified mailbox.

       Administrators do not have implicit delete rights on mailboxes.  Use the setaclmailbox command to grant the x permission to your principal if you need to delete a mailbox you do not own.

       aliases: delete, dm

   disconnect
       disconnect

       Disconnect from the current server.  The prompt will revert to cyradm>.  This does not quit cyradm.

       aliases: disc

   exit
       exit [number]

       Exit cyradm, optionally with a specific exit status; the exit status of the last command will be used if one is not specified.

       aliases: quit

   help
       help [command]

       Show help for command or all commands.

       aliases: ?

   getmetadata
       getmetadata [mailbox]

       Display mailbox/server metadata

       aliases: getmd

   info
       info [mailbox]

       Display the mailbox/server annotations.

   listaclmailbox
       listaclmailbox mailbox

       List ACLs on the specified mailbox.

       aliases: lam, listacl

   listmailbox
       listmailbox [--subscribed] [--specialuse] [pattern [reference]]

       List all, or all subscribed or special-use, mailboxes matching the specified pattern.  The pattern may have embedded wildcards '\*' or '%', which match anything or anything  except  the  separator
       character, respectively.

       Mailboxes returned will be relative to the specified reference if one is specified.  This allows a mailbox list to be limited to a particular hierarchy.

       In some cases when the '%' wildcard is used to end a pattern, it may match an entry which is not a mailbox but which contains other mailboxes.  In this case, the entry will be parenthesized to in‐
       dicate that it is a root for other mailboxes, as opposed to a mailbox itself.

       aliases: list, lm

   listquota
       listquota root

       List quotas on specified root.  If the specified mailbox path does not have a quota assigned, an error will be raised; see listquotaroot for a way to find the quota root for a mailbox.

       aliases: lq

   listquotaroot
       listquotaroot mailbox

       Show quota roots and quotas for mailbox

       aliases: lqm, lqr

   mboxconfig
       mboxconfig [--private] mailbox attribute value

       Set mailbox metadata, optionally set the private instead of the shared version of the metadata. A value of "none" will remove the attribute.

       The currently supported attributes are:

       • comment description
          Sets a comment or description associated with the mailbox.

       • expire days
          Sets the number of days after which messages will be expired from the mailbox.

       • news2mail address
          Sets an email address to which messages injected into the server via NNTP will be sent.

       • pop3showafter time
          Sets  a  time (in RFC3501 format, for example "6-Jan-2011 11:45:32 +1100") which specifies a cutoff date such that POP3 fetching of the folder does not see messages whose internaldate is before
          or equal to the date.

       • sharedseen true|false
          Enables the use of a shared Seen flag on messages rather than a per-user Seen flag.  The 's' right in the mailbox ACL still controls whether a user can set the shared Seen flag.

       • sieve scriptname
          Indicates the name of the global sieve script that should be run when a message is delivered to the shared mailbox (not used for personal mailboxes).

       • squat true|false
          Indicates that the mailbox should have a squat index created for it.

       aliases: mboxcfg

   reconstruct
       reconstruct [-r] mailbox

       Reconstruct the specified mailbox, optionally recursing and reconstructing child mailboxes if the -r flag is given.

       For more information see reconstruct(8).

   renamemailbox
       renamemailbox [--partition partition] oldname newname

       renamemailbox oldname newname [partition]

       Rename the specified mailbox, optionally moving it to a different partition.  Both old-style and getopt-style usages are accepted; combining them will produce an error.

       aliases: rename, renm

   server
       server

       server [--noauthenticate] [server]

       With no arguments, show the current server.  With an argument, connect to that server.  It will prompt for automatic login unless the --noauthenticateoption is specified.   (This  may  change;  in
       particular, either automatic authentication will be removed or all authenticate options will be added.)

       When connected to a server, cyradm's prompt changes from cyradm> to servername>, where servername is the fully qualified domain name of the connected server.

       aliases: connect, servername

   setaclmailbox
       setaclmailbox mailbox id rights [id rights ...]

       Set  ACLs on a mailbox.  The ACL may be one of the special strings none, read (lrs), post (lrsp), append (lrsip), write(lrswipkxte), delete (lrxte), or all (lrswipkxte), or any combinations of the
       ACL codes:

       • l
          Lookup (mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB, SUBSCRIBE mailbox)

       • r
          Read (SELECT/EXAMINE the mailbox, perform STATUS)

       • s
          Seen (set/clear SEEN flag via STORE, also set SEEN flag during APPEND/COPY/FETCH BODY[...])

       • w
          Write flags other than SEEN and DELETED

       • i
          Insert (APPEND, COPY destination)

       • p
          Post (send mail to mailbox)

       • k
          Create mailbox (CREATE new sub-mailboxes, parent for new mailbox in RENAME)

       • x
          Delete mailbox (DELETE mailbox, old mailbox name in RENAME)

       • t
          Delete messages (set/clear DELETED flag via STORE, also set DELETED flag during APPEND/COPY)

       • e
          Perform EXPUNGE and expunge as part of CLOSE

       • a
          Administer (SETACL/DELETEACL/GETACL/LISTRIGHTS)

       aliases: setacl, sam

   setinfo
       setinfo attribute value

       Set server metadata.  A value of "none" will remove the attribute.  The currently supported attributes are:

       • motd message
          Sets a "message of the day".  The message gets displayed as an ALERT upon connection.

       • comment note
          Sets a comment or description associated with the server.

       • admin address
          Sets the administrator email address for the server.

       • shutdown message
          Sets a shutdown message.  The message gets displayed as an ALERT and all users are disconnected from the server (subsequent logins are disallowed).

       • expire days
          Sets the number of days after which messages will be expired from the server (unless overridden by a mailbox annotation).

       • squat true|false
          Indicates that all mailboxes should have a squat indexes created for them (unless overridden by a mailbox annotation).

   setmetadata
       setmetadata [--private] mailbox [annotation] value

       Set metadata on mailbox, where annotation is one of [comment|expire|news2mail|pop3showafter|sharedseen|sieve|specialuse| squat|/<explicit annotation>].

       Note that value with a leading backslash must be escaped with an additional backslash.  For example:

          setmetadata --private Spam specialuse "\\Junk"

       Note, too, that "private" annotations are private to the user currently authenticated as, not necessarily the owner of the mailbox.  To set annotations for another user you must authorize as  that
       user.

       In addition to the use of optional flag --private, one may use a more explicit syntax, prefixing the annotation with '/shared/' or '/private/' as in this example:

          setmetadata Spam /private/specialuse "\\Junk"

       aliases: setmd

   setquota
       setquota root resource value [resource value ...]

       Set  a  quota  on  the specified root, which may or may not be an actual mailbox. The resources understood by Cyrus are STORAGE, MESSAGE, X-NUM-FOLDERS and X-ANNOTATION-STORAGE.  The storage units
       are, as defined in RFC 2087, groups of 1024 octets (i.e.  Kilobytes). The value may be the special string none which will remove the quota.

       aliases: sq

   subscribe
       subscribe mailbox

       Subscribe to the given mailbox.

   unsubscribe
       unsubscribe mailbox

       Unsubscribe to the given mailbox.

   version
       version

       Display the version info of the current server.

       aliases: ver

   xfermailbox
       xfermailbox [--partition partition] mailbox server

       xfermailbox mailbox server [partition]

       Transfer (relocate) the specified mailbox to a different server.  Both old-style and getopt-style usages are accepted; combining them will produce an error.

       aliases: xfer

NOTES
       GNU-style long options must be given in their entirety; Tcl-style options may be abbreviated.

       Tcl-style options are provided as a compatibility feature.  They will probably go away in the future.

       Multiple commands can be given on a line, separated by ';' characters.

       All commands set an exit status, which at present is not useful.

       Unknown commands are passed to a subshell for execution.

       The Tcl version of cyradm is used for scripting as well as interactively.  While this is possible to  a  limited  extent  by  use  of  the  run  method,  scripting  would  normally  be  done  with
       Cyrus::IMAP::Admin, which is far more flexible than either interactive cyradm or the Tcl scripting mechanism for Cyrus.

       cyradm understands /bin/sh-style redirection:  any command can have its standard or error output redirected, with all sh-style redirections (except <>) supported.  It does not currently understand
       pipes or backgrounding.

       If the Term::Readline::Perl or Term::Readline::GNU modules are available, cyradm will use it.

       An  alias facility is implemented internally, but no access is currently provided to it.  This will change, if only to allow some of the predefined aliases to be removed if they conflict with use‐
       ful shell commands.
