NAME
       .ddtcrc - ddtc script configuration file.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the configuration file for ddtc. If it exists, it must be at the top of your home directory ($HOME). This file is optional unless you don't want to use default values.

       Lines beginning with a number sign (`#') and empty lines will be ignored.  Spaces at the beginning and the end of a line will also be ignored as well as tabulators.  If you need spaces at the end
       or the beginning of a value you can use apostrophes (`"').  An option line starts with it's name followed by a value. An equal sign is optional.  A comment starts with the number sign, there can
       be any number of spaces and/or tab stops in front of the #.  Some possible examples:

        # this line is ignored
        option   value
        option = value                               # this is a comment
        option        "value ending with space   "

       You have to escape number signs with a backslash (`\') to use it in a value.

       Default values are provided into square brackets, they should be suitable for most installations.

       You can use the configuration menu from interactive mode to edit it.

GENERAL
       base_dir
           base directory, sub-directory of your $HOME unless an absolute path (i.e.  beginning with `/') is provided [ddts]

       comment
           comment string for review, a space character will be added to this string [>>]

       clean_regex
           regular expression to remove file with clean command [~\$|\.old\$|\.bak\$]

       editor
           text editor [sensible-editor]

       ddtc_bug
           whether reviews are sent in a special way to prevent updating ddts parts databases or not. [no]

           Caution:  if  set  to `yes', the `reply to accept modification' ddts feature doesn't work anymore and the whole language team should use ddtc. Ask your language team coordinator before setting
           this option.

EMAIL
       mail_out
           your email address [first found in $ENV{EMAIL}, $ENV{DEBEMAIL} or none]

       mail_in
           the mail address you want the ddts to answer to. This is the address the ddts uses for your identification so you must use this if you need to set mail_out to another value [mail_out]

       mail_server
           email address of the server [desc@ddtp.debian.org]

       mail_encoding
           mail encoding for mime [8bit]

       mail_charset

       mail_self
           set to `yes' if you want to be sent a copy of outgoing mail [yes]

MENU COLORS
       Set text colors for clear presentation.

       The recognized colors (all of which should be fairly intuitive) are: clear, reset, dark, bold, underline, underscore, blink, reverse, concealed, black, red, green,  yellow,  blue,  magenta,  cyan,
       white,  on_black,  on_red,  on_green,  on_yellow,  on_blue,  on_magenta,  on_cyan,  and on_white.  Case is not significant.  Underline and underscore are equivalent, as are clear and reset, so use
       whichever is the most intuitive to you.  The color alone sets the foreground color, and on_color sets the background color.

       Note that not all colors are supported by all terminal types, and some terminals may not support any of these sequences.  Dark, blink, and concealed in particular are frequently not implemented.

       menu_title_color
           color used for menu title [bold cyan]

       menu_letter_color
           color used for the letter to be entered [bold cyan]

       menu_text_color
           color used for the menu item description [cyan]
