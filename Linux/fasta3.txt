NAME
       ps_lav [-B] [-Z db_size] - plot an "lav" file in postscript.

DESCRIPTION
       ps_lav  is  a  simple  program  to  take  "lav"  format output from "lalign35" and produce postscript alignment plots (which look like "dot-plots").  It was designed to work with the output of the
       lalign35 program, but should work with other lav output as well.

       -B     color alignment lines using the "bit" score.

       -Z db_size
              set the effective database size for an E()-value calculate to db_size, and color alignment lines using E()-values.  Requires bit scores in the lav ouput.
