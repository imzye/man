NAME
       HTTP::CookieMonster::Cookie - Cookie representation used by HTTP::CookieMonster

VERSION
       version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
           use HTTP::CookieMonster::Cookie;
           my $cookie = HTTP::CookieMonster::Cookie->new(
               key       => 'cookie-name',
               val       => 'cookie-val',
               path      => '/',
               domain    => '.somedomain.org',
               path_spec => 1,
               secure    => 0,
               expires   => 1376081877
           );

           use WWW::Mechanize;
           use HTTP::CookieMonster;

           my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new;
           my $monster = HTTP::CookieMonster->new( cookie_jar => $mech->cookie_jar );
           $monster->set_cookie( $cookie );

           $mech->get('https://example.com');    # passes $cookie in request

DESCRIPTION
       This module is intended to be used by HTTP::CookieMonster to represent cookies found in an HTTP::Cookies cookie_jar.  To keep things familiar, I have chosen method names which reflect the
       positional parameter names laid out in the $cookie_jar->scan( \&callback ) documentation.

       Not being intimately familiar with the HTTP cookie spec, I haven't forced validation or default values on any attributes, so please be aware that the burden is on the user to provide "correct"
       data if you are using this module directly.

       I have provided some sample values below.  To get a better idea of what is required, try visiting a few sites and dumping their cookies.

           use Data::Printer;
           my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new;
           $mech->get( 'http://www.google.ca' );
           my $monster = HTTP::CookieMonster->new( cookie_jar => $mech->cookie_jar );
           p $monster->all_cookies;

   version
           $cookie->version( 0 );

   key
       The name of the cookie.

           $cookie->key( "session_id" );

   val
       The value of the cookie.

           $cookie->val( "random_stuff" );

       If you are creating a new cookie, you should escape the value first.

           use URI::Escape qw( uri_escape );
           $cookie->value( uri_escape( 'random_stuff' ) );

   path
           $cookie->path( "/" );

   domain
           $cookie->domain( ".google.ca" );

   port
   path_spec
           $cookie->path_spec( 1 );

   secure
           $cookie->secure( 1 );

   expires
           $cookie->expires( 1407696193 );

   discard
   hash
           $cookie->hash( { HttpOnly => undef } );

SEE ALSO
       This is mainly useful for creating cookies to be used by LWP::UserAgent and WWW::Mechanize classes.  If you need to create cookies to set via headers, have a look at Cookie::Baker.
