NAME
       sup-sync - sychronize the Sup index with message sources

SYNOPSIS
       sup-sync [options] source ...

DESCRIPTION
       Synchronizes the Sup index with one or more message sources by adding messages, deleting messages, or changing message state in the index as appropriate.

       “Message state” means read/unread, archived/inbox, starred/unstarred, and all user-defined labels on each message.

       “Default source state” refers to any state that a source itself has keeps about a message.  Sup-sync uses this information when adding a new message to the index.  The source state is typically limit‐
       ed to read/unread, archived/inbox status and a single label based on the source name.  Messages using the default source state are placed in the inbox (i.e. not archived) and unstarred.

       If no sources are given, sync from all usual sources.  Supported source URI schemes can be seen by running “sup-add --help”.

MESSAGE STATE OPTIONS
       --asis If the message is already in the index, preserve its state.  Otherwise, use default source state (default)

       --restore dumpfile
              Restore message state from a dump file created with sup-dump.  If a message is not in this dumpfile, act as --asis

       --discard
              Discard any message state in the index and use the default source state.  Dangerous!

       -x, -  When using the default source state, mark messages as archived.

       -r, --read
              When using the default source state, mark messages as read.

       --extra-labels STRING
              When using the default source state, also apply these user-defined labels (a comma-separated list) (default)

OTHER OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Print message ids as they’re processed.

       -o, --optimize
              As the final operation, optimize the index.

       --all-sources
              Scan over all sources.

       -n, --dry-run
              Don’t actually modify the index.  Probably only useful with --verbose.

       --version
              Show version information

       -h, --help
              Show help message
