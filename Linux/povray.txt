NAME
       povray - POV-Ray: The Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer

SYNOPSIS
       povray [+Ooutput_file] [+/-option ...]  [input_file]

       povray [+Iinput_file] [+Ooutput_file] [+/-option ...] [INI_file]

DESCRIPTION
       POV-Ray is a free, full-featured ray tracer, written and maintained by a team of volunteers on the Internet.  On the UNIX platform POV-Ray can be compiled with support for preview capabilities us‐
       ing the X Window System.

       This  manual page only lists the basic POV-Ray and UNIX specific features and command-line options for this version of POV-Ray.  For a complete description of the features of POV-Ray and its scene
       description language (a.k.a. POV-Ray SDL), or for a better explanation of the meaning of the command-line and INI file options, please consult the documentation that should accompany all  versions
       of  POV-Ray.   The documentation is installed in PREFIX/share/doc/povray-3.7, where PREFIX is /usr/local by default, or a path specified when configuring the source package for compilation and in‐
       stallation.

       Some of the UNIX-specific features are:

              Support for X Window display automatically uses the best visual class and deepest depth available.  For visuals that do not support 24 bits of color per pixel, Floyd-Steinberg error  diffu‐
              sion dithering is used, along with a dynamically allocated and optimized palette to produce the best display possible with the current visual, depth, and available colormap.

              ICCCM  compliance for the X Window version means that the preview window will behave like standard X Window programs, communicate properly with the window manager, and will accept the stan‐
              dard command-line options.  See X(1) for more information.

              ASCII graphics in the text-mode version allow a basic view of the current rendering on text-only terminals.

              An interrupt handler allows rendering to be interrupted in a safe way, so that any data not currently written to disk will be saved before exiting.  Control-C or SIGINT will  cause  a  user
              abort, and save the current rendering, before exiting.  See kill(1) for more information.

              Platform  and  architecture-independent rendering means that the same scene will render in the same way on all computers and operating systems (with the exception of the rendering speed, of
              course).

OPTIONS
       Options can be specified with either a leading '+' or a leading '-'.  Many options are switches, meaning a '+' turns the option on, and a '-' turns the option off.  For other options,  it  doesn't
       matter  if  a  '+' or a '-' is used.  Most options cannot have spaces in them so you should specify +FN rather than +F N, and combining options is not allowed, so +SC is very different from +S +C.
       Options are not case sensitive.

       The command-line options are shown below with their corresponding INI file options.  If the same option is specified multiple times, whether in INI files or on the command-line, the last such  op‐
       tion overrides any previous ones, with the exception of the +L or Library_Path option, which is cumulative.

   Parsing options:
       I<input_file_name> or Input_File_Name=file
              Specifies the input file to use. Only real files are supported. Using '-' as the input file name, to read from the standard input, is deprecated.

       HI<header_include_file_name> or Include_Header=file
              Specifies a file as the first include file of a scene file.  This can be used to always include a specific set of default include files used by all your scenes.

       L<library_path> or Library_Path=path
              Specifies  a  directory  to search for input files, include files, fonts, and image maps, if the specified file is not in the current directory.  This may be specified multiple times to in‐
              crease the number of directories to search.

       MVn.n or Version=float
              Treat scene files as if they were version n.n instead of the current version.  This may be overridden from within the scene file.

       SU or Split_Unions=bool
              Split bounded CSG unions if children are finite.  This allows automatic bounding of CSG objects to take place.

       UR or Remove_Bounds=bool
              Remove unnecessary bounding objects.  This allows automatic bounding of older scene files to take place.

       BM1 or Bounding_Method=1
              Enable BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) bounding (the default).

       BM2 or Bounding_Method=2
              Enable BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) tree bounding.

   Output options:
       Hn or Height=integer
              The image should be n pixels high.

       Wn or Width=integer
              The image should be n pixels wide.

       SRn or Start_Row=integer
              Start the rendering at row n from the top of the screen.

       SR0.n or Start_Row=float
              Start the rendering n percent from the top of the screen.

       ERn or End_Row=integer
              End the rendering at row n from the top of the screen.

       ER0.n or End_Row=float
              End the rendering at n percent from the top of the screen.

       SCn or Start_Column=integer
              Start the rendering at column n from the left of the screen.

       SC0.n or Start_Column=float
              Start the rendering at n percent from the left of the screen.

       ECn or Start_Column=integer
              End the rendering at column n from the left of the screen.

       EC0.n or Start_Column=float
              End the rendering at n percent from the left of the screen.

       C or Continue_Trace=bool
              Continue a previously interrupted trace.

       P or Pause_When_Done=bool
              If previewing, pause when the rendering is complete before closing the window.

       V or Verbose=bool
              Output verbose status messages on the progress of the rendering.

       WLn or Warning_Level=integer
              Set warning level to n.

       X or Test_Abort=bool
              Enable the 'q' and 'Q' keys to interrupt a rendering in progress.

       Xn or Test_Abort_Count=integer
              Only check every n pixels for a user abort.

   Output options - display related:
       D[0][GHT] or Display=bool  Palette=char
              Display the rendering in progress, optionally specifying the palette.  The only valid X Window palette option is G, which forces grayscale preview.  The X Window palette is based on the vi‐
              sual used, whether selected automatically by POV-Ray or via the -visual option.  To specify the palette, you must first specify the display type (the second character, shown  here  as  '0')
              for compatibility reasons, even though it is ignored in UNIX versions.

       SPn or Preview_Start_Size=integer
              Start mosaic preview with blocks n pixels square.

       EPn or Preview_End_Size=integer
              End mosaic preview with blocks n pixels square.

       UD or Draw_Vistas=bool
              Draw vista rectangles before rendering has been deprecated.

   Output options - file related:
       F[CEHJNPST][n] or Output_to_File=bool Output_File_Type=char
              Store the rendered image using one of the available formats, namely Compressed TGA, OpenEXR, Radiance High Dynamic-Range, JPEG, PNG, PPM, System  specific (PNG) and TGA.

       O<output_file> or Output_File_Name=file
              Write the output to the file named output_file, or the standard output if '-' is given as the output file name.

       MIn or Max_Image_Buffer_Memory=n
              Sets the allowable size of the output image cache in megabytes.

   Tracing options:
       MBn or Bounding=bool Bounding_Threshold=integer
              Use automatic bounding slabs if more than n objects are in the scene.

       Qn or Quality=integer
              Render at quality n.  Qualities range from 0 for rough images and 9 for complete ray-tracing and textures, and 10 and 11 add radiosity.

       A0.n or Antialias=bool Antialias_Threshold=integer
              Do antialiasing on the pixels until the difference between adjacent pixels is less that 0.n, or the maximum recursion depth is reached.

       AMn or Sampling_Method=integer
              Specify the method of antialiasing used, non-adaptive (n = 1), or adaptive antialiasing (n = 2).

       Jn.n or Jitter=bool Jitter_Amount=float

              Use light buffer to speed up rendering has been deprecated.

       UV or Vista_Buffer=bool
              Use vista buffer to speed up rendering has been deprecated.

   Animation options:
       Kn.n or Clock=float
              Render a single frame of an animation with the clock value n.n.

       KFIn or Initial_Frame=integer
              Specify the initial frame number for an animation.

       KFFn or Final_Frame=integer
              Specify the final frame number for an animation.  This must be set at a value other that 1 in order to render multiple frames at once.

       KIn.n or Initial_Clock=float
              Specify the clock value for the initial frame of an animation.

       KFn.n or Final_Clock=float

       UF or Field_Render=bool
              Render alternate frames using odd/even fields, suitable for interlaced output.

       UO or Odd_Field=bool
              Start a field rendered animation on the odd field, rather than the even field.

   Redirecting options:
       GI<name> or Create_Ini=bool or Create_Ini=file
              Write all INI parameters to a file named after the input scene file, or one with the specified name.

       G[ADFRSW]<name> or <Stream>_File=bool or <Stream>_File=file
              Write the stream to the console and/or the specified file.  The streams are All_File (except status), Debug_File, Fatal_File, Render_File, Statistics_File, and the Warning_File.

   X Window System options:
       In addition to the standard command-line options, POV-Ray recognizes additional command-line switches related to the X Window System.  See X(1) for a complete description of these options.

       -display <display_name>
              Display preview on display_name rather than the default display.  This is meant to be used to change the display to a remote host.  The normal dispay option +d is still valid.

       -geometry  [WIDTHxHEIGHT][+XOFF+YOFF]
              Render  the image with WIDTH and HEIGHT as the dimensions, and locate the window XOFF from the left edge, and YOFF from the top edge of the screen (or if negative the right and bottom edges
              respectively).  The WIDTH and HEIGHT, if given, override any previous Wn and Hn settings.

       -help  Display the X Window System-specific options.  Use -H by itself on the command-line to output the general POV-Ray options.

       -icon  Start the preview window as an icon.

       -title <window_title>
              Override the default preview window title with window_title.

       -visual <visual_type>
              Use the deepest visual of visual_type, if available, instead of the automatically selected visual.  Valid visuals are StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor, or  Direct‐
              Color.

RESOURCES
       Currently no X resource or app-default files are supported for the X Window options.

FILES
       POV-Ray  for  UNIX  allows a povray.ini file in the current directory to override the individual setting in $HOME/.povray/3.7/povray.ini.  POV-Ray looks for initial configuration information, like
       the Library_Path settings, which gives the location for the standard include files, first in the environment variable $POVINI, then in ./povray.ini, then in $HOME/.povray/3.7/povray.ini,  then  in
       PREFIX/etc/povray/3.7/povray.ini.  The  PREFIX  directory can be changed at compile-time using the --prefix option of the configure script.  For backward compatibility with POV-Ray version 3.5 and
       earlier, the $HOME/.povrayrc and $PREFIX/etc/povray.ini files are also searched for when none of the above files were found.

       Since version 3.5 POV-Ray features an I/O Restriction mechanism.  I/O Restrictions attempt to at least partially protect a machine running POV-Ray from having files read or written  outside  of  a
       given  set of directories. The settings are defined in two configuration files, a system-level PREFIX/etc/povray/3.7/povray.conf file and an user-level $HOME/.povray/3.7/povray.conf file with more
       restrictive settings.  As of POV-Ray 3.6 the format of these configuration files has changed, and no backward compatibility is retained with the configuration files in POV-Ray 3.5. See  the  docu‐
       mentation for further details and examples of I/O Restriction settings.

       povlegal.doc should accompany all installations of POV-Ray, and outlines specific conditions and restrictions on the POV-Ray software.  A condition of povlegal.doc requires that documentation, INI
       and  scene files be available to all users of POV-Ray. Scene and INI files are typically installed in PREFIX/share/povray-3.7, and documentation in PREFIX/share/doc/povray-3.7, but these may be in
       other locations on some systems.

       The most recent version of POV-Ray and its documentation can always be retrieved via anonymous FTP at ftp.povray.org or via HTTP at povray.org, as well as many other locations.
