NAME
       pycdlib-explorer - tool to examine and modify ISOs using pycdlib

SYNOPSIS
       pycdlib-explorer <iso-file>

DESCRIPTION
       This is a tool to examine and modify existing ISO files on disk.  Using this tool, the files, directories, and metadata on an ISO can be examined, new files can be added, and old files can be deleted.
       Note that due to the nature of the ISO standard, files cannot be modified in place in a general way.  To accomplish this, remove the file and then re-add it with new contents.

       The commands that modify the ISO only modify the in-memory copy.  No changes are made to the original file until the write command is issued.

       Also note that pycdlib-explorer has no command-line options; instead, its behavior is controlled entirely at runtime through commands.  The following section describes the available  commands  in  py‐
       cdlib-explorer.

COMMANDS
       add_file <iso_path> <src_filename> [rr_name=<rr_name>] [joliet_path=<joliet_path>]
              Add  the  contents  of <src_filename> to the ISO at the location specified in <iso_path>.  If the ISO is a Rock Ridge ISO, <rr_name> must be specified; otherwise, it must not be.  If the ISO is
              not a Joliet ISO, <joliet_path> must not be specified.  If the ISO is a Joliet ISO, <joliet_path> is optional, but highly recommended to supply.

       cd <iso_dir>
              Change relative directories to iso_dir for exploration.

       cwd    Show the current working directory.

       exit   Exit out of pycdlib-explorer.

       get <iso_file> <out_file>
              Copy the contents of the relative or absolute ISO path iso_file into out_file.

       help   Print the available commands.  Use "help <cmd>" for a more detailed description of the commands, including the command-line arguments they require.

       ls     Show the contents of the current working directory. The format of the output is: TYPE(F=file, D=directory) NAME.

       mkdir <iso_path> [rr_name=<rr_name>] [joliet_path=<joliet_path>]
              Make a new directory called <iso_path>.  If the ISO is a Rock Ridge ISO, <rr_name> must be specified; otherwise, it must not be.  If the ISO is not a Joliet ISO, <joliet_path> must not be spec‐
              ified.  If the ISO is a Joliet ISO, <joliet_path> is optional, but highly recommended to supply.

       print_mode [iso9660|rr|joliet|udf]
              Change  which  'mode'  of filenames are printed out.  There are four main modes: ISO9660 (iso9660, the default), Rock Ridge (rr), Joliet (joliet), and UDF (udf).  The original iso9660 mode only
              allows filenames of 8 characters, plus 3 for the extension.  The Rock Ridge extensions allow much longer filenames and much deeper directory structures.  The Joliet extensions also allow longer
              filenames  and  deeper  directory structures, but in an entirely different context (though in most circumstances, the Joliet context will mirror the ISO9660/Rock Ridge context).  The UDF Bridge
              extensions add an entirely parallel UDF context to the ISO as well.  Any given ISO will always have ISO9660 mode, but may have any combination of Rock Ridge, Joliet, and UDF (including none  of
              them).   Running this command with no arguments prints out the current mode.  Passing 'iso9660' as an argument sets it to the original ISO9660 mode.  Passing 'rr' as an argument sets it to Rock
              Ridge mode.  Passing 'joliet' as an argument sets it to Joliet mode.  Passing 'udf' as an argument sets it to UDF mode.

       quit   Exit out of pycdlib-explorer.

       rm_file <iso_path>
              Remove the file named iso_path from the ISO.  Note that this must be a file; to remove a directory, use rmdir.

       rmdir <iso_path>
              Remove the directory named iso_path from the ISO.  Note that this must be a directory; to remove a file, use rm_file.

       tree   List the contents of the ISO in a tree-like format, similar to the bash tree command.

       write <out_file>
              Write a valid ISO9660 file out to out_file, taking into account any changes made while running the program.  This is also sometimes referred to as "mastering" the ISO.  Note that  the  out_file
              must NOT be the same file as the input file, or the resulting ISO will not work properly.
