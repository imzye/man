SIMBA(8)                                                         User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                        SIMBA(8)

NAME
       simba

VERSION
       0.8.4

SYNOPSIS
       simba [-c|--config <configuration file] [--callbacks|-p] [--help|-h] [mirror_name]

PREREQUISITES
       simba requires RoPkg::Simba

DESCRIPTION
       There are many institutions that offer mirroring services to the community. Most of them use shell scripts to synchronize content with the master servers.
       This approach has some major limitations:

       Difficult maintenance
       No useful reports
       No data presented to the final user
       and more

       Simba was created to be the mirroring tool and to get more control over the mirrored content and (most important) more control over the reports you can
       generate using the mirrored content data. Using Simba, you can:

       Create web pages with mirrors status
       Create web pages with mirror details
       Generate RSS feeds
       Generate Google sitemaps
       Generate rsync configuration files
       and more

       Simba is extensible and has a dynamic plugin system.  If you have some knowledge of perl, you can write your own plugins and extend Simba as you wish.

RUNNING
       simba has a few command line parameters.

   -c|--config

   -p|--callbacks
