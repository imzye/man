NAME
       Net::SSLeay::Handle - Perl module that lets SSL (HTTPS) sockets be handled as standard file handles.

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::SSLeay::Handle qw/shutdown/;
         my ($host, $port) = ("localhost", 443);

         tie(*SSL, "Net::SSLeay::Handle", $host, $port);

         print SSL "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n";
         shutdown(\*SSL, 1);
         print while (<SSL>);
         close SSL;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::SSLeay::Handle allows you to request and receive HTTPS web pages using "old-fashion" file handles as in:

           print SSL "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n";

       and

           print while (<SSL>);

       If you export the shutdown routine, then the only extra code that you need to add to your program is the tie function as in:

           my $socket;
           if ($scheme eq "https") {
               tie(*S2, "Net::SSLeay::Handle", $host, $port);
               $socket = \*S2;
           else {
               $socket = Net::SSLeay::Handle->make_socket($host, $port);
           }
           print $socket $request_headers;
           ...

FUNCTIONS
       shutdown
             shutdown(\*SOCKET, $mode)

           Calls to the main shutdown() don't work with tied sockets created with this module.  This shutdown should be able to distinquish between tied and untied sockets and do the right thing.

       debug
             my $debug = Net::SSLeay::Handle->debug()
             Net::SSLeay::Handle->debug(1)

           Get/set debugging mode. Always returns the debug value before the function call.  if an additional argument is given the debug option will be set to this value.

       make_socket
             my $sock = Net::SSLeay::Handle->make_socket($host, $port);

           Creates  a  socket  that  is  connected  to  $post  using  $port.  It  uses  $Net::SSLeay::proxyhost  and  proxyport  if  set  and  authentificates  itself  against  this  proxy  depending  on
           $Net::SSLeay::proxyauth. It also turns autoflush on for the created socket.

   USING EXISTING SOCKETS
       One of the motivations for writing this module was to avoid duplicating socket creation code (which is mostly error handling).  The calls to tie() above where it is passed a  $host  and  $port  is
       provided for convenience testing.  If you already have a socket connected to the right host and port, S1, then you can do something like:

           my $socket \*S1;
           if ($scheme eq "https") {
               tie(*S2, "Net::SSLeay::Handle", $socket);
               $socket = \*S2;
           }
           my $last_sel = select($socket); $| = 1; select($last_sel);
           print $socket $request_headers;
           ...

       Note:  As  far  as  I  know  you  must  be  careful  with  the  globs  in  the tie() function.  The first parameter must be a glob (*SOMETHING) and the last parameter must be a reference to a glob
       (\*SOMETHING_ELSE) or a scaler that was assigned to a reference to a glob (as in the example above)

       Also, the two globs must be different.  When I tried to use the same glob, I got a core dump.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

       You can export the shutdown() function.

       It is suggested that you do export shutdown() or use the fully qualified Net::SSLeay::Handle::shutdown() function to shutdown SSL sockets.  It should be smart enough to distinguish between SSL and
       non-SSL sockets and do the right thing.

EXAMPLES
         use Net::SSLeay::Handle qw/shutdown/;
         my ($host, $port) = ("localhost", 443);

         tie(*SSL, "Net::SSLeay::Handle", $host, $port);

         print SSL "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n";
         shutdown(\*SSL, 1);
         print while (<SSL>);
         close SSL;

TODO
       Better error handling.  Callback routine?

CAVEATS
       Tying to a file handle is a little tricky (for me at least).

       The first parameter to tie() must be a glob (*SOMETHING) and the last parameter must be a reference to a glob (\*SOMETHING_ELSE) or a scaler that was assigned to  a  reference  to  a  glob  ($s  =
       \*SOMETHING_ELSE).  Also, the two globs must be different.  When I tried to use the same glob, I got a core dump.

       I was able to associate attributes to globs created by this module (like *SSL above) by making a hash of hashes keyed by the file head1.
