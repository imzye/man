NAME
       index.sense, sense.idx - WordNet's sense index

DESCRIPTION
       The WordNet sense index provides an alternate method for accessing synsets and word senses in the WordNet database.  It is useful to applications that retrieve synsets or other information related
       to a specific sense in WordNet, rather than all the senses of a word or collocation.  It can also be used with tools like grep and Perl to find all senses of a word in one or more parts of speech.
       A  specific  WordNet  sense, encoded as a sense_key, can be used as an index into this file to obtain its WordNet sense number, the database byte offset of the synset containing the sense, and the
       number of times it has been tagged in the semantic concordance texts.

       Concatenating the lemma and lex_sense fields of a semantically tagged word (represented in a <wf ... > attribute/value pair) in a semantic concordance file, using % as the concatenation character,
       creates the sense_key for that sense, which can in turn be used to search the sense index file.

       A sense_key is the best way to represent a sense in semantic tagging or other systems that refer to WordNet senses.  sense_keys are independent of WordNet sense numbers and  synset_offsets,  which
       vary  between  versions  of  the database.  Using the sense index and a sense_key, the corresponding synset (via the synset_offset) and WordNet sense number can easily be obtained.  A mapping from
       noun sense_keys in WordNet 1.6 to corresponding 2.0 sense_keys is provided with version 2.0, and is described in sensemap(5WN).

       See wndb(5WN) for a thorough discussion of the WordNet database files.

   File Format
       The sense index file lists all of the senses in the WordNet database with each line representing one sense.  The file is in alphabetical order, fields are separated by one space, and each line  is
       terminated with a newline character.

       Each line is of the form:

              sense_key  synset_offset  sense_number  tag_cnt

       sense_key  is an encoding of the word sense.  Programs can construct a sense key in this format and use it as a binary search key into the sense index file.  The format of a sense_key is described
       below.

       synset_offset is the byte offset that the synset containing the sense is found at in the database "data" file corresponding to the part of speech encoded in the sense_key.  synset_offset is  an  8
       digit, zero-filled decimal integer, and can be used with fseek(3) to read a synset from the data file.  When passed to the WordNet library function read_synset() along with the syntactic category,
       a data structure containing the parsed synset is returned.

       sense_number  is  a decimal integer indicating the sense number of the word, within the part of speech encoded in sense_key, in the WordNet database.  See wndb(5WN) for information about how sense
       numbers are assigned.

       tag_cnt represents the decimal number of times the sense is tagged in various semantic concordance texts.  A tag_cnt of 0 indicates that the sense has not been semantically tagged.

   Sense Key Encoding
       A sense_key is represented as:

              lemma%lex_sense

       where lex_sense is encoded as:

              ss_type:lex_filenum:lex_id:head_word:head_id

       lemma is the ASCII text of the word or collocation as found in the WordNet database index file corresponding to pos.  lemma is in lower case, and collocations  are  formed  by  joining  individual
       words with an underscore (_) character.

       ss_type is a one digit decimal integer representing the synset type for the sense.  See Synset Type below for a listing of the numbers corresponding to each synset type.

       lex_filenum  is  a  two  digit  decimal integer representing the name of the lexicographer file containing the synset for the sense.  See lexnames(5WN) for the list of lexicographer file names and
       their corresponding numbers.

       lex_id is a two digit decimal integer that, when appended onto lemma, uniquely identifies a sense within a lexicographer file.  lex_id numbers usually start with 00, and are incremented  as  addi‐
       tional  senses  of the word are added to the same file, although there is no requirement that the numbers be consecutive or begin with 00.  Note that a value of 00 is the default, and therefore is
       not present in lexicographer files.  Only non-default lex_id values must be explicitly assigned in lexicographer files.  See wninput(5WN) for information on the format of lexicographer files.

       head_word is only present if the sense is in an adjective satellite synset.  It is the lemma of the first word of the satellite's head synset.

       head_id is a two digit decimal integer that, when appended onto head_word, uniquely identifies the sense of head_word within a lexicographer file, as described for lex_id.  There  is  a  value  in
       this field only if head_word is present.

   Synset Type
       The synset type is encoded as follows:

              1    NOUN
              2    VERB
              3    ADJECTIVE
              4    ADVERB
              5    ADJECTIVE SATELLITE

NOTES
       For non-satellite senses the head_word and head_id fields have no values, however the field separator character (:) is present.
