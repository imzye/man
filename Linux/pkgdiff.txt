NAME
       pkgdiff - a tool for visualizing changes in Linux software packages

DESCRIPTION
   NAME:
              Package Changes Analyzer A tool for visualizing changes in Linux software packages

   DESCRIPTION:
              Package Changes Analyzer (PkgDiff) is a tool for visualizing changes in Linux software packages (RPM, DEB, TAR.GZ, etc).

              The tool can compare directories as well (with the help of the -d option).

              The tool is intended for Linux maintainers who are interested in ensuring compatibility of old and new versions of packages.

              This tool is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU GPL.

   USAGE:
              pkgdiff PKG1 PKG2 [options] pkgdiff -d DIR1/ DIR2/ [options]

   EXAMPLES:
              pkgdiff OLD.rpm NEW.rpm pkgdiff OLD.deb NEW.deb pkgdiff OLD.tar.gz NEW.tar.gz

   ARGUMENTS:
              PKG1

              Path to the old version of a package (RPM, DEB, TAR.GZ, etc).

              If you need to analyze a group of packages then you can pass an XML-descriptor of this group (VERSION.xml file):

              <version>

              /* Group version */

              </version>

              <group>

              /* Group name */

              </group>

              <packages>

              /path1/to/package(s) /path2/to/package(s) ...

              </packages>

              PKG2

              Path to the new version of a package (RPM, DEB, TAR.GZ, etc).

   INFORMATION OPTIONS:

       -h|-help

              Print this help.

       -v|-version

              Print version information.

       -dumpversion

              Print the tool version (1.8) and don't do anything else.

   GENERAL OPTIONS:

       -report-path PATH

              Path to the report.  Default:

              pkgdiff_reports/<pkg>/<v1>_to_<v2>/changes_report.html

       -details

              Try to create detailed reports.

       -size-limit SIZE

              Don't analyze files larger than SIZE in kilobytes.

       -width WIDTH

              Width of the Visual Diff.  Default: 80

       -prelines NUM

              Size of the context in the Visual Diff.  Default: 10

       -ignore-space-change
