NAME
       binfmtcxx-interpreter - binfmt_misc C++ handler

SYNOPSIS
       binfmtcxx-interpreter C++-source-file-name [command-line opions ...]

DESCRIPTION
       binfmtcxx-interpreter compiles a C++ source file specified on the command-line using C++ compiler, and executes the resulting file.

       It is designed to be used as a handler for binfmt_misc handler, which is a system used in Linux for handling arbitrary files as executables.

       The command-line options are passed on to the compiled binary.

FILE MAGIC
       There is a requirement for C++ source files to have the magic characters /*BINFMTCXX: at the beginning of the file.

       That line also is used to specify the additional command-line options for C++ compiler.

ENVIRONMENT
       GXX    The compiler used.  The default is to use g++

       CXX    The compiler used, if GXX variable is not set.

              Will fall back to using GCC and CC

       BINFMTCTMPDIR

              Temporary directory used for binary and execution.

              Falls back to $TMPDIR $TEMPDIR or /tmp

       BINFMTC_DEBUG
              enables debug output if set.

       BINFMTCXX_GXX_OPTS
              Additional G++ options.  Use BINFMTC_DEBUG to verify the options being passed on to g++.

              The default is  -O0 -Wall -g
