NAME
       XPresentNotifyMSC - X Present Extension

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/extensions/Xpresent.h>

       void XPresentNotifyMSC (Display *display,
            Window window,
            uint32_t serial,
            uint64_t target_msc,
            uint64_t divisor,
            uint64_t remainder);

DESCRIPTION
       XPresentNotifyMSC  requests  that  the X server specified by display deliver a PresentCompleteNotifyEvent with kind PresentCompleteKindNotifyMSC after the time specified by target-msc, divisor and
       remainder.

       serial is an arbitrary client-specified value which will be returned in the event so that the client can associate the event and request.

       If target-msc is greater than the current Media Stream Counter (msc) for window, the event will be delivered at (or after) the target-msc field. Otherwise, the event delivery will occur after  the
       next field where msc % divisor == remainder.

       If window is destroyed before the event is delivered, then the event delivery will not be completed.
