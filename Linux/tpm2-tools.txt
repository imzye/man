NAME
       tss2_setdescription(1)

SYNOPSIS
       tss2_setdescription [OPTIONS]

SEE ALSO
       fapi-config(5) to adjust Fapi parameters like the used cryptographic profile and TCTI or directories for the Fapi metadata storages.

       fapi-profile(5) to determine the cryptographic algorithms and parameters for all keys and operations of a specific TPM interaction like the name hash algorithm, the asymmetric signature algorithm,
       scheme and parameters and PCR bank selection.

DESCRIPTION
       tss2_setdescription(1)  -  This command allows an application to assign a human readable description to an object in the FAPI metadata store.  The stored data can be returned with tss2_getdescrip‐
       tion.  Previously stored data is overwritten by this function.  If an empty description is passed in, the stored data is deleted.

OPTIONS
       These are the available options:

       • -i, --description=STRING:

         The data to be stored as description for the object.  Optional parameter.  Previously stored descriptions are overwritten by this function.  If omitted any stored description is deleted.

       • -p, --path=STRING:

         The path of the object for which the description will be stored.

COMMON OPTIONS
       This collection of options are common to all tss2 programs and provide information that many users may expect.

       • -h, --help [man|no-man]: Display the tools manpage.  By default, it attempts to invoke the manpager for the tool, however, on failure will output a short tool summary.  This is the same behavior
         if the “man” option argument is specified, however if explicit “man” is requested, the tool will provide errors from man on stderr.  If the “no-man” option if specified, or the  manpager  fails,
         the short options will be output to stdout.

         To successfully use the manpages feature requires the manpages to be installed or on MANPATH, See man(1) for more details.

       • -v, --version: Display version information for this tool, supported tctis and exit.

EXAMPLE
              tss2_setdescription --path=HS/SRK --description=description

RETURNS
       0 on success or 1 on failure.
