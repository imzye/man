NAME
       ipcress - In-silico PCR experiment simulation system

SYNOPSIS
       ipcress [ options ] <primer file> <sequence paths>

DESCRIPTION
       ipcress is the In-silico PCR Experiment Simulation System.

       This is a tool for simulation of PCR experiments.  You supply a file containing primers and a set of sequences, and it predicts PCR products.

       Ipcress is similar to the e-PCR program from the NCBI, but is much faster, and does not suffer from problems identifying matches when there are ambiguity symbols near primer ends.

       If  you supply many primers pairs together, ipcress will simulate the PCR experiments in parallel, allowing genome wide simulation of large numbers of experiments.  It uses many libraries from the ex‐
       onerate sequence comparison tool.

INPUT FORMAT
       The input for ipcress is a simple white-space delimited file describing one experiment per line.  Each line contains the following 5 fields:

              id                An identifier for this experiment
              primer_A          Sequence for the first primer
              primer_B          Sequence for the second primer
              min_product_len   Minimum product length to report
              max_product_len   Maximum product length to report

       Here is an example line in this format:

       ID0001 CATGCATGCATGC CGATGCANGCATGCT 900 1100

OUTPUT FORMAT
       The output format describes one PCR product per-line,
              and is prefixed by "ipcress:", followed by the following 11 fields:

              sequence_id     The sequence identifier
              experiment_id   The PCR experiment id
              product_length  The PCR product length
              primer_5        The 5' primer (either A or B)
              pos_5           Position of the 5' primer
              mismatch_5      Number of mismatches on 5' primer
              primer_3        |
              pos_3           | Same fields for the 3' primer
              mismatch_3      |
              description     A description of the PCR product

       The description field is one of the following 4 strings:

              forward   Normal product, primer A followed by B
              revcomp   Normal product, primer B followed by A
              single_A  Bad product generated by primer_A only
              single_B  Bad product generated by primer_B only

       There is also a human-readable output displayed, is not designed for parsing (see: --pretty below).

GENERAL OPTIONS
       Most arguments have short and long forms.  The long forms
              are more likely to be stable over time, and hence should be used in scripts which call ipcress.

       -h | --shorthelp <boolean>
              Show help.  This will display a concise summary of the available options, defaults and values currently set.

       --help <boolean>
              This shows all the help options including the defaults, the value currently set, and the environment variable which may be used to set each parameter.  There will be an indication of which  op‐
              tions  are mandatory.  Mandatory options have no default, and must have a value supplied for ipcress to run.  If mandatory options are used in order, their flags may be skipped from the command
              line (see examples below).  Unlike this man page, the information from this option will always be up to date with the latest version of the program.

       -v | --version <boolean>
              Display the version number.  Also displays other information such as the build date and glib version used.

FILE INPUT OPTIONS
       -i | --input  <path>
              PCR experiment data in the ipcress file format described above.

       -s | --sequence <paths>
              Specify the sequences.  Multiple files may be specified here, which reduces the FSM building overhead, and makes ipcress run faster than running the process separately.

IPCRESS PARAMETERS
       -m | --mismatch  <mismatches>
              Specify the number of mismatches allowed per primer.  Allowing mismatches reduces the speed of the program as a large primer neighbourhood must be constructed, and fewer experiments can be fit‐
              ted in memory prior to each scan of the sequence databases.

       -M | --memory <Mb>
              Specify the amount of memory the program should use.  The more memory made available ipcress, the faster it will run, as more PCR experiments can be conducted in each scan of the sequence data‐
              bases.  This does not include memory used during the scan (for storing partial results and sequences), so the actual amount of memory used will be slightly higher.

       -p | --pretty <boolean>
              Display results in a human-readable format, not designed for parsing.

       -P | --products <boolean>
              Display PCR products as a FASTA format sequence.

       -S | --seed <length>
              Specifiy the seed length for the wordneighbourhood for the FSM.  If set to zero, the full primer is used.  Shorter words reduce the size of the neighbourhood, but increase  the  time  taken  by
              ipcress to filter false positive matches.

ENVIRONMENT
       Not documented yet.

EXAMPLES
       ipcress test.ipcress sequence.fasta
              This is the simplest way that ipcress can be used.
       ipcress dbsts_human.ipcress --sequence ncbi30/*.fasta --mismatch 1
              Compare a input file against a set of fasta files, allowing one mismatch in each primer.
