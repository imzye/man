FUNCTIONS
       int lgGpiochipOpen(int gpioDev)

           This returns a handle to a gpiochip device.

           gpioDev: >= 0

           If OK returns a handle (>= 0).

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Example

           h = lgGpiochipOpen(0); // open /dev/gpiochip0

           if (h >= 0)
           {
              // open ok
           }
           else
           {
              // open error
           }

       int lgGpiochipClose(int handle)

           This closes an opened gpiochip device.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Example

           status = lgGpiochipClose(h); // close gpiochip

           if (status < 0)
           {
              // close failed
           }

       int lgGpioGetChipInfo(int handle, lgChipInfo_p chipInfo)

           This returns information about a gpiochip.

             handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
           chipInfo: A pointer to space for a lgChipInfo_t object

           If OK returns 0 and updates chipInfo.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           This command gets the number of GPIO on the gpiochip, its name, and its usage.

           Example

           lgChipInfo_t cInfo;

           status = lgGpioGetChipInfo(h, &cInfo);

           if (status == LG_OKAY)
           {
              printf("lines=%d name=%s label=%s0,
                 cInfo.lines, cInfo.name, cInfo.label))
           }

       int lgGpioGetLineInfo(int handle, int gpio, lgLineInfo_p lineInfo)

           Returns information about a GPIO.

             handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
               gpio: >= 0, as legal for the gpiochip
           lineInfo: A pointer to space for a lgLineInfo_t object

           If OK returns 0 and updates lineInfo.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           This command gets information for a GPIO of a gpiochip.  In particular it gets the GPIO number, flags, its user, and its purpose.

           The meaning of the flags bits are as given for the mode by lgGpioGetMode.

           The user and purpose fields are filled in by the software which has claimed the GPIO and may be blank.

           Example

           lgLineInfo_t lInfo;

           status = lgGpioGetLineInfo(h, gpio, &lInfo);

           if (status == LG_OKAY)
           {
              printf("lFlags=%d name=%s user=%s0,
                 lInfo.lFlags, lInfo.name, lInfo.user))
           }

       int lgGpioGetMode(int handle, int gpio)

           Returns the GPIO mode.

             handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
               gpio: >= 0, as legal for the gpiochip

           If OK returns the GPIO mode.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           19    1<<19   Kernel: Realtime clock alert

           The LG bits are only set if the query was made by the process that owns the GPIO.

       int lgGpioSetUser(int handle, const char *gpiouser)

           This sets the user string to be associated with each claimed GPIO.

             handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
           gpiouser: a string up to 32 characters long

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Example

           status = lgGpioSetUser(h, "my_title");

       int lgGpioClaimInput(int handle, int lFlags, int gpio)

           This claims a GPIO for input.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
           lFlags: line flags for the GPIO
             gpio: the GPIO to be claimed

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The line flags may be used to set the GPIO as active low, open drain, or open source.

           Example

           // open GPIO 23 for input
           status = lgGpioClaimInput(h, 0, 23);

       int lgGpioClaimOutput(int handle, int lFlags, int gpio, int level)

           This claims a GPIO for output.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
           lFlags: line flags for the GPIO
             gpio: the GPIO to be claimed
            level: the initial level to set for the GPIO

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The line flags may be used to set the GPIO as active low, open drain, or open source.

           If level is zero the GPIO will be initialised low.  If any other value is used the GPIO will be initialised high.

           Example

           // open GPIO 31 for high output
           status = lgGpioClaimOutput(h, 0, 31, 1);

       int lgGpioClaimAlert(int handle, int lFlags, int eFlags, int gpio, int nfyHandle)

           This claims a GPIO for alerts on level changes.

              handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
              lFlags: line flags for the GPIO
              eFlags: event flags for the GPIO
                gpio: >= 0, as legal for the gpiochip
           nfyHandle: >= 0 (as returned by lgNotifyOpen)

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The line flags may be used to set the GPIO as active low, open drain, or open source.

           The event flags are used to specify alerts for a rising edge, falling edge, or both edges.

           The alerts will be sent to a previously opened notification. If you don't want them sent to a notification set nfyHandle to -1.

           The alerts will also be sent to any callback registered for the GPIO by lgGpioSetAlertsFunc.

           All GPIO alerts are also sent to a callback registered by lgGpioSetSamplesFunc.

           Example

           status = lgGpioClaimAlert(h, 0, LG_BOTH_EDGES, 16, -1);

       int lgGpioFree(int handle, int gpio)

           This frees a GPIO.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
             gpio: the GPIO to be freed

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The GPIO may now be claimed by another user or for a different purpose.

           Example

           status = lgGpioFree(h, 16);

       int lgGroupClaimInput(int handle, int lFlags, int count, const int *gpios)

           This claims a group of GPIO for inputs.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
           lFlags: line flags for the GPIO group
            count: the number of GPIO to claim
            gpios: the group GPIO

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The line flags may be used to set the group as active low, open drain, or open source.

           gpios is an array of one or more GPIO.  The first GPIO is called the group leader and is used to reference the group as a whole.

           Example

           int buttons[4] = {9, 7, 2, 6};

           status = lgGroupClaimInput(h, 0, 4, buttons);

           if (status == LG_OKAY)
           {
              // OK
           }
           else
           {
              // Error
           }

       int lgGroupClaimOutput(int handle, int lFlags, int count, const int *gpios, const int *levels)

           This claims a group of GPIO for outputs.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
           lFlags: line flags for the GPIO group
            count: the number of GPIO to claim
            gpios: the group GPIO
           levels: the initial level for each GPIO

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The line flags may be used to set the group as active low, open drain, or open source.

           gpios is an array of one or more GPIO.  The first GPIO is called the group leader and is used to reference the group as a whole.

           levels  is  an  array  of initialisation values for the GPIO. If a value is zero the corresponding GPIO will be initialised low.  If any other value is used the corresponding GPIO will be
           initialised high.

           Example

           int leds[7] =   {15, 16, 17, 8, 12, 13, 14};
           int levels[7] = { 1,  0,  1, 1,  1,  0,  0};

           status = lgGroupClaimInput(h, 0, 7, leds, levels);

           if (status == LG_OKAY)
           {
              // OK
           }
           else
           {
              // Error
           }

       int lgGroupFree(int handle, int gpio)

           This frees all the GPIO associated with a group.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
             gpio: the group to be freed

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The GPIO may now be claimed by another user or for a different purpose.

           Example

           status = lgGroupFree(9); // free buttons

       int lgGpioRead(int handle, int gpio)

           This returns the level of a GPIO.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
             gpio: the GPIO to be read

           If OK returns 0 (low) or 1 (high).

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           This command will work for any claimed GPIO (even if a member of a group).  For an output GPIO the value returned will be that last written to the GPIO.

           Example

           level = lgGpioRead(h, 15); // get level of GPIO 15

       int lgGpioWrite(int handle, int gpio, int level)

           This sets the level of an output GPIO.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
             gpio: the GPIO to be written
            level: the level to set

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           This command will work for any GPIO claimed as an output (even if a member of a group).

           If level is zero the GPIO will be set low (0).  If any other value is used the GPIO will be set high (1).

           Example

           status = lgGpioWrite(h, 23, 1); // set GPIO 23 high

       int lgGroupRead(int handle, int gpio, uint64_t *groupBits)

           This returns the levels read from a group.

              handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
                gpio: the group to be read
           groupBits: a pointer to a 64-bit memory area for the returned levels

           If OK returns the group size and updates groupBits.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           This command will work for an output group as well as an input group.  For an output group the value returned will be that last written to the group GPIO.

           Note that this command will also work on an individual GPIO claimed as an input or output as that is treated as a group with one member.

           After a successful read groupBits is set as follows.

           Bit 0 is the level of the group leader.
           Bit 1 is the level of the second GPIO in the group.
           Bit x is the level of GPIO x+1 of the group.

           Example

           // assuming a read group of 4 buttons: 9, 7, 2, 6.
           uint64_t bits;

           size = lgGroupRead(h, 9, &bits); // 9 is buttons group leader

           if (size >= 0) // size of group is returned so size will be 4
           {
              level_9 = (bits >> 0) & 1;
              level_7 = (bits >> 1) & 1;
              level_2 = (bits >> 2) & 1;
              level_6 = (bits >> 3) & 1;
           }
           else
           {
              // error
           }

       int lgGroupWrite(int handle, int gpio, uint64_t groupBits, uint64_t groupMask)

           This sets the levels of an output group.

              handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
                gpio: the group to be written
           groupBits: the level to set if the corresponding bit in groupMask is set
           groupMask: a mask indicating the group GPIO to be updated

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The values of each GPIO of the group are set according to the bits
           of groupBits.

           Bit 0 sets the level of the group leader.
           Bit 1 sets the level of the second GPIO in the group.
           Bit x sets the level of GPIO x+1 in the group.

           However this may be modified by the groupMask.  A GPIO is only updated if the corresponding bit in the mask is 1.

           Example

           // assuming an output group of 7 LEDs: 15, 16, 17, 8, 12, 13, 14.

           // switch on all LEDs
           status = lgGroupWrite(h, 15, 0x7f, 0x7f);

           // switch off all LEDs
           status = lgGroupWrite(h, 15, 0x00, 0x7f);

           // switch on first 4 LEDs, leave others unaltered
           status = lgGroupWrite(h, 15, 0x0f, 0x0f);

           // switch on LED attached to GPIO 13, leave others unaltered
           status = lgGroupWrite(h, 15, 32, 32);

       int lgTxPulse(int handle, int gpio, int pulseOn, int pulseOff, int pulseOffset, int pulseCycles)

           This starts software timed pulses on an output GPIO.

                handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
                  gpio: the GPIO to be written
               pulseOn: pulse high time in microseconds
              pulseOff: pulse low time in microseconds
           pulseOffset: offset from nominal pulse start position
           pulseCycles: the number of pulses to be sent, 0 for infinite

           If OK returns the number of entries left in the PWM queue for the GPIO.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           If both pulseOn and pulseOff are zero pulses will be switched off for that GPIO.  The active pulse, if any, will be stopped and any queued pulses will be deleted.

           Each successful call to this function consumes one PWM queue entry.

           pulseCycles cycles are transmitted (0 means infinite).  Each cycle consists of pulseOn microseconds of GPIO high followed by pulseOff microseconds of GPIO low.

           PWM is characterised by two values, its frequency (number of cycles per second) and its duty cycle (percentage of high time per cycle).

           The set frequency will be 1000000 / (pulseOn + pulseOff) Hz.

           The set duty cycle will be pulseOn / (pulseOn + pulseOff) * 100 %.

           E.g. if pulseOn is 50 and pulseOff is 100 the frequency will be 6666.67 Hz and the duty cycle will be 33.33 %.

           pulseOffset is a microsecond offset from the natural start of the PWM cycle.

           For instance if the PWM frequency is 10 Hz the natural start of each cycle is at seconds 0, then 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc.  In this case if the offset is 20000 microseconds the cycle will  start
           at seconds 0.02, 0.12, 0.22, 0.32 etc.

           Another pulse command may be issued to the GPIO before the last has finished.

           If  the  last pulse had infinite cycles then it will be replaced by the new settings at the end of the current cycle. Otherwise it will be replaced by the new settings when all its cycles
           are compete.

           Multiple pulse settings may be queued in this way.

           Example

           slots_left = lgTxPulse(h,  8, 100000, 100000, 0, 0); // flash LED at 5 Hz

           slots_left = lgTxPulse(h, 30, 1500, 18500, 0, 0); // move servo to centre

           slots_left = lgTxPulse(h, 30, 2000, 18000, 0, 0); // move servo clockwise

       int lgTxPwm(int handle, int gpio, float pwmFrequency, float pwmDutyCycle, int pwmOffset, int pwmCycles)

           This starts software timed PWM on an output GPIO.

                 handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
                   gpio: the GPIO to be pulsed
           pwmFrequency: PWM frequency in Hz (0=off, 0.1-10000)
           pwmDutyCycle: PWM duty cycle in % (0-100)
              pwmOffset: offset from nominal pulse start position
              pwmCycles: the number of pulses to be sent, 0 for infinite

           If OK returns the number of entries left in the PWM queue for the GPIO.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Each successful call to this function consumes one PWM queue entry.

           PWM is characterised by two values, its frequency (number of cycles per second) and its duty cycle (percentage of high time per cycle).

           Another PWM command may be issued to the GPIO before the last has finished.

           If the last pulse had infinite cycles then it will be replaced by the new settings at the end of the current cycle. Otherwise it will be replaced by the new settings when all  its  cycles
           are complete.

           Multiple PWM settings may be queued in this way.

       int lgTxServo(int handle, int gpio, int pulseWidth, int servoFrequency, int servoOffset, int servoCycles)

           This starts software timed servo pulses on an output GPIO.

           I would only use software timed servo pulses for testing purposes.  The timing jitter will cause the servo to fidget.  This may cause it to overheat and wear out prematurely.

                   handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
                     gpio: the GPIO to be pulsed
               pulseWidth: pulse high time in microseconds (0=off, 500-2500)
           servoFrequency: the number of pulses per second (40-500).
              servoOffset: offset from nominal pulse start position
              servoCycles: the number of pulses to be sent, 0 for infinite

           If OK returns the number of entries left in the PWM queue for the GPIO.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Each successful call to this function consumes one PWM queue entry.

           Another servo command may be issued to the GPIO before the last has finished.

           If  the  last pulse had infinite cycles then it will be replaced by the new settings at the end of the current cycle. Otherwise it will be replaced by the new settings when all its cycles
           are compete.

           Multiple servo settings may be queued in this way.

       int lgTxWave(int handle, int gpio, int count, lgPulse_p pulses)

           This starts a wave on an output group of GPIO.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
             gpio: the group leader
            count: the number of pulses in the wave
           pulses: the pulses

           If OK returns the number of entries left in the wave queue for the group.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Each successful call to this function consumes one queue entry.

           This command starts a wave of pulses.

           pulses is an array of pulses to be transmitted on the group.

           Each pulse is defined by the following triplet:

           bits:  the levels to set for the selected GPIO
           mask:  the GPIO to select
           delay: the delay in microseconds before the next pulse

           Another wave command may be issued to the group before the last has finished transmission. The new wave will start when the previous wave has competed.

           Multiple waves may be queued in this way.

           Example

           #include <stdio.h>

           #include <lgpio.h>

           #define PULSES 2000

           int main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
              int GPIO[] =   {16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21};
              int levels[] = { 1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1};
              int h;
              int e;
              int mask;
              int delay;
              int p;
              lgPulse_t pulses[PULSES];

              h = lgGpiochipOpen(0); // open /dev/gpiochip0

              if (h < 0) { printf("ERROR: %s (%d)0, lguErrorText(h), h); return 1; }

              e =  lgGroupClaimOutput(h, 0, 6, GPIO, levels);

              if (e < 0) { printf("ERROR: %s (%d)0, lguErrorText(e), e); return 1; }

              mask = 0;
              p = 0;

              for (p=0; p<PULSES; p++)
              {
                 pulses[p].bits = (p+1)>>2;  // see what sort of pattern we get
                 pulses[p].mask = mask;      // with bits and mask changing
                 pulses[p].delay = (PULSES + 500) - p;

                 if (++mask > 0x3f) mask = 0;
              }

              lgTxWave(h, GPIO[0], p, pulses);

              while (lgTxBusy(h, GPIO[0], LG_TX_WAVE)) lguSleep(0.1);

              lgGpiochipClose(h);
           }

       int lgTxBusy(int handle, int gpio, int kind)

           This returns true if transmissions of the specified kind are active on the GPIO or group.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
             gpio: the gpio or group to be checked
             kind: LG_TX_PWM or LG_TX_WAVE

           If OK returns 1 for busy and 0 for not busy.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Example

           while (lgTxBusy(h, 15, LG_TX_PWM)) // wait for PWM to finish on GPIO 15
              lguSleep(0.1);

       int lgTxRoom(int handle, int gpio, int kind)

           This returns the number of entries available for queueing transmissions of the specified kind on the GPIO or group.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
             gpio: the gpio or group to be checked
             kind: LG_TX_PWM or LG_TX_WAVE

           If OK returns the number of free entries (0 if none).

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Example

           while (lgTxRoom(h, 17, LG_TX_WAVE) > 0))
           {
              // queue another wave
           }

       int lgGpioSetDebounce(int handle, int gpio, int debounce_us)

           This sets the debounce time for a GPIO.

                handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
                  gpio: the GPIO to be configured
           debounce_us: the debounce time in microseconds

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           This only affects alerts.

           An alert will only be issued if the edge has been stable for at least debounce microseconds.

           Generally this is used to debounce mechanical switches (e.g. contact bounce).

           Suppose that a square wave at 5 Hz is being generated on a GPIO.  Each edge will last 100000 microseconds.  If a debounce time of 100001 is set no alerts will be generated,  If a debounce
           time of 99999 is set 10 alerts will be generated per second.

           Note that level changes will be timestamped debounce microseconds after the actual level change.

           Example

           lgSetDebounceTime(h, 16, 1000); // set a millisecond of debounce

       int lgGpioSetWatchdog(int handle, int gpio, int watchdog_us)

           This sets the watchdog time for a GPIO.

                handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
                  gpio: the GPIO to be configured
           watchdog_us: the watchdog time in microseconds

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           This only affects alerts.

           A watchdog alert will be sent if no edge alert has been issued for that GPIO in the previous watchdog microseconds.

           Note that only one watchdog alert will be sent per stream of edge alerts.  The watchdog is reset by the sending of a new edge alert.

           The level is set to LG_TIMEOUT (2) for a watchdog alert.

           Example

           lgSetWatchdogTime(h, 17, 200000); // alert if nothing for 0.2 seconds

       int lgGpioSetAlertsFunc(int handle, int gpio, lgGpioAlertsFunc_t cbf, void *userdata)

           This sets up a callback to be called when an alert GPIO changes state.

             handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgGpiochipOpen)
               gpio: the GPIO to be monitored
                cbf: the callback function
           userdata: a pointer to arbitrary user data

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <inttypes.h>

           {
              int i;
              int userdata = *(int*)data;

              for (i=0; i<e; i++)
              {
                 printf("u=%d t=%"PRIu64" c=%d g=%d l=%d f=%d (%d of %d)0,
                    userdata, evt[i].report.timestamp, evt[i].report.chip,
                    evt[i].report.gpio, evt[i].report.level,
                    evt[i].report.flags, i+1, e);
              }
           }

           int main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
              int h;
              int e;
              static int userdata=123;

              h = lgGpiochipOpen(0);

              if (h < 0) { printf("ERROR: %s (%d)0, lguErrorText(h), h); return 1; }

              lgGpioSetAlertsFunc(h, GPIO, afunc, &userdata);

              e = lgGpioClaimAlert(h, 0, LG_BOTH_EDGES, 23, -1);

              if (e < 0) { printf("ERROR: %s (%d)0, lguErrorText(e), e); return 1; }

              lguSleep(10);

              lgGpiochipClose(h);
           }

       void lgGpioSetSamplesFunc(lgGpioAlertsFunc_t cbf, void *userdata)

           This sets up a callback to be called when any alert GPIO changes state.

                cbf: the callback function
           userdata: a pointer to arbitrary user data

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Note that no handle or gpio is specified.  The callback function will receive alerts for all gpiochips and gpio.

       int lgNotifyOpen(void)

           This function requests a free notification.

           If OK returns a handle (>= 0).

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           A notification is a method for being notified of GPIO state changes via a pipe or socket.

           The notification pipes are created in the library working directory (see lguGetWorkDir).

           Pipe notifications for handle x will be available at the pipe named .lgd-nfy* (where * is the handle number).  E.g. if the function returns 15 then the notifications  must  be  read  from
           .lgd-nfy15.

           Socket notifications are returned to the socket which requested the handle.

           Example

           h = lgNotifyOpen();

           if (h >= 0)
           {
              sprintf(str, ".lgd-nfy%d", h);

              fd = open(str, O_RDONLY);

              if (fd >= 0)
              {
                 // Okay.
              }
              else
              {
                 // Error.
              }
           }
           else
           {
              // Error.
           }

       int lgNotifyResume(int handle)

           This function restarts notifications on a paused notification.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgNotifyOpen)

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           The notification gets state changes for each associated GPIO.

           Each notification occupies 16 bytes in the fifo and has the following structure.

           typedef struct
           {
              uint64_t timestamp; // alert time in nanoseconds
              uint8_t chip;       // gpiochip device number
              uint8_t gpio;       // offset into gpio device
              uint8_t level;      // 0=low, 1=high, 2=timeout
              uint8_t flags;      // none currently defined
           } lgGpioReport_t;

           timestamp: the number of nanoseconds since the epoch (start of 1970) level: indicates the level of the GPIO
           flags: no flags are currently defined

           For future proofing it is probably best to ignore any notification with non-zero flags.

           Example

           // Start notifications for associated GPIO.
           lgNotifyResume(h);

       int lgNotifyPause(int handle)

           This function pauses notifications.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgNotifyOpen)

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Notifications are suspended until lgNotifyResume is called.

           Example

           lgNotifyPause(h);

       int lgNotifyClose(int handle)

           This function stops notifications and frees the handle for reuse.

           handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgNotifyOpen)

           If OK returns 0.

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           Example

           lgNotifyClose(h);

       int lgI2cOpen(int i2cDev, int i2cAddr, int i2cFlags)

           This returns a handle for the device at the address on the I2C bus.

             i2cDev: >= 0
            i2cAddr: 0-0x7F
           i2cFlags: 0

           If OK returns a handle (>= 0).

           On failure returns a negative error code.

           No flags are currently defined.  This parameter should be set to zero.

           This  function  executes  a sequence of I2C operations.  The operations to be performed are specified by the contents of txBuf which contains the concatenated command codes and associated
           data.

             handle: >= 0 (as returned by lgI2cOpen)
              txBuf: pointer to the concatenated I2C commands, see below
            txCount: size of command buffer

           Write     5 P ...      Write P bytes of data

           The address, read, and write commands take a parameter P.  Normally P is one byte (0-255).  If the command is preceded  by  the  Escape  command  then  P  is  two  bytes  (0-65535,  least
           significant byte first).

           The address defaults to that associated with the handle.  The flags default to 0.  The address and flags maintain their previous value until updated.

           The returned I2C data is stored in consecutive locations of rxBuf.

           Example

           Set address 0x53, write 0x32, read 6 bytes
           Set address 0x1E, write 0x03, read 6 bytes
           Set address 0x68, write 0x1B, read 8 bytes
