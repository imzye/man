NAME
       doodled - a daemon to keep your doodle database up-to-date

SYNOPSIS
       doodled [OPTIONS] [FILENAMES]*

DESCRIPTION
       doodled  monitors  your filesystem for changes and updates the doodle database to keep it always up-to-date with the latest data.  doodled is experimental at
       this point.  It uses libfam and is thus limited to monitoring less than 1024 directories for changes.

OPTIONS
       -d FILENAME, --database=FILENAME
              use FILENAME for the location of the database (use when building or searching).  This option is particularly useful when doodle is used to search dif‐
              ferent  types of files (or is operated with different extractor options).  Using this option doodle can be used to build specialized indices (i.e. one
              per file system), which can in turn improve search performance.  When searching, you can pass a colon-separated list of database file names,  in  that
              case  all  databases  are  searched.   Note that the disk-space consumption of a single database is typically slightly smaller than if the database is
              split into multiple files.  Nevertheless, the space-savings are likely to be small (a few percent).  You can also use  the environment  variable  DOO‐
              DLE_PATH to set the list of database files to search.  The option overrides the environment variable if both are used.  If the option is not given and
              DOODLE_PATH is not set, "/var/lib/doodle" is used.

       -D, --debug
              do not detach from the terminal (do not daemonize).  Also will print log messages to stderr if no logfile is specified.

       -f, --filenames
              include filenames (full path) in the set of keywords

       -h, --help
              print help page

       -l LIBRARIES, --library=LIBRARIES
              specify which libextractor plugins to use (for building the index with -b or for printing information about files with -e)

       -L FILENAME, --log=FILENAME
              log messages to the given logfile.

       -m LIMIT, --memory=LIMIT
              use at most LIMIT MB of memory for the nodes of the suffix-tree (after that, serialize to disk).  Note that a smaller value will  reduce  memory  con‐
              sumption but increase the size of the temporary file (and slow down indexing).  The default is 8 MB.

       -n, --nodefault
              do not load the default set of plugins (only load plugins specified with -l)

       -P PATH, --prunepaths=PATH
              Directories  to not put in the database, which would otherwise be. The environment variable PRUNEPATHS also sets this value. Default is "/tmp /usr/tmp
              /var/tmp /dev /proc /sys".  This option can also be used when searching, in which case search results in the specified directories will be ignored.

       -v, --version
              print the version number

       -V, --verbose
              be verbose

ENVIRONMENT
       DOODLE_PATH
              Colon-separated list of databases to search.  Note that when building the database this path must either only contain one filename or  the  option  -b
              must be used to specify the database file.  Default is "/var/lib/doodle".

       PRUNEPATHS
              Space-separated list of paths to exclude.  Can be overridden with the -P option.

       Doodle depends on GNU libextractor.  You can download libextractor from http://www.gnu.org/software/libextractor/.
