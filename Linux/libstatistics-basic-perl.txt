Statistics::Basic::Correlation(3pm)                                                 User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                 Statistics::Basic::Correlation(3pm)

NAME
       Statistics::Basic::Correlation - find the correlation between two lists

SYNOPSIS
       Invoke it this way:

           my $correlation = correlation( [1,2,3], [1,2,3] );

       Or this way:

           my $v1  = vector(1,2,3);
           my $v2  = vector(1,2,3);
           my $cor = corr($v1,$v2);

       And then either query the values or print them like so:

           print "The correlation between $v1 and $v2: $correlation\n";
           my $cq = $cor->query;
           my $c0 = 0+$correlation;

       Create a 20 point "moving" correlation like so:

           use Statistics::Basic qw(:all nofill);

           my $sth = $dbh->prepare("select col1,col2 from data where something");
           my $len = 20;
           my $cor = corr()->set_size($len);

           $sth->execute or die $dbh->errstr;
           $sth->bind_columns( my ($lhs, $rhs) ) or die $dbh->errstr;

           my $count = $len;
           while( $sth->fetch ) {
               $cor->insert( $lhs, $rhs );
               if( defined( my $c = $cor->query ) ) {
                   print "Correlation: $c\n";
               }

               # This would also work:
               # print "Correlation: $cor\n" if $cor->query_filled;
           }

METHODS
       This list of methods skips the methods inherited from Statistics::Basic::_TwoVectorBase (things like query(), insert(), and ginsert()).

       new()
           Create  a new Statistics::Basic::Correlation object.  This function takes two arguments -- which can either be arrayrefs or Statistics::Basic::Vector objects.  This function is called when the
           correlation() shortcut-function is called.

       query_covariance()
           Returns the Statistics::Basic::Covariance object used to calculate the correlation.

       query_vector1()
           Return the Statistics::Basic::Vector for the first vector.

       query_vector2()
           Return the Statistics::Basic::Vector object for the second vector.

       query_mean1()
           Returns the Statistics::Basic::Mean object for the first vector.

       query_mean2()
           Returns the Statistics::Basic::Mean object for the second vector.

OVERLOADS
       This object is overloaded.  It tries to return an appropriate string for the calculation or the value of the computation in numeric context.

       In boolean context, this object is always true (even when empty).
