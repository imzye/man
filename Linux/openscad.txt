NAME
       openscad - script file based graphical CAD environment

SYNOPSIS
       openscad [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the openscad command.

       openscad is a software for creating solid 3D CAD objects. It focuses on CAD aspects rather than artistic ones.

       OpenSCAD  will  start  as  a  graphical  program  unless  export  options are given (see below). For the usage of the GUI and a description of the OpenSCAD language see the OpenSCAD user manual at
       https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual.  A tutorial can be found at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_Tutorial.

OPTIONS
       -o outputfile
              Export the given file to outputfile in STL, OFF, AMF, 3MF, DXF, SVG, or PNG format, depending on file extension of outputfile. If this option is given, the GUI will not be started.

              Known extensions: stl, off, amf, 3mf, csg, dxf, svg, png, echo, ast, term, nef3, nefdbg.

              Additional formats, which are mainly used for debugging and testing (but can also be used in automation), are AST (the input file as parsed and serialized again), CSG (an OpenSCAD  language
              representation  of  the  input  file with calculations done and module calls applied), TERM (the constructive solid geometry expression passed to OpenCSG).  If outputfile is null, no output
              file will be written, but the file will still be evaluated and all echo commands will be written to the standard error output. (The rendering process will still take place if  the  --render
              option is given.)

       --export-format
              Overrides format of exported scad file when using option -o, arg can be any of its supported file extensions.

       -q     Quiet mode (don't print anything except errors)

       -d file.deps
              If the -d option is given, all files accessed while exporting are written to the given deps file in the syntax of a Makefile.

       -m make_command
              If a nonexisting file is accessed during OpenSCAD's operation, it will try to invoke make_command missing_file to create the missing file, and then read it again.

       -D var=val
              This option can be used to assign constant values to OpenSCAD variables. The variable's value is an expression, so if this mechanism is used to assign strings, care has to be taken that the
              shell does not consume quotation marks.  More than one -D option can be given.

       -p     Customizer parameter file.

       -p     Customizer parameter set.

       -v     Print version.

       --render
              If exporting an image, render the model fully. (Default is preview)

       --preview[=throwntogether]
              If exporting an image, use an OpenCSG preview (optionally in throwntogether mode for quicker rendering).

       --animate[=N]
              Export N animated frames as PNG images.

       --view[=axes|crosshairs|edges|scales|wireframe]
              View options

       --csglimit=limit
              If exporting an image as an OpenCSG preview, stop rendering after encountering limit elements to avoid runaway resource usage.

       --camera=transx,transy,transz,rotx,roty,rotz,distance
              If  exporting  an image, use a Gimbal camera with the given parameters.  Rot is rotation around the x, y, and z axis, trans is the distance to move the object in the x, y, and z directions,
              and distance is the distance between the camera and the center of the object.

       --camera=eyex,eyey,eyez,centerx,centery,centerz
              If exporting an image, use a Vector camera with the given parameters.  The first three are for the Eye position, while the next three are for the Center (or target)  that  the  camera  will
              look at. The 'up' vector is not currently supported.

       --viewall
              If exporting an image, adjust camera distance to fit the whole design in the frame

       --autocenter
              If exporting an image, center the design in the frame

       --imgsize=width,height
              If exporting an image, specify the pixel width and height

       --projection=[o|ortho|p|perspective]
              If exporting an image, specify whether to use orthographic or perspective projection

       --colorscheme=scheme
              If  exporting  an image, use the specified color scheme for the rendering.  scheme can be any of Cornfield, Sunset, Metallic, Starnight, BeforeDawn, Nature or DeepOcean Solarized, Tomorrow,
              Tomorrow 2, Tomorrow Night, Monotone.

       --hardwarnings
              Stop on the first warning

       --check-parameters=[true|false]
              Configure the parameter check for user modules and functions

       --check-parameter-ranges=[true|false]
              Configure the parameter range check for builtin modules

       --info Show which versions of libraries were used to compile the program, and which OpenGL details are discovered.

COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES
       Render example001.scad into the .stl format (raw triangle data):

       openscad -o example001.stl examples/example001.scad

       Compile a 2d image using a camera rotated 25 degrees in x and 35 in z, distance 500, with orthographic projection:

       openscad -o o.png o.scad --camera=0,0,0,25,0,35,500 --projection=ortho

       Set the 'mode' variable in example017 so that it will render only the parts of the shape. Export to a .dxf file.

       openscad -o example017.dxf -D'mode="parts"' examples/example017.scad
