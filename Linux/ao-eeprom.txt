NAME
       ao-eeprom - Analyze an eeprom log

SYNOPSIS
       ao-eeprom [--raw] [--csum] [--verbose] [--len <record-len>] {flight.eeprom} ...

OPTIONS
       -r | --raw
              This option makes ao-eeprom dump the raw bytes of each log record in hex format.

       -c | --csum
              This  option makes ao-eeprom dump records that have checksum errors. By default, ao-eeprom skips such records.  -v | --verbose This option makes ao-eeprom report when records are skipped due to
              checksum errors.  -l <record-len> | --len <record-len Specify the eeprom record length rather than letting ao-eeprom automatically determine it based on the file contents.

DESCRIPTION
       ao-eeprom reads the specified eeprom log and display the contents of each record.
