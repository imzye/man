NAME
       image2xy - Source extractor.

SYNOPSIS
       image2xy [options] fitsname.fits

DESCRIPTION
       Read a FITS file, find objects, and write out X, Y, FLUX to fitsname.xy.fits.

OPTIONS
       -e extension
              Read from a single FITS extension

       -O     Overwrite existing output file.

       -o file
              Write XYlist to given filename.

       -L order
              Lanczos order

       -8     Don't use optimization for byte (u8) images.

       -H     Downsample by a factor of 2 before running simplexy.

       -d factor
              Downsample by an integer factor before running simplexy.

       -D factor
              Downsample, if necessary, by this many factors of two.

       -s scale
              Set median-filter box size (default 100 pixels)

       -w width
              Set Gaussian PSF sigma (default 1 pixel)

       -g sigma
              Set image noise level

       -p significance
              Set significance level of peaks in sigmas (default 8 sigmas)

       -a saddle
              Set "saddle" level joining peaks i sigmas (default 5 sigmas)

       -P plane
              Pull out a single plane of a multi-color image (default: first plane)

       -b     Don't do (median-based) background subtraction

       -G background
              Subtract this 'global' background value; implies -b

       -m     Set maximum extended object size for deblending (default 2000 pixels)

       -S file
              Save background-subtracted image to this filename (FITS float image)

       -B file
              Save background image to filename

       -U file
              Save smoothed background-subtracted image to filename

       -M file
              Save mask image to filename

       -C file
              Save connected-components image to filename

       -v     Verbose. repeat for more and more verboseness

       image2xy 'file.fits[1]'
              Process first extension.

       image2xy 'file.fits[2]'
              Process second extension

       image2xy file.fits+2
              Same as above
