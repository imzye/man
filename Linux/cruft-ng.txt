NAME
       cruft - Check the filesystem for cruft (missing and unexplained files)

SYNOPSIS
       cruft [ FILE ]

DESCRIPTION
       cruft is a program that goes over the Debian packaging system's database, and compares the contents of that with the files actually on your system, and produces a summary of the differences.

OPTIONS
       If a file is provided, cruft-ng will analyze this single file and print matching package(s) name(s).
       Without any option, cruft-ng will analyze the whole system.

FILES
       A user can tune execution by providing extra configuration files:

       /etc/cruft/ignore
              Do not process paths listed in this file, this can speed-up matching.  Format is one line per path.  Example values: /var/schroot/, /var/www/ ...

       /etc/cruft/filters/*
              Rules (glob-patterns) similar that are similar to those built-in into cruft package.  The uppercase files are always processed, the lowercase ones are processed when matching package is in‐
              stalled.

       /etc/cruft/explain/*
              Shell  scripts  that will print-out a list of temporary file belonging to a package.  The uppercase files are always processed, the lowercase ones are processed when matching package is in‐
              stalled.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       It is possible to get some debugging information from cruft by setting the variable DEBUG.

CAVEAT
       The cleansing command apt purge '~c' should be run beforehand. Beware that this may cleanse old databases and currently unused settings you would have liked to preserve.
