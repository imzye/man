NAME
       edoc - Generate documentation as HTML or EEP-48 doc chunks.

Description
       This program is a command line entry point to both edoc:application/2 and edoc:files/2 functions. It also allows to generate just the EEP-48 doc chunks (using the -chunks flag) instead of the com‐
       plete HTML documentation.

edoc -app <var>app</var> [-chunks]
       EDoc is invoked via edoc:application/2, with the default set of options. If -chunks is given, then only doc chunks will be generated, not the full HTML documentation.

       Run the script with no arguments to get the full list of options.

edoc -files <var>erl_file</var>... [-chunks]
       EDoc is invoked via edoc:files/2, with the default set of options. If -chunks is given, then only doc chunks will be generated, not the full HTML documentation.

       Run the script with no arguments to get the full list of options.
