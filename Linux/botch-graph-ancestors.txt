BOTCH-GRAPH-ANCESTORS(1)                                                                          botch tools                                                                          BOTCH-GRAPH-ANCESTORS(1)

NAME
       botch-graph-ancestors - find all ancestors of a vertex in a graph in GraphML or dot format

SYNOPSIS
       botch-graph-ancestors [options] --target TARGET [--target TARGET ...] [ingraph] [outgraph]

DESCRIPTION
       Extract the subgraph of all ancestors of a specific node in the input graph.

       The --target option is mandatory and can be specified more than once.

       If either (or both) of the positional arguments is/are omitted, then read GraphML or dot from standard input and/or write GraphML or dot to standard output, respectively.  Passing a '-' as either
       argument, explicitly specifies to read the input from standard input and write the output to standard output, respectively.

       The input graph type will be determined automatically. If the output graph is given as a filename, then the output type will be GraphML if the filename ends with .xml and dot if the filename ends with
       .dot. If the output is done on standard output then it will happen in the same format as the input graph.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display help.

       --target=TARGET
           This option picks the target vertex of which the ancestors are computed. The TARGET argument is a key/value pair (separated by a colon) of a graph attribute and its desired value. If more than one
           vertex matches the given key/value pair, then the smallest (by node comparison) is chosen.

           The special key "__ID__" allows one to select the unique vertex identifier.

           This option can be specified more than once. The final set of vertices is chosen such that all vertices match all key/value pairs. Multiple --target options thus form a logical conjunction (they
           are AND-ed together).

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

EXAMPLE
       Extract the subgraph of all ancestors of a binary packages vertex with name "build-essential" and version "11.7".

         botch-graph-ancestors --target name:build-essential --target version:11.7 --target type:bin < in.xml > out.xml

       or giving input and output as positional arguments:

         botch-graph-ancestors --target name:build-essential --target version:11.7 --target type:bin in.xml out.xml

       Find all source packages that build depend on "texlive-binaries:amd64 (=2015.20150524.37493-5)".

       Using package selection and reverse dependency cone computation by ceve:

               dose-ceve -r "texlive-binaries:amd64 (= 2015.20150524.37493-5)" --deb-native-arch=amd64 -G pkg -T grml deb://Packages debsrc://Sources \
                       | botch-graph-sources - - \
                       | botch-graph2text - "{realpackage} (= {realversion})" --vertex type:src \
                       | sort

       Using package selection and ancestor vertex computation by botch:

               dose-ceve --deb-native-arch=amd64 -G pkg -T grml deb://Packages debsrc://Sources \
                       | botch-graph-ancestors --target realpackage:texlive-binaries:amd64 --target realversion:2015.20150524.37493-5 - - \
                       | botch-graph-sources - - \
                       | botch-graph2text - "{realpackage} (= {realversion})" --vertex type:src \
                       | sort
