NAME
       rstcheck - check syntax of reStructuredText files and nested code blocks

SYNOPSIS
       rstcheck [--config FILE] [-r] [--report LEVEL] [--ignore-language LANG] [--ignore-messages MSG] [--ignore-directives DIR] [--ignore-substitutions SUB] [--ignore-roles ROLES] FILE.rst [FILE.rst
                ...]

DESCRIPTION
       rstcheck validates the syntax of reStructuredText files and can also verify the syntax for a number of languages in nested code blocks:

       •      Bash

       •      Doctest

       •      C (C99)

       •      C++ (C++11)

       •      JSON

       •      XML

       •      Python

       •      restructuredTest

OPTIONS
       --config FILE
              load configuration from FILE.  The configuration is expected in INI file format with a section [rstcheck] and key-value pairs which correspond with command line options.

       -r, --recursive
              Treat input file names as directories and recursively check all .rst files within.

       --report LEVEL
              restrict reported severities to LEVEL or higher.  Valid levels in increasing order of severity are: info, warning, error, severe.  You can also specify none to suppress all output.

       --ignore-language LANG, --ignore LANG
              Ignore  code blocks with one of the languages LANG, where LANG is a comma-separated list of code block language identifiers. You can also disable language checking with a block comment such
              as

              .. rstcheck: ignore-language=cpp,python,rst

              near the beginning of the input file.

       --ignore-messages (MSG)
              Ignore all messages that match the regular expression MSG.  Note that you will probably need to quote the regex to prevent spurious shell expansion:

              "(Title underline too short.*|Duplicate implicit target.*)"

       --ignore-directivesDIR
              Ignore any rST directives from the comma-separated list DIR.

       --ignore-substitutionsSUB
              Ignore any rST substitutions from the comma-separated list SUB.

       --ignore-rolesROLES
              Ignore any rST roles from the comma-separated list ROLES.

INTEGRATION WITH VIM
       You can instruct Syntastic to check .rst files with rstcheck like this:

       let g:syntastic_rst_checkers = ['rstcheck']

       ALE will detect the presence of rstcheck automatically, no additional configuration is required.
