DICTION(1)                                                                                     User commands                                                                                     DICTION(1)

NAME
       diction - print wordy and commonly misused phrases in sentences

SYNOPSIS
       diction [-b] [-d] [-f file [-n|-L language]] [file...]
       diction [--beginner] [--ignore-double-words] [--file file [--no-default-file|--language language]] [file...]
       diction -h|--help
       diction --version

DESCRIPTION
       Diction  finds  all sentences in a document that contain phrases from a database of frequently misused, bad or wordy diction.  It further checks for double words.  If no files are given, the docu‐
       ment is read from standard input.  Each found phrase is enclosed in [ ] (brackets).  Suggestions and advice, if any and if asked for, are printed headed by a right arrow ->.  A sentence is  a  se‐
       quence  of words, that starts with a capitalised word and ends with a full stop, double colon, question mark or exclaimation mark.  A single letter followed by a dot is considered an abbreviation,
       so it does not terminate a sentence.  Various multi-letter abbreviations are recognized, they do not terminate a sentence as well, neither do fractional numbers.

       Diction understands cpp(1) #line lines for being able to give precise locations when printing sentences.

OPTIONS
       -b, --beginner
              Complain about mistakes typically made by beginners.

       -d, --ignore-double-words
              Ignore double words and do not complain about them.

       -s, --suggest
              Suggest better wording, if any.

       -f file, --file file
              Read the user specified database from the specified file in addition to the default database.

       -n, --no-default-file
              Do not read the default database, so only the user-specified database is used.

       -L language, --language language
              Set the phrase file language (de, en, nl).

       -h, --help
              Print a short usage message.

       --version
              Print the version.

ERRORS
       On usage errors, 1 is returned.  Termination caused by lack of memory is signalled by exit code 2.

EXAMPLE
       The following example first removes all roff constructs and headers from a document and feeds the result to diction with a German database:

              deroff -s file.mm | diction -L de | fmt

ENVIRONMENT
       LC_MESSAGES=de|en|nl
              specifies the message language and is also used as default for the phrase language.  The default language is en.

FILES
       ${prefix}/share/diction/*     databases for various languages

       The file consists of lines, one per entry.  Each line is divided by one or two tabs into two parts: Left is the text to match and right is the suggestion.  The text to match either starts  with  a
       space to match a full word or with letters to match suffixes.  If it ends with a tilde, it matches a prefix.

       The suggestion may be empty to mark fill words, contain an explanation or start with an equal sign followed by text to match for referring to the explanation of that text.  The right part can con‐
       sist of an exclamation mark to mark exceptions that should not be matched.

       If both parts are separated by two tabs, then this entry concerns mistakes typically made by beginners.

       Empty lines or lines starting with a hash are ignored.

HISTORY
       There  has been a diction command on old UNIX systems, which is now part of the AT&T DWB package.  The original version was bound to roff by enforcing a call to deroff.  This version is a reimple‐
       mentation and must run in a pipe with deroff(1) if you want to process roff documents.  Similarly, you can run it in a pipe with dehtml(1) or detex(1) to process HTML or TeX documents.
