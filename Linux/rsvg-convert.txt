NAME
       rsvg-convert - turn SVG files into raster images.

SYNOPSIS
       rsvg-convert [options] in.svg > out.png

DESCRIPTION
       Converts SVG images into PNG raster images, PDF, PS, or SVG vector images, or dumps of Cairo XML or recording surfaces.

   OPTIONS
       -d --dpi-x number
              Set the X resolution of the image in pixels per inch.  RSVG's current default is 90 DPI.

       -p --dpi-y number
              Set the Y resolution of the image in pixels per inch.  RSVG's current default is 90 DPI.

       -x --x-zoom number
              X Zoom factor, as a percentage.  If unspecified, 1.0 is used as the default.

       -y --y-zoom number
              Y Zoom factor, as a percentage.  If unspecified, 1.0 is used as the default.

       -z --zoom number
              Zoom factor, as a percentage.  If unspecified, 1.0 is used as the default.

       -w --width integer
              Specify how wide you wish the image to be.  If unspecified, the natural width of the image is used as the default.

       -h --height integer
              Specify how tall you wish the image to be.  If unspecified, the natural height of the image is used as the default.

       -f --format [png, pdf, ps, eps, svg, xml, recording]
              Specify the output format you wish the image to be saved in.  If unspecified, PNG is used as the default.

       -o --output filename
              Specify the output filename.  If unspecified, outputs to stdout.

       -i --export-id object-id
              Allows to specify an SVG object that should be exported. If unspecified, all objects will be exported.

       -a --keep-aspect-ratio
              Specify that the aspect ratio is to be preserved.  If unspecified, aspect ratio will not be preserved.

       -b --background-color [black, white, #abccee, #aaa...]
              Specify the background color.  If unspecified, none is used as the default.

       -s --stylesheet filename
              Filename of a CSS stylesheet.

       -u --unlimited
              The  SVG parser has some guards designed to mitigate large CPU or memory consumption in the face of malicious XML.  It may also refuse to resolve URIs used to embed image data.  If you are run‐
              ning into such issues when converting a SVG, this option allows to turn off these guards.

       --keep-image-data
              Include the original, compressed images in the final output, rather than uncompressed RGB data. This is the default behavior for PDF and (E)PS output.

       --no-keep-image-data
              Do not include the original, compressed images but instead embed uncompressed RGB date in PDF or (E)PS output. This will most likely result in larger documents that are slower to read.

       -v --version
              Display what version of rsvg this is.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
              If the selected output format is PDF, this variable can be used to control the CreationDate in the PDF file.  This is useful for reproducible output.  The environment variable must be set to  a
              decimal  number  corresponding  to  a  UNIX  timestamp,  defined  as  the  number of seconds, excluding leap seconds, since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC.  The specification for this can be found at
              https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/
