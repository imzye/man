NAME
       jellyfish - jellyfish Documentation

OVERVIEW
       jellyfish is a library of functions for approximate and phonetic matching of strings.

       Source code is available on GitHub

       The library provides implementations of the following algorithms:

   Phonetic Encoding
       These  algorithms convert a string to a normalized phonetic encoding, converting a word to a representation of its pronunciation.  Each takes a single string
       and returns a coded representation.

   American Soundex
       soundex(s)
              Calculate the American Soundex of the string s.

       Soundex is an algorithm to convert a word (typically a name) to a four digit code in the form 'A123' where 'A' is the first letter of the name and the digits
       represent similar sounds.

       For example soundex('Ann') == soundex('Anne') == 'A500' and soundex('Rupert') == soundex('Robert') == 'R163'.

       See the Soundex article at Wikipedia for more details.

   Metaphone
       metaphone(s)
              Calculate the metaphone code for the string s.

       The  metaphone  algorithm  was  designed as an improvement on Soundex.  It transforms a word into a string consisting of '0BFHJKLMNPRSTWXY' where '0' is pro‐
       nounced 'th' and 'X' is a '[sc]h' sound.

       For example metaphone('Klumpz') == metaphone('Clumps') == 'KLMPS'.

       See the Metaphone article at Wikipedia for more details.

   NYSIIS
       nysiis(s)
              Calculate the NYSIIS code for the string s.

       The NYSIIS algorithm is an algorithm developed by the New York State Identification and Intelligence System.  It transforms a  word  into  a  phonetic  code.
       Like soundex and metaphone it is primarily intended for use on names (as they would be pronounced in English).

       For example nysiis('John') == nysiis('Jan') == JAN.

       See the NYSIIS article at Wikipedia for more details.

   Match Rating Approach (codex)
       match_rating_codex(s)
              Calculate the match rating approach value (also called PNI) for the string s.

       The Match rating approach algorithm is an algorithm for determining whether or not two names are pronounced similarly.  The algorithm consists of an encoding
       function (similar to soundex or nysiis) which is implemented here as well as match_rating_comparison() which does the actual comparison.

       See the Match Rating Approach article at Wikipedia for more details.

   Stemming
   Porter Stemmer
       porter_stem(s)
              Reduce the string s to its stem using the common Porter stemmer.

       Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its root form, for example 'stemmed' to 'stem'.

       Martin Porter's algorithm is a common algorithm used for stemming that works for many purposes.

       See the official homepage for the Porter Stemming Algorithm for more details.

   String Comparison
       These methods are all measures of the difference (aka edit distance) between two strings.

   Levenshtein Distance
       levenshtein_distance(s1, s2)
              Compute the Levenshtein distance between s1 and s2.

       Levenshtein distance represents the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one word to another.

       For example: levenshtein_distance('berne', 'born') == 2 representing the transformation of the first e to o and the deletion of the second e.

       See the Levenshtein distance article at Wikipedia for more details.

   Damerau-Levenshtein Distance
       damerau_levenshtein_distance(s1, s2)
              Compute the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between s1 and s2.

       A modification of Levenshtein distance, Damerau-Levenshtein distance counts transpositions (such as ifsh for fish) as a single edit.

       Where levenshtein_distance('fish', 'ifsh') == 2 as it would require a deletion and an insertion, though damerau_levenshtein_distance('fish', 'ifsh') == 1  as
       this counts as a transposition.

       See the Damerau-Levenshtein distance article at Wikipedia for more details.

   Hamming Distance
       hamming_distance(s1, s2)
              Compute the Hamming distance between s1 and s2.

       Hamming distance is the measure of the number of characters that differ between two strings.

       Typically  Hamming  distance is undefined when strings are of different length, but this implementation considers extra characters as differing.  For example
       hamming_distance('abc', 'abcd') == 1.

       See the Hamming distance article at Wikipedia for more details.

   Jaro Similarity
       jaro_similarity(s1, s2)
              Compute the Jaro similarity between s1 and s2.

       Jaro distance is a string-edit distance that gives a floating point response in [0,1] where 0 represents two completely dissimilar strings and  1  represents
       identical strings.

       WARNING:
          Prior to 0.8.1 this function was named jaro_distance.  That name is still available, but no longer functions as expected.  It will be replaced in 1.0 with
          a correct version.

   Jaro-Winkler Similarity
       jaro_winkler_similarity(s1, s2)
              Compute the Jaro-Winkler distance between s1 and s2.

       Jaro-Winkler is a modification/improvement to Jaro distance, like Jaro it gives a floating point response in [0,1] where 0 represents two completely dissimi‐
       lar strings and 1 represents identical strings.

       WARNING:
          Prior  to 0.8.1 this function was named jaro_winkler.  That name is still available, but no longer functions as expected.  It will be replaced in 1.0 with
          a correct version.

       See the Jaro-Winkler distance article at Wikipedia for more details.

   Match Rating Approach (comparison)
       match_rating_comparison(s1, s2)
              Compare s1 and s2 using the match rating approach algorithm, returns True if strings are considered equivalent or False if not.  Can also return  None
              if s1 and s2 are not comparable (length differs by more than 3).

       The  Match  rating  approach  algorithm  is  an algorithm for determining whether or not two names are pronounced similarly.  Strings are first encoded using
       match_rating_codex() then compared according to the MRA algorithm.

       See the Match Rating Approach article at Wikipedia for more details.

IMPLEMENTATION
       Each algorithm has C and Python implementations.

       On a typical CPython install the C implementation will be used. The Python versions are available for PyPy and systems where compiling the CPython  extension
       is not possible.

       To explicitly use a specific implementation, refer to the appropriate module:

          import jellyfish._jellyfish as pyjellyfish
          import jellyfish.cjellyfish as cjellyfish

       If you've already imported jellyfish and are not sure what implementation you are using, you can check by querying jellyfish.library:

          if jellyfish.library == 'Python':
              # Python implementation
          elif jellyfish.library == 'C':
              # C implementation
