NAME
       ws_restore - restore a workspace that was removed, but is still in recovery area

SYNOPSIS
       ws_restore [-h] [-l] [-F FILESYSTEM]  NAME TARGET

DESCRIPTION
       After  a  workspace  was  released  by user or deleted due to expiration, it can be (depending on administrator policy) kept for a while in an unaccessible area of the filesystem before beeing finally
       deleted to free the space.  In this case, it can be restored. The decision how long it can be restored is up to administrator.

       ws_restore -l has to be used to list the restorable workspaces and to restore a selected workspace into a new existing workspace (attention, this name is not  identical  with  the  name  displayed  by
       ws_list !)

       ws_restore can not be automated, it has to be executed in an interactive session by a human.
