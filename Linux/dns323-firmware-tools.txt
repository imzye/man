NAME
       splitdns323fw - extract data from DNS-323 (and other) firmware images

SYNOPSIS
       splitdns323fw [-k KERNEL] [-i INITRD] [-d DEFAULTS] firmwarefile

DESCRIPTION
       splitdns323fw parses an existing firmware image for a device such as the D-Link DNS-323, DNS-321, and Conceptronics CH3SNAS.

       By  default,  if only the firmwarefile ®option is given, the script verifies the checksums of the included components and prints a bunch of useful info about the image.  If you specify one or more
       of the other options, however, the corresponding section of the firmware image will be written to that file.

       -k kernel, --kernel=kernel

              Write the kernel part of the firmware image to the specified file.

       -i initrd, --initrd=initrd

              Write the initrd part of the firmware image to the specified file.

       -d defaults.tar.gz, --defaults=defaults.tar.gz

              Write the defaults part of the firmware image to the specified file.

BUGS
       E-mail bug reports to theshed+dns323-firmware-tools@hezmatt.org.  I don't guarantee to be able to help, but I'll give it a shot.  Patches are far more helpful.
