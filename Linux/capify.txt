NAME
       cap - tool to perform capistrano tasks

SYNOPSIS
       cap <command> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       cap  —  cap  is an utility to invoke capistrano tasks.  Capistrano is a utility and framework for executing commands in parallel on multiple remote machines, via SSH. It uses a simple DSL (borrowed in
       part from Rake, http://rake.rubyforge.org/) that allows you to define _tasks_, which may be applied to machines in certain roles. It also supports tunneling connections via some gateway machine to al‐
       low operations to be performed behind VPN's and firewalls.

       Capistrano was originally designed to simplify and automate deployment of web applications to distributed environments, and originally came bundled with a set of tasks designed for deploying Rails ap‐
       plications. The deployment tasks are now (as of Capistrano 2.0) opt-in and require clients to explicitly put "load 'deploy'" in their recipes.

       Capistrano is  a  self-documenting program by giving you an extensive help listing for each command. If you think that this manual page is outdated, simply running

       cap -h

ASSUMPTIONS
       Capistrano is "opinionated software", which means it has very firm ideas about how things ought to be done, and tries to force those ideas on you. Some of the assumptions behind these opinions are:

         * You are using SSH to access the remote servers.
         * You either have the same password to all target machines, or you have public keys in place to allow passwordless access to them.

       Do not expect these assumptions to change.

OPTIONS
       Capistrano  is extensible configurable, and it has the following configuration options:

       -e           --explain TAKS
                 Displays help (if available) for the task.

       -F           --default-config
                 Always use default config, even with -f.

       -f           --file FILE
                 A recipe file to load. May be given more than once.
