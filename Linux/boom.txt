SYNOPSIS
       boom [-VTOAP] [-l num] [-d num] [-i num] [-a num] [-sjbgpwtmorn]
                      filename [outname]

DESCRIPTION
       BOOM is used for the first step of the synthesis process.  It optimizes
       a behavioural description using a Reduced Ordered Binary Decision  Dia‐
       gram representation of logic functions.  The file filename is the input
       behavioural description and must be written in vbe(5) format.  The  re‐
       sulting  behavioural  optimized description is saved with the name out‐
       name or input_name_o in vbe(5) format.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       MBK_WORK_LIB(1)
                 indicates the path to the read/write directory for  the  ses‐
                 sion.

OPTIONS
       -V        Verbose  mode on.  Each step of the optimization is displayed
                 on the standard output.

       -T        Trace mode on.  Some debug information are displayed  on  the
                 standard output.

       -O        Reverses initial Bdd variables order.

       -A        BOOM performs a local optimization and keeps the architecture
                 of the initial description by saving most of the intermediate
                 signals.   This  mode  is well-suited for big or regular cir‐
                 cuits such as multipliers, adders.  By default BOOM  performs
                 a  global  optimization  and removes most of the intermediate
                 signals so that the outputs are expressed in terms of the in‐
                 puts or the internal registers.  This mode is well-suited for
                 random circuits such as FSMs.

       -P        Uses a parameter file input_name.boom describing optimization
                 directives and constraints.  (see below for the exact syntax)

                 # Example of .boom file

                 #
                 # The list of auxiliary signals that have to be kept
                 # during optimization.
                 # Generally carry signals, ram address signals etc ...
                 #
                 BEGIN_KEEP

                 carry[3:0]
                 ram_address[3:0]

                 END

                 #
                 # The list of auxiliary signals which assigned
                 # expression won't be modified.
                 # Generally it's ram output signals.
                 #
                 BEGIN_DONT_TOUCH
                 ram_out[7:0]
                 END

       -l num    Specifies  the  optimization  level  [0-3] (default is 0, low
                 level).

       -d num    Specifies the delay optimization percent (default is  0%  de‐
                 lay, 100% surface).

       -i num    Specifies  the  number of iterations for the chosen optimiza‐
                 tion algorithm (for experts only).

       -a num    Specifies the amplitude during bdd  reordering  (for  experts
                 only).

       -sjbgpwtmorn
                 Specifies  which algorithm has to be used for the boolean op‐
                 timization.
