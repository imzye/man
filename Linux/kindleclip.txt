NAME
       kindleclip - User interface for managing Amazon Kindle's My Clippings.txt file

SYNOPSIS
       kindleclip [clippings_file]

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Kindle  devices store a My Clippings.txt file, where the bookmarks, highlights and notes are kept. This application allows you to search within the clippings, filter the contents, and copy and
       paste to other applications.  This program is in no way endorsed, promoted or should be associated with Amazon. It is not –and does not aim to be– an official Kindle project.

OPTIONS
       kindleclip accepts as its only argument the path to the My Clippings.txt file to use; if none is provided, it will try to open it in the current directory, and exit with an error message  if  it  does
       not exist.

       This program was written by Gunnar Wolf <gwolf@gwolf.org>.
