HTTP::Server::Simple::Mason(3pm)                                                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                    HTTP::Server::Simple::Mason(3pm)

NAME
       HTTP::Server::Simple::Mason - An abstract baseclass for a standalone mason server

SYNOPSIS
               my $server = MyApp::Server->new();

               $server->run;

               package MyApp::Server;
               use base qw/HTTP::Server::Simple::Mason/;

               sub mason_config {
                   return ( comp_root => '/tmp/mason-pages' );
               }

DESCRIPTION
INTERFACE
       See HTTP::Server::Simple and the documentation below.

   mason_handler
       Returns the server's "HTML::Mason::CGIHandler" object.  The first time this method is called, it creates a new handler by calling "new_handler".

   handle_request CGI
       Called with a CGI object. Invokes mason and runs the request

   handle_error ERROR
       If the call to "handle_request" dies, "handle_error" is called with the exception (that is, $@).  By default, it does nothing; it can be overridden by your subclass.

   new_handler
       Creates and returns a new "HTML::Mason::CGIHandler", with configuration specified by the "default_mason_config" and "mason_config" methods.  You don't need to call this method yourself;
       "mason_handler" will automatically call it the first time it is called.

   handler_class
       Returns the name of the Mason handler class invoked in "new_handler".  Defaults to HTML::Mason::CGIHandler, but in your subclass you may wish to change it to a subclass of HTML::Mason::CGIHandler.

   setup_escapes $handler
       Sets up the Mason escapes for the handler $handler.  For example, the "h" in

         <% $name | h %>

       By default, sets "h" to "HTTP::Server::Simple::Mason::escape_utf8" and "u" to "HTTP::Server::Simple::Mason::escape_uri", but you can override this in your subclass.

   mason_config
       Returns a subclass-defined mason handler configuration; you almost certainly want to override it and specify at least "comp_root".

   default_mason_config
       Returns the default mason handler configuration (which can be overridden by entries in "mason_config").

   escape_utf8 SCALARREF
       does a css-busting but minimalist escaping of whatever html you're passing in.

   escape_uri SCALARREF
       Escapes URI component according to RFC2396

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       For most configuration, see HTTP::Server::Simple.

       You can (and must) configure your mason CGI handler by subclassing this module and overriding the subroutine "mason_config". It's most important that you set a component root (where your pages
       live) by adding

           comp_root => '/some/absolute/path'

       See the Synopsis section or "ex/sample_server.pl" in the distribution for a complete example.
