NAME
       RT::Action::SMSNotify - an action to send SMS notifications

DESCRIPTION
       See RT::Extension::SMSNotify for details on how to use this extension, including how to customise error reporting.

       This action may be invoked directly, from rt-crontool, or via a Scrip.

ARGUMENTS
       "RT::Action::SMSNotify" takes a single argument, like all other RT actions.  The argument is a comma-delimited string of codes indicating where the module should get phone numbers to SMS from.
       Wherever a group appears in a category, all the users from that group will be recursively added.

       Recognised codes are:

   TicketRequestors
       The ticket requestor(s). May be groups.

   TicketCc
       All entries in the ticket Cc field

   TicketAdminCc
       All entries in the ticket AdminCc field

   TicketOwner
       The ticket Owner field

   QueueCc
       All queue watchers in the Cc category on the queue

   QueueAdminCc
       All queue watchers in the AdminCc category on the queue

   g:name
       The RT group with name 'name'. Ignored with a warning if it doesn't exist.  No mechanism for escaping commas in names is provided.

   p:number
       A phone number, specified in +0000000 form with no spaces, commas etc.

   filtermodule:
       You may override the phone number filter function on a per-call basis by passing filtermodule: in the arguments. The argument must be the name of a module that defines a GetPhoneForUser function.

       This can appear anywhere in the argument string. For example, to force the use of the OnShift filter for this action, you might write:

        TicketAdminCc,TicketRequestors,TicketOwner,TicketCc,filtermodule:RT::Extension::SMSNotify::OnShift

perl v5.40.1                                                                                     2025-03-22                                                                      RT::Action::SMSNotify(3pm)
