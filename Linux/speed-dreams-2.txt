DESCRIPTION
       Speed  Dreams  is  a  Motorsport  Simulator featuring high-quality 3D graphics and an accurate physics engine, all targeting maximum realism.  Initially forked from TORCS, it has now reached a clearly
       higher realism level in visual and physics simulation, thanks to its active development team and growing community.  It mainly aims to implement exciting new features, cars, tracks and AI opponents to
       make a more enjoyable game for the player, while constantly pushing forward visual and physics realism.  It is also intended for any research, study or teaching activity, around physics and AI, thanks
       to its GPL V2+ license, and the clear and modular architecture of its C/C++ code base.  As everything is open in Speed Dreams, you can also tweak you favorite car physics setup, create a band new  car
       model, or simply design a new shinning livery for an existing one, and even create an entire new track with its landscape, or simply improve an existing one.  And even more ...

       -l, --localdir local dir
              Set the run-time user settings folder (default = ~/.speed-dreams-2, unless not using the default CMake configuration for building)

       -L, --libdir lib dir
              Set the run-time library folder (default = /usr/local/lib[64]/games/speed-dreams-2, unless not using the default CMake configuration for building)

       -D, --datadir data dir
              Set the run-time data folder (default = /usr/local/share/games/speed-dreams-2, unless not using the default CMake configuration for building)

       -B, --bindir bin dir
              Set the run-time binary data folder (default = /usr/local/games, unless not using the default CMake configuration for building)

       -s, --startrace race mode name
              Directly start a new race of the given mode, as the name without extension of the selected raceman file, among the .xml files in <user settings>/config/raceman (no default)

       -x, --textonly
              Run the specified race without any GUI (suitable for a headless computer)
              Note: Can't be used without -s/--startrace.

       -m, --hardmouse
              Use hardware mouse cursor

       -e, --tracelevel trace level threshold
              Set  the  trace  level  threshold  to the given integer value (0=Fatal, 1=Error, 2=Warning, 3=Info, 4=Trace, 5=Debug, ... ; default = Debug, unless not using the default CMake configuration for
              building) Only traces with lower or equal level will appear in the trace stream Note: May be disabled if CMake option 'OPTION_DEBUG' is not true at build time)

       -t, --tracestream target trace stream
              Set the target stream for the traces (among 'stdout', 'stderr' or <file name>) ; default = stderr, unless not using the default CMake configuration for building)) Note: May be disabled if CMake
              option 'OPTION_DEBUG' is not true at build time)
