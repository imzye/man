NAME
       clamonacc - an anti-virus on-access scanning daemon and clamd client

SYNOPSIS
       clamd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  clamonacc daemon registers for file access notifications from the Linux kernel and in response, submits scans to the clamd scanning daemon for a verdict. On-Access is only available on Linux sys‐
       tems. On Linux, On-Access requires a kernel version >= 3.8. This is because it leverages a kernel api called fanotify to block processes from attempting to access malicious files. This prevention  oc‐
       curs in kernel-space, and thus offers stronger protection than a purely user-space solution.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output help information and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -l FILE, --log=FILE
              Save the scan report to FILE.

       -F, --foreground
              Run in foreground; do not daemonize.

       -w FILE, --watch-list=FILE
              Watch directories from FILE.

       -e FILE, --exclude-list=FILE
              Exclude directories from FILE.

       -p A[:I], --ping A[:I]
              Ping clamd up to [A] times at optional interval [I] until it responds.

       -w, --wait
              Wait up to 30 seconds for clamd to start. Optionally use alongside ping to set attempts [A] and interval [I] to check clamd.

       --remove
              Remove infected files. Be careful.

       --move=DIRECTORY
              Move infected files into DIRECTORY.

       --copy=DIRECTORY
              Copy infected files into DIRECTORY.

       -c FILE, --config-file=FILE
              Read configuration from FILE.

       --allmatch
              Continue scanning within file after finding a match.

       --fdpass
              Pass the file descriptor permissions to clamd. This is useful if clamd is running as a different user as it is faster than streaming the file to clamd.  Only available if connected to clamd via
              local(unix) socket.

       --stream
              Forces file streaming to clamd. This is generally not needed as clamdscan detects automatically if streaming is required. This option only exists for debugging  and  testing  purposes,  in  all
              other cases --fdpass is preferred.

SIGNALS
       ClamOnAcc recognizes the following signals:

       SIGHUP Reopen the logfile.

       SIGUSR2
              Reload the signature databases.

       SIGTERM
              Perform a clean exit.
