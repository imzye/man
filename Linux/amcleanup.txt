AMCLEANUP(8)            System Administration Commands            AMCLEANUP(8)

NAME
       amcleanup - run the Amanda cleanup process after a failure

SYNOPSIS
       amcleanup [-k] [-p] [-r] [-v] [--note string] config

DESCRIPTION
       Amcleanup generates the Amanda Mail Report and updates the Amanda
       databases after a system failure on a tape server host. This cleanup
       process is normally done automatically as part of the amdump program,
       but if amdump cannot complete for some reason (usually because of a
       tape server host crash), amcleanup must be run some time later (usually
       during system boot).

       The amcleanupdisk program is run with the same [-r] and [-v] options.

       See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

OPTIONS
       -k
           Kill all process listed in the log file are their child. if there
           is no log file, then kill all amdump, amflush and amvault process
           and their child.

       -p
           Do the cleanup only if all process listed in the log file are
           already terminated.

       -r
           Remove bad file in holding disk. This options is passed to
           amcleanupdisk.

       -v
           Generate verbose output. This options is passed to amcleanupdisk.

       --note string
           Add the string to the log files, it will show up in the NOTES
           section of the report.

EXAMPLES
       This example runs the Amanda cleanup process by hand after a failure.
       % amcleanup daily

       Putting the following line in a system boot script (e.g.
       /etc/rc.local) runs the Amanda cleanup process as part of the reboot,
       eliminating the need to run it by hand.
       /usr/local/sbin/amcleanup daily

       If nothing needs to be done, amcleanup exits normally with the message:
       amcleanup: no unprocessed logfile to clean up.
