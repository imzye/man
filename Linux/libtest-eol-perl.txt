NAME
       Test::EOL - Check the correct line endings in your project

VERSION
       version 2.02

SYNOPSIS
       "Test::EOL" lets you check for the presence of trailing whitespace and/or windows line endings in your perl code. It reports its results in standard "Test::Simple" fashion:

         use Test::EOL tests => 1;
         eol_unix_ok( 'lib/Module.pm', 'Module is ^M free');

       and to add checks for trailing whitespace:

         use Test::EOL tests => 1;
         eol_unix_ok( 'lib/Module.pm', 'Module is ^M and trailing whitespace free', { trailing_whitespace => 1 });

       Module authors can include the following in a t/eol.t and have "Test::EOL" automatically find and check all perl files in a module distribution:

         use Test::EOL;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       or

         use Test::EOL;
         all_perl_files_ok( @mydirs );

       and if authors would like to check for trailing whitespace:

         use Test::EOL;
         all_perl_files_ok({ trailing_whitespace => 1 });

       or

         use Test::EOL;
         all_perl_files_ok({ trailing_whitespace => 1 }, @mydirs );

       or

         use Test::More;
         use Test::EOL 'no_test';
         all_perl_files_ok();
         done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
       This module scans your project/distribution for any perl files (scripts, modules, etc) for the presence of windows line endings.

FUNCTIONS
   all_perl_files_ok
         all_perl_files_ok( [ \%options ], [ @directories ] )

       Applies "eol_unix_ok()" to all perl files found in @directories (and sub directories). If no <@directories> is given, the starting point is the current working directory, as tests are usually run
       from the top directory in a typical CPAN distribution. A perl file is *.pl or *.pm or *.pod or *.t or a file starting with "#!...perl"

       Valid "\%options" currently are:

       •   trailing_whitespace

           By default Test::EOL only looks for Windows (CR/LF) line-endings. Set this to true to raise errors if any kind of trailing whitespace is present in the file.

       •   all_reasons

           Normally  Test::EOL  reports only the first error in every file (given that a text file originated on Windows will fail every single line). Set this a true value to register a test failure for
           every line with an error.

       If the test plan is defined:

         use Test::EOL tests => 3;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       the total number of files tested must be specified.

   eol_unix_ok
         eol_unix_ok ( $file [, $text] [, \%options ] )

       Run a unix EOL check on $file. For a module, the path (lib/My/Module.pm) or the name (My::Module) can be both used. $text is the diagnostic label  emitted  after  the  "ok"/"not  ok"  TAP  output.
       "\%options" takes the same values as described in "all_perl_files_ok".
