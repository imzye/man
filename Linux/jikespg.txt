DESCRIPTION
       Jikes  Parser  Generator  is a parser generator that accepts as input an annotated  description for a language grammar and produces text files suitable for inclusion in a parser for that lan‐
       guage. It is similar in function and use to the widely-available parser generators Yacc and Bison.

       It also provides support for automatic diagnosis and recovery from syntactic errors. It is the parser generator used by the Jikes Compiler. Jikes Parser Generator  can  generate  parsers  for
       LALR(k) grammars and produce output suitable for use with parsers written in Java, C, or C++.
