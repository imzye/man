NAME
       nauty-complg - complement graphs

SYNOPSIS
       complg [-lq] [-a] [-L] [-r|-R] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Take the complements of a file of graphs.

              The output file has a header if and only if the input file does.  The output format is defined by the header or first graph.

       -r     Only complement if the complement has fewer directed edges.

       -R     Only complement if the complement has fewer directed edges or has the same number of directed edges and is canonically less than the original.

       -a     Also output the input graph (before the complement).

       -L     Complement the loops too. By default, preserve them.

       -l     Canonically label outputs.

       -q     Suppress auxiliary information.
