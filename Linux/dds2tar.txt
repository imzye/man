NAME
       scsi_vendor - script displays SCSI vendors

SYNOPSIS
       scsi_vendor [disk|tape|cd] [<num>]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the scsi_vendor command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because the original program does not
       have a manual page.

       When run, the script will report the vendors of all or the specified types of SCSI devices on the system.

AUTHOR
