DESCRIPTION
       isort sorts Python import definitions alphabetically within logical sections.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -l LINE_LENGTH, --lines LINE_LENGTH
              The maximum length of an import line (used for wrapping long imports).

       -s SKIP, --skip SKIP
              Files that sort imports should skip over.

       -ns NOT_SKIP, --dont-skip NOT_SKIP
              Files that sort imports should never skip over.

       -t FORCE_TO_TOP, --top FORCE_TO_TOP
              Force specific imports to the top of their appropriate section.

       -b KNOWN_STANDARD_LIBRARY, --builtin KNOWN_STANDARD_LIBRARY
              Force isort to recognize a module as part of the python standard library.

       -o KNOWN_THIRD_PARTY, --thirdparty KNOWN_THIRD_PARTY
              Force isort to recognize a module as being part of a third party library.

       -p KNOWN_FIRST_PARTY, --project KNOWN_FIRST_PARTY
              Force isort to recognize a module as being part of the current python project.

       -m MODE, --multi_line MODE
              Multi line output (0=grid, 1=vertical, 2=hanging, 3=vert-hanging, 4=vert-grid, 5=vert-grid-grouped).

       -i INDENT, --indent INDENT
              String to place for indents; defaults to "    " (4 spaces).

       -a ADD_IMPORTS, --add_import ADD_IMPORTS
              Adds the specified import line to all files, automatically determining correct placement.

       -af, --force_adds
              Forces import adds even if the original file is empty.

       -r REMOVE_IMPORTS, --remove_import REMOVE_IMPORTS
              Removes the specified import from all files.

       -ls, --length_sort
              Sort imports by their string length.

       -d, --stdout
              Force resulting output to stdout, instead of in-place.

       -c, --check-only
              Checks the file for unsorted imports and prints them to the command line without modifying the file.

       -sl, --force_single_line_imports
              Forces all from imports to appear on their own line.

       -sd DEFAULT_SECTION, --section-default DEFAULT_SECTION
              Sets the default section for imports (by default, FIRSTPARTY).  Possible values: FUTURE, ISTDLIB, THIRDPARTY, FIRSTPARTY, LOCALFOLDER

       -df, --diff
              Prints a diff of all the changes isort would make to a file, instead of changing it in place

       -e, --balanced
              Balances wrapping to produce the most consistent line length possible.

       -rc, --recursive
              Recursively look for Python files of which to sort imports.

       -ot, --order-by-type
              Order imports by type in addition to alphabetically.

       -ac, --atomic
              Ensures the output doesn't save if the resulting file contains syntax errors.

       -cs, --combine-star
              Ensures that if a star import is present, nothing else is imported from that namespace.

       -v, --version
              Show program's version number and exit.

       -vb, --verbose
              Shows verbose output, such as when files are skipped or when a check is successful.

       -sp SETTINGS_PATH, --settings-path SETTINGS_PATH
              Explicitly set the settings path instead of auto determining based on file location.
