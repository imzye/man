NAME
       SIFT_for_submitting_fasta_seq.csh - predict effect of an amino acid substitution on protein function

SYNOPSIS
       SIFT_for_submitting_fasta_seq.csh <FASTA_FILE> <BLAST_DB> <SUBSTITUTIONS_FILE> [BLAST_PROCESSORS]

DESCRIPTION
       SIFT predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids.

       Results are stored in ./<seq_file>.SIFTprediction.

       This program is used for FASTA input and is part of the SIFT suite.

OPTIONS
       <FASTA_FILE>
           Protein sequence in fasta format.

       <BLAST_DB>
           Protein database to search.  These sequences are assumed to be functional.

       <SUBSTITUTIONS_FILE>
           File  of substitutions to be predicted.  See /usr/share/doc/sift/examples/lacI.subst for an example of the format.  If you give '-', scores for all mutations of the entire protein sequence are
           printed.

       [BLAST_PROCESSORS]
           Number of processors/cores to use when running blast via the -a argument.

EXAMPLES
        SIFT_for_submitting_fasta_seq.csh /usr/share/doc/sift/examples/lacI.fasta [BLAST_DB] /usr/share/doc/sift/examples/lacI.subst
