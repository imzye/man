NAME
       oz-generate-icicle - tool to generate an ICICLE (package manifest) of a disk image

SYNOPSIS
       oz-generate-icicle [OPTIONS] <tdl-file> <libvirt-xml-file>

DESCRIPTION
       This is a tool to generate a package manifest (also called ICICLE) from a disk image.  This program can be used as a counterpart to oz-install, though it does not have to be used in conjunction.

       Note that oz-generate-icicle does the actual work using a combination of KVM and libvirt, so both of these must be available (and working) for oz-generate-icicle to have a chance to succeed.

OPTIONS
       -c <config>
              Get  the configuration from config file config, instead of the default /etc/oz/oz.cfg.  If neither one exists, Oz will use sensible defaults.  The config file is in standard ini format; for
              an explanation of the sections and keys, see the CONFIGURATION FILE section.

       -d <loglevel>
              Turn on debugging output to level loglevel.  The log levels are:

              0 - errors only (this is the default)

              1 - errors and warnings

              2 - errors, warnings, and information

              3 - all messages

              4 - all messages, prepended with the level and classname

       -h     Print a short help message.

       -i <icicle>
              oz-generate-icicle will normally write the ICICLE XML to stdout.  To have oz-generate-icicle write the ICICLE to a file instead, use this option.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The Oz configuration file is in standard INI format with several sections.  If any section or configuration key is missing, Oz will use a sensible default.  For true/false configuration keys,  the
       values  of "true", "True", "yes", or "Yes" can be used to turn the option on, and "false", "False", "no", or "No" can be used to turn the behavior off.  The configuration file should have the fol‐
       lowing form:

           [paths]
           output_dir = /var/lib/libvirt/images
           data_dir = /var/lib/oz
           screenshot_dir = .
           sshprivkey = /etc/oz/id_rsa-icicle-gen

           [libvirt]
           uri = qemu:///system
           type = kvm
           bridge_name = virbr0
           cpus = 1
           memory = 1024
           image_type = raw

           [cache]
           original_media = yes
           modified_media = no
           jeos = no

           [icicle]
           safe_generation = no

       The paths section defines the paths that Oz will use for storing data.  The output_dir key describes where to store the images after they are built, and the data_dir key describes where  to  cache
       install media and use temporary storage.  Both locations must have a decent amount of free disk space in order for Oz to work properly.  The screenshot_dir key describes where to store screenshots
       of failed installs. The sshprivkey key describes where the ssh keys are stored, which are required by Oz to do customization of the image.

       The  libvirt  section allows some manipulation of how Oz uses libvirt.  The uri key describes the libvirt URI to use to do the guest installation.  The type key defines what type of virtualization
       to use.  The bridge_name key defines which bridge Oz should place the guests that it launches on.  The cpus key defines how many cpus should be used inside the virtual machine.  The memory key de‐
       fines how much memory (in megabytes) should be used inside the virtual machine.  The image_type key defines which output disk type should be used; this can be any value that libvirt supports.

       The cache section allows some manipulation of how Oz caches data.  The caching of data in Oz is a tradeoff between installation time and storage space.  The original_media key tells  Oz  to  cache
       the  original installation media so that it does not have to download it the next time an install for the same operating system is requested.  The modified_media key tells Oz to cache the oz-modi‐
       fied installation media so that it does not have to download and modify it the next time an install for the same operating system is requested.  The jeos key tells Oz to cache the installed  oper‐
       ating  system  after  installation.   This can significantly speed up subsequent installation of the same operating system, with the additional downside of the operating system getting out-of-date
       with respect to security updates.  Use with care.

       The icicle section allows some manipulation of how Oz generates ICICLE output.  ICICLE is a package manifest that can optionally be generated at the end of installs.  The safe_generation key  con‐
       trols  whether  Oz  uses a throwaway overlay file while generating the ICICLE.  If it is set to "no" (the default), then Oz will boot up the guest at the end of the install and run the appropriate
       commands to generate the ICICLE.  If it is set to "yes", then Oz will use a throwaway overlay file while generating the ICICLE.  After the ICICLE is generated, Oz will  delete  the  backing  file,
       leaving the original disk image pristine.
