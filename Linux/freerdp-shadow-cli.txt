SYNOPSIS
       freerdp-shadow-cli   [/port:<port  number>]  [/ipc-socket:<ipc-socket>]
       [/monitors:<0,1,2,...>] [/rect:<x,y,w,h>] [+auth] [-may-view] [-may-in‐
       teract]   [/sec:<rdp|tls|nla|ext>]   [-sec-rdp]  [-sec-tls]  [-sec-nla]

DESCRIPTION
       freerdp-shadow-cli can be used to share a running X display  like  with
       VNC  but  by  using  the RDP instead. It is also possibly to share only
       parts (rect) of the display.

OPTIONS
       /ipc-socket:<ipc-socket>
              If this option is set an ipc socket with the path ipc-socket  is
              used instead of a TCP socket.

       /port:<port>
              Set the port to use. Default is 3389.  This option is ignored if
              ipc-socket is used.

       /monitors:<1,2,3,...>

       -auth  Disable authentication. If authentication is enabled PAM is used
              with  the  X11 subsystem. Running as root is not necessary, how‐
              ever  if  run  as  user  only  the  same   user   that   started
              freerdp-shadow-cli can authenticate.
              Warning: If authentication is disabled everyone can connect.
