Config::INI::Reader::Ordered(3pm)                                                   User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                   Config::INI::Reader::Ordered(3pm)

NAME
       Config::INI::Reader::Ordered - .ini-file parser that returns sections in order

VERSION
       version 0.022

SYNOPSIS
       If family.ini contains:

         admin = rjbs

         [rjbs]
         awesome = yes
         height = 5' 10"

         [mj]
         awesome = totally
         height = 23"

       Then when your program contains:

         my $array = Config::INI::Reader->read_file('family.ini');

       $array will contain:

         [
           [ '_'  => { admin => 'rjbs' } ],
           [
             rjbs => {
               awesome => 'yes',
               height  => q{5' 10"},
             }
           ],
           [
             mj   => {
               awesome => 'totally',
               height  => '23"',
             }
           ],
         ]

DESCRIPTION
       Config::INI::Reader::Ordered is a subclass of Config::INI::Reader which preserves section order.  See Config::INI::Reader for all documentation; the only difference is as presented in the
       "SYNOPSIS".

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
