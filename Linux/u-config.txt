NAME
       u-config — smaller, simpler, portable pkg-config clone

SYNOPSIS
       u-config [options] package [package ...]

DESCRIPTION
       u-config is a small, highly portable pkg-config and pkgconf clone. It retrieves compiler and linker flags, version, and other dependency information of software packages.

       Package metadata is retrieved from “.pc” text files, located in a system-specific path. You can override the default search path with environment variables like PKG_CONFIG_PATH.  See “ENVIRONMENT”
       for more information.

       This  manual  page  describes  the  u-config  utility  in  particular. For general information about pkg-config concepts and its file format, refer to manual pages provided by other projects, like
       pkgconf(1) and pc(5).

       u-config supports a subset of the options of other pkg-config implementations. For a list of supported options, use the --help option. Some of them are unique to u-config:

       --newlines
               Separate arguments by line feeds instead of spaces, which is sometimes useful like in the fish shell or when manually examining output.

       --msvc-syntax
               Translates and prints compiler arguments into a syntax compatible with the MSVC compiler. For example, -l libname becomes libname.lib.

ENVIRONMENT
       u-config supports all the important pkg-config run-time environment variables. To see which are supported, use the --help option.

EXAMPLES
       $ u-config --cflags --libs foo
       -I/usr/include/foo -DFOO_HAS_BAR=1 -lfoo

SEE ALSO
       pkgconf(1), pc(5)
