NAME
       "String::Tagged::Extent" - represents a range within a "String::Tagged"

DESCRIPTION
       These objects represent a range of characters within the containing String::Tagged object. The range they represent is fixed at the time of creation. If the containing string is modified by a call
       to "set_substr" then the effect on the extent object is not defined. These objects should be considered as relatively short-lived - used briefly for the purpose of querying the result of an
       operation, then discarded soon after.

METHODS
   string
          $extent->string;

       Returns the containing String::Tagged object.

   start
          $extent->start;

       Returns the start index of the extent. This is the index of the first character within the extent.

   end
          $extent->end;

       Returns the end index of the extent. This is the index of the first character beyond the end of the extent.

   anchor_before
          $extent->anchor_before;

       True if this extent begins "before" the start of the string. Only certain methods return extents with this flag defined.

   anchor_after
          $extent->anchor_after;

       True if this extent ends "after" the end of the string. Only certain methods return extents with this flag defined.

   length
          $extent->length;

       Returns the number of characters within the extent.

   substr
          $extent->substr;

       Returns the substring contained by the extent, as a String::Tagged complete with all the relevant tag values.

   plain_substr
          $extent->plain_substr;

       Returns the substring of the underlying plain string buffer contained by the extent, as a plain Perl string.
