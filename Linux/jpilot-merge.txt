NAME
       jpilot-merge - merge an unsynced records file (pc3) into the corresponding palm database (pdb) file

SYNOPSIS
       jpilot-merge {input pdb file} {input pc3 file} {output pdb file}

DESCRIPTION
       This program will merge an unsynced records file (pc3) into the corresponding palm database (pdb) file.

       WARNING: Only run this utility if you understand the consequences!

       The merge will leave your databases in an unsync-able state.  It is intended for cases where J-pilot is being used as a standalone PIM and where no syncing occurs to physical hardware.

       WARNING: Make a backup copy of your databases before proceeding.

       It is quite simple to destroy your databases by accidentally merging address records into datebook databases, etc.
