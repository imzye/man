NAME
       cobertura-check — show which classes do not have adequate test coverage

SYNOPSIS
       cobertura-check  [--branch  0..100]   [--datafile  file]   [--line  0..100]  [--regex regex:branchrate:linerate]  [--packagebranch 0..100]  [--packageline 0..100]  [--totalbranch 0..100]  [--totalline
       0..100]

DESCRIPTION
       cobertura-check can be run after your JUnit tests to show which classes do not have adequate test coverage.

OPTIONS
       If no parameters are specified then all values will be set to 50%.

       --branch 0..100
                 Specify the minimum acceptable branch coverage rate needed by each class. This should be an integer value between 0 and 100. Default value is 0.

       --datafile file
                 Specify the name of the file containing metadata about your classes. Default value: "./cobertura.ser".

       --line 0..100
                 Specify the minimum acceptable line coverage rate needed by each class. This should be an integer value between 0 and 100. Default value is 0.

       --regex regex:branchrate:linerate
                 For finer grained control, you can optionally specify minimum branch and line coverage rates for individual classes using any number of regular expressions.

       --packagebranch 0..100
                 Specify the minimum acceptable average branch coverage rate needed by each package. This should be an integer value between 0 and 100. Default value is 0.

       --packageline 0..100
                 Specify the minimum acceptable average line coverage rate needed by each package. This should be an integer value between 0 and 100. Default value is 0.

       --totalbranch 0..100
                 Specify the minimum acceptable average branch coverage rate needed by the project as a whole. This should be an integer value between 0 and 100. Default value is 0.

       --totalline 0..100
                 Specify the minimum acceptable average line coverage rate needed by the project as a whole. This should be an integer value between 0 and 100. Default value is 0.
