NAME
       Perl6::Caller - OO "caller()" interface

VERSION
       Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
        use Perl6::Caller;

        my $sub         = caller->subroutine;
        my $line_number = caller->line;
        my $is_require  = caller(3)->is_require;

EXPORT
caller"
        # standard usage
        print "In ",           caller->subroutine,
              " called from ", caller->file,
              " line ",        caller->line;

        # get a caller object
        my $caller = caller;
        my $caller = caller();   # same thing

        # get a caller object for a different stack from
        my $caller = caller(2);  # two stack frames up
        print $caller->package;  # prints the package name

        # enjoy the original flavor
        my @caller = caller;     # original caller behavior
        print $caller[0],        # prints the package name

DESCRIPTION
       This module is experimental.  It's also alpha.  Bug reports and patches welcome.

       By default, this module exports the "caller" function.   This automatically returns a new "caller" object.  An optional argument specifies how many stack frames back to skip, just like the
       "CORE::caller" function.  This lets you do things like this:

        print "In ",           caller->subroutine,
              " called from ", caller->file,
              " line ",        caller->line;

       If you do not wish the "caller" function imported, specify an empty import list and instantiate a new "Perl6::Caller" object.

        use Perl6::Caller ();
        my $caller = Perl6::Caller->new;
        print $caller->line;

       Note:  if the results from the module seem strange, please read perldoc -s caller carefully.  It has stranger behavior than you might be aware.

METHODS
       The following methods are available on the "caller" object.  They return the same values as documented in perldoc -f caller.

       There are no "hints" and "bitmask" methods because those are documented as for internal use only.

       •   "package"

       •   "filename"

       •   "line"

       •   "subroutine"

       •   "hasargs"

       •   "wantarray"

       •   "evaltext"

       •   "is_require"

       Note that each of these values will report correctly for when the caller object was created.  For example, the following will probably print different line numbers:

        print caller->line;
        foo();
        sub foo {
           print caller->line;
        }

       However, the following will print the same line numbers:

        my $caller = Perl6::Caller->new;   # everything is relative to here
        print $caller->line;
        foo($caller);
        sub foo {
           my $caller = shift;
           print $caller->line;
        }

CAVEATS
       Most of the time, this package should just work and not interfere with anything else.

       •   $hints, $bitmask

           'hints'  and  'bitmask' are not available.  They are documented to be for internal use only and should not be relied upon.  Further, the bitmask caused strange test failures, so I opted not to
           include them.

       •   Subclassing

           Don't.

       •   Perl 6

           I'm not entirely comfortable with the namespace.  The Perl 6 caller actually does considerably more, but for me to have a hope of working that in, I need proper introspection and I don't  have
           that.  Thus, I've settled for simply having a caller object.

       •   *CORE::GLOBAL::caller

           I  didn't  implement  this,  though I was tempted.  It turns out to be a bit tricky in spots and I'm very concerned about globally overriding behavior.  I might change my mind in the future if
           there's enough demand.

       •   Overloading

           In string context, this returns the package name.  This is to support the original "caller" behavior.

       •   List Context

           In list context, we simply default to the original behavior of "CORE::caller".  However, this always assumes we've called caller with an argument.  Calling "caller" and caller(0) are identical
           with this module.  It's difficult to avoid since the stack frame changes.
