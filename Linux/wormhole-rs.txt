NAME
       wormhole-rs - send files to another computer, securely

DESCRIPTION
       wormhole-rs 0.7.0

   USAGE:
              wormhole-rs [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

   GENERAL OPTIONS:
       --relay-server <tcp://HOSTNAME:PORT>
              Use a custom relay server (specify multiple times for multiple relays) [aliases: relay]

       --rendezvous-server <ws://example.org>
              Use a custom rendezvous server. Both sides need to use the same value in order to find each other

       --force-direct
              Disable the relay server support and force a direct connection

       --force-relay
              Always route traffic over a relay server. This hides your IP address from the peer (but not from the server operators. Use Tor for that)

       -h, --help
              Print this help message

       -v, --verbose
              Enable logging to stdout, for debugging purposes

       -V, --version
              Print version information

   SUBCOMMANDS:
       forward
              Forward ports from one machine to another

       receive
              Receive a file or a folder [aliases: rx]

       send   Send a file or a folder [aliases: tx]

   SEND OPTIONS:
       --code <CODE>
              Enter a code instead of generating one automatically

       -c, --code-length <NUMWORDS>
              Length of code (in bytes/words) [default: 2]

       --rename <FILE_NAME>
               Suggest a different name to the receiver to keep the file's actual name secret. Not allowed when sending more than one file [aliases: name]

       send-many
              Send a file to many recipients.

   send-many OPTIONS:
       -n, --tries <N>
              Only send the file up to n times, limiting the number of people that may receive it. These are also the number of tries a potential attacker gets at guessing the password [default: 30]

       --timeout <MINUTES>
              Automatically stop providing the file after a certain amount of time [default: 60]

       --code <CODE>
              Enter a code instead of generating one automatically

       -c, --code-length <NUMWORDS>
              Length of code (in bytes/words) [default: 2]

       --rename <FILE_NAME>
               Suggest a different name to the receiver to keep the file's actual name secret. Not allowed when sending more than one file [aliases: name]

       To send files, use `wormhole send <PATH>`.  To receive files, use `wormhole receive <CODE>`.
