SYNOPSIS
       vigor [-eFRrSsv] [-c cmd] [-t tag] [-w size] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       Vigor is a perpetration of the Microsoft Word "Office Assistant" paperclip, based on nvi. It was inspired by Pitr of the "User Friendly" comic strip (http://www.userfriendly.org/).  See nvi(1) for
       documentation of its command-line options.
