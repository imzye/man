NAME
       wrc - Wine Resource Compiler

SYNOPSIS
       wrc [options] [inputfile...]

DESCRIPTION
       wrc compiles resources from inputfile into win16 and win32 compatible binary format.

       The source file is preprocessed with a builtin ANSI-C compatible preprocessor before the resources are compiled. See PREPROCESSOR below.

       wrc  takes a series of inputfile as argument. The resources are read from standard input if no inputfile is given. If the output file is not specified with -o, then wrc will write the output to input‐
       file.res with .rc stripped, or to wrc.tab.res if no inputfile was given.

OPTIONS
       -D, --define=id[=val]
              Define preprocessor identifier id to (optionally) value val.  See also PREPROCESSOR below.

       --debug=nn
              Set debug level to nn. The value is a bitmask consisting of 1=verbose, 2=dump internals, 4=resource parser trace, 8=preprocessor messages, 16=preprocessor  scanner  and  32=preprocessor  parser
              trace.

       -E     Preprocess only. The output is written to standard output if no outputfile was selected. The output is compatible with what gcc would generate.

       -h, --help
              Prints a summary message and exits.

       -i, --input=file
              The  name  of  the  input file. If this option is not used, then wrc will use the first non-option argument as the input file name. If there are no non-option arguments, then wrc will read from
              standard input.

       -I, --include-dir=path
              Add path to the list of directories to search for includes. It is allowed to specify -I multiple times. Include files are searched in the order in which the -I options were specified.
              The search is compatible with gcc, in which '<>' quoted filenames are searched exclusively via the -I set path, whereas the '""' quoted filenames are first tried to be opened in the current di‐
              rectory. Also resource statements with file references are located in the same way.

       -J, --input-format=format
              Sets the input format. Valid options are 'rc' or 'rc16'. Setting the input to 'rc16' disables the recognition of win32 keywords.

       -l, --language=lang
              Set default language to lang. Default is the neutral language 0 (i.e. "LANGUAGE 0, 0").

       -m16, -m32, -m64
              Generate resources for 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit platforms respectively.  The only difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is whether the _WIN64 preprocessor symbol is defined.

       --nls-dir=dir
              Specify the directory to search for the NLS files containing the codepage mapping tables.

       --nostdinc
              Do not search the standard include path, look for include files only in the directories explicitly specified with the -I option.

       --no-use-temp-file
              Ignored for compatibility with windres.

       -o, -fo, --output=file
              Write output to file. Default is inputfile.res with .rc stripped or wrc.tab.res if input is read from standard input.

       -O, --output-format=format
              Sets the output format. The supported formats are po, pot, res, and res16.  If this option is not specified, the format defaults to res.
              In  po mode, if an output file name is specified it must match a known language name, like en_US.po; only resources for the specified language are output. If no output file name is specified, a
              separate .po file is created for every language encountered in the input.

       --pedantic
              Enable pedantic warnings. Notably redefinition of #define statements can be discovered with this option.

       --po-dir=dir
              Enable the generation of resource translations based on mo files loaded from the specified directory. That directory must follow the gettext convention, in particular it must  contain  one  .mo
              file for each language, and a LINGUAS file listing the available languages.

       -r     Ignored for compatibility with rc.

       --preprocessor=program
              This option may be used to specify the preprocessor to use, including any leading arguments. If not specified, wrc uses its builtin processor.  To disable preprocessing, use --preprocessor=cat.

       --sysroot=dir
              Prefix the standard include paths with dir.

       --utf8, -u
              Set the default codepage of the input file to UTF-8.

       -U, --undefine=id
              Undefine  preprocessor  identifier  id.   Please note that only macros defined up to this point are undefined by this command. However, these include the special macros defined automatically by
              wrc.  See also PREPROCESSOR below.

       --use-temp-file
              Ignored for compatibility with windres.

       -v, --verbose
              Turns on verbose mode (equivalent to -d 1).

       --version
              Print version and exit.

PREPROCESSOR
       The preprocessor is ANSI-C compatible with some of the extensions of the gcc preprocessor.

       The preprocessor recognizes these directives: #include, #define (both simple and macro), #undef, #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #else, #endif, #error, #warning, #line, # (both null- and line-directive),
       #pragma (ignored), #ident (ignored).

       The preprocessor sets by default several defines:
       RC_INVOKED      set to 1
       __WRC__         Major version of wrc
       __WRC_MINOR__   Minor version of wrc
       __WRC_PATCHLEVEL__   Patch level

       Win32 compilation mode also sets _WIN32 to 1.

       Special macros __FILE__, __LINE__, __TIME__ and __DATE__ are also recognized and expand to their respective equivalent.

LANGUAGE SUPPORT
       Language,  version  and  characteristics  can be bound to all resource types that have inline data, such as RCDATA. This is an extension to Microsoft's resource compiler, which lacks this support com‐
       pletely. Only VERSIONINFO cannot have version and characteristics attached, but languages are propagated properly if you declare it correctly before the VERSIONINFO resource starts.

       Example:

       1 RCDATA DISCARDABLE
       LANGUAGE 1, 0
       VERSION 312
       CHARACTERISTICS 876
       {
            1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "and whatever more data you want"
            '00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08'
       }

AUTHORS
       wrc was written by Bertho A. Stultiens and is a nearly complete rewrite of the first wine resource compiler (1994) by Martin von Loewis.  Additional resource-types were contributed by Ulrich  Czekalla
       and Albert den Haan. Many cleanups by Dimitrie O. Paun in 2002-2003.  Bugfixes have been contributed by many Wine developers.

BUGS
       - The preprocessor recognizes variable argument macros, but does not expand them correctly.
       - Error reporting should be more precise, as currently the column and line number reported are those of the next token.
       - Default memory options should differ between win16 and win32.

       There is no support for:
       - RT_DLGINCLUDE, RT_VXD, RT_PLUGPLAY and RT_HTML (unknown format)
       - PUSHBOX control is unsupported due to lack of original functionality.

       Fonts are parsed and generated, but there is no support for the generation of the FONTDIR yet. The user must supply the FONTDIR resource in the source to match the FONT resources.

       Bugs can be reported on the Wine bug tracker ⟨https://bugs.winehq.org⟩.
