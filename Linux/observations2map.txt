NAME
       observations2map - Transforms a set of pairs <pose,observation> into metric maps.

SYNOPSIS
       observations2map config_file.ini observations.simplemap output_maps_prefix

DESCRIPTION
       observations2map reads a multi metric map description from the config file and insert all the observations into it. Then it saves all the metric maps to independent files.  It can be used to generate
       point maps, occupancy grid maps, or any kind of maps from a sequence of localized observations.
