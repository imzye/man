NAME
       gracket - the GUI Racket implementation

SYNOPSIS
       gracket [ option ...  ] [ argument ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       GRacket is the GUI-application variant of racket.

       Run

          gracket --help

       for a list of command-line options and other start-up information.

       Supplying no arguments to gracket is the same as supplying the -i option for interactive evaluation.

       Supplying non-switch, non-configuration arguments to gracket is the same as putting -u before the arguments to run the first one as a module-based script.
