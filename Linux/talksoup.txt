NAME
       TalkSoup - IRC client for GNUstep

SYNOPSIS
       TalkSoup

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the TalkSoup command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have
       a manual page.

       TalkSoup is a GNUstep IRC client built on the extensibility of the Objective-C language. The entire IRC client is implemented by plugins, so one can pick and
       choose what they want to use.

SEE ALSO
       GNUstep(7).
