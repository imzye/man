NAME
       Check::ISA - DWIM, correct checking of an object's class.

VERSION
       Version 0.09

SYNOPSIS
           use Check::ISA;

           if (obj($foo, "SomeClass")) {
               $foo->some_method;
           }

           # instead of one of these methods:
           UNIVERSAL::isa($foo, "SomeClass") # WRONG
           ref $obj eq "SomeClass"; # VERY WRONG
           $foo->isa("SomeClass") # May die
           local $@; eval { $foo->isa("SomeClass") } # too long

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides several functions to assist in testing whether a value is an object, and if so asking about its class.

FUNCTIONS
       obj $thing, [ $class ]
           This function tests if $thing is an object.

           If $class is provided, it also tests tests whether "$thing->isa($class)".

           $thing  is  considered  an  object  if  it's blessed or a "GLOB" with a valid "IO" slot (the "IO" slot contains a FileHandle object which is the actual invocant).  This corresponds directly to
           "gv_fetchmethod".

       obj_does $thing, [ $class_or_role ]
           Just like "obj" but uses "DOES" in UNIVERSAL instead of "isa" in UNIVERSAL.

           "DOES" in UNIVERSAL is just like "isa" except it's use is encouraged to query about an interface, as opposed to the object structure. If "DOES" is not overridden by the ebject, calling  it  is
           semantically identical to calling "isa".

           This is probably reccomended over "obj" for interoperability but can be slower on Perls before 5.10.

           Note that "DOES" in UNIVERSAL

       inv $thing, [ $class_or_role ]
           Just like "obj_does", but also returns true for classes.

           Note that this method is slower, but is supposed to return true for any value you can call methods on (class, object, filehandle, etc).

           Look into autobox if you would like to be able to call methods on all values.

       obj_can $thing, $method
       inv_can $thing, $method
           Checks if $thing is an object or class, and calls "can" on $thing if appropriate.
