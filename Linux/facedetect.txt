NAME
       facedetect - simple face detector for batch processing

SYNOPSIS
       facedetect [-h] [--biggest] [--best] [-c] [-q] [-o OUTPUT] [-d] file

DESCRIPTION
       Facedetect  is  a  simple face detector for batch processing. It answers the basic question: "Is there a face in this image?" and gives back either an exit code or the coordinates of each detected
       face in the standard output.

       The aim is to provide a basic command-line interface that's consistent and easy to use with software such as ImageMagick, while progressively improving the detection algorithm over time.

       facedetect is used in software such as fgallery to improve the thumbnail cutting region, so that faces are always centered.

OPTIONS
   positional arguments:
       file   Input image file

   optional arguments:

              show this help message and exit

       --biggest
              Extract only the biggest face

       --best Extract only the best matching face

       -c, --center
              Print only the center coordinates

       -q, --query
              Query only (exit 0: face detected, 2: no detection)

       -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
              Image output file

       -d, --debug
              Add debugging metrics in the image output file
