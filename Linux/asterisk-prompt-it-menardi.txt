ASTMAN(1)                                                                              Linux Programmer's Manual                                                                             ASTMAN(1)

NAME
       astman -- a client to asterisk's manager interface

SYNOPSIS
       astman hostname

DESCRIPTION
       astman This program is a full-screen (terminal) client for Asterisk's manager interface.

OPTIONS
       hostname

       The host name or IP address to connect to (TCP port 5038). If astman fails to connect it will exit immediately.

USAGE
       If  astman has successfully cunnected to the manager port it will prompt the user for a username and a secret (password) for the manager interface on the remote Asterisk manager interface. It
       will then be able to report existing channels (calls). You will then be able to redirect calls to or terminate them.

SEE ALSO
       asterisk(8)

BUGS
       The hostname does not default to localhost.

       Impossible to use a port other than 5038.

       The username and password cannot be defined from the command-line.

       I mean, what's the point in a man page if the syntax is so simple?
