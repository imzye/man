NAME
       bdump - visualization of biniou data

SYNOPSIS
       bdump [Options...] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       bdump  prints biniou data files in human readable form. For the conversion of hash tags into meaningful names, bdump maintains a dictionary of words, see option -h.  New words can be added to this
       dictionary with -d and -w. The dictionary is saved between invocation, see option -x and -h.

       If the file argument is omitted, bdump reads data from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -d file
              load file containing words to add to the dictionary, one per line

       -h file
              set dictionary file for unhashing. Default is $HOME/.bdump-dict on Unix and $HOMEPATH_bdump-dict on Windows

       -w word1,word2,...
              add words to the dictionary

       -x     neither load nor update the dictionary file (see option -h)

       -help | --help
              print options and exit
