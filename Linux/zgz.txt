NAME
       zgz - Frankenstein's compressor

SYNOPSIS
       zgz [options] < file > file.gz

DESCRIPTION
       This program is an unholy combination of the BSD gzip program, a modified GNU gzip that supports setting an arbitrary file name and timestamp, and an old, rotting version of bzip2 that we dug up
       somewhere at midnight.  Only the bits to do with file compression were kept.

       There are many arcane options which aid pristine-gz(1) in re-animating files. Use --help to see all the gory details.
