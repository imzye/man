NAME
       Fotocx - photo/image editor and collection manager

DESCRIPTION
       Organize  and manage a large image collection. Edit and optimize photos and other images, add special effects, edit metadata, search images, create a photomontage, perform batch operations. Fotocx
       is a GTK GUI application.  The included user manual explains Fotocx operation in great detail.

LONG DESCRIPTION
       Fotocx is a free Linux program for editing photos or other images and managing a large collection. Fotocx has powerful editing tools to correct and enhance photos. Fotocx can  instantly  find  de‐
       sired images within a huge collection, based on file/folder names or embedded metadata such as date, tags/keywords, title, description, rating, location ... any metadata.
       Image  folders  can be viewed as a scrolling gallery of thumbnail images.  Navigation of folders and subfolders is simple and fast. Click a thumbnail for a full window view of the image. The image
       can be zoomed, panned and scrolled using the mouse. Gallery thumbnails can vary from small to huge.  Popup windows can be used to view or compare multiple images at any scale.  Thumbnail galleries
       are also used for image search results and albums.  Albums are selected images arranged in a desired order. Fotocx has many editing tools that go beyond the basics.  Images  with  severe  problems
       (underexposed,  false colors, blurred, uneven lighting, fog/haze) can be brought back to life. Details lost in shadows or haze can be brought out.  Images with distorted perspective (esp. wide-an‐
       gle views) can be corrected.
       Fotocx is standards compliant. Nothing done by Fotocx makes images less usable with other applications. Fotocx uses your image files wherever they are: they are not  moved  or  duplicated.  Fotocx
       does  create  an  index for fast image searching, and thumbnail images for fast gallery displays. These add typically 2% to overall storage requirements. There is no database to manage - the index
       manages itself.
       Fotocx can import RAW images and perform all processing in deep color (24 bits per color used internally). Edited images can be saved as JPEG, TIFF (8/16 bits/color), or PNG (8/16  bits).  Convert
       single RAW files or selected batches (click thumbnails from gallery pages).
       Image edit functions are interactive with rapid visual feedback, using the full image or a chosen zoom-in area. Undo and Redo can be applied serially to all the edits of an image. Intermediate and
       final results can be saved as new files or as new versions (e.g. filename.v02.jpg).
       Areas within an image can be selected and edited separately from the background. Areas can be selected using several methods: drag the mouse to select and flood into matching tones, follow feature
       edges,  or outline an area freehand. Complex feature edges, such as hair or foliage, can be accurately selected. Selected areas can be copied and pasted into the same or other images, resized, ro‐
       tated, brightened, etc.
       Layers are not used. Each edit step can be saved separately as a file
       An image can be "mouse painted" onto another image. Paint from a chosen source image location to a chosen destination, with optional rescale.
       Batch functions are available to copy, move, rename, resize, upright, convert format, convert RAW files, and add or revise metadata.
       Several tools are available to change size and shape: crop, rescale, rotate, fix perspective, curve/warp the whole image or selected areas within the image. There is a special  tool  to  'flatten'
       photos of curved surfaces, e.g. a page from a thick book or a poster on a round column.
       Text  can  be added to an image. Any font and size can be used, any color, any angle. The text can have variable transparency, an outline, a shadow, or an embossed effect - good for a signature or
       copyright. Other basic markups are available: lines, arrows, box, oval/circle.
       Advanced edit functions: Dust spots from old slides or photos can be removed, roadside trash or power lines can be erased. Panoramas can be made by stitching photos together seamlessly,  automati‐
       cally  matching  brightness and color. Photos with a range of exposure values can be combined into an HDR image with adjustable contributions. Photos with varying focus depths can be combined into
       an image that is sharp over the combined range. Photos of one scene taken at different moments can be combined to remove passing autos or tourists. Multiple photos made under low light  conditions
       can be combined to reduce noise. Images and text can be combined into a mashup (montage), using the mouse to position and resize the components and adjust overlaps and transparencies.
       Fotocx  has a batch scripting tool to speed the processing of multiple images requiring the same edits: record the edits made to a base image and then apply these edits automatically to any number
       of selected images.
       Many special effects ('filters') are available to convert a photo into a line drawing, sketch, painting, embossing, cartoon, dithered image, mosaic, or abstract patterns. Background  patterns  and
       textures can be added.
       Images  can  be rapidly searched using file and folder names or partial names, dates, assigned tags, ratings, locations, and any other metadata stored in the image. Some data is automatic from the
       camera (date, location, exposure data), and other data can be manually entered (tags, captions ...).  Search criteria can be used in combination; e.g. find Chicago photos for years 2008-2020  con‐
       taining tags 'Barbara' or 'Barbie'.
       Locations  (from  a  camera GPS sensor or entered manually) can also be searched. You can view a map of any region in the world, at any scale, using an internet map service. Images having location
       data show as markers on these maps. Click a marker to get a gallery of the corresponding images.  You can jump from a given photo to its location on a world map, where you can  find  other  photos
       from the same or nearby locations.
       Albums can be made using selected images from your collection. The files are not duplicated. Select images by clicking gallery thumbnails. Arrange the images with drag and drop. Albums can be made
       into slide shows. Choose animated transitions between images, pan and zoom effects, and places to auto-pause for narration.
       Fotocx  includes  a  comprehensive  user  manual,  also  used for interactive help: press F1 while using any function in Fotocx to see the corresponding topic. You should take the time to read the
       overview pages. The function details can be viewed as needed using F1.
