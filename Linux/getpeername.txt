NAME
       getpeername - get name of connected TCP/IP peer

SYNOPSIS
       getpeername [-n] [-p protocol]

DESCRIPTION
       getpeername  prints  the  IP  address and service name (port number) of the remote peer connected to standard input.  The IP address and the service name are printed on the same line, separated by one
       space.

OPTIONS
       -n     Don't translate IP addresses and port numbers to names.

       -p protocol
              Force getpeername to use protocol as the protocol when translating port numbers to service names.  Protocol can be tcp and udp.  Normally, getpeername  automatically  determines  what  type  of
              socket it is connected to.

SEE ALSO
       getpeername(3).

BUGS
       Only works on IP sockets.
