NAME
       remctl_error - Retrieve the error from a failed remctl operation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <remctl.h>

       const char *remctl_error(struct remctl *r);

DESCRIPTION
       remctl_error() returns the error from a previously failed remctl operation.  Its only argument is a remctl struct as returned by remctl_new().  If the previous remctl operation was successful,
       returns the constant string "No error".

       The caller may not modify the returned string.  The string may even be stored in read-only memory and attempting to modify it may cause a memory fault.  The returned pointer will be invalidated by
       the next call to any remctl API function with the same client object, other than remctl_error().

RETURN VALUE
       remctl_error() returns either the previous error or the constant string "No error".  It will never return NULL.

COMPATIBILITY
       This interface has been provided by the remctl client library since its initial release in version 2.0.
