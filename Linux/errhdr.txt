NAME
       errhdr - produce a C header file from a set of messages

SYNOPSIS
       errhdr [-2] [-s] msgfile [hdrfile]

DESCRIPTION
       errhdr reads a file describing error codes and corresponding messages and produces a C header file, either on standard output or in hdrfile.

       The input file has a simple text-based format; one file (errmsg/valid.msg in the source tree) starts

       MODULE valid
       $$ SEQ_INST, 1
       $^   ExtNotAllowed, 1
       # This is a comment
       A Bioseq "extension" is used for special classes of Bioseq. This class of
       Bioseq should not have one but it does. This is probably a software error.

       $^   ExtBadOrMissing, 2
       This class of Bioseq requires an "extension" but it is missing or of the
       wrong type. This is probably a software error.

       (Detailed descriptions are optional, and no "end" lines of any sort are necessary.)
