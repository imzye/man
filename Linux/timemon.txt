NAME
       TimeMon - CPU time usage monitor

SYNOPSIS
       TimeMon

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the TimeMon command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have
       a manual page.

       TimeMon gives a graphical representation of where the CPU cycles are going. It's coarse, but better than nothing.

SEE ALSO
       GNUstep(7).
