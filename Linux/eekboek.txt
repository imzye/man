NAME
       EekBoek - Bookkeeping software for small and medium-size businesses

SYNOPSIS
         ebshell

       EekBoek is a bookkeeping package for small and medium-size businesses.  Unlike other accounting software, EekBoek has both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user-interface (GUI).
       Furthermore, it has a complete Perl API to create your own custom applications.

       EekBoek is designed for the Dutch/European market and currently available in Dutch only. An English translation is in the works (help appreciated).
