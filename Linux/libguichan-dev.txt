NAME
       guichan - A set of libraries that provide fully extensible widgets for SDL, Allegro, and OpenGL.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the guichan library set, and the API provided.

       Guichan  is a fully extensible C++ set of libraries that provide an very complete API to easily get widgets for all games based on SDL, Allegro, and OpenGL.  The widgets are, of course, fully cus‐
       tomizable using the way of inheritance. The API is stable, strong and already quite well optimized.
