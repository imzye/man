NETSCRIPT-2.4.CONF(5)                                                                       File Formats Manual                                                                       NETSCRIPT-2.4.CONF(5)

NAME
       /etc/netscript/network.conf - interface, firewalling, and QoS configuration file.

       /etc/netscript/if.conf - interface setup shell script file

       /etc/netscript/qos.conf - QoS setup shell script file

       /etc/netscript/ipfilter.conf - IP iptables filtering shell script file

DESCRIPTION
       This manpage is a place holder until something better is written when the netscript itself has stopped changing rapidly.

       Please see the README file in the /etc/netscript directory, and READ the configuration files if you need to change them.  Apart from network.conf, all of them contain sh (1) shell script functions
       which  are  there  so  that  various things can be altered or hooked in at the right place. Network.conf contains the full network setup details, including special interface setup for the likes of
       ciped/pppd/wanconfig, and is fully commented with examples given.

SEE ALSO
       netscript(8), iptables(8), ip6tables(8), iproute(8), brcfg(8).
