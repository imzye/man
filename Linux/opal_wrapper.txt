NAME
       opal_wrapper - Back-end Open MPI wrapper command

SYNOPSIS
       opal_wrapper [options]

DESCRIPTION
       opal_wrapper  is  not  meant  to  be  called  directly  by  end users.  It is automatically invoked as the back-end by the Open MPI wrapper commands such as: mpicc, mpiCC, mpic++, and mpifort (and its
       legacy/deprecated names mpif77 and mpif90).

       Some Open MPI installations may have additional wrapper commands, and/or have renamed the wrapper compilers listed above to avoid executable name conflicts with other MPI implementations.  Hence,  you
       may also have wrapper compilers installed including the following names: mpifort.openmpi (and the legacy/deprecated names mpif90.openmpi and mpif77.openmpi), mpicxx.openmpi, mpiCC.openmpi, mpicc.open‐
       mpi, mpic++.openmpi, opalcc, opalc++, ortecc, and ortec++,

SEE ALSO
       The following may exist depending on your particular Open MPI installation: mpicc(1),  mpiCC(1),  mpic++(1),  mpifort(1),  mpifort.openmpi(1),  mpicxx.openmpi(1),  mpiCC.openmpi(1),  mpicc.openmpi(1),
       mpic++.openmpi(1), ortecc(1), ortec++(1), opalccc(1), and the website at http://www.openmpi.org/.
