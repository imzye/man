NAME
       startpar - start runlevel scripts in parallel

SYNOPSIS
       startpar [-p par] [-i iorate] [-e etcdir] [-n] [-t timeout] [-T global_timeout] [-a arg] prg1 prg2 ...
       startpar [-p par] [-i iorate] [-n] [-t timeout] [-T global_timeout] -M [ boot|start|stop]
       startpar [-f]
       startpar [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       startpar  is  used  to  run multiple run-level scripts in parallel.  The degree of parallelism on one CPU can be set with the -p option, the default is full parallelism.  An argument to all of the
       scripts can be provided with the -a option.  Processes blocked by pending I/O will cause new process creation to be weighted by the iorate factor 800.  To change this factor the option -i  can  be
       used  to  specify  another  value.  The amount weight=(nblocked×iorate)/1000 will be subtracted from the total number of processes which could be started, where nblocked is the number of processes
       currently blocked by pending I/O.

       The output of each script is buffered and written when the script exits, so output lines of different scripts won't mix.  You can modify this behaviour by setting a timeout.

       The timeout set with the -t option is used as buffer timeout.  If the output buffer of a script is not empty and the last output was timeout seconds ago, startpar will flush the buffer.

       The -T option timeout works more globally.  If no output is printed for more than global_timeout seconds, startpar will flush the buffer of the script with the oldest output.  Afterwards  it  will
       only print output of this script until it is finished.

       When the -n flag is used, output from a running job is prefixed with the name of the program or script being run.

       The -M option switches startpar into a make(1) like behaviour.  This option takes three different arguments: boot, start, and stop for reading .depend.boot or .depend.start or .depend.stop respec‐
       tively in the directory /etc/init.d/.  By scanning the boot and runlevel scripts in /etc/init.d/ it then executes the appropriate scripts in parallel.

       The -e option allows the user to set the location of the system's etc configuration directory.  The default is to use /etc.  Using -e we can use alternative locations such as /usr/local/etc.

       The  -f option causes startpar to copy standard input (stdin) to standard output (stdout) until startpar reaches the end of input or the process is killed.  When -f is used no programs are started
       and other parameters on the command line are ignored.  This option is only kept for legacy purposes.

       The -v option tells startpar to print its name and version number.  When the version flag is used, all other command line parameters are ignored.  The version number will be printed  and  startpar
       then immediately exits.
