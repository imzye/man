       wayland-info [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       wayland-info is a utility for displaying information about the Wayland protocols supported by a Wayland compositor.

       It can be used to check which Wayland protocols and versions are advertised by the Wayland compositor.

       wayland-info also provides additional information for a subset of Wayland protocols it knows about, namely Linux DMABUF, presentation time, tablet and XDG output protocols.

OPTIONS
       wayland-info accepts the following line options:

       -h, --help
               Print a summary of command line options, and quit.

       -i, --interface interface
               Only print information about the Wayland globals containing the string interface in their name.

ENVIRONMENT
       WAYLAND_DISPLAY
              The  name of the display (socket) of an already running Wayland server, without the path. The directory path is always taken from XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.  If WAYLAND_DISPLAY is not set, the socket
              name is "wayland-0".
