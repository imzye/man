NAME
       Rose::DB::Constants - Symbolic names for important Rose::DB constants.

SYNOPSIS
         use Rose::DB::Constants qw(IN_TRANSACTION);
         ...

         $ret = $db->begin_work or die $db->error;
         ...
         unless($ret == IN_TRANSACTION)
         {
           $db->commit or die $db->error;
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains and optionally exports symbolic names for important Rose::DB constants.  The only constant defined so far is "IN_TRANSACTION".  See the documentation for Rose::DB's
       begin_work() object method for more information on this constant.

       This module inherits from "Exporter".  No symbols are exported by default.
