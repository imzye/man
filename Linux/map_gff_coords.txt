NAME
       map_gff_coords - Map coordinates of GFF features from one genome to another using a Mercator multiple alignment

SYNOPSIS
       map_gff_coords [options] <source genome> <source GFF file> <target genome>

DESCRIPTION
       map_gff_coords from FSA 1.15.9

       Map coordinates of GFF features from one genome to another using a Mercator multiple alignment.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this message

       -t, --type <string>
              only look at features of particular type

       -D, --data <directory>
              path to map, genome and alignment files

       -M, --map <directory>
              path to map and genome files

       -A, --align <directory>
              path to alignment files

       -L, --lazy
              warn, rather than die, if the subalignment can't be obtained

       -U, --truncate
              truncate unmappable sequence (rather than skipping) and show truncated subalignment

       -f, --force-entry
              if a feature can't be mapped, then add an empty entry to the GFF file (rather than skipping it entirely); implies --lazy

       -e, --verbose
              report progress

       PLEASE NOTE: While this program is reasonably fast if the GFF is properly ordered by chromosome and the start and end coordinates of features, it will be *very slow* if the GFF is not sorted.  Assumes
       that the "seqid" or "name" field (the first field) of the GFF entries holds the chromosome name.

       Note that the GFF specification defines coordinates to be 1-based and fully-closed, therefore representing the interval [start, end].  Conformance to this specification is assumed internally.

       If requested, unmappable sequence will be truncated to the mappable portion; note that the truncation will favor the beginning of the requested sequence.

       If a GFF feature is on the + strand for the source genome but the corresponding homologous region in the target genome is on the - strand, then the mapped GFF feature will be  reported  as  on  the  -
       strand.
