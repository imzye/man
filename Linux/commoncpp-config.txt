NAME
       commoncpp-config - script to get information about common c++ library

SYNOPSIS
       commoncpp-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--cflags] [--libs] [--includes]

DESCRIPTION
       commoncpp-config is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the commonc++ library.  Note: commoncpp-config
       is provided for compatibility with legacy software only.  Current projects should use pkg-config instead!

OPTIONS
       --version
              Print the currently installed version of common c++ on the standard output.

       --includes
              Print the include directory for commonc++ headers

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program with commonc++

       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program with commonc++

       --prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that common c++ was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for  the  exec
              prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
              If  specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that common c++ was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option must be specified be‐
              fore any --libs or --cflags options.
