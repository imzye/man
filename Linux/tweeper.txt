NAME
       tweeper - web scraper to convert supported websites (e.g. Twitter.com) to RSS

SYNOPSIS
       tweeper [OPTIONS] URL

DESCRIPTION
       tweeper(1) is a web scraper which can be used to conveniently follow the public activity of social network users without the need to log in or even be subscribed to the social network; tweeper
       converts the public information to RSS so that it can be accessed and collected by a feed reader.

       tweeper started as the TWitter fEEd scraPER but support for other web sites has been added.

       The sites that tweeper is able to scrape and convert to RSS are:

       •   Twitter.com

       •   Pump.io based websites, like Identi.ca

       •   Dilbert.com

       •   Instagram.com

       •   Facebook.com (public pages)

       tweeper can be used as:

        1. a command line tool;

        2. a filter for feed readers;

        3. a web based tool when used with a PHP-enabled web server.

OPTIONS
       -e
           show links to supported media files in the RSS <enclosure/> element

       -m <0|1>
           enable or disable showing multimedia content (e.g. Twitter or Instagram pictures) directly inside the item description. Default is 1 (enable).

       -u <0|1>
           enable or disable showing usernames in front of the item for hosts which supports it (Twitter.com/Instagram.com). Default is 1 (enable).

       -v <0|1>
           enable or disable showing verbose output like, for instance, non-fatal errors and warnings from the XML parser. Default is 1 (enable).

       -h, --help
           show the help message

EXAMPLE OF USE
       Getting the RSS feed of some Twitter user:

           tweeper https://twitter.com/NSACareers

       Using tweeper as a filter for the Liferea feed reader:

           liferea-add-feed  "|tweeper https://twitter.com/NSAcareers"

       To use tweeper via web there are two options (the examples assume the installation directory to be /usr/share/php/tweeper/):

        1. Using the PHP built-in web server:

               php -S localhost:8000 -t /usr/share/php/tweeper/

           and then visit http://localhost:8000/tweeper.php in the web browser.

        2. Using a generic web server with the document root in /var/www:

               sudo ln -s /usr/share/php/tweeper/tweeper.php /var/www
               xdg-open http://localhost/tweeper.php?src_url=http://twitter.com/NSAcareers

           It is enough to create the symlink only the very first time tweeper is used this way.

NOTES
       In order to use tweeper with a symlink with the apache userdir module, the SymLinksIfOwnerMatch option must be replaced by FollowSymlink in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf

EXIT STATUS
       0
           Success

       !0
           Failure
