NAME
       mp3splt‐gtk — Gtk utility for mp3/ogg splitting without decoding.

SYNOPSIS
       mp3splt‐gtk [-d Directory ] [ Filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       mp3splt‐gtk  is  a  free software that allows you to split mp3 and ogg files from several splitpoints, without need of decoding and reencoding.  It is useful to split large mp3/ogg to make smaller
       files or to split entire albums to obtain original tracks.

       If you are splitting an album you can get splitpoints and filenames automatically from servers on internet like tracktype.org or from a local .XMCD (.CDDB) or .CUE file, with  the  possibility  to
       adjust them automatically with silence detection.

       You can also split files automatically with silence detection, or by a fixed time length.

       If you have a file created either with Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap, you can easily split it.

       The  whole  program  is  controlled by a self-describing GUI and documented in the gnome help system. Optionally the name of the input file and the output directory can be specified on the command
       line (see above).
