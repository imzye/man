IRPIPE(1)                        User Commands                       IRPIPE(1)

NAME
       irpipe - tool to send data to lircd over /dev/irpipe kernel device.

SYNOPSIS
       irpipe [options] <file

       irpipe --read [options] >file

       irpipe --filter [options] <infile >outfile

DESCRIPTION
       irpipe  is designed to feed data to lircd(8) over a /dev/irpipe device.
       It's a tool to enter test data to lircd in a way which is identical  to
       real data from /dev/lirc devices.

       irpipe  uses  two  formats: text and binary. The binary format is docu‐
       mented in the lirc(4) manual page. The text format  is  as  defined  in
       mode2(1).

       The  irpipe  driver  allows  user   to set the features returned by the
       LIRC_GET_FEATURES ioctl. These are documented in lirc(4).

       The irpipe kernel device is often not built in packaged lirc  versions.
       See [KERNEL DRIVER] below.

OPTIONS
       -d --device=driver
              Set kernel device, default is /dev/irpipe0.

       -b --bin2text
              Convert binary data to text.

       -t --text2bin
              Convert text data to binary.

       -s --add-sync
              Add  long  initial  sync  on  converted  output.  This  is often
              required for lircd to be able to decode data, in  particular  if
              keys are not repeated.

       -f --filter
              Send data from stdin to stdout

       -r --read
              Send  data  from kernel device to stdout. This option is experi‐
              mental and not tested.

       -l--length=bits
              Set kernel device signal length. This is only meaningful on LIR‐
              CCODE device emulation.

       -F--features=bitmask
              Set  the  features bitmask, as returned by the LIRC_GET_FEATURES
              ioctl. See lirc(4) for more.

       -h --help
              Display usage summary.

       -v --version
              Display version.

KERNEL DRIVER
       The irpipe tool is designed to work  with  the  irpipe  kernel  driver,
       although the --filter option works without it. This driver is often not
       built in packaged versions. If this is the  case,  the  driver  can  be
       built  from sources in the drivers/irpipe directory. This requires ker‐
       nel sources installed. The drivers/irpipe/README  provides  information
       on building and installing the driver.
