NAME
       hatariui - Python/Gtk UI for Hatari

SYNOPSIS
       hatariui | hatariui.py [options] [directory|diskimage|program]

DESCRIPTION
       hatariui  is  a  Python/Gtk UI for Hatari which can either embed the Hatari window (on X11 systems) or run in a separate window.  By default it provides normal application menus and some extra buttons
       for faster access to fast-forward and other functionality, but these are fully configurable with the command line options. While it lacks support for some of  the  Hatari  configuration  options  that
       Hatari's SDL GUI has, it also supports some options that the Hatari's built-in SDL UI doesn't.

       Besides  the  UI configurability, some of the other advantages hatariui has over the SDL interface included with Hatari itself are use of a normal Gtk file selector with all of its features (directory
       shortcuts etc), support for UTF-8 (in file names) and in general blending better to the user's desktop environment.

       Additionally, Hatari can run while one uses UI configuration dialogs, and it can stop Hatari completely to better save the battery on mobile computers.  For devices without a keyboard, it offers  a  a
       text input dialog and one can configure (from command line) buttons for often used strings.

HATARIUI / HATARIUI.PY
       hatariui  is a shell script wrapper for the hatariui.py Python script.  It's used to run the Python script with suitable options for default usage, and to set up the correct installation directory for
       rest of the Hatari UI Python scripts and data files.

       Options below are actually for the hatariui.py script.  If you want to change options given for it, modify the hatariui shell script or make your own based on the installed one.
