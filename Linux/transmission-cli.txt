NAME
       transmission-cli — a bittorrent client

SYNOPSIS
       transmission-cli -h
       transmission-cli [-b | -B] [-d number | -D] [-er | -ep | -et] [-f script] [-g directory] [-h] [-m | -M] [-p port] [--tos tos] [-u number | -U] [-v] [-w directory] torrent-file

DESCRIPTION
       The transmission-cli program is a lightweight, command-line BitTorrent client with scripting capabilities.

       The options are as follows:

       -b --blocklist
               Enable peer blocklists. Transmission understands the bluetack blocklist file format.  New blocklists can be added by copying them into the config-dir's "blocklists" subdirectory.

       -B --no-blocklist
               Disable blocklists.

       -d --downlimit number
               Set the maximum download speed in KB/s

       -D --no-downlimit
               Don't limit the download speed

       -er --encryption-required
               Encrypt all peer connections.

       -ep --encryption-preferred
               Prefer encrypted peer connections.

       -et --encryption-tolerated
               Prefer unencrypted peer connections.

       -f --finish script
               Set a script to run when the torrent finishes

       -g --config-dir directory
               Where to look for configuration files. This can be used to swap between using the cli, daemon, gtk, and qt clients.  See https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/Config‐
               uration-Files.md for more information.

       -h --help
               Prints a short usage summary.

       -m --portmap
               Enable portmapping via NAT-PMP or UPnP

       -M --no-portmap
               Disable portmapping

       -p --port port
               Set the port to listen for incoming peers. (Default: 51413)

       --tos tos
               Use a ToS or DSCP name to set the peer socket service type for
               local router-based traffic shaping. Valid values are a decimal
               value 0-255, or any of these DSCP strings:

               “af11”, “af12”, “af13”, “af21”, “af22”, “af23”, “af31”, “af32”, “af33”, “af41”, “af42”, “af43”, “cs0”, “cs1”, “cs2”, “cs3”, “cs4”, “cs5”, “cs6”, “cs7”, “ef”, “le” These ToS keys are depre‐
               cated and will be removed in the future: “default”, “lowcost”, “lowdelay,” “reliability”, “throughput”

       -u --uplimit number
               Set the maximum upload speed in KB/s

       -U --no-uplimit
               Don't limit the upload speed

       -v --verify
               Verify the torrent's downloaded data.

       -w --download-dir directory
               Where to save downloaded data.

SIGNALS
       In addition to these options, sending transmission-cli a SIGHUP signal will contact the tracker for more peers.

ENVIRONMENT
       TRANSMISSION_HOME
                   Sets the default config-dir.

       http_proxy  libcurl uses this environment variable when performing tracker announces.

FILES
       ~/.config/transmission
               Directory where transmission-cli keeps torrent information for future seeding and resume operations.

AUTHORS
       The transmission-cli program was written by Eric Petit, Josh Elsasser, Charles Kerr, Mitchell Livingston, and Mike Gelfand.
