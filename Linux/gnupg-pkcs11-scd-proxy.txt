NAME
       gnupg-pkcs11-scd-proxy — GnuPG-compatible smart-card proxy daemon gnupg-pkcs11-scd-proxy-server — GnuPG-compatible smart-card proxy server daemon

SYNOPSIS
       gnupg-pkcs11-scd-proxy [--multi-server] [--socket file] [--verbose] [--log-file file] [--help]
       gnupg-pkcs11-scd-proxy-server [--socket file] [--socket-group group] [--scd file] [--scd-config file] [--verbose] [--log-file file] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       gnupg-pkcs11-scd-proxy is a drop-in replacement for the smart-card daemon (scd) shipped with the next-generation GnuPG (gnupg-2). The daemon is a proxy into gnupg-pkcs11-scd-proxy-server which can
       be run within different security context to load the gnupg-pkcs11-scd smart-card daemon.

       The  communications between the proxy and the server is unix socket based.  The assuan socket is created as world readable but with a specific user ACL, so that only initiating user can connect to
       the daemon.

       The recommended version of gnupg is 2.1 since in this version the gnupg-pkcs11-scd configuration does not specify any specific key information and can be used as generic for all users.

       The following options are available:

       --multi-server
           Run in multi-server mode (foreground). In addition to communicating over stdin/stdout, the server also opens an additional listening UNIX socket.

       --socket file
           Socket name, default should be sufficient.

       --socket-group group
           A custom group to set for the proxy server socket, this may serve first level of access control.

       --scd file
           The smartcard daemon location, default should be sufficient.

       --scd-config file
           The smartcard daemon configuration, required parameter.

       --verbose
           Be verbose while running.

       --no-detach
           Do not detach from console (useful for debugging purposes).

       --log-file file
           Output log to file.

       --help
           Print help information.

       When the daemon receives any of the SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGINT signals, it cleans up and exits.
