NAME
       pyacidobasic - program to plot simulated curves for acido-basic titrations

SYNOPSIS

       pyacidobasic [<FILE>]

DESCRIPTION
       pyacidobasic is a program to simulate acido-basic titrations. It plots interactively the variations of pH driven by the addition of a variable volume of a selected acid or base.

       You can interactively view the concentration of all chemical species which vary with the addition of the variable volume of acid or base

PARAMETERS
       You can specify one file as a parameter; then pyacidobasic will try to open it and restore from its contents. This file must be previously saved by pyacidobasic. The preferred suffix for such
       files is .acb.
