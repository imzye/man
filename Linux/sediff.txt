NAME
       sediff - SELinux policy difference tool

SYNOPSIS
       sediff [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION] POLICY1 POLICY2

DESCRIPTION
       Determine the differences between two SELinux policies.

POLICY
       A single file containing a binary policy. This file is usually named by
       version on Linux systems, for example, policy.30. This file is  usually
       named  sepolicy on Android systems.  If not provided, sediff will print
       an error message and exit.

EXPRESSIONS
       The user may specify an expression listing the policy elements to  dif‐

       ined.

DIFFERENCES
       sediff categorizes differences in policy elements  into  one  of  three
       forms.

              added  The element exists only in the modified policy.

              removed
                     The element exists only in the original policy.

              modified
                     The  element  exists  in  both  policies but its semantic
                     meaning has changed.  For example, a class is modified if
                     one or more permissions are added or removed.
