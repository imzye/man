NAME
       nfanon - netflow anonymisation

SYNOPSIS
       nfanon [options]

DESCRIPTION
       nfanon  is  used  to  anonymise  all IP addresses ( src, dst, next hop,
       router IP etc. ) in the netflow records using the CryptoPAn (Cryptogra‐
       phy-based   Prefix-preserving Anonymization) module. The key -K is used
       to initialize the Rijndael cipher.  The key is either  a  32  character
       string, or a 64 hex digit string starting with 0x.

          See  http://www.cc.gatech.edu/computing/Telecomm/cryptopan/ for more
          information about CryptoPAn.

       nfanon has several modes of operation.

       o nfanon reads a sequence of input files, specified by -r,  -R  and  -M
       and  anonymises  the flows in the given files. The input file arguments
       have the same syntax and meaning as nfdump(1).

       o nfanon reads a sequence of input files, specified by -r, -R  and  -M.
       All anonymised flows are written to a single file specified by -w.

       o  nfanon  works  as  filter and reads flows from stding and writes the
       anonymised flows to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -r inputfile
          Read input data from inputfile. Default is read from stdin.

       -R expr
          Read input from a sequence of files in the same directory. expr  may
          be one of:
           /any/dir          Read recursively all files in directory dir.
           /dir/file         Read all files beginning with file.
           /dir/file1:file2  Read all files from file1 to file2.

           Note: files are read in alphabetical sequence.

       -M expr
          Read   input   from   multiple   directories.   expr   looks   like:
          /any/path/to/dir1:dir2:dir3 etc. and will be expanded to the  direc‐
          tories:  /any/path/to/dir1,  /any/path/to/dir2 and /any/path/to/dir3
          Any number of colon separated directories may be given. The files to
          read  are specified by -r or -R and are expected to exist in all the
          given directories.  The options -r  and  -R  must  not  contain  any
          directory part when used in conjunction with -M.

       -w outputfile
          If specified writes anonymised netflow records to outputfile.

       -K key
          The  key  is used to initialize the Rijndael cipher. key is either a
          32 character string, or a 64 hex digit string starting with 0x.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns
           0   No error.
           255 Initialization failed.
           250 Internal error.

NOTES
       None.
