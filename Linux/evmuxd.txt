NAME
       evmuxd - Event Device Multiplexing Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       evmuxd device

DESCRIPTION
       This tool creates two Linux virtual keyboards and forwards the events
       from a given physical keyboard to either of the two. It's possible to
       switch the target of the redirect with a special key press.

       This is useful when the user wants to assign a special purpose to one
       of the keyboard while grabbing it (such as exporting the keyboard via
       btkbdd(8)) while still retaining the local keyboard functionality on
       his system.

       The virtual keyboard have a sysfs attribute "name" set to "evmuxd
       primary" and "evmuxd secondary" with the primary one being chosen by
       default.

       The special key used is "SCROLL LOCK".

OPTIONS
       device
           Linux input subsystem event device to use as event source.

EXAMPLES
       Use with udev(7) and systemd(1) is recommended. Look into
       89-evmuxd.rules and evmuxd@.service files distributed with evmuxd for
       examples.

BUGS
       It's possible to create only two devices.

       It's not possible to configure the magic key.

       It's not possible to control the virtual keyboard metadata, such as
       name, product and vendor IDs or version.

       Only keyboard input devices are supported.
