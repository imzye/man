NAME
       nsvi - transfer a zone, edit it, then upload the edits

SYNOPSIS
       nsvi [-01cCdDhvV] [-k keyfile] [-y [hmac:]name:key]
            [-S mode|num] [-s server] <zone>

DESCRIPTION
       The nsvi program makes an AXFR request for the zone, runs your editor so you can make whatever changes you require, then it runs nsdiff | nsupdate to push those changes to the server.

       Automatically-maintained DNSSEC records are stripped from the zone before it is passed to your editor, and you do not need to manually adjust the SOA serial number.

OPTIONS
       Most nsvi options are passed to nsdiff and some to nsupdate.

       -h  Display this documentation.

       -V  Display version information.

       -v  Verbose mode.

       -n  Interactive confirmation.

           When you quit the editor, you will be shown the changes, then asked whether to make the update (press U or Y), edit again (press E or R), or quit (press another key).

       -01cCdD
       -S mode|num
           These options are passed to nsdiff.  For details see the nsdiff manual.

       -s server[#port]
           Transfer the zone from the server given in this option, and send the update request to the same place. You can specify the server host name or IP address, optionally followed by a "#" and the port
           number.

           If you do not use the -s option, the zone will be transferred from localhost, and nsvi will use nsupdate -l to update the zone.

       -k keyfile
           TSIG key file, passed to dig, nsdiff, and nsupdate.

       -y [hmac:]name:key
           Literal TSIG key, passed to dig, nsdiff, and nsupdate.

ENVIRONMENT
       TMPDIR
           Location for temporary files.

       VISUAL
       EDITOR
           Which editor to use. $VISUAL is used if it is set, otherwise $EDITOR, otherwise vi.
