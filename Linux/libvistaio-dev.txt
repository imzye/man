VistaIOWarning(3)                                                                         Library Functions Manual                                                                        VistaIOWarning(3)

NAME
       VistaIOWarning, VistaIOSystemWarning - report a nonfatal error

SYNOPSIS
       void VistaIOWarning (format [, arg...])
              VistaIOStringConst format;

       void VistaIOSystemWarning (format [, arg...])
              VistaIOStringConst format;

ARGUMENTS
       format    Specifies the format of the message that is to be reported.

       arg       Specifies values that are to be included in the formatted message.

DESCRIPTION
       VistaIOWarning  is  called to report a nonfatal error. It composes an error message and passes it to the nonfatal error handler, which typically prints the message and returns (see VistaIOSetWarn‐
       ingHandler(3)).

       The message composed by VistaIOWarning is of the form:

              Program: Warning: Description.

       Program, the program's name, is included if it has been previously established with a call to VistaIOSetProgramName. Description is a string that has been formatted by sprintf using  format,  plus
       all of the optional arguments, arg.

       VistaIOSystemWarning is identical to VistaIOWarning except that it also includes in the message a phrase based on the current value of the external variable errno, which is used by system calls to
       return diagnostic codes. The message composed by VistaIOSystemWarning is of the form:

              Program: Warning: Description: Diagnostic.

       Diagnostic is a short phrase corresponding to the value of errno. This phrase is drawn from the table used by perror(3).

EXAMPLES
       In this first example, the values of attr_name, act_value, and exp_value are incorporated into the error message produced by VistaIOWarning.

              char *attr_name;
              float act_value, exp_value;

              if (act_value != exp_value)
                   VistaIOWarning ("MyRoutine: Attribute %s is %f rather than %f",
                        attr_name, act_value, exp_value);

       In this second example, the diagnostic phrase corresponding to the value of errno is incorporated into the error message produced by VistaIOSystemWarning.

              if (ioctl (fd, request, arg) == -1)
                   VistaIOSystemWarning ("MyRoutine: ioctl failed");
