NAME
       common-lisp-controller - Common Lisp system management tool

DESCRIPTION
       The  common-lisp-controller  system  will  manage  the installed Common Lisp implementations and libraries on the system. The main function is to enable every user to load any available library and to
       store the compiled files in a user and implementation specific cache directory.

       On upgrades of either implementations or libraries these directories will be cleared so that no old fasl files will remain.

       There are also options to add libraries by default to new images, see /usr/share/doc/common-lisp-controller/README.Debian , or to add user specific libraries to the management system,  see  clc-regis‐
       ter-user-package.

EXAMPLES
       To load a clc library :foo on a clc enabled implementation simply do

       (clc:clc-require :foo)

FILES
       /var/cache/common-lisp/ <uid> / <implementation-name> / <library> the cache directory for a library fir a given user with associated uid and a certain implementation.

       /usr/share/common-lisp/systems/ the location of the libraries.

BUGS
       Bug reports should be sent to the Debian BTS, preferably with reportbug.
