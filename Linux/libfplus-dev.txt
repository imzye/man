SYNOPSIS
       libfplus is a header-only C++ library.

DESCRIPTION
       The libfplus header-only library is aimed at allowing developers to write concise and readable C++ code.

       From the project home page:

       FunctionalPlus is a small header-only library supporting you in reducing code noise and in dealing with only one single level of abstraction at a time. By increasing brevity and maintainability of
       your  code it can improve productivity (and fun!) in the long run. It pursues these goals by providing pure and easy-to-use functions that free you from implementing commonly used flows of control
       over and over again.

EXAMPLE
       • To include files from the libfplus library, write an inclusion statement of this sort:

         #include <fplus/fplus.hpp>

       • In CMake-based projects, simply use the following statement:

         find_package(FunctionalPlus);

         Then, target_link_libraries(TARGET FunctionalPlus::plus...).
