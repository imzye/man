NAME
       llvm-objcopy - object copying and editing tool

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-objcopy [options] input [output]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-objcopy is a tool to copy and manipulate objects. In basic usage, it makes a semantic copy of the input to the output. If any options are specified, the
       output may be modified along the way, e.g. by removing sections.

       If no output file is specified, the input file is modified in-place. If “-” is specified for the input file, the input is read from  the  program’s  standard
       input stream. If “-” is specified for the output file, the output is written to the standard output stream of the program.

       If the input is an archive, any requested operations will be applied to each archive member individually.

       The tool is still in active development, but in most scenarios it works as a drop-in replacement for GNU’s objcopy.

GENERIC AND CROSS-PLATFORM OPTIONS
       The following options are either agnostic of the file format, or apply to multiple file formats.

       --add-gnu-debuglink <debug-file>
              Add a .gnu_debuglink section for <debug-file> to the output.

       --add-section <section=file>
              Add a section named <section> with the contents of <file> to the output. For ELF objects the section will be of type SHT_NOTE, if the name starts with
              “.note”. Otherwise, it will have type SHT_PROGBITS. Can be specified multiple times to add multiple sections.

              For MachO objects, <section> must be formatted as <segment name>,<section name>.

       --binary-architecture <arch>, -B
              Ignored for compatibility.

       --disable-deterministic-archives, -U
              Use real values for UIDs, GIDs and timestamps when updating archive member headers.

       --discard-all, -x
              Remove most local symbols from the output. Different file formats may limit this to a subset of the local symbols. For example, file and section  sym‐
              bols in ELF objects will not be discarded. Additionally, remove all debug sections.

       --dump-section <section>=<file>
              Dump  the contents of section <section> into the file <file>. Can be specified multiple times to dump multiple sections to different files.  <file> is
              unrelated to the input and output files provided to llvm-objcopy and as such the normal copying and editing operations will still be performed. No op‐
              erations are performed on the sections prior to dumping them.

              For MachO objects, <section> must be formatted as <segment name>,<section name>.

       --enable-deterministic-archives, -D
              Enable deterministic mode when copying archives, i.e. use 0 for archive member header UIDs, GIDs and timestamp fields. On by default.

       --help, -h
              Print a summary of command line options.

       --only-keep-debug
              Produce a debug file as the output that only preserves contents of sections useful for debugging purposes.

              For  ELF  objects,  this  removes the contents of SHF_ALLOC sections that are not SHT_NOTE by making them SHT_NOBITS and shrinking the program headers
              where possible.

       --only-section <section>, -j
              Remove all sections from the output, except for sections named <section>.  Can be specified multiple times to keep multiple sections.

              For MachO objects, <section> must be formatted as <segment name>,<section name>.

       --redefine-sym <old>=<new>
              Rename symbols called <old> to <new> in the output. Can be specified multiple times to rename multiple symbols.

       --redefine-syms <filename>
              Rename symbols in the output as described in the file <filename>. In the file, each line represents a single symbol to rename, with the old  name  and
              new  name separated by whitespace. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored, as is anything following a ‘#’. Can be specified multiple times to read
              names from multiple files.

       --regex
              If specified, symbol and section names specified by other switches are treated as extended POSIX regular expression patterns.

       --remove-section <section>, -R
              Remove the specified section from the output. Can be specified multiple times to remove multiple sections simultaneously.

              For MachO objects, <section> must be formatted as <segment name>,<section name>.

       --set-section-alignment <section>=<align>
              Set the alignment of section <section> to <align>`. Can be specified multiple times to update multiple sections.

       --set-section-flags <section>=<flag>[,<flag>,...]
              Set section properties in the output of section <section> based on the specified <flag> values. Can be specified multiple  times  to  update  multiple
              sections.

              Supported  flag  names are alloc, load, noload, readonly, exclude, debug, code, data, rom, share, contents, merge and strings. Not all flags are mean‐
              ingful for all object file formats.

              For ELF objects, the flags have the following effects:

              • alloc = add the SHF_ALLOC flag.

              • load = if the section has SHT_NOBITS type, mark it as a SHT_PROGBITS section.

              • readonly = if this flag is not specified, add the SHF_WRITE flag.

              • exclude = add the SHF_EXCLUDE flag.

              • code = add the SHF_EXECINSTR flag.

              • merge = add the SHF_MERGE flag.

              • strings = add the SHF_STRINGS flag.

              • contents = if the section has SHT_NOBITS type, mark it as a SHT_PROGBITS section.

              For COFF objects, the flags have the following effects:

              • alloc = add the IMAGE_SCN_CNT_UNINITIALIZED_DATA and IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ flags, unless the load flag is specified.

              • noload = add the IMAGE_SCN_LNK_REMOVE and IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ flags.

              • readonly = if this flag is not specified, add the IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE flag.

              • exclude = add the IMAGE_SCN_LNK_REMOVE and IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ flags.

              • debug = add the IMAGE_SCN_CNT_INITIALIZED_DATA, IMAGE_SCN_MEM_DISCARDABLE and  IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ flags.

              • code = add the IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE, IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE and IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ flags.

              • data = add the IMAGE_SCN_CNT_INITIALIZED_DATA and IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ flags.

              • share = add the IMAGE_SCN_MEM_SHARED and IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ flags.

       --strip-all-gnu
              Remove all symbols, debug sections and relocations from the output. This option is equivalent to GNU objcopy’s --strip-all switch.

       --strip-all, -S
              For ELF objects, remove from the output all symbols and non-alloc sections not within segments, except for .gnu.warning, .ARM.attribute  sections  and
              the section name table.

              For COFF and Mach-O objects, remove all symbols, debug sections, and relocations from the output.

       --strip-debug, -g
              Remove all debug sections from the output.

       --strip-symbol <symbol>, -N
              Remove all symbols named <symbol> from the output. Can be specified multiple times to remove multiple symbols.

       --strip-symbols <filename>
              Remove  all  symbols  whose names appear in the file <filename>, from the output. In the file, each line represents a single symbol name, with leading
              and trailing whitespace ignored, as is anything following a ‘#’. Can be specified multiple times to read names from multiple files.

       --strip-unneeded-symbol <symbol>
              Remove from the output all symbols named <symbol> that are local or undefined and are not required by any relocation.

       --strip-unneeded-symbols <filename>
              Remove all symbols whose names appear in the file <filename>, from the output, if they are local or undefined and are not required by any  relocation.
              In the file, each line represents a single symbol name, with leading and trailing whitespace ignored, as is anything following a ‘#’. Can be specified
              multiple times to read names from multiple files.

       --strip-unneeded
              Remove from the output all local or undefined symbols that are not required by relocations. Also remove all debug sections.

       --version, -V
              Display the version of the llvm-objcopy executable.

       --wildcard, -w
              Allow wildcard syntax for symbol-related flags. On by default for section-related flags. Incompatible with –regex.

              Wildcard syntax allows the following special symbols:

                                                            ┌───────────────┬───────────────────────────┬────────────┐
                                                            │Character      │ Meaning                   │ Equivalent │
                                                            ├───────────────┼───────────────────────────┼────────────┤
                                                            │*              │ Any number of characters  │ .*         │
                                                            ├───────────────┼───────────────────────────┼────────────┤
                                                            │?              │ Any single character      │ .          │
                                                            ├───────────────┼───────────────────────────┼────────────┤
                                                            │\              │ Escape the next character │ \          │
                                                            ├───────────────┼───────────────────────────┼────────────┤
                                                            │[a-z]          │ Character class           │ [a-z]      │
                                                            ├───────────────┼───────────────────────────┼────────────┤
                                                            │[!a-z], [^a-z] │ Negated character class   │ [^a-z]     │
                                                            └───────────────┴───────────────────────────┴────────────┘

              Additionally, starting a wildcard with ‘!’ will prevent a match, even if another flag matches. For example -w -N '*' -N '!x' will  strip  all  symbols
              except for x.

              The order of wildcards does not matter. For example, -w -N '*' -N '!x' is the same as -w -N '!x' -N '*'.

       @<FILE>
              Read command-line options and commands from response file <FILE>.

ELF-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       The following options are implemented only for ELF objects. If used with other objects, llvm-objcopy will either emit an error or silently ignore them.

       --add-symbol <name>=[<section>:]<value>[,<flags>]
              Add a new symbol called <name> to the output symbol table, in the section named <section>, with value <value>. If <section> is not specified, the sym‐
              bol is added as an absolute symbol. The <flags> affect the symbol properties. Accepted values are:

              • global = the symbol will have global binding.

              • local = the symbol will have local binding.

              • weak = the symbol will have weak binding.

              • default = the symbol will have default visibility.

              • hidden = the symbol will have hidden visibility.

              • protected = the symbol will have protected visibility.

              • file = the symbol will be an STT_FILE symbol.

              • section = the symbol will be an STT_SECTION symbol.

              • object = the symbol will be an STT_OBJECT symbol.

              • function = the symbol will be an STT_FUNC symbol.

              • indirect-function = the symbol will be an STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol.

              Additionally, the following flags are accepted but ignored: debug, constructor, warning, indirect, synthetic, unique-object, before.

              Can be specified multiple times to add multiple symbols.

       --allow-broken-links
              Allow llvm-objcopy to remove sections even if it would leave invalid section references. Any invalid sh_link fields will be set to zero.

       --change-start <incr>, --adjust-start

              Extract the named partition from the output.

       --globalize-symbol <symbol>
              Mark any defined symbols named <symbol> as global symbols in the output.  Can be specified multiple times to mark multiple symbols.

       --globalize-symbols <filename>
              Read  a  list of names from the file <filename> and mark defined symbols with those names as global in the output. In the file, each line represents a
              single symbol, with leading and trailing whitespace ignored, as is anything following a ‘#’. Can be specified multiple times to read names from multi‐
              ple files.

       --input-target <format>, -I
              Read the input as the specified format. See SUPPORTED FORMATS for a list of valid <format> values. If unspecified, llvm-objcopy will attempt to deter‐
              mine the format automatically.

       --keep-file-symbols
              Keep symbols of type STT_FILE, even if they would otherwise be stripped.

       --keep-global-symbol <symbol>

       --keep-symbol <symbol>, -K
              When removing symbols from the output, do not remove symbols named <symbol>. Can be specified multiple times to keep multiple symbols.

       --keep-symbols <filename>
              When  removing  symbols  from  the  output do not remove symbols named in the file <filename>. In the file, each line represents a single symbol, with
              leading and trailing whitespace ignored, as is anything following a ‘#’. Can be specified multiple times to read names from multiple files.

       --localize-hidden
              Make all symbols with hidden or internal visibility local in the output.

       --localize-symbol <symbol>, -L

       --localize-symbols <filename>
              Read a list of names from the file <filename> and mark defined non-common symbols with those names as local in the output. In the file, each line rep‐
              resents  a  single symbol, with leading and trailing whitespace ignored, as is anything following a ‘#’. Can be specified multiple times to read names
              from multiple files.

       --new-symbol-visibility <visibility>
              Specify the visibility of the symbols automatically created when using binary input or --add-symbol. Valid options are:

              • default

              • hidden

              • internal

              • protected

              The default is default.

       --output-target <format>, -O
              Write the output as the specified format. See SUPPORTED FORMATS for a list of valid <format> values. If unspecified, the output format is  assumed  to
              be the same as the value specified for --input-target or the input file’s format if that option is also unspecified.

       --prefix-alloc-sections <prefix>
              Add <prefix> to the front of the names of all allocatable sections in the output.

       --prefix-symbols <prefix>

       --rename-section <old>=<new>[,<flag>,...]
              Rename sections called <old> to <new> in the output, and apply any specified <flag> values. See --set-section-flags for a list of supported flags. Can
              be specified multiple times to rename multiple sections.

       --set-start-addr <addr>
              Set the start address of the output to <addr>. Overrides any previously specified --change-start or --adjust-start options.

       --split-dwo <dwo-file>
              Equivalent to running llvm-objcopy with --extract-dwo and <dwo-file> as the output file and no other options, and then with --strip-dwo on  the  input
              file.

       --strip-dwo
              Remove all DWARF .dwo sections from the output.

       --strip-non-alloc
              Remove from the output all non-allocatable sections that are not within segments.

       --strip-sections
              Remove  from  the  output all section headers and all section data not within segments. Note that many tools will not be able to use an object without
              section headers.

       --target <format>, -F
              Equivalent to --input-target and --output-target for the specified format. See SUPPORTED FORMATS for a list of valid <format> values.

       --weaken-symbol <symbol>, -W

              Read a list of names from the file <filename> and mark global symbols with those names as weak in the output. In the file, each line represents a sin‐
              gle  symbol, with leading and trailing whitespace ignored, as is anything following a ‘#’. Can be specified multiple times to read names from multiple
              files.

       --weaken
              Mark all defined global symbols as weak in the output.

MACH-O-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       --keep-undefined
              Keep undefined symbols, even if they would otherwise be stripped.

SUPPORTED FORMATS
       The following values are currently supported by llvm-objcopy for the --input-target, --output-target, and --target options. For  GNU  objcopy  compatibility,
       the values are all bfdnames.

       • ihex

       • elf32-i386

       • elf32-x86-64

       • elf64-x86-64

       • elf32-sparc

       • elf32-sparcel

       Additionally, all targets except binary and ihex can have -freebsd as a suffix.

BINARY INPUT AND OUTPUT
       If  binary  is  used  as  the  value  for  --input-target,  the input file will be embedded as a data section in an ELF relocatable object, with symbols _bi‐
       nary_<file_name>_start, _binary_<file_name>_end, and _binary_<file_name>_size representing the start, end and size of the data, where <file_name> is the path
       of the input file as specified on the command line with non-alphanumeric characters converted to _.

       If  binary  is  used as the value for --output-target, the output file will be a raw binary file, containing the memory image of the input file.  Symbols and
       relocation information will be discarded. The image will start at the address of the first loadable section in the output.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-objcopy exits with a non-zero exit code if there is an error.  Otherwise, it exits with code 0.

       To report bugs, please visit <https://bugs.llvm.org/>.

       There is a known issue with --input-target and --target causing only binary and ihex formats to have any effect. Other values will be ignored  and  llvm-obj‐
       copy will attempt to guess the input format.
