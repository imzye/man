DESCRIPTION
       The check-zone-exiration script reports how long until a zone will
       expire by querying for the zone's (top level) RRSIG and calculating how
       much time is left before the signatures will no longer be valid.  It
       will then report how much time is left in human readable form.

       If the -m switch is provided with a time argument (in seconds), it will
       only print output for zones that have less than that time left.

OPTIONS
       -m STRING
       --minimum-reporting=STRING
           Minimum reporting time, or else be silent for the zone
