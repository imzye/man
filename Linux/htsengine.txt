NAME
       hts_engine — HMM-based speech synthesis engine

SYNOPSIS
       hts_engine [options]  [infile]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the hts_engine command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU       Info format; see below.

       hts_engine is a program that synthesize speech waveform from HMMs trained by the HMM-based speech synthesis system (HTS).

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -m  htsvoice
                 HTS voice files

       -od s     filename of output label with duration

       -om s     filename of output spectrum

       -of s     filename of output Log F0

       -ol s     filename of output low-pass filter

       -or s     filename of output raw audio (generated speech)

       -ow s     filename of output wav audio (generated speech)

       -ot s     filename of output trace information

       -vp       use phoneme alignment for duration

       -i  i f1 .. fi
                 enable interpolation & specify number(i),coefficient(f)

       -s  i     sampling frequency [auto][  1--   ]

       -p  i     frame period (point) [auto][  1--   ]

       -a  f     all-pass constant [auto][0.0--1.0]

       -b  f     postfiltering coefficient [0.0][0.0--1.0]

       -r  f     speech speed rate [1.0][0.0--   ]

       -fm f     add half-tone [0.0][   --   ]

       -u  f     voiced/unvoiced threshold[0.5][0.0--1.0]

       -jm f     weight of GV for spectrum [1.0][0.0--   ]

       -jf f     weight of GV for Log F0 [1.0][0.0--   ]

       -z  i     audio buffer size (if i==0, turn off) [  0][0--   ]

       infile    label file

       generated spectrum, log F0, and low-pass filter coefficient sequences are saved in natural endian, binary (float) format.

EXAMPLE
       If you installed hts-voice-nitech-jp-atr503-m001 in the current directory, the following command let you make a voice file from input.lab:

              % hts_engine -s 48000 -p 240 -a 0.55 \
              -m nitech_jp_atr503_m001.htsvoice \
              -ow output.wav \
              input.lab
