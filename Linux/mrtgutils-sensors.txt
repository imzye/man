MRTG-SENSORS(1)                                                                            MRTG helper utilities                                                                            MRTG-SENSORS(1)

NAME
       mrtg-sensors - Returns data from lm-sensors

SYNOPSIS
       mrtg-sensors ([-m multiplier])*2 chip label [chip label]

DESCRIPTION
       mrtg-sensors uses the lm-sensors library to query various system sensors for information such as temperature, fan speed, etc. The output is written in a form useful as input for the MRTG utility.

       Up to two pairs of chips and labels may be specified. The first is used for the incoming data value in MRTG, while the second is used for the outgoing data value. Of course, they need not
       correspond to incoming or outgoing data, that is merely what MRTG expects.

       "chip" is the name of the chip to query, and "label" is the label of the piece of information that should be queried from the given chip. sensors(1) can be used to look up all available chips and
       labels on your system.

       Wildcards may be used in chip names, but only the first matching chip will be queried.

       If you use the special name "dummy" as a chip name, nothing will be queried, and a value of zero will be sent to MRTG.

       -m multiplier
           Sets  the  multiplier  to  be  used  in the output.  For example, if the temperature is 59.2 and a multiplier of 100, the output would be 592.  The option order is important, the first -m will
           modify the first value and the second -m, the second.  Note that you may find it more useful to use sensors.conf(5) to set global multipliers for sensors.  If it is defined once,  affect  both
           output values.  The default multiplier is 1.

EXAMPLES
       mrtg-sensors dummy dummy adm9240-\* fan2
           Get the speed of fan #2 from the adm9240 chip.

       mrtg-sensors -m 0.5 adm9240-\* fan1 adm9240-\* fan2
           Get the speeds of both fan #1 and fan #2, halfing both.

       mrtg-sensors -m 2 dummy dummy adm9240-\* temp
           Get the cpu temperature, and double it.

       mrtg-sensors -m 0.5 adm9240-\* fan1 -m 10 adm9240-\* temp
           Get the fan #1 speed and halfing it, and the cpu temperature with one decimal (e.i multipled by 10).
