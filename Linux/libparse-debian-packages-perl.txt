NAME
       Parse::Debian::Packages - parse the data from a debian Packages.gz

SYNOPSIS
        use YAML;
        use IO::File;
        use Parse::Debian::Packages;
        my $fh = IO::File->new("Packages");

        my $parser = Parse::Debian::Packages->new( $fh );
        while (my %package = $parser->next) {
            print Dump \%package;
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses the Packages files used by the debian package management tools.

       It presents itself as an iterator.  Each call of the ->next method will return the next package found in the file.

       For laziness, we take a filehandle in to the constructor.  Please open the file for us.

METHODS
   new( $filehandle )
   next
       Iterate to the next package in the file, returns either a hash containing a package description, or false at end of file.

   as_hash( $filehandle )
       Return all the packages from a filehandle as a hash of hashes.
