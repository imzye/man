FUNIONFS(8)                                                        FUNIONFS(8)

NAME
       funionfs - user-space directory concatenation.

SYNOPSIS
       funionfs upper_dir mountpoint [ option ] ...

OPTIONS
           -o opt,[opt...]        mount options
           -h   --help            print help
           -V   --version         print version

       Mount options include:
          funionfs_debug      print some debugging information
          dirs=LIST           A colon separated list of directories
             /branch1=rw      a directory in a read-write mode
             /branch1         if no permission is specified, the branch
                              is in a read-write mode
             /branch2=ro      a directory in a read-only mode
          copyupuid=N         uid of the copied-up files (no default)
          copyupgid=N         gid of the copied-up files (no default)
          copyupmode=N        mode of the copied-up files (no default)
          del_string=N        string to mark a deleted file(default: _DELETED~
       )
          delete=TYPE         specifies how funionfs deletes and renames
             all (default)    delete all objects  in  read-write  branch  (de‐
       fault)
                              and add a whiteout file if objects exists in
                              read-only branches.
             whiteout         only add a whiteout file in upper (rw) branch
                              or delete file in upper branch.
          copyup=TYPE         specifies how to manage attributes
             preserve         preserve uid, gid and mode of object (default)
             currentuser      the object owns to the user doing the operation
             mounter          the object owns to the mounter

       There is no implementation of -o delete and -o copyup for now.

       You could use the mount command instead :
          mount -t fuse funionfs#/upper_dir mountpoint [ options ]

       If  you want to name all directories in '-o dirs=', then pass "none" as
       upper_dir

DESCRIPTION
       funionfs concatenates directories mentioned in options (and upper_dir )
       to  mountpoint.   Also,  although some (but not all) of the directories
       are read-only, you still can write in resulting mounted directory.  For
       example,  if you have files a/a and b/b and mount mountpoint r with "-o
       dirs=a=ro:b=ro:w=rw", then you will see files r/a and r/b.  You will be
       able  to  write to them, and original files will remain intact (changes
       will go to w ). Note that it is impossible to have file with name  end‐
       ing  by del_string value, if you create r/a_DELETED~ in mentioned exam‐
       ple, it will dissapear together with a.

BUGS
       You cannot mount an overlay on / (the program that list the content  of
       /  will  hang). This is probably due to a loop call of the fuse driver.
       There is no known solution for now.

       Probably minor (or major) mistakes in not-so-frequent cases.

       Not enough tested.
