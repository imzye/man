OFF SCREEN RENDERING
       Loch  is able to render large bitmaps that can be afterwards post processed and printed. Bitmaps can be exported in PDF, PNG or BMP formats. Configuration of export is done via the Rendering setup
       dialog.  You can set the following features:

       Size and Scaling

       Screen shot: Screen copy will be saved into a file with no other changes.

       Image width:  The screen image will be exported with the specified width.

       Image height: The screen image will be exported with the specified height.

       Scale: The screen image will be exported with the specified scale.

       Image options

       Rendering resolution: Resolution of the image file used when image size or scale are specified.

       Image size: Image size in pixels and uncompressed bytes calculated from previous settings.

       White background: Force white background in exported image.

KNOWN BUGS
       Sometimes empty rectangles appear in off screen rendered file.  Changing the window size usually helps.

       * Crashes have been observed on intel graphics cards unless the
        texture initialisations are removed in the code.

       * Stereo mode does not work correctly on some graphics adapters.

       * This help does not work.
