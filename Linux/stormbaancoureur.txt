NAME
       stormbaancoureur - simulated obstacle course for automobiles

SYNOPSIS
       stormbaancoureur [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Your objective is to drive your car along an obstacle course. Success depends on total control of the car. If you want to master it, try to have the laws of physics work with you, not against you.

OPTIONS
       stormbaancoureur accepts the standard glutInit options for your system.

       The X Window System specific options parsed by glutInit are as follows:

       -display DISPLAY
                  Specify the X server to connect to. If not specified, the value of the DISPLAY environment variable is used.

       -geometry W x H + X + Y
              Determines  where  window's should be created on the screen. The parameter following -geometry should be formatted as a standard X geometry specification. The effect of using this option is
              to change the GLUT initial size and initial position the same as if glutInitWindowSize or glutInitWindowPosition were called directly.

       -iconic
              Requests all top-level windows be created in an iconic state.

       -indirect
              Force the use of indirect OpenGL rendering contexts.

       -direct
              Force the use of direct OpenGL rendering contexts (not all GLX implementations support direct rendering contexts). A fatal error is generated if direct rendering is  not  supported  by  the
              OpenGL implementation.

              If neither -indirect or -direct are used to force a particular behavior, GLUT will attempt to use direct rendering if possible and otherwise fallback to indirect rendering.

       -gldebug
              After  processing  callbacks and/or events, check if there are any OpenGL errors by calling glGetError. If an error is reported, print out a warning by looking up the error code with gluEr‐
              rorString. Using this option is helpful in detecting   OpenGL run-time errors.

       -sync  Enable synchronous X protocol transactions. This option makes it easier to track down potential   X protocol errors.

       Debian-specific options:

       -fullscreen
              Run the game in fullscreen mode

       -window
              Run the game inside a window
