NAME
       QucsHelp - A small program to display help files.

SYNOPSIS
       qucshelp [OPTION] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Qucs  is  an  integrated circuit simulator which means you are able to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the cir‐
       cuit.  After that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results on a presentation page or window.

       The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types, e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance analysis, noise analysis, etc.

       QucsHelp is a small program displaying the integrated help system of Qucs consisting of several HTML files.
