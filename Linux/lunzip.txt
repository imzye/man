NAME
       lunzip - decompressor for the lzip format

SYNOPSIS
       lunzip [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       Lunzip  is a decompressor for the lzip format written in C. Its small size makes it well suited for embedded devices or software installers that need to decompress files but don't need compression
       capabilities.

       Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip uses a simplified form of LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm) designed to  achieve  complete
       interoperability  between implementations. The maximum dictionary size is 512 MiB so that any lzip file can be decompressed on 32-bit machines. Lzip provides accurate and robust 3-factor integrity
       checking. 'lzip -0' compresses about as fast as gzip, while 'lzip -9' compresses most files more than bzip2. Decompression speed is intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip provides  better  data
       recovery capabilities than gzip and bzip2. Lzip has been designed, written, and tested with great care to replace gzip and bzip2 as general-purpose compressed format for Unix-like systems.

       Lunzip  provides a 'low memory' mode able to decompress any file using as little memory as 50 kB, irrespective of the dictionary size used to compress the file. To activate it, specify the size of
       the output buffer with the option --buffer-size and lunzip will use the decompressed file as dictionary for distances beyond the buffer size. Of course,  the  larger  the  difference  between  the
       buffer  size  and  the dictionary size, the more accesses to disc are needed and the slower the decompression is.  This 'low memory' mode only works when decompressing to a regular file and is in‐
       tended for systems without enough memory (RAM + swap) to keep the whole dictionary at once.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       -a, --trailing-error
              exit with error status if trailing data

       -c, --stdout
              write to standard output, keep input files

       -d, --decompress
              decompress (this is the default)

       -f, --force
              overwrite existing output files

       -k, --keep
              keep (don't delete) input files

       -l, --list
              print (un)compressed file sizes

       -o, --output=<file>
              write to <file>, keep input files

       -q, --quiet
              suppress all messages

       -t, --test
              test compressed file integrity

       -u, --buffer-size=<bytes>
              set output buffer size in bytes

       -v, --verbose
              be verbose (a 2nd -v gives more)

       --loose-trailing
              allow trailing data seeming corrupt header

       If no file names are given, or if a file is '-', lunzip decompresses from standard input to standard output.  Numbers may be followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000, Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024,
       M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...  Buffer sizes 12 to 29 are interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12 to 2^29 bytes.

       To extract all the files from archive 'foo.tar.lz', use the commands 'tar -xf foo.tar.lz' or 'lunzip -cd foo.tar.lz | tar -xf -'.

       Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file not found, invalid command-line options, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or invalid input file,  3  for  an  internal
       consistency error (e.g., bug) which caused lunzip to panic.

       The  ideas  embodied  in  lunzip are due to (at least) the following people: Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv (for the LZ algorithm), Andrei Markov (for the definition of Markov chains), G.N.N. Martin
       (for the definition of range encoding), Igor Pavlov (for putting all the above together in LZMA), and Julian Seward (for bzip2's CLI).
