NAME
       AOQuality - Handle AOFlagger measurement set quality statistics

SYNOPSIS
       aoquality <action> [options]

ACTIONS
       help   Get more info about an action (usage: 'aoquality help <action>')

       collect [-c/-tf/-h] <ms> [quack timesteps] [list of antennae]
              The collect action will go over a whole measurement set and collect the default statistics. It will write the results in the quality subtables of the main measurement set.

              Currently, the default statistics are: RFIRatio, Count, Mean, SumP2, DCount, DMean, DSumP2.

              The subtables that will be updated are: QUALITY_KIND_NAME, QUALITY_TIME_STATISTIC, QUALITY_FREQUENCY_STATISTIC and QUALITY_BASELINE_STATISTIC.

              -c will use the CORRECTED_DATA column.  and writes them in the quality tables.

       combine <target_ms> [<in_ms> [<in_ms> ..]
              This will read all given input measurement sets, combine the statistics and write the results to a target measurement set. The target measurement set should not exist beforehand.

       histogram <query> <ms>
              Various histogram actions.

              Query can be: rfislope - performs linear regression on the part of the histogram that should contain the RFI.  Reports one value per polarisation.

       liststats
              Display a list of possible statistic kinds.

       query_b <kind> <ms>
              Prints the given statistic for each baseline.

       query_t <kind> <ms>
              Print the given statistic for each time step.

       query_f <kind> <ms>
              Print the given statistic for each frequency.

       query_g <kind> <ms>
              Print the given statistic for this measurement set.

       remove [ms]
              Completely remove all quality tables from the measurement set.

       summarize <ms>
              Gives a summary of the statistics in the measurement set.

       summarizerfi
              Give a summary of the rfi statistics.

       A  few actions take a statistic kind. Some common statistic kinds are: StandardDeviation, Variance, Mean, RFIPercentage, RFIRatio, Count. These are case sensitive. Run 'aoquality liststats' for a full
       list.
