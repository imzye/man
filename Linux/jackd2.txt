NAME
       jackd - JACK Audio Connection Kit sound server

SYNOPSIS
       jackd [options] -d backend [backend-parameters]
       jackd --help

DESCRIPTION
       jackd is the JACK audio server daemon that allows JACK client programs to process and route audio and MIDI data in a synchronous, sample-accurate and low-latency manner. Originally written for the
       GNU/Linux  operating system, it also runs on various Unix platforms, Mac OS X and MS Windows.  JACK can connect a number of different client applications to an audio device and also to each other.
       Most clients are external, running in their own processes as normal applications. JACK also supports internal clients, which run within the jackd process using a loadable "plugin" interface.

       JACK differs from other audio servers in being designed from the ground up for professional audio work. It focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients and low latency operation.

       The name JACK makes a reference to the classical way of patching audio connections with physical audio jack cables.  JACK is also a recursive acronym, that is an abbreviation which is part of  it‐
       self. JACK Audio Connection Kit.

OPTIONS
       -d, --driver backend [backend-parameters ]
              Select  the  audio  interface  backend.  The current list of supported backends is: alsa, coreaudio, dummy, firewire, oss sun and portaudio. They are not all available on all platforms. All
              backend-parameters are optional.

       -h, --help
              Print a brief usage message describing the main jackd options.  These do not include backend-parameters, which are listed using the --help option for each specific backend.  Examples  below
              show how to list them.

       -a, --autoconnect modechar
              Select  how to handle self connect requests. They can be ignore or fail, on all port or just external ones. Use the --help option to know your system specific options. The default is to not
              restrict self connect requests.

       -m, --no-mlock
              Do not attempt to lock memory, even if --realtime.

       -n, --name server-name
              Name this jackd instance server-name. If unspecified, this name comes from the $JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER environment variable.  (default: "default")

       -p, --port-max  n
              Set the maximum number of ports the JACK server can manage.  (default: 256)

       --replace-registry
              Remove the shared memory registry used by all JACK server instances before startup. This should rarely be used, and is intended only for  occasions  when  the  structure  of  this  registry
              changes in ways that are incompatible across JACK versions (which is rare).

       -R, --realtime
              Use realtime scheduling. This is needed for reliable low-latency performance. On many systems, it requires jackd to run with special scheduler and memory allocation privileges, which may be
              obtained in several ways.  (default: true)

       -r, --no-realtime
              Do not use realtime scheduling.

       -P, --realtime-priority int
              When running --realtime, set the scheduler priority to int.

       --silent
              Silence any output during operation.

       -T, --temporary
              Exit once all clients have closed their connections.

       -t, --timeout int
              Set client timeout limit in milliseconds.  In realtime mode the client timeout must be smaller than the watchdog timeout (5000 msec).  (default: 500)

       -Z, --nozombies
              Prevent JACK from ever kicking out clients because they were too slow.  This cancels the effect any specified timeout value, but JACK and its clients are still subject to the supervision of
              the watchdog thread or its equivalent.

       -C, --internal-session-file internal-session-file
              Load internal clients and connections from internal-session-file.  Each line of this configuration file starts with a command.  The following commands are available:
              l(oad) client-name lib-name client-args
              With  this  command  an  internal JACK client will be instantiated.  client-name and lib-name cannot contain spaces.  The rest of the line will be interpreted as client-args and sent to the
              client library.
              c(on) source-port destination-port
              With this command a source port will be connected to a destination port.  source-port and destination-port cannot contain spaces.
              Comments are allowed, they start with #.
              An example configuration could look like the following:
               l inprocess1 inprocess
               l amp1 jalv http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp
               c amp:out system:playback_1

       -u, --unlock
              Unlock libraries GTK+, QT, FLTK, Wine.

       -v, --verbose
              Give verbose output.

       -c, --clocksource ( h(pet)  |  s(ystem) )
              Select a specific wall clock (HPET timer, System timer).

       -V, --version
              Print the current JACK version number and exit.

   ALSA BACKEND OPTIONS
       -C, --capture [ name ]
              Provide only capture ports, unless combined with -D or -P. Optionally set capture device name.

       -d, --device name
              The ALSA pcm device name to use. If none is specified, JACK will use "hw:0", the first hardware card defined in /etc/modules.conf.

       -z, --dither [rectangular,triangular,shaped,none]
              Set dithering mode. If none or unspecified, dithering is off.  Only the first letter of the mode name is required.

       -D, --duplex
              Provide both capture and playback ports. Defaults to on unless only one of -P or -C is specified.  (default: true)

       -h, --help Print a brief usage message describing only the
              alsa backend parameters.

       -M, --hwmeter
              Enable hardware metering for devices that support it. Otherwise, use software metering.

       -H, --hwmon
              Enable hardware monitoring of capture ports. This is a method for obtaining "zero latency" monitoring of audio input. It requires support in hardware and from  the  underlying  ALSA  device
              driver.

              When  enabled,  requests to monitor capture ports will be satisfied by creating a direct signal path between audio interface input and output connectors, with no processing by the host com‐
              puter at all. This offers the lowest possible latency for the monitored signal.

              Presently (March 2003), only the RME Hammerfall series and cards based on the ICE1712 chipset (M-Audio Delta series, Terratec, and others) support --hwmon.  In  the  future,  some  consumer
              cards may also be supported by modifying their mixer settings.

              Without  --hwmon, port monitoring requires JACK to read audio into system memory, then copy it back out to the hardware again, imposing the basic JACK system latency determined by the --pe‐
              riod and --nperiods parameters.

       -i, --inchannels int
              Number of capture channels.  (default: maximum supported by hardware)

       -I, --input-latency
              Extra input latency (frames).  (default: 0)

       -n, --nperiods int
              Number of periods of playback latency. In seconds, this corresponds to --nperiods times --period divided by --rate. The default is 2, the minimum allowed. For most devices, there is no need
              for any other value with the --realtime option. Without realtime privileges or with boards providing unreliable interrupts (like ymfpci), a larger value may yield fewer xruns. This can also
              help if the system is not tuned for reliable realtime scheduling.

              For most ALSA devices, the hardware buffer has exactly --period times --nperiods frames. Some devices demand a larger buffer. If so, JACK will use the smallest possible buffer containing at
              least --nperiods, but the playback latency does not increase.

              For USB audio devices it is recommended to use -n 3. Firewire devices supported by FFADO (formerly FreeBoB) are configured with -n 3 by default.

       -o, --outchannels int
              Number of playback channels.  (default: maximum supported by hardware)

       -O, --output-latency
              Extra output latency (frames).  (default: 0)

       -P, --playback [ name ]
              Provide only playback ports, unless combined with -D or -C. Optionally set playback device name.

       -p, --period int
              Number of frames between JACK process() calls. This value must be a power of 2. If you need low latency, set -p as low as you can go without seeing xruns. A larger period size yields higher
              latency, but makes xruns less likely. The JACK capture latency in seconds is --period divided by --rate.  (default: 1024)

       -r, --rate int
              Sample rate.  (default: 48000)

       -S, --shorts
              Try to configure card for 16-bit samples first, only trying 32-bits if unsuccessful.  (default: 32-bit samples)

       -s, --softmode
              Ignore xruns reported by the ALSA driver. This makes JACK less likely to disconnect unresponsive ports when running without --realtime.

       -X, --midi [seq|raw]
              Which ALSA MIDI system to provide access to. Using raw will provide a set of JACK MIDI ports that correspond to each raw ALSA device on the machine. Using seq will provide  a  set  of  JACK
              MIDI  ports  that  correspond to each ALSA "sequencer" client (which includes each hardware MIDI port on the machine). raw provides slightly better performance but does not permit JACK MIDI
              communication with software written to use the ALSA "sequencer" API.

   FIREWIRE BACKEND PARAMETERS
       -d, --device name
              The  Firewire  device  name  to  use.  If  none is specified, JACK will try to use "hw:0". To get a list of available Firewire devices, see ffado-test. It's recommended to use the GUID of a
              Firewire device to rule out any ambiguities. Once the GUID of the device is known ("ffado-test ListDevices"), it can be used like -dguid:0xff2584e39b078a2e to tell JACK which  interface  to
              use.  Sometimes resetting the Firewire bus can help ("ffado-test BusReset") if there is any problem.  (default: hw:0)

       -p, --period int
              Number of frames between JACK process() calls. This value must be a power of 2. If you need low latency, set -p as low as you can go without seeing xruns. A larger period size yields higher
              latency, but makes xruns less likely. The JACK capture latency in seconds is --period divided by --rate.  (default: 1024)

       -n, --nperiods int
              Number of periods of playback latency. Value must be greater or equal 2. In seconds, this corresponds to --nperiods times --period divided by --rate.  (default: 3)

       -r, --rate int
              Sample rate.  (default: 48000)

       -C, --capture [ name ]
              Provide only capture ports, unless combined with -D or -P. Optionally set capture device name.

       -P, --playback [ name ]
              Provide only playback ports, unless combined with -D or -C. Optionally set playback device name.

       -D, --duplex
              Provide both capture and playback ports. This option is the default behaviour and can normally be omitted.  -D can not be combined with -P or -C.

       -I, --input-latency
              Extra input latency (frames).  (default: 0)

       -O, --output-latency
              Extra output latency (frames).  (default: 0)

       -v, --verbose
              libffado verbose level.  (default: 3)

       -X, --snoop
              Snoop Firewire traffic.  (default: false)

       -h, --help Print a brief usage message describing only the
              firewire backend parameters.

       Run the JACK daemon with realtime priority using the first ALSA hardware card defined in /etc/modules.conf.

              jackstart --realtime --driver=alsa

       Run  the  JACK daemon with low latency giving verbose output, which can be helpful for trouble-shooting system latency problems. A reasonably well-tuned system with a good sound card and a low-la‐
       tency kernel can handle these values reliably. Some can do better. If you get xrun messages, try a larger buffer. Tuning a system for low latency can be challenging. Please consult  the  JACK  FAQ
       for more suggestions.

              jackstart -Rv -d alsa -p 128 -n 2 -r 44100

       Run jackd with realtime priority using the "sblive" ALSA device defined in ~/.asoundrc. Apply shaped dithering to playback audio.

              jackd -R -d alsa -d sblive --dither=shaped

       Run  jackd  with no special privileges using the second ALSA hardware card defined in /etc/modules.conf. Any xruns reported by the ALSA backend will be ignored. The larger buffer helps reduce data
       loss. Rectangular dithering will be used for playback.

              jackd -d alsa -d hw:1 -p2048 -n3 --softmode -zr

       Run jackd in full-duplex mode using the ALSA hw:0,0 device for playback and the hw:0,2 device for capture.

              jackd -d alsa -P hw:0,0 -C hw:0,2

       Run jackd in playback-only mode using the ALSA hw:0,0 device.

              jackd -d alsa -P hw:0,0

ENVIRONMENT
       JACK is evolving a mechanism for automatically starting the server when needed. Any client started without a running JACK server will attempt to start one itself using the command  line  found  in
       the  first  line  of $HOME/.jackdrc if it exists, or /etc/jackdrc if it does not. If neither file exists, a built-in default command will be used, including the -T flag, which causes the server to
       shut down when all clients have exited.

       As a transition, this only happens when $JACK_START_SERVER is defined in the environment of the calling process. In  the  future  this  will  become  normal  behavior.  In  either  case,  defining
       $JACK_NO_START_SERVER disables this feature.

       To change where JACK looks for the backend drivers, set $JACK_DRIVER_DIR.

       $JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER  specifies  the  default  server name. If not defined, the string "default" is used. If set in their respective environments, this affects jackd unless its --name parameter is
       set, and all JACK clients unless they pass an explicit name to jack_client_open().

       Defining $JACK_NO_AUDIO_RESERVATION will bypass audio device reservation via session bus (DBus). This can be useful if JACK was compiled with DBus support but should run on a headless system.

       $JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER enables an alternate way of handling the various shared resources (Unix sockets, semaphores, ...). In this mode, the generated names will not contain the user id  anymore,
       and the permissions of those resources will be relaxed, allowing clients from different users to talk with the same server. Moreover, on platforms that support it (all POSIX variants), if set to a
       valid Unix group name or id, the permissions will be restricted to that group, so only members of that group will be able to launch clients that talk to this server. Important note: it must be set
       with the same value for both server and clients to work as expected.
