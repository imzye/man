        --debug=package            enables debugging output for the

        --inputencoding=enc specify the input encoding.
        --VERSION                  show version number and exit.
        --help                     shows this help message.
        --                         ends options

       If texmath is '-', "latexmlmath" reads the TeX from standard input.  If any of the output files are '-', the result is printed on standard output.

   Input notes
       Note that, unless you are reading texmath from standard input, the texmath string will be processed by whatever shell you are using before "latexmlmath" even sees it.  This means that many so-called
       meta characters, such as backslash and star,  may confuse the shell or be changed.  Consequently, you will need to quote and/or slashify the input appropriately.  Most particularly, "\" will need to
       be doubled to "\\" for "latexmlmath" to see it as a control sequence.

       Using "--" to explicitly end the option list is useful for cases when the math starts with a minus (and would otherwise be interpreted as an option, probably an unrecognized one). Alternatively,
       wrapping the texmath with {} will hide the minus.

       Simple examples:

         latexmlmath \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
         echo "\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}" | latexmlmath --pmml=quad.mml -

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
   Conversion Options
       These options specify what formats the math should be converted to.  In each case, the destination file is given.  Except for mathimage, the file can be given as '-', in which case the result is
       printed to standard output.

       If no conversion option is specified, the default is to output presentation MathML to standard output.

       "--mathimage"=file
           Requests conversion to png images.

       "--mathsvg"=file
           Requests conversion to svg images.

       "--magnification="factor
           Specifies the magnification used for math image. Default is 1.75.

       "--presentationmathml"=file
           Requests conversion to Presentation MathML.

       "--linelength"=number
           (Experimental) Line-breaks the generated Presentation MathML so that it is no longer than number `characters'.

       "--plane1"
           Converts the content of Presentation MathML token elements to the appropriate Unicode Plane-1 codepoints according to the selected font, when applicable.

       "--hackplane1"
           Converts the content of Presentation MathML token elements to the appropriate Unicode Plane-1 codepoints according to the selected font, but only for the mathvariants double-struck, fraktur and
           script.  This gives support for current (as of August 2009) versions of Firefox and MathPlayer, provided a sufficient set of fonts is available (eg. STIX).

       "--contentmathml"=file
           Requests conversion to Content MathML.  Note that this conversion is only partially implemented.

       "--openmath"=file
           Requests conversion to OpenMath.  Note that this conversion is only partially implemented.

       "--XMath"=file
           Requests conversion to LaTeXML's internal format.

Other Options
       "--preload"=module
           Requests the loading of an optional module or package.  This may be useful if the TeX code does not specifically require the module (eg. through input or usepackage).  For example, use
           "--preload=LaTeX.pool" to force LaTeX mode.

       "--includestyles"
           This optional allows processing of style files (files with extensions "sty", "cls", "clo", "cnf").  By default, these files are ignored  unless a latexml implementation of them is found (with an
           extension of "ltxml").

           These style files generally fall into two classes:  Those that merely affect document style are ignorable in the XML.  Others define new markup and document structure, often using deeper LaTeX
           macros to achieve their ends.  Although the omission will lead to other errors (missing macro definitions), it is unlikely that processing the TeX code in the style file will lead to a correct
           document.

       "--path"=dir
           Add dir to the search paths used when searching for files, modules, style files, etc; somewhat like TEXINPUTS.  This option can be repeated.

       "--documentid"=id
           Assigns an ID to the root element of the XML document.  This ID is generally inherited as the prefix of ID's on all other elements within the document.  This is useful when constructing a site of
           multiple documents so that all nodes have unique IDs.

       "--quiet"
           Reduces the verbosity of output during processing, used twice is pretty silent.

       "--verbose"
           Increases the verbosity of output during processing, used twice is pretty chatty.  Can be useful for getting more details when errors occur.

       "--strict"
           Specifies a strict processing mode. By default, undefined control sequences and invalid document constructs (that violate the DTD) give warning messages, but attempt to continue processing.  Using
           --strict makes them generate fatal errors.

       "--inputencoding="encoding
           Specify the input encoding, eg. "--inputencoding=iso-8859-1".  The encoding must be one known to Perl's Encode package.  Note that this only enables the translation of the input bytes to UTF-8
           used internally by LaTeXML, but does not affect catcodes.  It is usually better to use LaTeX's inputenc package.  Note that this does not affect the output encoding, which is always UTF-8.

       "--VERSION"
           Shows the version number of the LaTeXML package..

       "--debug"=package
           Enables debugging output for the named package. The package is given without the leading LaTeXML::.

       "--help"
           Shows this help message.

BUGS
       This program runs much slower than would seem justified.  This is a result of the relatively slow initialization including loading TeX and LaTeX macros and the schema.  Normally, this cost would be
       ammortized over large documents, whereas, in this case, we're processing a single math expression.
