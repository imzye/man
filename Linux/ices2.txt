NAME
       ices2 - an Ogg Vorbis broadcast streaming source client

SYNOPSIS
       ices2 config.xml

DESCRIPTION
       ices2 is a program that connects to Icecast 2 streaming media servers, and provides them with audio streams.  It supports both live audio input from a soundcard and re-encoding of Ogg Vorbis files
       from a playlist.

OPTIONS
       ices2 has no command line options.  All aspects of its operation are controlled by the XML configuration file, whose path is specified by the sole argument.

SEE ALSO
       The  example  configuration  files, provided with the package documentation, are the only reliable source of information on this software.  The software is still under very active development; de‐
       tailed documentation will be written when it is possible to do so.
