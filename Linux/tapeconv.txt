DESCRIPTION
       tapeconv converts between ZX Spectrum tape images.

OPTIONS
       -a archive info TZX
              causes the TZX supplied to be scanned for a Archive  Info  block
              containing  author,  year  of release etc. information about the
              file and then added to the output TZX.

       [ -b ] causes the output TZX to be stripped of any concatenation blocks
              that get created when appending TZX files.

       [ -s SCR loading screen ]
              causes  the  supplied .scr format file to be attached to the TZX
              as a Custom Info block marked as a loading screen.

       [ -i JPG or GIF inlay image ]
              causes the supplied .gif or .jpg format file to be  attached  to
              the TZX as a Custom Info block marked as a cassette inlay.
