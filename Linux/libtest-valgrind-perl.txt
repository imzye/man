NAME
       Test::Valgrind::Command::Perl - A Test::Valgrind command that invokes perl.

VERSION
       Version 1.19

DESCRIPTION
       This command is the base for all "perl"-based commands.  It handles the suppression generation and sets the main command-line flags.

METHODS
       This class inherits Test::Valgrind::Command.

   "new"
           my $tvcp = Test::Valgrind::Command::Perl->new(
            perl       => $^X,
            inc        => \@INC,
            taint_mode => $taint_mode,
            %extra_args,
           );

       The package constructor, which takes several options :

       •   The "perl" option specifies which "perl" executable will run the argument list given in "args".

           Defaults to $^X.

       •   "inc" is a reference to an array of paths that will be passed as "-I" to the invoked command.

           Defaults to @INC.

       •   $taint_mode is a boolean that specifies if the script should be run under taint mode.

           Defaults to false.

       Other arguments are passed straight to "Test::Valgrind::Command->new".

   "perl"
           my $perl = $tvcp->perl;

       Read-only accessor for the "perl" option.

   "inc"
           my @inc = $tvcp->inc;

       Read-only accessor for the "inc" option.

   "taint_mode"
           my $taint_mode = $tvcp->taint_mode;

       Read-only accessor for the "taint_mode" option.

   "env"
           my $env = $tvcp->env($session);

       Returns an Env::Sanctify object that sets the environment variables "PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL" to 3 and "PERL_DL_NONLAZY" to 1 during the run.
