NAME
       mperfmon - Mono Performance Counter Monitor

SYNOPSIS
       mperfmon [--config=FILE] [--report=REPORT_NAME] [--count=NUM] [pid]

OPTIONS
       --config=FILE
              Specifies the configuration file to load instead of the default one installed in the same directory as the app.

       --report=REPORT_NAME
              Instead  of  showing the GUI, run in console mode and print a report of the set of counters specified by REPORT_NAME and described in the config file.
              The report is printed for up to the number of times specified with the --count option.  The pid argument is used as the instance name in  the  perfor‐
              mance counters, it is typically the pid of a mono process.

       --count=NUM
              Sets the number of times a report is printed in console mode.  The default is 2.

DESCRIPTION
       mperfmon  is a tool that allows you to monitor performance counters exposed by Mono processes or by the operating system.  With the --report option it can be
       used on the console, otherwise a GUI is started. In GUI mode each counter added is monitored at user-specified time intervals (the default is 1  second)  and
       it is shown in a graph as it changes over time.
