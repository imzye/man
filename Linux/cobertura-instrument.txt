NAME
       cobertura-instrument — add coverage instrumentation to existing classes

SYNOPSIS
       cobertura-instrument [--basedir dir]  [--datafile file]  [--destination dir]  [--ignore regex]  classes [...]

DESCRIPTION
       cobertura-instrument  inserts  instrumentation  instructions directly into your compiled Java classes. When these instructions are encountered by the Java Virtual Machine, the inserted code increments
       various counters so that it is possible to tell which instructions have been encountered and which have not.

OPTIONS
       Classes may be specified individually, or as a directory tree containing multiple classes.

       --basedir dir
                 Specify the base directory containing the classes you want to instrument. This command line parameter should appear before any classes. If you are instrumenting classes in different directo‐
                 ries, you should specify multiple basedirs.

       --datafile file
                 Specify the name of the file to use for storing the metadata about your classes. This is a single file containing serialized Java classes.  It contains information about the names of classes
                 in your project, their method names, line numbers, etc. It will be updated as your tests are run, and will be referenced by the Cobertura reporting command. Default value: "./cobertura.ser".

       --destination dir
                 Specify the output directory for the instrumented classes.  If no destination directory is specified, then the uninstrumented classes will be overwritten  with  their  instrumented  counter‐
                 parts.

       --ignore regex
                 Specify  a  regular expression to filter out certain lines of your source code. This is useful for ignoring logging statements, for example.  You can have as many <ignore/> statements as you
                 want. By default no files are ignored.

       --auxClasspath
                 Add any classes/jars that cobertura is unable to find during instrumentation.
