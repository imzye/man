EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The  arcrename  command  renames files or directories on grid storage elements and indexing services. The path component of oldurl and newurl must differ and it must be the only component of both URLs
       which is different.  arcrename will exit with an error if the paths are equivalent or other components of the URLs are different. Renaming a URL to an existing URL will either fail  or  overwrite  the
       existing URL, depending on the protocol.  arcrename works purely at the namespace level and does not perform data transfer.

       For more information on ARC URL syntax please read "Protocols, Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and Extensions Supported in ARC" [NORDUGRID-TECH-7]

       Depending  on  the  installed libraries (check with -P ), the following protocols may be used: file  (file://  prefix  may  be omitted), http, https, httpg, ftp, gsiftp, srm, root. However renaming is
       not supported or implemented for some of those protocols.

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       X509_USER_PROXY
              The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard location.

       ARC_LOCATION
              The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not specified the install location will be determined from the path to the command being executed, and if this fails  a
              WARNING will be given stating the location which will be used.

       ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
              The  location  of  ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The default location is $ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc (\ in
              Windows).

EXAMPLE
