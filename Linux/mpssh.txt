NAME
     mpssh

SYNOPSIS
     mpssh

           [-besvV] [-o directory] [-u username] [-f hosts] [-p procs]
           <command>

DESCRIPTION
       -b, --blind            enable blind mode (no remote output)
       -d, --delay            delay between each ssh fork (default 10 msec)
       -e, --exit             print the remote command return code
       -f, --file=FILE        name of the file with the list of hosts
       -h, --help             this screen
       -l, --label=LABEL      connect only to hosts under label LABEL
       -o, --outdir=DIR       save the remote output in this directory
       -p, --procs=NPROC      number of parallel ssh processes (default 100)
       -s, --nokeychk         disable ssh strict host key check
       -t, --conntmout        ssh connect timeout (default 30 sec)
       -u, --user=USER        ssh login as this username
       -v, --verbose          be more verbose (i.e. show usernames used)
       -V, --version          show program version

     The mpssh utility executes multiple parallel ssh binary instances in
     order to connect to a list of hosts (specified in the hosts file) and
     execute the given <command> on each of them.

     A list of flags and arguments with description:

     -b       This flag enables "blind" mode, in which no output from the
              remote hosts is output to the screen. This mode is normally used
              with the -o flag, so the output is saved to disk.

     -d       This flag sets some delay in msecs between each fork()/exec() of
              the ssh process.

     -e       With this flag mpssh prints the return codes of the remotely
              executed commands.

     -l -LABEL
              Only connect to the hosts under the given label.

     -s       This flag disables the ssh(1)'s strict host key checking. For
              more info see the ssh(1) manual page.

     -v       This flag makes the output more verbose.

     -o directory
              This option creates files in the specified directory named after
              each host name listed in the "hosts" file and saves the output
              received from the remotely executed command there. If the direc‐
              tory does not exists and attempt is made to be created.

     -u username
              This forces ssh to use the supplied username instead of the
              username of the current user.

     -f hosts
              A file containing a list of hosts to whom we are going to con‐
              nect. One host per line. Lines starting with # are skipped. If
              not specified $HOME/.mpssh/hosts will be used.

     -p procs
              Spawn up-to "procs" number of ssh processes in parallel.

FILES
     /usr/bin/mpssh The mpssh binary
