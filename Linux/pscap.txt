NAME
       pscap - a program to see capabilities

SYNOPSIS
       pscap [ -a ]

DESCRIPTION
       pscap is a program that prints out a report of process capabilities. If
       the application has any capabilities, it will be in the report with the
       exception  of  init. By giving the -a command line option, init will be
       included, too. If a process is not in the report, it  has  dropped  all
       capabilities.  If  the  process has partial capabilities, it is further
       examined to see if it has an open-ended bounding set. If this is  found
       to be true, a '+' symbol is added.

       The command name in the output may be followed by an asterisk mark (*).
       This mark denotes processes which run in child user  namespaces  (rela‐
       tive to the user namespace of pscap itself).

SEE ALSO
       netcap(8), filecap(8), capabilities(7), ps(8).
