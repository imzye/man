NAME
       cgreen-runner - an auto-discovering runner for the Cgreen unittest and mocking framework

SYNOPSIS
       cgreen-runner [--colour] [--xml prefix] [--suite name] [--verbose] [--no-run] [--help] ( LIBRARY [test] )+

DESCRIPTION
       Cgreen  is  a  framework  for  creating  and  running  compact  and easy-to-read unittests for C and/or C++. After compiling your tests and linking them together with the code/class/subject under test
       (CUT/SUT) into a shared dynamically loadable LIBRARY you can auto-discover and run all tests using the cgreen-runner without having to manually add each and every test that you write to a  suite  pro‐
       grammatically.

       This makes the TDD cycle even faster and less error-prone, one less thing to remember.

   Usage:
       Discover and run all, or a single named, cgreen test(s) from one or multiple dynamically loadable library.

       A single test can be run using the form [<context>:]<name> where <context> can be omitted if there is no context.

OPTIONS
       -c, --colours/colors
              Use colours to emphasis result (requires ANSI-capable terminal)

       -x, --xml prefix
              Instead of messages on stdout, write results into one XML-file per suite, compatible with Hudson/Jenkins CI. The filename(s) will be 'prefix-<suite>.xml'

       -s, --suite name
              Give the top level suite name instead of the name in the LIBRARY.

       -n, --no-run
              Don't run the tests.

       -v, --verbose
              Show progress information during run.

       -V, --version
              Show version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Print some usage information and exit.
