NAME
       ots-validator-checker - font validation checker

SYNOPSIS
       ots-validator-checker FONT_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       ots-validator-checker  is a program which is intended to validate malformed fonts.  If the program detects that the font is invalid, it prints “OK” and returns with 0 (success).  If it couldn’t detect
       any errors, the program then opens the transcoded font and renders some characters using FreeType:

              transcoded_font = ValidateAndTranscode(malicious_font);
              if (validation_error)
                Print("OK");
              OpenAndRenderSomeCharacters(transcoded_font);  # may cause SIGSEGV
              Print("OK");

       If SEGV doesn’t raise inside FreeType library, the program prints “OK” and returns with 0 as well.  You should run this tool under the catchsegv(1) or valgrind(1) command so that you can easily verify
       that all transformed fonts don’t crash the library (see the example below).

EXAMPLES
              $ for f in malformed/*.ttf ; do catchsegv ./ots-validator-checker "$f" ; done
              OK: the malicious font was filtered: malformed/1.ttf
              OK: the malicious font was filtered: malformed/2.ttf
              OK: FreeType2 didn't crash: malformed/3.ttf
              OK: the malicious font was filtered: malformed/4.ttf
