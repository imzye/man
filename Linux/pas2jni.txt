NAME
       pas2jni - Free Pascal Java Native Interface generation tool

SYNOPSIS
       pas2jni [options] <unit> [<unit2> <unit3> ...]

       Generate  a  Java  native  interface description and library from compiled Free Pascal units.  pas2jni generates per unit 2 files: a library that provides access to the functions and procedures in the
       pascal unit in a manner that Java understands, and a .java file that describes the library, and can be used to access the library from Java.

OPTIONS
       -U<path>
              Unit search path, semicolon delimited. Wildcards are allowed.

       -L<name>
              Set output library name. By default, this is the name of the unit followed by 'jni'.

       -P<name>
              Set Java package name. This is by default 'pas'.

       -O<path>
              Set output path for Pascal files. This is the current directory, by default.

       -J<path>
              Set output path for Java files. By default, this is 'pas'.

       -D<prog>
              Set full path to the "ppudump" program. The ppudump program is needed to analyse the contents of the unit files.

       -I<list>
              Include the list of specified objects in the output.  The list is semicolon delimited.  To read this list from a file use -I@<file>

       -E <list>
              Exclude the list of specified objects from the output. The list is semicolon delimited. To read this list from a file use -E@<file>

EXAMPLES
       The following will create a file pas/getopts.java and a library file getoptsjni.pas unit from the standard getopts unit:

       pas2jni units/x86_64-linux/getopts.ppu

       The following will create a file getopts.java and a library file pasgetopts.pas unit from the standard getopts unit:

       pas2jni -J. -O. -Lpasgetopts -units/x86_64-linux/getopts.ppu
