DESCRIPTION
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Credential::OpenID is an OpenID credential for Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication framework.

METHODS
       authenticate_openid
             $c->authenticate_openid;

           Call this method in the action you'd like to authenticate the user via OpenID. Returns 0 if auth is not successful, and 1 if user is authenticated.

           User class specified with user_class config, which defaults to Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::User::Hash, will be instantiated with the following parameters.

           By default, authenticate_openid method looks for claimed URI parameter from the form field named "openid_url", "openid_identifier" or "claimed_uri". If you want to use another form field name,
           call it like:

             $c->authenticate_openid( $c->req->param('myopenid_param') );

           url
           display
           rss
           atom
           foaf
           declared_rss
           declared_atom
           declared_foaf
           foafmaker

           See Net::OpenID::VerifiedIdentity for details.

DIFFERENCE WITH Authentication::OpenID
       There's already Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::OpenID (Auth::OpenID) and this plugin tries to deprecate it.

       •   Don't use this plugin with Auth::OpenID since method names will conflict and your app won't work.

       •   Auth::OpenID  uses  your  root  path  (/) as an authentication callback but this plugin uses the current path, which means you can use this plugin with other Credential plugins, like Flickr or
           TypeKey.

       •   This plugin is NOT a drop-in replacement for Auth::OpenID, but your app needs only slight modifications to work with this one.

       •   This plugin is based on Catalyst authentication framework, which means you can specify user_class or auth_store in your app config and this modules does the right thing, like other  Credential
           modules. This crates new User object if authentication is successful, and works with Session too.
