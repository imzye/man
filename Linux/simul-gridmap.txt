NAME
       simul-gridmap - Robot dataset simulator from a gridmap and a predefined robot path

SYNOPSIS
       simul-gridmap OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
       simul-gridmap is a command-line application which generates a synthetic rawlog of a simulated robot as it follows a path (given by the poses.txt file) and takes measurements from a laser scanner in a
       world defined through an occupancy grid map.

OPTIONS
       --help                produce help message

       --grid arg            grid map file (*.gridmap or *.gridmap.gz)

       --poses arg           poses text file, one 'time x y phi' line per pose

       --out-rawlog arg      the output rawlog to generate  from which to take noisy
                              odometry

       --in-rawlog arg       (optional) the rawlog from which to take noisy odometry

       --ranges arg (=361)   number of laser ranges per scan (default=361)

       --span arg (=180)     span of the laser scans (default=180 degrees)

       --std_r arg (=0.01)   range noise sigma (default=0.01 meters)

       --std_b arg (=0.05)   bearing noise sigma (default=0.05 degrees)

       --nologo              skip the logo at startup
