NAME
       HTML::HTML5::Outline::RDF - RDF-related methods

DESCRIPTION
       Some of the RDF-related functionality of "HTML::HTML5::Outline" is split out into this module so that the basic outline functionality can still be used if "RDF::Trine" is not installed.

       RDF support can be disabled using:

               use HTML::HTML5::Outline rdf => 0;

       No user-servicable parts within.

SEE ALSO
       HTML::HTML5::Outline.
