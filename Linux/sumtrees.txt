NAME
       sumtrees - Phylogenetic Tree Summarization and Annotation

SYNOPSIS
       sumtrees [-i FORMAT] [-b BURNIN] [--force-rooted] [--force-unrooted]

DESCRIPTION
       SumTrees is a program to summarize non-parameteric bootstrap or Bayesian posterior probability support for splits or clades on phylogenetic trees.

       The  basis  of  the  support assessment is typically given by a set of non-parametric bootstrap replicate tree samples produced by programs such as GARLI or RAxML, or by a set of MCMC tree samples
       produced by programs such as Mr. Bayes or BEAST. The proportion of trees out of the samples in which a particular split is found is taken to be the degree of support for that split as indicated by
       the samples. The samples that are the basis of the support can be distributed across multiple files, and a burn-in option allows for an initial number of trees in each file to be excluded from the
       analysis if they are not considered to be drawn from the true support distribution.

       Summarizations collections of trees, e.g., MCMC samples from a posterior distribution, non-parametric bootstrap replicates, mapping posterior probability, support, or frequency that  splits/clades
       are found in the source set of trees onto a target tree.

OPTIONS
   Source Options:
       TREE-FILEPATH
              Source(s) of trees to summarize. At least one valid source of trees must be provided. Use '-' to specify reading from standard input (note that this requires the input file format to be ex‐
              plicitly set using the '--source-format' option).

       -i FORMAT, --input-format FORMAT, --source-format FORMAT
              Format of all input trees (defaults to handling either NEXUS or NEWICK through inspection; it is more efficient to explicitly specify the format if it is known).

       -b BURNIN, --burnin BURNIN
              Number of trees to skip from the beginning of *each* tree file when counting support (default: 0).

       --force-rooted, --rooted
              Treat source trees as rooted.

       --force-unrooted, --unrooted
              Treat source trees as unrooted.

       -v, --ultrametricity-precision, --branch-length-epsilon
              Precision to use when validating ultrametricity (default: 1e-05; specify '0' to disable validation).

       --weighted-trees
              Use weights of trees (as indicated by '[&W m/n]' comment token) to weight contribution of splits found on each tree to overall split frequencies.

       --preserve-underscores
              Do not convert unprotected (unquoted) underscores to spaces when reading NEXUS/NEWICK format trees.

       --taxon-name-filepath FILEPATH
              Path to file listing all the taxon names or labels that will be found across the entire set of source trees. This file should be a plain text file with a single name list on each line. This
              file  is  only  read  when multiprocessing ('-M' or '-m') is requested. When multiprocessing using the '-M' or '-m' options, all taxon names need to be defined in advance of any actual tree
              analysis. By default this is done by reading the first tree in the first tree source and extracting the taxon names. At best, this is, inefficient, as it involves an extraneous  reading  of
              the tree. At worst, this can be erroneous, if the first tree does not contain all the taxa. Explicitly providing the taxon names via this option can avoid these issues.

   Target Tree Topology Options:
       -t FILE, --target-tree-filepath FILE
              Summarize  support and other information from the source trees to topology or topologies given by the tree(s) described in FILE. If no use-specified target topologies are given, then a sum‐
              mary topology will be used as the target. Use the '-s' or '--summary-target' to specify the type of summary tree to use.

       -s SUMMARY-TYPE, --summary-target SUMMARY-TYPE
              Construct and summarize support and other information from the source trees to one of the following summary topologies: - 'consensus'

       A consensus tree. The minimum frequency
              threshold of clades to be included can be specified using the '-f' or '--min-clade-freq' flags. This is the DEFAULT if a user- specified target tree is not given through the '-t' or '--tar‐
              get-tree-filepath' options.

       - 'mcct'
              The maximum clade credibility tree. The tree from the source set that maximizes the *product* of clade posterior probabilities.

       - 'msct'
              The maximum clade credibility tree. The tree from the source set that maximizes the *product* of clade posterior probabilities.

   Target Tree Supplemental Options:
       -f #.##, --min-consensus-freq #.##, --min-freq #.##, --min-clade-freq #.##
              If using a consensus tree summarization strategy, then this is the minimum frequency or probability for a clade or a split to be included in the resulting tree (default: > 0.5).

       --allow-unknown-target-tree-taxa
              Do not fail with error if target tree(s) have taxa not previously encountered in source trees or defined in the taxon discovery file.

   Target Tree Rooting Options:
       --root-target-at-outgroup TAXON-LABEL
              Root target tree(s) using specified taxon as outgroup.

       --root-target-at-midpoint
              Root target tree(s) at midpoint.

       --set-outgroup TAXON-LABEL
              Rotate the target trees such the specified taxon is in the outgroup position, but do not explicitly change the target tree rooting.

   Target Tree Edge Options:
       -e STRATEGY, --set-edges STRATEGY, --edges STRATEGY
              Set the edge lengths of the target or summary trees based on the specified summarization STRATEGY: - 'mean-length'

       Edge lengths will be set to the mean of the
              lengths of the corresponding split or clade in the source trees.

       - 'median-length'
              Edge lengths will be set to the median of the

       lengths of the corresponding split or clade in
              the source trees.

       - 'mean-age'
              Edge lengths will be adjusted so that the age of subtended nodes will be equal to the mean age of the corresponding split or clade in the source trees. Source trees will need to to  be  ul‐
              trametric for this option.

       - 'median-age'
              Edge lengths will be adjusted so that the age of subtended nodes will be equal to the median age of the corresponding split or clade in the source trees. Source trees will need to to be ul‐
              trametric for this option.

       - support
              Edge lengths will be set to the support value for the split represented by the edge.

       - 'keep'
              Do not change the existing edge lengths. This is the DEFAULT if target tree(s) are sourced from an external file using the '-t' or '--targettree-filepath' option

       - 'clear'
              Edge lengths will be cleared from the target trees if they are present.

       Note the default settings varies according to the
              following, in order of preference: (1) If target trees are specified using the '-t' or

       '--target-tree-filepath' option, then the default edge
              summarization strategy is: 'keep'.

       (2) If target trees are not specified, but the
              '--summarize-node-ages' option is specified, then the default edge summarization strategy is: 'mean-age'.

       (3) If no target trees are specified and the
              node ages are NOT specified to be summarized, then the default edge summarization strategy is: 'mean-length'.

       --force-minimum-edge-length FORCE_MINIMUM_EDGE_LENGTH
              (If setting edge lengths) force all edges to be at least this length.

       --collapse-negative-edges
              (If setting edge lengths) force parent node ages to be at least as old as its oldest child when summarizing node ages.

   Target Tree Annotation Options:
       --summarize-node-ages, --ultrametric, --node-ages
              Assume that source trees are ultrametic and summarize node ages (distances from tips).

       -l {support,keep,clear}, --labels {support,keep,clear}
              Set the node labels of the summary or target tree(s): - 'support'

       Node labels will be set to the support value for
              the clade represented by the node. This is the DEFAULT.

       - 'keep'
              Do not change the existing node labels.

       - 'clear'
              Node labels will be cleared from the target trees if they are present.

       --suppress-annotations, --no-annotations
              Do NOT annotate nodes and edges with any summarization information metadata such as.support values, edge length and/or node age summary statistcs, etc.

   Support Expression Options:

              If specified, extended summarization information will be generated, consisting of the following files: - '<PREFIX>.topologies.trees'

       A collection of topologies found in the sources
              reported with their associated posterior probabilities as metadata annotations.

       - '<PREFIX>.bipartitions.trees'
