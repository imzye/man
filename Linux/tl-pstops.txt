NAME
       pstops - shuffle pages in a PostScript file

SYNOPSIS
       pstops [-q] [-b] [-wwidth] [-hheight] [-ppaper] [-d[lwidth]] pagespecs [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
       Pstops  rearranges pages from a PostScript document, creating a new PostScript file.  The input PostScript file should follow the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions.  Pstops can be used to perform
       a large number of arbitrary re-arrangements of Documents, including arranging for printing 2-up, 4-up, booklets, reversing, selecting front or back sides of documents, scaling, etc.

       pagespecs follow the syntax:

              pagespecs   = [modulo:]specs

              specs       = spec[+specs|,specs]

              spec        = [-]pageno[L|R|U][H|V][@scale][(xoff,yoff)]

       modulo is the number of pages in each block. The value of modulo should be greater than 0; the default value is 1.  specs are the page specifications for the pages in each  block.  The  value  of  the
       pageno  in each spec should be between 0 (for the first page in the block) and modulo-1 (for the last page in each block) inclusive.  The optional dimensions xoff and yoff shift the page by the speci‐
       fied amount.  xoff and yoff are in PostScript's points, but may be followed by the units cm or in to convert to centimetres or inches, or the flag w or h to specify as  a  multiple  of  the  width  or
       height.   The optional parameters L, R, R, R, and V rotate the page left, right, or upside-down, and flip (mirror) page horizontally or vertically.  The optional scale parameter scales the page by the
       fraction specified.  If the optional minus sign is specified, the page is relative to the end of the document, instead of the start.

       If page specs are separated by + the pages will be merged into one page; if they are separated by , they will be on separate pages.  If there is only one page  specification,  with  pageno  zero,  the
       pageno may be omitted.

       The  shift,  rotation,  and  scaling are applied to the PostScript transformation matrix in that order regardless of which order they appear on the command line.  The matrix accumulates the individual
       transformations.  The effect on the image is to first scale with respect to an origin at the lower left corner, then rotate about the same origin, and finally shift.

       The -w option gives the width which is used by the w dimension specifier, and the -h option gives the height which is used by the h dimension specifier. These dimensions are also used (after  scaling)
       to set the clipping path for each page.  The -p option can be used as an alternative, to set the paper size. See paper(1).

       The -b option prevents any bind operators in the PostScript prolog from binding. This may be needed in cases where complex multi-page re-arrangements are being done.

       The  option draws a line around the border of each page, of the specified width.  If the lwidth parameter is omitted, a default linewidth of 1 point is assumed. The linewidth is relative to the origi‐
       nal page dimensions, i.e., it is scaled up or down with the rest of the page.

       Pstops normally prints the page numbers of the pages re-arranged; the -q option suppresses this.

EXAMPLES
       This section contains some sample re-arrangements. To put two pages on one sheet (of A4 paper), the pagespec to use is:

                                                                                        "2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"

       To select all of the odd pages in reverse order, use:

                                                                                                         2:-0

       To re-arrange pages for printing 2-up booklets, use

                                                                                        "4:-3L@.7(21cm,0)+0L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"

       for the front sides, and

                                                                                        "4:1L@.7(21cm,0)+-2L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"

       for the reverse sides (or join them with a comma for duplex printing).
