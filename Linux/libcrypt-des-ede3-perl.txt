NAME
       Crypt::DES_EDE3 - Triple-DES EDE encryption/decryption

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::DES_EDE3;
           my $ede3 = Crypt::DES_EDE3->new($key);
           $ede3->encrypt($block);

DESCRIPTION
       Crypt::DES_EDE3 implements DES-EDE3 encryption. This is triple-DES encryption where an encrypt operation is encrypt-decrypt-encrypt, and decrypt is decrypt-encrypt-decrypt. This implementation
       uses Crypt::DES to do its dirty DES work, and simply provides a wrapper around that module: setting up the individual DES ciphers, initializing the keys, and performing the encryption/decryption
       steps.

       DES-EDE3 encryption requires a key size of 24 bytes.

       You're probably best off not using this module directly, as the encrypt and decrypt methods expect 8-octet blocks. You might want to use the module in conjunction with Crypt::CBC, for example.
       This would be DES-EDE3-CBC, or triple-DES in outer CBC mode.

USAGE
   $ede3 = Crypt::DES_EDE3->new($key)
       Creates a new Crypt::DES_EDE3 object (really, a collection of three DES ciphers), and initializes each cipher with part of $key, which should be at least 24 bytes. If it's longer than 24 bytes,
       the extra bytes will be ignored.

       Returns the new object.

   $ede3->encrypt($block)
       Encrypts an 8-byte block of data $block using the three DES ciphers in an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt operation.

       Returns the encrypted block.

   $ede3->decrypt($block)
       Decrypts an 8-byte block of data $block using the three DES ciphers in a decrypt-encrypt-decrypt operation.

       Returns the decrypted block.

   $ede3->blocksize
       Returns the block size (8).

   $ede3->keysize
       Returns the key size (24).
