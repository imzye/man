       version:

              Every input file must be sorted per sort-bed.

              USAGE:

       0) --help or --version
              Print requested info and exit successfully

       1) --list-chr <input.bed>
              Print all unique chromosome names found in <input.bed>

       2) <chromosome> <input.bed>
              Retrieve all rows for chr8 with:  bedextract chr8 <input.bed>

       3) <query.bed> <target>
              Grab elements from the <query.bed> that overlap elements in <target>. Same as

       `bedops -e 1 <query.bed> <target>`, except that this option fails silently
              if  <query.bed> contains fully-nested BED elements.  If no fully-nested element exists, bedextract can vastly improve upon the performance of bedops.  <target> may be a BED or Starch file (with
              or without fully-nested elements).  Using '-' for <target> indicates input (in BED format) comes from stdin.
