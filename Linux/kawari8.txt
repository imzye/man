NAME
       kawari_encode, kawari_encode2, kawari_decode2 — kawari 8.0 encoder/decoder

SYNOPSIS
       kawari_encode [file ...]

       kawari_encode2 [file ...]

       kawari_decode2 [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the kawari command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation written in HTML format. For detailed descriptions,
       see doc-base.

       kawari_encode  encodes  kawari  scripts  to an encoded file. So the users for the scripts cannot easily read the content. It can be used to protect the content of Kawari scripts.  It takes several
       text files as inputs and converts them to .kaw files separately.

       kawari_encode2 is an advanced kawari_encode. It is able to assign a symmetric key like some encrypting systems. The key affects the encoding system. Users need the key to decode them.

       kawari_decode2 is a decoder of the .kaw files. It takes several .kaw files and convert them back to .txt files. If the kaw files is encoded by kawari_encode2, the key must  be  provided  correctly
       for decoding.
