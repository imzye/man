NAME
       simplevisor-loop - execute the given command in a loop

SYNOPSIS
       simplevisor-loop [OPTIONS] COMMAND...

DESCRIPTION
       By default, this program executes the given command in a loop, forever, until the command fails (i.e. return a non zero exit status).

       It can optionally sleep between consecutive executions of the command (see the --sleep option) and stop after a given number of executions (see the --count option).

OPTIONS
       --count, -c INTEGER
           stop after having executed the command the given number of times

       --daemon
           detach simplevisor-loop so that it becomes a daemon running in the background; debug, warning and error messages get sent to syslog

       --debug, -d
           show debugging information

       --help, -h, -?
           show some help

       --manual, -m
           show this manual

       --pidfile PATH
           use this pid file

       --quit
           tell another instance of simplevisor-loop (identified by its pid file, as specified by the --pidfile option) to quit

       --sleep, -s NUMBER
           sleep during the given number of seconds between executions of the command; can be fractional

       --status
           get the status of another instance of simplevisor-loop (identified by its pid file, as specified by the --pidfile option); the exit code will be zero if the instance is alive and non-zero
           otherwise
