NAME
       gemdropx - an interesting one-player puzzle game for X-Window

SYNOPSIS
       gemdropx [--help] [--version] [--usage] [--nomusic]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in /usr/share/doc/gemdropx/README.txt.gz

       gemdropx  is an interesting one-player puzzle game for X-Window.  It is a direct port of Gem Drop, an Atari 8-bit game written in Action!  (a very fast C- and Pascal-like compiled language for the
       Atari).  The concept of the game Gem Drop is based on an arcade game for the NeoGeo system called "Magical Drop III" by SNK.

       If you're familiar with games like Jewels, Klax, Bust-A-Move or Tetris, this game is similar to them all.  I consider it closest to Klax.
