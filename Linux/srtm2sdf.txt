[1mNAME[0m
       srtm2sdf  ‐  Generate  SPLAT Data Files (SDFs) from  3‐arc
second STS‐99
       Space  Shuttle  Topography Mission (SRTM‐3) elevation data
files.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1msrtm2sdf [22mis a utility  that  generates  SPLAT  Data
Files (SDFs) from 3‐arc
       second   STS‐99  Space Shuttle Topography Mission (SRTM‐3)
elevation data
       files. This data is of a much higher quality   than   that
contained  in
       older  USGS  Digital  Elevation Models of the same resolu‐
tion. However,
       many  SRTM‐3  Version  2  elevation  models  contain  data
"voids" and "wells"
       that are the consequence of the radar mapping process.

       The   srtm2sdf  utility  has the ability to detect and re‐
place SRTM data
       outliers with equivalent SDF data created through the  us‐
gs2sdf  utility
       (below).  If  equivalent USGS‐derived SPLAT Data Files are
not available,
       SRTM outliers are handled either  through  adjacent  pixel
averaging,  or
       by   threshold   limiting  using user‐specified limits. Of
all three meth‐
       ods, the USGS‐derived SDF replacement  method  yields  the
best results.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The  srtm2sdf utility accepts command‐line options as fol‐
lows:

       ‐d     used to specify the directory path to the  location
of  existing
              SDF  files  The ‐d option overridesthe default path
specified in
              your $HOME/.splat_path file.

       ‐n     used to specify the  elevation  (in  meters)  below
which SRTM  data
              is  replaced. Below this limit, SRTM elevation data
is either re‐
              placed using existing  SDF  equivalent  files,   or
averaged  among
              adjacent   elevation   data   points.  The  default
threshold for the
              replacement limit is sea‐level (0   meters).    Un‐
less  elevations
              below   sea‐level  are  known  to exist for the re‐
gion being pro‐
              cessed by the srtm2sdf utility, the ‐n option  need
not be speci‐
              fied.
