NAME
       cinnamon-session - Start the GNOME desktop environment

SYNOPSIS
       cinnamon-session [-a|--autostart=DIR] [--session=SESSION] [--failsafe|-f] [--debug] [--whale]

DESCRIPTION
       The  cinnamon-session  program starts up the GNOME desktop environment. This command is typically executed by your login manager (either mdm, xdm, or from your X startup scripts). It will load ei‐
       ther your saved session, or it will provide a default session for the user as defined by the system administrator (or the default GNOME installation on your system).

       The default session is  defined  in  gnome.session,  a  .desktop-like  file  that  is  looked  for  in  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cinnamon-session/sessions,  $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/cinnamon-session/sessions  and
       $XDG_DATA_DIRS/cinnamon-session/sessions.

       When saving a session, cinnamon-session saves the currently running applications in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cinnamon-session/saved-session directory.

       cinnamon-session is an X11R6 session manager. It can manage GNOME applications as well as any X11R6 SM compliant application.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --autostart=DIR
              Start all applications defined in DIR, instead of starting the applications defined in gnome.session, or via the --session option. Multiple --autostart options can be passed.

       --session=SESSION
              Use the applications defined in SESSION.session. If not specified, gnome.session will be used.

       --failsafe
              Run in fail-safe mode. User-specified applications will not be started.

       --debug
              Enable debugging code.

       --whale
              Show the fail whale in a dialog for debugging it.

SESSION DEFINITION
       Sessions are defined in .session files, that are using a .desktop-like format, with the following keys in the GNOME Session group:

       Name   Name of the session. This can be localized.

       RequiredComponents
              List of component identifiers (desktop files) that are required by the session. The required components will always run in the session.

       RequiredProviders
              List  of task providers that are required by the session. A default provider for each task has to be defined with a DefaultProvider-TASK key; the provider can be overridden by required com‐
              ponents, the saved session or autostart applications. The task providers will always run in the session.

       DefaultProvider-TASK
              Identifier (desktop file) of the default provider for TASK. If no provider for TASK is found in the required components, the saved session and in the  autostart  applications,  the  default
              provider will be started.

       Here is an example of a session definition:

           [GNOME Session]
           Name=GNOME fallback
           RequiredComponents=gnome-panel;metacity;gnome-settings-daemon;
           RequiredProviders=notifications;
           DefaultProvider-notifications=notification-daemon

       The .session files are looked for in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cinnamon-session/sessions, $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/cinnamon-session/sessions and $XDG_DATA_DIRS/cinnamon-session/sessions.

ENVIRONMENT
       cinnamon-session sets several environment variables for the use of its child processes:

       SESSION_MANAGER

              This variable is used by session-manager aware clients to contact cinnamon-session.

       DISPLAY

              This  variable  is  set  to the X display being used by cinnamon-session. Note that if the --display option is used this might be different from the setting of the environment variable when
              cinnamon-session is invoked.

FILES
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/config/autostart $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/config/autostart /usr/share/gnome/autostart

              The applications defined in those directories will be started on login.  cinnamon-settings(1) can be used to easily configure them.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cinnamon-session/sessions $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/cinnamon-session/sessions $XDG_DATA_DIRS/cinnamon-session/sessions

              These directories contain the .session files that can be used with the --session option.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cinnamon-session/saved-session

              This directory contains the list of applications of the saved session.
