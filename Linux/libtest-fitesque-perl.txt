NAME
       Test::FITesque::Test - A FITesque test

SYNOPSIS
         my $test = Test::FITesque::Test->new();

         # add test rows
         $test->add( ... );
         $test->add( ... );

         # return number of TAP tests
         $test->test_count();

         $test->run_tests();

DESCRIPTION
METHODS
   new
         my $test = Test::FITesque::Test->new();

       This is a simple constructor. It takes a hashref of options:

       data
           This is an arrayref of arrayrefs for the FITesque run.

       Please note that the first test row that is added must be the FITesque fixture class name, followed by the arguments to be passed to its constructor.

   add
         $test->add(qw(Foo::Fixture some constructor args));
         $test->add('click button', 'search');

       This method allows you to add FITesque test rows individually. As with the data option in the constructor, the first row added must be the Fixture class name and its constructor arguments.

   test_count
         my $count = $test->test_count();

       This method returns the number of TAP tests expected to be run during the test run.

   run_tests
         $test->run_tests();

       This method will run the FITesque test based upon the data supplied.
