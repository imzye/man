NAME
       appstreamcli-compose - Compose AppStream metadata catalog from directory trees

SYNOPSIS

       appstreamcli compose [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the appstreamcli compose command.

       The appstreamcli compose tool is used to construct AppStream metadata catalogs from directory trees. The tool will also perform many related metadata generation actions, like resizing icons and
       screenshots and merging in data from referenced desktop-entry files as well as translation status information. Therefore, the tool provides a fast way to test how the final processed metadata for
       an application that is shipped to users may look like. It also provides a way to easily generate AppStream data for projects which do not need a more complex data generator like
       appstream-generator.

       In order for the appstreamcli compose command to be available, you may need to install the optional compose module for appstreamcli first.

       For more information about the AppStream project and the other components which are part of it, take a look at the AppStream pages at Freedesktop.org[1].

OPTIONS
       SOURCE-DIRECTORIES
           A list of directories to process needs to be provided as positional parameters. Data from all directories will be combined into one output namespace.

       --origin NAME
           Set the AppStream data origin identifier. This can be a value like "debian-unstable-main" or "flathub".

       --result-root DIR
           Sets the directory where all generated output that is deployed to a user's machine is exported to. If this parameter is not set and we only have one directory to process, we use that directory
           as default output path.

           If both --data-dir and --icons-dir are set, --result-root is not necessary and no data will be written to that directory.

       --data-dir DIR
           Override the directory where the generated AppStream metadata catalog will be written to. Data will be written directly to this directory, and no supdirectories will be created (unlike when
           using --result-root to set an output location).

       --icons-dir DIR
           Override the directory where the cached icons are exported to.

       --hints-dir DIR
           Set a directory where hints reported generated during metadata processing are saved to. If this parameter is not set, no HTML/YAML hint reports will be saved.

       --media-dir DIR
           If set, creates a directory with media content (icons, screenshots, ...) that can be served via a webserver. The metadata will be extended to include information about these remote media.

       --media-baseurl URL
           The URL under which the contents of a directory set via --media-dir will be served. This value must be set if a media directory is created.

       --prefix DIR
           Set the default prefix that is used in the processed directories. If none is set explicitly, /usr is assumed.

       --print-report MODE
           Print the issue hints report (that gets exported as HTML and YAML document when --hints-dir was set) to the console in text form.

           Various print modes are supported: on-error only prints a short report if the run failed (default), short generates an abridged report that is always printed and full results in a detailed
           report to be printed.

       --no-partial-urls
           If set, all URLs in the generated data will be absolute and media_baseurl will not be used. This makes changing the media mirror harder without regenerating all data and is generally not
           recommended, to increase flexibility.

       --icon-policy POLICY-STRING
           Override the existing icon policy with a custom one. The icon policy sets how icons of different sizes should be dealt with. They can be in the icon cache only, be a remote icon in the media
           location or be both cached and available in the remote location.

           The icon-policy string is comprised of comma-separated %{size}x%{size}@%{scale}=%{state} statements. The size and scale are that of the respective icon, with the scale being allowed to be
           omitted if it is 1. The state can be one of remote, cached or cached-remote.

           By default, a policy of 48x48=cached,48x48@2=cached,64x64=cached,64x64@2=cached,128x128=cached-remote,128x128@2=cached-remote is selected.

       --allow-custom CUSTOM-KEY-NAMES
           By default, all custom entries set in MetaInfo input data are removed. This flag allows one to whitelist custom keys to be propagated to the final catalog output data. The custom-key names
           should be provided as a comma-separated list.

       --components COMPONENT-IDs
           Set a comma-separated list of AppStream component IDs that should be considered for the generated metadata. All components that exist in the input data but are not mentioned in this list will
           be ignored for the generated output.

       --no-color
           Don't print colored output.

       --verbose
           Display extra debugging information

       --version
           Display the version number of appstreamcli compose
