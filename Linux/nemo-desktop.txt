NOTE ON THE ROOT USER
       Ordinarily,  nemo  and  nemo-desktop treat being run as the root user as special, with certain restrictions and UI changes. This behavior can be bypassed via a gsettings key. You can use the following
       command to enable/disable this override:

       gsettings set org.nemo.preferences treat-root-as-normal true|false
