DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cbcodec commands.

       cbcodec is  a tool to use encoding and decoding features provided by Cabin. This command is used in the above format. file specifies a input file. If it is omitted, the standard input is read.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the file:///usr/share/doc/qdbm-doc/spex.html#cabincli.

       -d     perform decoding (unescaping), not encoding (escaping).

       -br    break up URL into elements.

       -rs    resolve relative URL.

       -l     output the tailing newline.

       -e expr
              specify input data directly.

       -c num limit the number of columns of the encoded data.

       -hd    parse MIME and extract headers in TSV format.

       -bd    parse MIME and extract the body.

       -part num
              parse MIME and extract a part.

       -ec code
              specify the input encoding, which is UTF-8 by default.

       -qp    use quoted-printable encoding, which is Base64 by default.

       -dc    output the encoding name instead of the result string when decoding.

       -t     parse CSV. Convert the data into TSV. Tab and new-line in a cell are deleted.

       -html  parse CSV. Convert the data into HTML.

       -p     parse XML. Show tags and text sections with dividing headers.

       -tsv   parse XML. Show the result in TSV format. Characters of tabs and new-lines are URL-encoded.

       -gz    use GZIP format.

       -crc   output the CRC32 checksum as hexadecimal and big endian.

       -ic code
              specify the input encoding, which is detected automatically by default.

       -oc code
              specify the output encoding, which is UTF-8 by default.

       -ol ltype
              convert line feed characters, with `unix'(LF), `dos'(CRLF), and `mac'(CR).

       -cn    detect the input encoding and show its name.

       -wc    count the number of characters of the input string of UTF-8.

       -um    output mappings of UCS-2 characters and C strings of UTF-16BE and UTF-8.

       -wf    output in W3CDTF format.

       -rf    output in RFC 1123 format.

       -utc   output the coordinate universal time.
