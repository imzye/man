NAME
       cdk - Curses Development Kit

SYNOPSIS
       cc [ flag ... ] file ...  -lcdk [ library ... ]

       #include <cdk.h>

       Cdk provides functions to use a large number of predefined curses widgets.  To use the Cdk widgets the header file, cdk.h must be included in the source.

       The widgets available from Cdk are listed below.

DESCRIPTION
       Cdk is a library of functions which allow a programmer to quickly create a full screen interactive program with ease.  The Cdk widgets support the following features:

       • Ncurses library.
            Instead of using the standard curses library, Cdk can take advantage of the colors that Ncurses provides.  To learn how to take advantage of Cdk's color capabilities, see cdk_display (3).

       • Key Bindings.
            Individual keys can be overridden with a callback.  The callback is set up using the bindCDKObject function.  To learn more about this see cdk_binding (3).

       • Pre and Post Processing.
            Certain widgets allow the user to trap a character before and after the character has been applied to the widget.  This allows programmers to “filter” character input.  To learn more  about  this
            see cdk_process (3).

       • Self Test Widgets.
            With the use of the inject function class and the activate function, programmers can have the widgets test themselves.  This allows the programmer to perform automated tests on a final program.

       • Special Display Formats
            There  are special character format commands that can be inserted into any string in Cdk and the contents will get mapped to a chtype (see the curses manual page) with character attributes.  This
            allows the programmer to insert format types on each character if they wish.

       • The Ability To Build Predefined Screens
            Widgets can be associated to any given screen.  If there is more than one screen defined, then Cdk has the ability to "flip" from one screen to another with ease.  See the cdk_screen manual  page
            for more details.

STANDARD WIDGET BEHAVIOR
       All of the widgets have a member of the structure called exitType.  This member states how the widget exited.  There are three values in which to check for, they are as follows:
