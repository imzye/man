NAME
       acorn-fdisk — partition editor for Acorn/RISC OS machines

SYNOPSIS
       acorn-fdisk -h | --help | -v | --version

       acorn-fdisk [-t scheme | --type scheme] -l | --list [device ...]

       acorn-fdisk [-t scheme | --type scheme] -s | --size partition

       acorn-fdisk [-t scheme | --type scheme] [device]

DESCRIPTION
       The  acorn-fdisk utility allows one to display or interactively edit partition tables for Acorn/RISC OS machines in various formats.  Using the PC/BIOS format, standard IBM PC (i386) partition ta‐
       bles can also be accessed.  When no optional device is given, it defaults to /dev/hda or /dev/sda.

       The options are as follows:

       -h | --help  Display a short usage and exit immediately.

       -l | --list  Display the partition table(s) of all devices.

       -s | --size  Display the size of partition.

       -t | --type  Select the partitioning scheme to use.  Valid schemes are:

                    EESOX            Eesox SCSI on the Acorn machines.

                    ICSIDEFS         ICS IDE.

                    Filecore/Linux   Linux on Filecore.  This uses the non-ADFS descriptor to point to the start of the disc to be partitioned.  The first two sectors contain a partition table  to  iden‐
                                     tify the Linux partitions contained within.

                    PC/BIOS          PC/BIOS partitioning scheme.  This consists of a partition table in the first sector of the disk which contains both CHS and LBA values for the partitions.  There can
                                     be up to four entries in the primary partition table.  One of these can be an extended partition containing up to four extra partitions.

                    PowerTec         PowerTec SCSI on the Acorn machines.

                    Filecore/RISCiX  RiscIX on Filecore.

       -v | --version
                    Display the version of acorn-fdisk and exit immediately.

       If neither -l | --list or -s | --size are given, the partition table of the given device will be edited interactively.

EXAMPLES
       Display the default device's partition table on a PC:

             acorn-fdisk --type PC/BIOS -l

       Display the PC partition table of /dev/sda:

             acorn-fdisk --type PC/BIOS --list /dev/sda

       Display the size in blocks of the partition /dev/sda1:

             acorn-fdisk --type PC/BIOS --size /dev/sda1

       Edit the MBR partition table interactively:

             acorn-fdisk --type PC/BIOS

       Display the partition table of an MBR backed up to a file:

             acorn-fdisk -t PC/BIOS -l mbrdump.bin

       Display the size of the first partition on a device where the MBR would be restored from the backup file mbrdump.bin:

             acorn-fdisk -t PC/BIOS -s mbrdump.bin1
