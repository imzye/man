USAGES
       pgpool runs in 3 modes: start, stop and reload. If none of stop or reload is given, it is assumed that "start" is specified.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These are common options for 3 modes.

       -a hba_config_file
       --hba-file=hba_config_file
           Set the path to the pool_hba.conf configuration file. Mandatory if the file is placed other than the standard location.

       -f config_file
       --config-file=config_file
           Set the path to the pgpool.conf configuration file. Mandatory if the file is placed other than the standard location.

       -F pc_config_file
       --pcp-file=pcp_config_file
           Set the path to the pcp.conf configuration file. Mandatory if the file is placed other than the standard location.

       -k key_file
       --key-file=key_file
           Set the path to the .pgpoolkey file. Mandatory if you use AES256 encrypted password and the file is placed other than the standard location and used.

       -h
       --help
           Print help.

STARTING PGPOOL-II MAIN SERVER
       Here are options for the start mode.

       -d
       --debug
           Run Pgpool-II in debug mode. Lots of debug messages are produced.

       -n
       --dont-detach
           Don't run in daemon mode, does not detach control ttys.

       -x
       --debug-assertions
           Turns on various assertion checks, This is a debugging aid.

       -C
       --clear-oidmaps
           Clear query cache oidmaps when memqcache_method is memcached.

           If memqcache_method is shmem, Pgpool-II always discards oidmaps at the start-up time. So this option is not necessary.

       -D
       --discard-status
           Discard pgpool_status file and do not restore previous status.

               Caution
               This option is testing purpose only for developers and you should not use it for other purposes. If pgpool_status is accidentally removed, Pgpool-II may go into split-brain (there are
               multiple primary servers exist).

STOPPING PGPOOL-II MAIN SERVER
       Here are options for the stop mode.

       -m shutdown_mode
       --mode=shutdown_mode
           Stop Pgpool-II.  shutdown_mode is either smart, fast or immediate. If smart is specified, Pgpool-II will wait for all clients are disconnected. If fast or immediate are specified, Pgpool-II
           immediately stops itself without waiting for all clients are disconnected. There's no difference between fast and immediate in the current implementation.

RELOADING PGPOOL-II CONFIGURATION FILES
       Reload configuration file of Pgpool-II. No specific options exist for reload mode. Common options are applicable.
