NAME
       x2gobroker-pubkeyauthorizer - Retrieve public SSH keys from an X2Go Session Broker

SYNOPSIS
       x2gobroker-pubkeyauthorizer [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       x2gobroker-pubkeyauthorizer retrieves the X2Go Session Broker's public SSH key(s) and adds it to ~x2gobroker/.ssh/authorized_keys.

       This command has to be executed once on each X2Go Server that is to become a member of a muli-node X2Go server farm. The execution of this command requires root-privileges.

              Display a help with all available command line options and exit.

       -b <BROKER_URL>, --broker-url <BROKER_URL>
              The  URL  of  the X2Go Session Broker that we want to retrieve public keys from.  The common pattern for this URL is http(s)://<broker_hostname>:<port>/pubkeys/, but may differ depending on
              your X2Go Session Broker setup.
