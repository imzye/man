NAME
       symilar - tool for checking similarities in different files

SYNOPSIS
       symilar [ options ] [ <files> ]

DESCRIPTION
       symilar  is a tool for searching blocks of identical lines in different
       files. It can be used to find copy pasted blocks of code, or stuff that
       could  be  refactored.   Differences concerning only stuff behind a '#'
       (Python comments) can be ignored.  The size of identical blocks can  be
       optionally  modified.  symilar ´s functionality is integrated in pylint
       with the refactoring message 'R0801'.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show help message and exit

       -d <min_duplicated_lines>, --duplicates <min_duplicated_lines>
              minimum number of identical lines that should trigger a similar‐
              ity  message.   Default  is 4. So if it finds 3 identical lines,
              there will be no message, but 4 identical  lines  will  be  men‐
              tioned.

       -i, --ignore-comments
              ignore  differences  concerning  only stuff behind a '#' (Python
              comments). This means that if just a comment was added, the mes‐
              sage will still be triggered.
