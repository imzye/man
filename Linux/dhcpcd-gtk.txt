NAME
       dhcpcd-gtk — a GTK+ frontend for network configuration

DESCRIPTION
       dhcpcd-gtk is a GTK+ frontend for network configuration.  It uses dhcpcd(8) and wpa_supplicant(8) as backends.  dhcpcd(8) needs to be running in Master mode for dhcpcd-gtk to work with it.

       If dhcpcd-gtk is used to make configuration changes then the user needs to be able to write to the privileged dhcpcd control socket as well as /etc/dhcpcd.conf.  See dhcpcd.conf(5) for details.

   wpa_supplicant
       dhcpcd-gtk relies on wpa_supplicant(8) being configured to write its sockets to /var/run/wpa_supplicant. If dhcpcd-gtk is used to select and set pass phrases for wireless networks then update_con‐
       fig=1 needs to be set in wpa_supplicant.conf.
