NAME
       gammurc - gammu(1) configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       On Linux, MacOS X, BSD and other Unix-like systems, the config file is searched in following order:

       1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gammu/config

       2. ~/.config/gammu/config

       3. ~/.gammurc

       4. /etc/gammurc

       On Microsoft Windows:

       1. %PROFILE%\Application Data\gammurc

       2. .\gammurc

DESCRIPTION
       Gammu requires configuration to be able to properly talk to your phone.  gammu reads configuration from a config file. It's location is determined on runtime, see above for search paths.

       You can use gammu-config or gammu-detect to generate configuration file or start from Fully documented example.

       For hints about configuring your phone, you can check Gammu Phone Database <https://wammu.eu/phones/> to see what user users experienced.

       This file use ini file syntax, see ini.

       Configuration  file  for gammu can contain several sections - [gammu], [gammu1], [gammuN], ... Each section configures one connection setup and in default mode gammu tries all of them in numerical
       order. You can also specify which configuration section to use by giving it's number ([gammu] has number 0) as a parameter to gammu and it will then use only this section.

       [gammu]

       This section is read by default unless you specify other on command line.

   Device connection parameters
       Connection
              Protocol which will be used to talk to your phone.

              For Nokia cables you want to use one of following:

              fbus   serial FBUS connection

              dlr3   DLR-3 and compatible cables

              dku2   DKU-2 and compatible cables

              dku5   DKU-5 and compatible cables

              mbus   serial MBUS connection

              If you use some non original cable, you might need to append -nodtr (eg. for ARK3116 based cables) or -nopower, but Gammu should be able to detect this automatically.

              For non-Nokia phones connected using cable you generally want:

              at     generic AT commands based connection

              You can optionally specify speed of the connection, eg. at19200, but it is not needed for modern USB cables.

              For IrDA connections use one of following:

              irdaphonet
                     Phonet connection for Nokia phones.

              irdaat AT commands connection for most of phones (this is not supported on Linux).

              irdaobex
                     OBEX (IrMC or file transfer) connection for most of phones.

              irdagnapbus
                     GNapplet based connection for Symbian phones, see gnapplet.

              For Bluetooth connection use one of following:

              bluephonet
                     Phonet connection for Nokia phones.

              bluefbus
                     FBUS connection for Nokia phones.

              blueat AT commands connection for most of phones.

              blueobex
                     OBEX (IrMC or file transfer) connection for most of phones.

              bluerfgnapbus
                     GNapplet based connection for Symbian phones, see gnapplet.

              blues60
                     Connection to Series60 applet in S60 phones, see s60.

                     New in version 1.29.90.

              New in version 1.36.7: Gammu now supports connecting using proxy command.

              You can also proxy the connection using shell command, for example to different host. This can be done using proxy connections:

              proxyphonet
                     Phonet connection for Nokia phones.

              proxyfbus
                     FBUS connection for Nokia phones.

              proxyat
                     AT commands connection for most of phones.

              proxyobex
                     OBEX (IrMC or file transfer) connection for most of phones.

              proxygnapbus
                     GNapplet based connection for Symbian phones, see gnapplet.

       Device New in version 1.27.95.

              Device node or address of phone. It depends on used connection.

              For cables or emulated serial ports, you enter device name (for example /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyACM0, /dev/ircomm0, /dev/rfcomm0 on Linux, /dev/cuad0 on FreeBSD or COM1: on Windows).  The  spe‐
              cial exception are DKU-2 and DKU-5 cables on Windows, where the device is automatically detected from driver information and this parameters is ignored.

              NOTE:
                 Some USB modems expose several interfaces, in such cases Gammu works best with "User" one, you can find more information on <http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Mobile_Broadband>.

              For USB connections (currently only fbususb and dku2 on Linux), you can specify to which USB device Gammu should connect. You can either provide vendor/product IDs or device address on USB:

                 Device = 0x1234:0x5678  # Match device by vendor and product id
                 Device = 0x1234:-1      # Match device by vendor id
                 Device = 1.10           # Match device by usb bus and device address
                 Device = 10             # Match device by usb device address
                 Device = serial:123456  # Match device by serial string

              NOTE:
                 On  Linux systems, you might lack permissions for some device nodes.  You might need to be member of some group (eg. plugdev or dialout) or or add special udev rules to enable you access
                 these devices as non-root.

                 For Nokia phones you can put following file (also available in sources as contrib/udev/69-gammu-acl.rules) as /etc/udev/rules.d/69-gammu-acl.rules:

                     #
                     # udev rule to give users access to USB device to be used by Gammu
                     #

                     ACTION!="add|change", GOTO="gammu_acl_rules_end"

                     KERNEL!="ttyACM[0-9]*", GOTO="gammu_acl_rules_end"
                     SUBSYSTEM!="tty", GOTO="gammu_acl_rules_end"

                     # Nokia devices
                     ATTRS{manufacturer}=="Nokia", TAG+="uaccess"

                     # Example for Sony Ericsson J108i Cedar
                     # ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fce", ATTRS{idProduct}=="d14e", TAG+="uaccess"

                     LABEL="gammu_acl_rules_end"

              In case your USB device appears as the serial port in the system (eg.  /dev/ttyACM0 on Linux or COM5: on Windows), just use same setup as with serial port.

              For Bluetooth connection you have to enter Bluetooth address of your phone (you can list Bluetooth devices in range on Linux using hcitool scan command). Optionally you can also force Gammu
              to use specified channel by including channel number after slash.

              Before using Gammu, your device should be paired with computer or you should have set up automatic pairing.

              For Proxy connections, you need to specify command which should be executed. It is supposed to pass bidirectional communication from Gammu to the device. This can happen  for  example  over
              network.

              For IrDA connections, this parameters is not used at all.

              If IrDA does not work on Linux, you might need to bring up the interface and enable discovery (you need to run these commands as root):

                 ip l s dev irda0 up          # Enables irda0 device
                 sysctl net.irda.discovery=1  # Enables device discovery on IrDA

              NOTE:
                 Native  IrDA is not supported on Linux, you need to setup virtual serial port for it (eg. /dev/ircomm0) and use it same way as cable.  This can be usually achieved by loading modules ir‐
                 comm-tty and irtty-sir:

                     modprobe ircomm-tty
                     modprobe irtty-sir

              SEE ALSO:
                 faq-config

       Port   Deprecated since version 1.27.95: Please use Device instead.

              Alias for Device, kept for backward compatibility.

       Model  Do not use this parameter unless really needed! The only use case for this is when Gammu does not know your phone and misdetects it's features.

              The only special case for using model is to force special type of OBEX connection instead of letting Gammu try the best suited for selected operation:

              obexfs force using of file browsing service (file system support)

              obexirmc
                     force using of IrMC service (contacts, calendar and notes support)

              obexnone
                     none service chosen, this has only limited use for sending file (gammu sendfile command)

              mobex  m-obex service for Samsung phones

       Use_Locking
              On Posix systems, you might want to lock serial device when it is being used using UUCP-style lock files. Enabling this option (setting to yes) will make Gammu honor these locks and  create
              it on startup. On most distributions you need additional privileges to use locking (eg. you need to be member of uucp group).

              This option has no meaning on Windows.

   Connection options
       SynchronizeTime
              If you want to set time from computer to phone during starting connection.

       StartInfo
              This  option allows one to set, that you want (setting yes) to see message on the phone screen or phone should enable light for a moment during starting connection. Phone will not beep dur‐
              ing starting connection with this option. This works only with some Nokia phones.

   Debugging options
       LogFile
              Path to file where information about communication will be stored.

              NOTE:
                 For most debug levels (excluding errors) the log file is overwritten on each execution.

       LogFormat
              Determines what all will be logged to LogFile. Possible values are:

              nothing
                     no debug level

              text   transmission dump in text format

              textall
                     all possible info in text format

              textalldate
                     all possible info in text format, with time stamp

              errors errors in text format

              errorsdate
                     errors in text format, with time stamp

              binary transmission dump in binary format

              For debugging use either textalldate or textall, it contains all needed information to diagnose problems.

       Features
              Custom features for phone. This can be used as override when values coded in common/gsmphones.c are bad or missing. Consult include/gammu-info.h for possible values (all GSM_Feature  values
              without leading F_ prefix). Please report correct values to Gammu authors.

   Locales and character set options
       GammuCoding
              Forces using specified codepage (for example 1250 will force CP-1250 or utf8 for UTF-8). This should not be needed, Gammu detects it according to your locales.

       GammuLoc
              Path to directory with localisation files (the directory should contain LANG/LC_MESSAGES/gammu.mo). If gammu is properly installed it should find these files automatically.

   Advanced options
       Advanced options are used to alter default logic, when using these options the user is responsible for ensuring any settings are correct for the target device and that they produce the desired be‐
       haviour.

       atgen_setCNMI
              For configurations using the generic AT command protocol it is possible to override the default indicators used when a new SMS message is received.

              The  value for the setting is a comma delimited list of single digits corresponding to the values for the AT+CNMI modem command. If a digit is not provided, or if the provided digit is out‐
              side of the acceptable range for the device the default value is used.

              For example setting atgen_setcnmi = ,,2 would set the third parameter of the CNMI command to the value 2, leaving the rest of the parameters at default, and atgen_setcnmi = 1,,,1 would  set
              the first and fourth parameters respectively.

   Other options
       DataPath
              Additional path where to search for data files. The default path is configured on build time (and defaults to /usr/share/data/gammu on Unix systems). Currently it is used only for searching
              files to upload to phone using gammu install.

EXAMPLES
       There is more complete example available in Gammu documentation, see gammu.

   Connection examples
       Gammu configuration for Nokia phone using DLR-3 cable:

          [gammu]
          device = /dev/ttyACM0
          connection = dlr3

       Gammu configuration for Sony-Ericsson phone (or any other AT compatible phone) connected using USB cable:

          [gammu]
          device = /dev/ttyACM0
          connection = at

       Gammu configuration for Sony-Ericsson (or any other AT compatible phone) connected using bluetooth:

          [gammu]
          device = B0:0B:00:00:FA:CE
          connection = blueat

       Gammu configuration for phone which needs to manually adjust Bluetooth channel to use channel 42:

          [gammu]
          device = B0:0B:00:00:FA:CE/42
          connection = blueat

   Working with multiple phones
       Gammu  can  be  configured  for multiple phones (however only one connection is used at one time, you can choose which one to use with gammu -s parameter). Configuration for phones on three serial
       ports would look like following:

          [gammu]
          device = /dev/ttyS0
          connection = at

          [gammmu1]
          device = /dev/ttyS1
          connection = at

          [gammmu2]
          device = /dev/ttyS2
          connection = at

   Connecting to remote phone
       New in version 1.36.7.

       You can connect using Gammu to phone running on different host. This can be achieved using proxy connection, which executes command to forward bi-directional communication with the phone.

          [gammu]
          device = ssh root@my.router /usr/local/bin/myscript /dev/ttyUSB0
          connection = proxyat

       You can find sample script which can be used on the remote side in contrib/proxy/gammu-backend.

   Fully documented example
       You can find this sample file as docs/config/gammurc in Gammu sources.

          ; This is a sample ~/.gammurc file.
          ; In Unix/Linux  copy it into your home directory and name it .gammurc
          ;                or into /etc and name it gammurc
          ; In Win32       copy it into directory with Gammu.exe and name gammurc
