NAME
       xmlsec-txfmout - Output XML transforms used when validating a signature

SYNOPSIS
       xmlsec-txfmout [-s] [-o] [-r [n]] [-n] input

DESCRIPTION
       xmlsec-txfmout outputs the results of various transforms that are used when verifying signatures on an XML document.  By default, the output is sent to standard output.

OPTIONS
       Note that each option must be given as a separate argument.

       --newfiles, -n
           Create a new output file for each reference or SignedInfo.  This should be specified in conjunction with -o.  The file names will be formed by appending "." and a number.

       --out file, -o file
           Instead of printing the transform results to standard output, write them to the specified file.

       --references [num], -r [num]
           Output only references.  If num is given, it specifies a single numbered reference to output.

       --signedinfo, -s
           Output canonicalized SignedInfo only.
