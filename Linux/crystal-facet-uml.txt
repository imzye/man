CRYSTAL-FACET-UML(1)                                                                   crystal-facet-uml Command Line                                                                  CRYSTAL-FACET-UML(1)

NAME
       crystal-facet-uml - creates a set of uml diagrams. crystal-facet-uml ensures consistency of relationships and uml element names between different diagrams. crystal-facet-uml exports diagrams in
       various vector and pixel-based image formats.

SYNOPSIS

       crystal-facet-uml [-u database_file ]

       crystal-facet-uml {-t | -r} database_file

       crystal-facet-uml {-h | -v}

       crystal-facet-uml -e database_file export_format export_directory

       crystal-facet-uml -i database_file import_mode json_input_file

DESCRIPTION
       crystal-facet-uml provides a graphical user interface to

       •   create, modify and delete diagrams,

       •   create, modify and delete UML/SysML elements,

       •   create, modify and delete relationships,

       •   cut, copy, paste elements between diagrams,

       •   undo and redo are supported,

       •   multiple windows can show different or same parts of the uml model,

       •   search for elements.

       Diagrams are layouted part-automatically:

       •   The user chooses the relative location of elements towards others,

       •   crystal-facet-uml defines the exact locations of shown elements.

       •   The user controls the positions of messages/transitions in sequence and timing diagrams,

       •   crystal-facet-uml auto-layouts relationships in other diagrams.

       crystal-facet-uml manages a meta model:

       •   Diagrams are organized as a tree, similar to a book's table-of-contents;

       •   Uml(TM)/SysML(TM) elements exist only once even if shown in many diagrams;

       •   Relationships and features are consistent between all diagrams;

       •   Diagram-local messages/transitions are supported in scenario-based interaction diagrams: sequence, communication, timing, interaction overview.

       •   These extension mechanisms of UML are supported: Tagged values and stereotypes including stereotype images.

       Diagrams can be exported as

       •   images: pdf, ps, svg, png,

       •   text: utf-8, DocBook, html,

       •   machine-readable model: json, xmi(TM).

       crystal-facet-uml can also be started from command line

       •   to export all diagrams automatically or

       •   to import a previously exported json file or

       •   to check and repair database files.

OPTIONS
       Without options, the program starts in graphical mode. See crystal-facet-uml_documentation.pdf for graphical mode usage.

       -u database_file
           Starts in graphical mode and opens the database_file immediately.

           If the file does not exist, a new, empty database is created. If database_file ends on .cfu1, a binary database file is created. Otherwise, a json data file is created.

       -t database_file
           Tests the consistency of a database_file. In case of an error, a non-zero value is returned.

       -r database_file
           Tests the consistency of a database_file and repairs found issues.

       -h
           Show summary of options.

       -v
           Show version

       -e database_file export_format export_directory
           Exports all diagrams of a database_file in export_format to the export_directory. Valid formats are: docbook, html, json, pdf, png, ps, svg, txt, xmi. Please be aware that the export
           overwrites possibly existing files in the export_directory without notice.

       -i database_file import_mode json_input_file
           Imports elements from json_input_file to the database_file. Valid modes are: check, add. Please create a backup of your database_file before importing.

EXAMPLE
       The json-based data file can be stored in a version control system (vcs) like svn or git.

       •   Close the crystal-facet-uml application before synchronizing a file with your vcs. Do not synchronize the file with your vcs while you modify it at the same time.

       •   In case of merge conflicts in the json-based data files, note that uuid strings do uniquely identify all json objects. Relations between objects are defined by these uuid strings. In contrast
           to uuids, integer-id can be changed as long as they are unique among all objects of same type within the file. Also the names of classifiers (nodes) must be unique.

       •   To see the changes between versions of the json file, consider to use the patience option: git diff --patience The result may better explain the changes.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on syslog:

       EVT : ...
           An event occurred (DEBUG mode only).

       ANOM: ...
           Something unexpected happened that was handled (DEBUG mode only).

       WARN: ...
           Something unexpected happened that may cause a failure.

       ERR : ...
           Something unexpected happened that has caused a failure.

       journalctl -f allows one to read the syslog.
