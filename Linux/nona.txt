NAME
       nona - Stitch a panorama image

SYNOPSIS
       nona [options] -o output project_file (image files)

DESCRIPTION
       nona uses the transform function from PanoTools, the stitching itself is quite simple, no seam feathering is done.

       Only the non-antialiasing interpolators of PanoTools are supported.

       The following output formats (n option of PanoTools p script line) are supported:

       JPEG, TIFF, PNG  : Single image formats without feathered blending
       JPEG_m, TIFF_m, PNG_m   : multiple tiff files
       TIFF_multilayer : Multilayer tiff files, readable by The Gimp 2.0

OPTIONS
       General options:

       -c  Create coordinate images (only TIFF_m output)

       -v  Quiet, do not output progress indicators

       -d  print detailed output for GPU processing

       -g  perform image remapping on the GPU

       The following options can be used to override settings in the project file:

       -i num
           Remap only image with number num (can be specified multiple times)

       -m str
           Set output file format (TIFF, TIFF_m, TIFF_multilayer, EXR, EXR_m, JPEG, JPEG_m, PNG, PNG_m)

       -r ldr/hdr
           Set output mode:

           ldr - keep original bit depth and response
           hdr - merge to hdr
       -e exposure
           Set exposure for ldr mode

       -p TYPE
           Pixel type of the output. Can be one of:

           UINT8   8 bit unsigned integer
           UINT16  16 bit unsigned integer
           INT16   16 bit signed integer
           UINT32  32 bit unsigned integer
           INT32   32 bit signed integer
           FLOAT   32 bit floating point
       -z|--compression
           Set compression type. Possible options for tiff output:

           NONE      no compression
           PACKBITS  packbits compression
           LZW       LZW compression
           DEFLATE   deflate compression
               For JPEG output set quality number

       --ignore-exposure
           Don't correct exposure. (This doesn't work with the -e switch)

       --save-intermediate-images
           Saves also the intermediate images (only when output is is TIFF, PNG or JPEG)

       --intermediate-suffix=SUFFIX
           Suffix for intermediate images

       --create-exposure-layers
           Create all exposure layers (this will always use TIFF)

       --clip-exposure[=lower cutoff:upper cutoff]
           Mask automatically all dark and bright pixels. Optionally you can specify the limits for the lower and upper cutoff (specify in range 0...1, relative the full range)
