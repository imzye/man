NAME
       gff2ps - Produces PostScript graphical output from GFF-files.

SYNOPSIS
       gff2ps [options] -- gff_files

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  draws  color-filled  DotPlots from files with gff-formatted data fields. The program takes as input the annotated features on a genomic sequence in GFF format, and produces a visual
       output in PostScript.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -H <option>
              Shows only help for the especified option.

       -V     Verbose mode, a full report is sent to standard error (default only sends Warnings).

       -v     Silent mode: Disable all warnings, no messages sent to standard error.

       -d     Write (or rewrite if exists) default customfile.

       -D <default_custom_filename>
              Create a new default customfile with the given filename.

       -C <custom_filename>
              Load given custom file and append to default custom file (.gff2psrc).

       -s <page_size>
              Useful to modify page size (default is a4).

       -p     Switches page orientation to Portrait (default is Landscape).

       -G <color_name>
              Sets color for FOREGROUND (default is black).

       -g <color_name>
              Sets color for BACKGROUND (default is white).

       -P <#> Sets how many pages are needed to split your output (default is one).

       -S <#> Zoom first nucleotide (default is sequence origin).

       -E <#> Zoom last nucleotide (default is sequence length).

       -B <#> Sets blocks per page (default is one).

       -N <#> Sets nucleotides per line (default is the largest sequence position from input gff-files).

       -b     Blocks from left to right and from top to bottom (default is top to bottom first).

       -L     Switch off Header (Title area).

       -T <title_string>
              Defining title (default is input gff filename).

       -t <subtitle_string>
              Defining subtitle (default is none).

       -l     Does not show page numbering.

       -O     Does not show date.

       -o     Does not show time.

       -M <#> Number of major tickmarks per line (default 10).

       -K <#> Major tickmarks scale in nucleotides, default is nucleotide length for lines divided by major tickmarks number (see option -T).

       -m <#> Number of minor tickmarks between major tickmarks (default 10).

       -k <#> Minor tickmarks scale in nucleotides default is major tickmarks size divided by minor tickmarks number (see option -t).

       -w, -f Switch off displaying forward-strand(Watson) elements.

       -c, -r Switch off displaying reverse-strand(Crick) elements.

       -i     Switch off displaying strand-independent elements.

       -0 <color_name>
              Sets color for frame "0" (default is blue).

       -1     Sets color for frame "1" (default is red).

       -2     Sets color for frame "2" (default is green).

       -3     Sets color for frame "." (default is orange).

       -n     Switch off labels for element positions.

       -a     Switch off CopyRight line on plot.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       There are three environmental variables that can be set by users to their pre ferences:

        + You can specify the path where GFF2PS can find the default files with the shell variable "GFF2PS_CFDIR". Default value is path where you are running GFF2PS.
        + You can also define the default custom filename you will like with the variable "GFF2PS_CUSTOMFILE", program default filename for custom file is ".gff2psrc".
        + GFF2PS needs to write few temporary files in a directory with permissions for current user to read and write. Default temporary directory path is set to "/tmp/" but you can assign  a  different
       temporary directory path using the variable "GFF2PS_TMP".

       Setting those vars in Bourne-shell (bash):
          export GFF2PS_CFDIR="path"
          export GFF2PS_CUSTOMFILE="file_name"
          export GFF2PS_TMP="path"

       Using a C-Shell (csh):
          setenv GFF2PS_CFDIR "path"
          setenv GFF2PS_CUSTOMFILE "file_name"
          setenv GFF2PS_TMP "path"
