NAME
       HPXcvt - Reorganise HEALPix data into a 2-D FITS image

SYNOPSIS
       HPXcvt [-C<col>] [-c<sys>] [-n|-r] [-q<quad>] [-x<n|s>]

DESCRIPTION
              [<infile> [<outfile>]]

       HPXcvt  reorganises  HEALPix  data into a 2-D FITS image with HPX coordinate system.  The input data may be stored in a FITS file as a primary image or image extension, or as a binary table extension.
       Both NESTED and RING pixel indices are supported.  The input and output files may be omitted or specified as "-" to indicate stdin and stdout respectively.

OPTIONS
       -C<col>
              Binary table column number from which to read data, default 1 (n.b. WMAP exclusion masks are in column 2).

       -c<sys>
              Specify the coordinate system to be used to label the output map if the COORDSYS keyword is absent from the input FITS header.  Recognised values are g (galactic), e (ecliptic)  or  q  (equato‐
              rial).

       -n|-r  Assume n(ested) or r(ing) organization if the ORDERING keyword is absent from the input FITS header.

       -q<quad>
              Recentre longitude at quad(mod 4) x 90 degrees, where quad(rant) is an integer.

       -x<n|s>
              Use a north-polar or south-polar layout (XPH).
