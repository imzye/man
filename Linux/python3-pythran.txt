NAME
       pythran - part of pythran: ahead of time compiler for Python

DESCRIPTION
       usage: pythran [-h] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-P] [-E] [-e] [-v] [-w] [-V] [-p pass]

              [-I include_dir] [-L ldflags] [-D macro_definition] [-U macro_definition] [--config config] [-ftime-report] input_file

       pythran: a python to C++ compiler

   positional arguments:
       input_file
              the pythran module to compile, either a .py or a .cpp file

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -o OUTPUT_FILE
              path to generated file. Honors %{ext}.

       -P     only run the high-level optimizer, do not compile

       -E     only run the translator, do not compile

       -e     similar to -E, but does not generate python glue

       -v     be more verbose

       -w     be less verbose

       -V, --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -p pass
              any pythran optimization to apply before code generation

       -I include_dir
              any include dir relevant to the underlying C++ compiler

       -L ldflags
              any search dir relevant to the linker

       -D macro_definition
              any macro definition relevant to the underlying C++ compiler

       -U macro_definition
              any macro undef relevant to the underlying C++ compiler

       --config config
              config additional params

       -ftime-report
              report time spent in each optimization/transformation

       It's a megablast!
