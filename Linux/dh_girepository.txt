NAME
       dh_girepository - compute dependencies for GObject introspection packages

SYNOPSIS
       dh_girepository [debhelper options] [-ldirectory] [-pdirectory] [-Xitem] [private [...]]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_girepository is a debhelper program to compute dependencies for packages shipping GObject introspection data.

       The dependencies are generated in the ${gir:Depends} substitution variable.

       The minimal version of the generated dependencies is calculated by looking first at the version of the packages declared in the build-dependencies of the
       building package. If a package is not declared in the build-dependencies, the minimal version of that package is calculated by looking at the version of the
       package containing the corresponding .gir file defined in the build-dependencies.

       Note that dh_girepository will not be executed automatically by dh; you need to use "dh $@ --with gir" for "dh" to include it.

OPTIONS
       -ldirectory
           Specify a directory (or a colon-separated list of directories) where to look for the .gir XML files that were used to generate the .typelib files that
           are scanned. This option is only necessary if those files are not shipped in another, architecture-dependent package.

       -pdirectory
           Specify a directory (or a colon-separated list of directories) where to look for the dependencies. This is useful when a dependency ships the .typelib in
           a private directory.

       -Xitem
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being analyzed.

       private [...] List of directories where to look for typelibs and the corresponding .gir files. Useful when the package installs its typelibs in a private
       directory, such as /usr/lib/<package>. Library dependencies are also looked there, in case your typelib depends on a library that you ship on a private
       directory.

CONFORMS TO
       GObject introspection mini policy as of 2011-03-30.
