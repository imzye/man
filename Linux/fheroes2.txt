NAME
       fheroes2 - free remake of the Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine

SYNOPSIS
       fheroes2

DESCRIPTION
       fheroes2 is a free implementation of the Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine, a classic turn-based strategy game, with significant improvements in gameplay, graphics and logic (including sup‐
       port for high-resolution graphics, improved AI, numerous fixes and UI improvements).

       To play the game, the assets from the demo version or the full version of the original Heroes of Might and Magic II game are needed.

GAME DATA PATHS
   The engine assets are searched for in the following directories:
       /usr/share/games/fheroes2
              System-wide data directory that can be accessed by all users.

       $FHEROES2_DATA
              This environment variable may contain the path to a custom assets directory.

       Game engine executable directory
              Directory containing the executable file used to run the engine.

       $HOME/.local/share/fheroes2
              Per-user data directory.  This path can be overridden by XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable.

   The structure of engine assets is as follows:
       anim/*.smk
       anim2/*.smk
       heroes2/anim/*.smk
              Video files of the original game.

       data/*.agg
              Assets of the original game (required).

       files/data/*.h2d
              Additional non-original assets from the fheroes2 project. These assets are inextricably linked to a specific version of the engine, and must be updated when the engine version changes.

       files/lang/*.mo
              Translations of the fheroes2 project into different languages.

       files/soundfonts/*.sf2
       files/soundfonts/*.sf3
              Additional SoundFont files for the MIDI synthesizer.

       files/timidity/timidity.cfg
              Configuration file for the TiMidity MIDI synthesizer.

       files/timidity/instruments/*.pat
              GUS patches (samples of musical instruments) for the TiMidity MIDI synthesizer.

       maps/*.fh2m
              Map files in the fheroes2 format.

       maps/*.h2c
       maps/*.hxc
              Campaign map files.

       maps/*.mp2
       maps/*.mx2
              Map files in the original game format.

       music/*.flac
       music/*.mp3
       music/*.ogg
              Music  tracks ripped from the original game CD. These tracks should be named as homm2_XX.ext or TrackXX.ext where XX is a track number and ext is an extension. Numeration starts from 01 for
              the homm2_ prefix and from 02 for the Track prefix.
