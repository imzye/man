DASDINFO(8)                                                         Linux Administrator's Manual                                                         DASDINFO(8)

NAME
       dasdinfo - tool to read unique id from s390 DASD device

SYNOPSIS
       dasdinfo [-a] [-l] [-u] [-x] [-e] {-i <busid> | -b <blockdev>  | -d <devnode> }

       dasdinfo [-h] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       dasdinfo  displays  specific  information about a specified DASD device.  It is normally called from a udev rule, to provide udev with a unique id string and
       additional information (type, serial) for an S390 DASD drive. Udev can use this information to create symlinks in /dev/disk/by-id and  /dev/disk/by-label  to
       the real device node.

OPTIONS
       -a|--all
              Same as -u -x -l

       -x|--extended-uid
              Print DASD uid

              This  option prints the full uid of the DASD. When z/VM provides two virtual devices that are actually located on the same real device, the first four
              tokens of the uid will be identical for both devices.  z/VM may provide an additional token that can be used to distinguish  between  different  mini‐
              disks. You need both support in the Linux kernel and z/VM to receive such an additional token.

              For  z/VM: VM support for the hypervisor injected Special Node Element Qualifier (SNEQ) (or hypervisor injected self-description data) is available by
              applying the PTFs for VM APAR VM64273 on z/VM 5.2.0 and higher.

       -u|--uid
              Print DASD uid without z/VM minidisk token

              z/VM may provide an additional token that can be used to distinguish between different minidisks (see --extended-uid option).  To  remain  compatibile
              with systems that were installed on older Linux or z/VM levels, the -u option will print the uid excluding any z/VM-provided minidisk token.

              For example, if the extended uid is IBM.75000000092461.e900.10.00000000000037400000000000000000 then the uid is IBM.75000000092461.e900.10. If the ex‐
              tended uid contains no minidisk token, e.g. in an LPAR environment, then both uids are the same.

       -l|--label
              Print DASD volume label (volser).

       -i|--busid <busid>
              Use the bus ID as input parameter, e.g. 0.0.e910.

       -b|--block <blockdev>
              Use the block device name as input parameter, e.g. dasdb.

       -d|--devnode <devnode>
              Use a device node as input parameter, e.g. /dev/dasdb.

       -e|--export
              Print all values (ID_BUS, ID_TYPE, ID_SERIAL).

       -h|--help
              Print usage text.

       -v|--version
              Print version number.

EXAMPLES
       dasdinfo -u -i 0.0.e910

       dasdinfo -u -b dasdb

       dasdinfo -u -d /dev/dasdb

       All three examples should return the same unique ID for the same DASD device, e.g. IBM.75000000092461.e900.10.

       In case this uid is not available, dasdinfo will return the volume label instead, e.g. 0XE910.
