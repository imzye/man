NAME
       pminfo - display information about performance metrics

SYNOPSIS
       pminfo  [-dfFIlLmMstTvVxz?]   [-a  archive]  [-b batchsize] [-c dmfile]
       [--container name] [-h hostname] [-K spec] [-[n|N] pmnsfile] [-O  time]
       [-Z timezone] [metricname | pmid | indom]...

DESCRIPTION
       pminfo  displays various types of information about performance metrics
       available through the facilities of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).

       The metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments.  If met‐
       ricname  is  a  non-leaf node in the PMNS, then pminfo will recursively
       descend the PMNS and report on all leaf nodes.  If no metricname  argu‐
       ment is given, the root of the PMNS is used.

       If  the metricname argument is in numeric dotted notation, it is inter‐
       preted as either a 3-dotted pmid (metric identifier - domain,  cluster,
       item numbers) or a 2-dotted indom (instance domain identifier - domain,
       serial number).  In the pmid case, a  reverse  PMID-to-name  lookup  is
       performed,  and  in  the  indom  case,  the instance domain is reported
       directly.  This latter mode can be used to report the  instance  domain
       ``one line'' and long form help text summaries.

       Unless  directed  to  another  host by the -h option, by default pminfo
       will contact the Performance Metrics Collector  Daemon  (PMCD)  on  the
       local  host.   The  connection  to  a  PMCD  is only required if pminfo
       requires distributed PMNS information, and/or meta-data describing met‐
       rics, and/or metric values, and/or help text.

       The -a option causes pminfo to use the specified set of archives rather
       than connecting to a PMCD.

       The -L option causes pminfo to use a local context to  collect  metrics
       from  PMDAs  on  the  local  host  without PMCD.  Only some metrics are
       available in this mode.

       The -a, -h and -L options are mutually exclusive.

OPTIONS
       The available command line options are:

       -a archive, --archive=archive
            Performance metric values are retrieved from the  set  of  Perfor‐
            mance  Co-Pilot  (PCP) archive log files identified by the archive
            argument, which is a comma-separated list of names, each of  which
            may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory con‐
            taining one or more archives.

       -b, --batch
            This option may be used to define the maximum number of metrics to
            be  fetched  in  a  single request for the -f and -v options.  The
            default value for batchsize is 128.

       -c dmfile, --derived=dmfile
            The dmfile argument specifies a file that contains derived  metric
            definitions  in  the  format described for pmLoadDerivedConfig(3).
            The -c option provides a way to load  derived  metric  definitions
            that   is   an   alternative  to  the  more  generic  use  of  the
            PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment variable  as  described  in  PCPIn‐
            tro(1).   Using  the -c option and the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environ‐
            ment variable to specify the same configuration is a bad idea,  so
            choose one or the other method.

       --container=container
            Specify an individual container to be queried.

       -d, --desc
            Metric descriptions detailing the PMID, data type, data semantics,
            units, scale and associated instance domain.

       -f, --fetch
            Fetch and print values for all instances.  When  fetching  from  a
            set of archives, only those instances present in the first archive
            record for a metric will be displayed; see  also  the  -O  option,
            else use pmdumplog(1) which may be a better tool for examining ar‐
            chives.

       -F, --fetchall
            Same as -f but try harder to fetch  instances  for  metrics  which
            have non-enumerable instance domains (e.g. metrics in the ``proc''
            subtree of the default PMNS on some platforms).

       -h host, --host=host
            Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather  than  from
            the default localhost.

       -I, --fullindom
            Print the InDom in verbose mode.

       -K spec, --spec-local=spec
            When  using  the -L/ option to fetch metrics from a local context,
            this option controls the DSO PMDAs that should be made accessible.
            The  spec  argument  conforms to the syntax described in pmSpecLo‐
            calPMDA(3).  More than one -K option may be used.

       -l, --labels
            Print label sets associated with metrics  and  instances.   Labels
            are  optional  metric  metadata described in detail in pmLookupLa‐
            bels(3).

       -L, --local-PMDA
            Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the local
            host without PMCD.  See also -K.

       -m, --pmid
            Print the PMID in terse mode.

       -M, --fullpmid
            Print the PMID in verbose mode.

       -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
            Normally  pminfo  operates  on the distributed Performance Metrics
            Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is specified an alter‐
            native local PMNS is loaded from the file pmnsfile.

       -N pmnsfile, --uniqnames=pmnsfile
            The  -N  option  supports  the same function as -n, except for the
            handling of duplicate names for the same Performance Metric  Iden‐
            tifier  (PMID)  in  pmnsfile - duplicate names are allowed with -n
            but they are not allowed with -N.

       -O time, --origin=time
            When used in conjunction with an archive source of metrics and the
            options  -f/, the time argument defines a time origin at which the
            metrics should be fetched from the  set  of  archives.   Refer  to
            PCPIntro(1)  for  a  complete  description of this option, and the
            syntax for the time argument.

       -s, --series
            Print time series identifiers associated with  metrics,  instances
            and sources.  These unique identifiers are calculated from intrin‐
            sic (non-optional) labels and  other  metric  metadata  associated
            with  each  PMAPI  context  (sources), metrics and instances.  Ar‐
            chive, local context or pmcd(1) connections for the same host  all
            produce  the  same  source identifier.  See also pmLookupLabels(3)
            and the -l option.

       -t, --oneline
            Print the ``one line'' help summary, if available.

       -T, --helptext
            Print the help text, if available.

       -v, --verify
            Verify mode in which descriptions and values  are  retrieved,  but
            only error conditions are reported.  This option silently disables
            any   output   from   the   options    -f/--fetch,    -l/--labels,
            -I/--fullindom,   -M/--fullpmid,   -m/--pmid,   -t/--oneline   and
            -T/--helptext.

       -V, --version
            Display version number and exit.

       -x, --events
            Like the -f/--fetch option, but with the additional  functionality
            that  if  a  value  is  processed that is of type PM_TYPE_EVENT or
            PM_TYPE_HIGHRES_EVENT, then the event records will be unpacked and
            the details of each event record reported.

       -z, --hostzone
            Change  the  reporting  timezone to the local timezone at the host
            that is the source of the performance metrics, as  identified  via
            either the -h or -a options.

       -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
            By  default, pminfo reports the time of day according to the local
            timezone on the system where pminfo is run.  The -Z option changes
            the timezone to timezone in the format of the environment variable
            TZ as described in environ(7).

       -?, --help
            Display usage message and exit.

FILES
       $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/*
            default local PMNS specification files

PCP ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the
       file  and  directory names used by PCP.  On each installation, the file
       /etc/pcp.conf contains the  local  values  for  these  variables.   The
       $PCP_CONF  variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
       file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see pmGetOptions(3).
