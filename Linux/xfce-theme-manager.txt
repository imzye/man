       from your system.
       To install a theme/gtk/icon/cursor/border/wallpaper just drag and drop the archive (wallpapers should not be archived) anywhere on the main window and if posible the theme etc will be  installed  into
       the  correct  place, all installations are local, supported archive types are: "*.tgz","*.gz","*.zip","*.ta r","*.bz2", supported wallpaper types are: "*.jpg","*.png","*.bmp","*.gif" anything else you
       will have to install yourself.

       You must have unzip installed to drag 'n' drop .zip files.

       The thumbnails are stored in ${HOME}/.config/XfceThemeManager.

       The DB is updated automatically on drag'n'drop, if you do a lot of adding and removing of themes/icons etc you may want to run Re-build DB from the advanced tab.

       Meta Themes are themes that contain a gtk2 folder and an xfwm4 folder (ie window frames and controls), if there is a gnome-like "theme.index" file that also specifies an icon set this will be used  as
       well.
