NAME
       mech, qop — GSS-API Mechanism and QOP files

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/gss/mech /etc/gss/qop

DESCRIPTION
       The  /etc/gss/mech file contains a list of installed GSS-API security mechanisms.  Each line of the file either contains a comment if the first character is '#' or it contains five fields with the
       following meanings:

       Name    The name of this GSS-API mechanism.

       Object identifier
               The OID for this mechanism.

       Library
               A shared library containing the implementation of this mechanism.

       Kernel module (optional)
               A kernel module containing the implementation of this mechanism (not yet supported in FreeBSD).

       Library options (optional)
               Optionsal parameters interpreted by the mechanism. Library options must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]) to differentiate them from the optional kernel module entry.

       The /etc/gss/qop file contains a list of Quality of Protection values for use with GSS-API.  Each line of the file either contains a comment if the first character is  '#'  or  it  contains  three
       fields with the following meanings:

       QOP string
               The name of this Quality of Protection algorithm.

       QOP value
               The numeric value used to select this algorithm for use with GSS-API functions such as gss_get_mic(3).

       Mechanism name
               The GSS-API mechanism name that corresponds to this algorithm.

EXAMPLES
       This is a typical entry from /etc/gss/mech:

       kerberosv5      1.2.840.113554.1.2.2    /usr/lib/libgssapi_krb5.so.8    -

       This is a typical entry from /etc/gss/qop:

       GSS_KRB5_CONF_C_QOP_DES         0x0100  kerberosv5

       The mech manual page example first appeared in FreeBSD 7.0.
