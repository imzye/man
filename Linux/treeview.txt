NAME
       treeview — Presentation of Eisen-clustering

SYNOPSIS
       treeview

DESCRIPTION
       TreeView is the Java-based Linux variant of the well-known Windows program of Michael Eisen for the display of clusterings of DNA microarray expression data.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU       Info format; see below.
