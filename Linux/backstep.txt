NAME
       backstep - Backstep is a program that draws icons for minimized windows on your desktop.

SYNOPSIS
       backstep [options]...

DESCRIPTION
       Backstep is a program that draws icons for minimized windows on your desktop. It doesn't depend on the window manager or on a desktop-drawing program (for example, I use it with Nautilus). It
       is  meant  to  work with window managers that are EWHM compliant. However, I only know for sure that it works with Metacity and Xfwm4. And I know that it doesn't work with Fluxbox and that it
       only partially works with Kwin (hopefully this will be corrected soon). I haven't yet tested it with other window managers.

       Drawing icons for minimized windows on the desktop might be considered a step backwards by many people (hence the name), but I find it useful to identify minimized windows by position  rather
       than by name.

FEATURES
       1)  Simple to use. You do not have to configure anything - just run 'backstep'.

       2)  Session management support - at least to the extent that backstep adds itself to the session so that it will be started automatically the next time you log in to your desktop environment.

       3)   Grouping. Windows can be grouped together (by right clicking on their icons and selecting a group) so that when one window from the group is shown or hidden, all windows in the group are
       shown or hidden.

       4)  Configurable. You can make some adjustments to the way the icons look. This is done through a simple configuration dialog launched by right-clicking on an icon.
