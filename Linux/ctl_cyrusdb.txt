CTL_CYRUSDB(8)                    Cyrus IMAP                    CTL_CYRUSDB(8)

NAME
       ctl_cyrusdb - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Perform administrative operations directly on Cyrus IMAP databases.

SYNOPSIS
       ctl_cyrusdb [ -C config-file ] -c
       ctl_cyrusdb [ -C config-file ] -r [ -x ]

DESCRIPTION
       ctl_cyrusdb is used to perform various administrative operations on the
       Cyrus IMAP databases.

       ctl_cyrusdb reads its configuration options out  of  the  imapd.conf(5)
       file  unless  specified otherwise by -C.  The configdirectory option in
       imapd.conf(5) is used to determine the default location  of  the  Cyrus
       databases.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -r     Recover the database after an  application  or  system  failure.
              Also  performs  database cleanups like removing mailbox reserva‐
              tions (and the associated mailbox files).

              All mailbox files are also checked to make sure the file  format
              matches the configured database type in imapd.conf.  If not, the
              file  is  automatically  converted  using  the  same  logic   as
              cvt_cyrusdb.

              If  the  reverseacls option in imapd.conf(5) is enabled, and the
              RACL entries do not exist in the database, they will  be  gener‐
              ated.  Conversely, if RACL entries do exist in the database, but
              the reverseacls option is disabled, then  the  entries  will  be
              cleaned up.

       -x     Used  with  -r  to  only  recover  the database, and prevent any
              cleanup.

       -c     Checkpoint and archive (a copy of) the database.

              Changes to the database which are part of the committed transac‐
              tions are written to disk.

              The  archive is created via a hot backup, and inactive log files
              are removed.

EXAMPLES
       ctl_cyrusdb -r
          Recover databases, performing cleanup.  This is commonly used in the
          START section of cyrus.conf(5).

       ctl_cyrusdb -x -r
          Recover database only.

       ctl_cyrusdb -c
          Checkpoint  databases.   Commonly  used  in  the  EVENTS  section of
          cyrus.conf(5).
