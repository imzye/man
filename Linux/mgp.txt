NAME
       mgpnet — MagicPoint Netserver (provide MagicPoint presentation over the net)

SYNOPSIS
       mgpnet [arguments to mgp]

DESCRIPTION
       mgpnet is a small http server to be executed on the presenter's notebook computer.  It lets audience read MagicPoint presentation foils on her notebook computers, over the net.

       When a presenter performs a presentation, she should invoke mgpnet instead of mgp, with the same argument.  mgpnet will become an http server running on tcp port 9999 (by default), and invokes mgp
       as a child process.  By accessing URL http://hostname:9999/, audience will be able to read the MagicPoint window currently displayed on the presenter's notebook.  The webpage provided by mgpnet is
       designed in "client pull" manner; audience's notebook will reload the page, several times a minute.

       If no option is specified, mgpnet will print the URL to be accessed by the audience to the standard output.  This is useful for indicating the URL to be accessed on the presentation, like:

       %filter "mgpnet"
       %endfilter

TODO
       Be network conscious.  Current implementation is too naive about CPU/network usage.  Presenter's notebook may be overloaded if there's too many audiences.
