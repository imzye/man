NAME
       mhgui - A GUI to access the myharmony.com web service

SYNOPSIS
       mhgui [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       mhgui  is  intended  to access the web service behind the myharmony.com
       web site, to enable programming of  Logitech  Harmony  remote  controls
       that  are only supported through this web site (which normally requires
       the use of Microsoft Silverlight).

OPTIONS
       --use-local-wsdl
           Normally, mhgui will download  its  WSDL  files  from  Sourceforge.
           This  option  will  force  mhgui  to  use WSDL files from the local
           filesystem.  This could be used for  example,  if  Sourceforge  was
           down for some reason.

       --suds-debug
           This  option  will  cause mhgui to log debug information related to
           its communications with the web service.  This is mainly useful for
           troubleshooting  problems,  and  these logs may be requested by the
           developers.

REPORTING BUGS
       Report bugs to <concordance-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.

       mhgui utilizes libconcord.   Until  mhgui  grows  its  own  sourceforge
       project, it piggy-backs off the concordance/libconcord mailing list.
