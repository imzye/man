fedora-third-party(1)       General Commands Manual      fedora-third-party(1)

NAME
       fedora-third-party - manage third-party software repositories

SYNOPOSIS
       fedora-third-party [--verbose | -v] COMMAND [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       The  fedora-third-party  tool  is  used  to manage third-party software
       repositories that are distributed with editions of  Fedora  Linux,  but
       not enabled unless the user opts-in.

COMMON OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --verbose, v

       Print detailed information about what is being done.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

   enable [--config-only]
       Enables  third-party  repositories. Configured DNF repositories are en‐
       abled, and configured Flatpak remotes are created unless  they  already
       exist.

       If  --config-only is specified, existing repositories are not modified,
       but the configuration is updated so that newly added repositories  will
       be enabled when fedora-third-party refresh is called.

   disable [--config-only]
       Disables third-party repositories. Configured DNF repositories are dis‐
       abled.  Configured Flatpak remotes are removed, unless:

              • the remote previously existed and was not created  by  fedora-
                third-party.

              • there  are  Flatpak applications or runtimes already installed
                from the remote

              • the remote has been  modified  to  remove  a  filter  and  the
                keep_unfiltered flag is configured for the remote.

       The  last  exception exists because, if a Fedora third-party repository
       has a filter (see flatpak-remote-add(1)), this filter will  be  removed
       if the user installs a .flatpakrepo file for the same remote name with‐
       out a filter.  At this point, the remote is  different  from  what  was
       distributed with the Fedora edition and should be left untouched.

       If  --config-only is specified, existing repositories are not modified,
       but the configuration is updated so that newly added repositories  will
       not be enabled when fedora-third-party refresh is called.

   query [--quiet | -q]
       Prints  a  human-readable  string  describing  the  whether third-party
       repositories hae been enabled.

       When --quiet is specified, no output is  printed,  and  the  status  is
       given  by  the exit code (0 for enabled, 1 for disabled, 2 for disabled
       if no selection has yet been made).

   refresh
       Look for newly added third-party repository definitions, and if  third-
       party  repositories  are  enabled,  enable  DNF repositories and create
       Flatpak remotes.

   list [-a | --all | --csv | --columns=col1,col2]
       Prints the list of currently configured repositories. By  default,  the
       list will be pretty-printed in tabular form with headers. The --csv op‐
       tion can be used to switch the output to  comma-separated-value  format
       without headers.

       The  columns to be printed can be specified with the --columns options.
       Currently supported values are name for  the  name  of  the  repository
       (which is the same as the DNF repository name or Flatpak remote name)),
       and type for the type of the repository (either dnf or flatpak).

       --columns should always be specified together with --csv to get  stable
       output  -  the default set of columns may change. With the current col‐
       umns, you can assume that the values will not be quoted.

       Flatpak repositories with the keep_unfiltered option set are hidden  by
       default  from  the list if there is a matching remote without a filter.
       a or --all can be passed to show all repositories.

CONFIGURATION
       Repositories  are  configured  by   files   in   /usr/lib/fedora-third-
       party/conf.d.   All files in this directory ending with .conf are read.
       Each section found defines a repository that should  be  controlled  by
       fedora-third-party.

       Example of configuration for a DNF repository:

              [somerepo]
              # The DNF repository must match and also be 'somerepo'
              type=dnf

       Example of configuration for a Flatpak remote:

              [somerepo]
              # The Flatpak remote must match and also be 'somerepo'
              type=flatpak

              # Path to a flatpakrepo file defining the remote. If it's a relative
              # path, it will be interpreted relative to the directory where the
              # config file is.
              flatpakrepo=somerepo.flatpakrepo
              # If present, 'fedora-third-party disable' will leave this repository
              # untouched if it has been modified to not have a filter, and it will
              # also be hidden from the output of 'fedora-third-party list'
              keep_unfiltered=yes

FILES
       /usr/lib/fedora-third-party/conf.d - repository configuration files

       /var/lib/fedora-third-party/state  -  current  state  is stored in this
       file.
