LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix(3pm)                                                User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix(3pm)

NAME
       LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix - Speak HTTP through UNIX sockets

SYNOPSIS
         use LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix;
         LWP::Protocol::implementor( http => 'LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix' );
         ...

DESCRIPTION
       LWP::Protocol::http::UnixSocket enables you to speak HTTP through UNIX sockets.  To use it you need to overwrite the implementor class of the LWP 'http' scheme.  All 'http' URIs will now be
       interpreted as local sockets by LWP.

       The interface of LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix is similar to LWP::Protocol::http, which LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnix inherits from.
