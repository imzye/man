NAME
       hmmscan - search protein sequence(s) against a protein profile database

SYNOPSIS
       hmmscan [options] <hmmdb> <seqfile>

DESCRIPTION
       hmmscan  is  used to search protein sequences against collections of protein profiles. For each sequence in <seqfile>, use that query sequence to search the target database of profiles in <hmmdb>, and
       output ranked lists of the profiles with the most significant matches to the sequence.

       The <seqfile> may contain more than one query sequence. It can be in FASTA format, or several other common sequence file formats (genbank, embl, and uniprot, among others), or in alignment  file  for‐
       mats (stockholm, aligned fasta, and others). See the --qformat option for a complete list.

       The <hmmdb> needs to be press'ed using hmmpress before it can be searched with hmmscan.  This creates four binary files, suffixed .h3{fimp}.

       The  query <seqfile> may be '-' (a dash character), in which case the query sequences are read from a <stdin> pipe instead of from a file.  The <hmmdb> cannot be read from a <stdin> stream, because it
       needs to have those four auxiliary binary files generated by hmmpress.

       The output format is designed to be human-readable, but is often so voluminous that reading it is impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The --tblout and --domtblout options save output in simple tab‐
       ular formats that are concise and easier to parse.  The -o option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing it away in /dev/null.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING OUTPUT
       -o <f> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <f> instead of the default stdout.

       --tblout <f>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-target output, with one data line per homologous target model found.

       --domtblout <f>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-domain output, with one data line per homologous domain detected in a query sequence for each homologous model.

       --pfamtblout <f>
              Save an especially succinct tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-target output, with one data line per homologous target model found.

       --acc  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       --noali
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       --notextw
              Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120 characters per line, which helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but can truncate
              target profile description lines.

       --textw <n>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <n> characters per line. The default is 120.

OPTIONS FOR REPORTING THRESHOLDS
       Reporting thresholds control which hits are reported in output files (the main output, --tblout, and --domtblout).

       -E <x> In the per-target output, report target profiles with an E-value of <= <x>.  The default is 10.0, meaning that on average, about 10 false positives will be reported per query, so  you  can  see
              the top of the noise and decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       -T <x> Instead of thresholding per-profile output on E-value, instead report target profiles with a bit score of >= <x>.

       --domE <x>
              In  the  per-domain  output, for target profiles that have already satisfied the per-profile reporting threshold, report individual domains with a conditional E-value of <= <x>.  The default is
              10.0.  A conditional E-value means the expected number of additional false positive domains in the smaller search space of those comparisons that already  satisfied  the  per-profile  reporting
              threshold (and thus must have at least one homologous domain already).

       --domT <x>
              Instead of thresholding per-domain output on E-value, instead report domains with a bit score of >= <x>.

OPTIONS FOR INCLUSION THRESHOLDS
       Inclusion  thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.  Inclusion thresholds control which hits are considered to be reliable enough to be included in an output alignment or a subsequent search
       round.  In hmmscan, which does not have any alignment output (like hmmsearch or phmmer) nor any iterative search steps (like jackhmmer), inclusion thresholds have little effect. They only affect  what
       domains get marked as significant (!) or questionable (?) in domain output.

       --incE <x>
              Use  an  E-value  of  <=  <x> as the per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01, meaning that on average, about 1 false positive would be expected in every 100 searches with different
              query sequences.

       --incT <x>
              Instead of using E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, instead use a bit score of >= <x> as the per-target inclusion threshold.  It would be unusual to use  bit  score  thresholds  with
              hmmscan, because you don't expect a single score threshold to work for different profiles; different profiles have slightly different expected score distributions.

       --incdomE <x>
              Use a conditional E-value of <= <x> as the per-domain inclusion threshold, in targets that have already satisfied the overall per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01.

       --incdomT <x>
              Instead of using E-values, instead use a bit score of >= <x> as the per-domain inclusion threshold.  As with --incT above, it would be unusual to use a single bit score threshold in hmmscan.

OPTIONS FOR MODEL-SPECIFIC SCORE THRESHOLDING
       Curated profile databases may define specific bit score thresholds for each profile, superseding any thresholding based on statistical significance alone.

       To  use  these  options,  the  profile  must  contain the appropriate (GA, TC, and/or NC) optional score threshold annotation; this is picked up by hmmbuild from Stockholm format alignment files. Each
       thresholding option has two scores: the per-sequence threshold <x1> and the per-domain threshold <x2> These act as if -T<x1> --incT<x1> --domT<x2> --incdomT<x2> has  been  applied  specifically  using
       each model's curated thresholds.

       --cut_ga
              Use  the  GA (gathering) bit scores in the model to set per-sequence (GA1) and per-domain (GA2) reporting and inclusion thresholds. GA thresholds are generally considered to be the reliable cu‐
              rated thresholds defining family membership; for example, in Pfam, these thresholds define what gets included in Pfam Full alignments based on searches with Pfam Seed models.

       --cut_nc
              Use the NC (noise cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set per-sequence (NC1) and per-domain (NC2) reporting and inclusion thresholds. NC thresholds are generally considered to  be  the
              score of the highest-scoring known false positive.

       --cut_tc
              Use the NC (trusted cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set per-sequence (TC1) and per-domain (TC2) reporting and inclusion thresholds. TC thresholds are generally considered to be the
              score of the lowest-scoring known true positive that is above all known false positives.

CONTROL OF THE ACCELERATION PIPELINE
       HMMER3 searches are accelerated in a three-step filter pipeline: the MSV filter, the Viterbi filter, and the Forward filter. The first filter is the fastest and most approximate; the last is the  full
       Forward scoring algorithm. There is also a bias filter step between MSV and Viterbi. Targets that pass all the steps in the acceleration pipeline are then subjected to postprocessing -- domain identi‐
       fication and scoring using the Forward/Backward algorithm.

       Changing filter thresholds only removes or includes targets from consideration; changing filter thresholds does not alter bit scores, E-values, or alignments, all of which  are  determined  solely  in
       postprocessing.

       --max  Turn off all filters, including the bias filter, and run full Forward/Backward postprocessing on every target. This increases sensitivity somewhat, at a large cost in speed.

       --F1 <x>
              Set the P-value threshold for the MSV filter step.  The default is 0.02, meaning that roughly 2% of the highest scoring nonhomologous targets are expected to pass the filter.

       --F2 <x>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Viterbi filter step.  The default is 0.001.

       --F3 <x>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Forward filter step.  The default is 1e-5.

       --nobias
              Turn  off  the  bias filter. This increases sensitivity somewhat, but can come at a high cost in speed, especially if the query has biased residue composition (such as a repetitive sequence re‐
              gion, or if it is a membrane protein with large regions of hydrophobicity). Without the bias filter, too many sequences may pass the filter with biased queries, leading to slower than  expected
              performance as the computationally intensive Forward/Backward algorithms shoulder an abnormally heavy load.

OTHER OPTIONS
       --nonull2
              Turn off the null2 score corrections for biased composition.

       -Z <x> Assert that the total number of targets in your searches is <x>, for the purposes of per-sequence E-value calculations, rather than the actual number of targets seen.

       --domZ <x>
              Assert  that  the  total  number of targets in your searches is <x>, for the purposes of per-domain conditional E-value calculations, rather than the number of targets that passed the reporting
              thresholds.

       --seed <n>
              Set the random number seed to <n>.  Some steps in postprocessing require Monte Carlo simulation.  The default is to use a fixed seed (42), so that results are exactly  reproducible.  Any  other
              positive integer will give different (but also reproducible) results. A choice of 0 uses an arbitrarily chosen seed.

       --qformat <s>
              Assert that the query sequence file is in format <s>.  Accepted formats include fasta, embl, genbank, ddbj, uniprot, stockholm, pfam, a2m, and afa.

       --cpu <n>
              Set  the  number  of parallel worker threads to <n>.  By default, HMMER sets this to the number of CPU cores it detects in your machine - that is, it tries to maximize the use of your available
              processor cores. Setting <n> higher than the number of available cores is of little if any value, but you may want to set it to something less. You can also control this number  by  setting  an
              environment variable, HMMER_NCPU.

              This option is only available if HMMER was compiled with POSIX threads support. This is the default, but it may have been turned off for your site or machine for some reason.

       --stall
              For  debugging  the  MPI  master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to attach debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the
              pause.  (Under gdb: (gdb) signal SIGCONT)

              (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.)

       --mpi  Run in MPI master/worker mode, using mpirun.

              (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.)
