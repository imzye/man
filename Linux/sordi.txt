NAME
       sordi — load and rewrite RDF data

SYNOPSIS
       sordi [-hv] [-i syntax] [-o syntax] [-s string] input [base_uri]

DESCRIPTION
       sordi is a command-line utility for loading RDF data into a model, and writing it out again.

       sordi is mainly useful for things like removing duplicate statements, merging data files, or aggressive pretty-printing with statement reordering.

       The options are as follows:

       -h, --help
            Print the command line options.

       -i syntax
            Read input as syntax.  Case is ignored, valid values are: “NQuads”, “NTriples”, “TriG”, “Turtle”.

       -o syntax
            Write output as syntax.  Case is ignored, valid values are: “NQuads”, “NTriples”, “TriG”, “Turtle”.

       -s string
            Parse string input instead of a file (terminates options).

       -v   Display version information and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       sordi exits with a status of 0, or non-zero if an error occurred.
