NAME
       condor_power - HTCondor Manual

       send packet intended to wake a machine from a low power state

SYNOPSIS
       condor_power [-h ]

       condor_power [-d ] [-i ] [-m MACaddress] [-s subnet] [ClassAdFile ]

DESCRIPTION
       condor_power  sends  one  UDP  Wake on LAN (WOL) packet to a machine specified either by command line arguments or by the contents of a machine ClassAd. The machine ClassAd may be in a file, where the
       file name specified by the optional argument ClassAdFile is given on the command line. With no command line arguments to specify the machine, and no file specified, condor_power quietly presumes  that
       standard input is the file source which will specify the machine ClassAd that includes the public IP address and subnet of the machine.

       condor_power needs a complete specification of the machine to be successful. If a MAC address is provided on the command line, but no subnet is given, then the default value for the subnet is used. If
       a subnet is provided on the command line, but no MAC address is given, then condor_power falls back to taking its information in the form of the machine ClassAd as provided in a file  or  on  standard
       input. Note that this case implies that the command line specification of the subnet is ignored.

       condor_power  relies  on  the router receiving the WOL packet to correctly broadcast the request. Since routers are often configured to ignore requests to broadcast messages on a different subnet than
       the sender, the send of a WOL packet to a machine on a different subnet may fail.

OPTIONS
          -h     Print usage information and exit.

          -d     Enable debugging messages.

          -i     Read a ClassAd that is piped in through standard input.

          -m MACaddress
                 Specify the MAC address in the standard format of six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons.

          -s subnet
                 Specify the subnet in the standard form of a mask for an IPv4 address. Without this option, a global broadcast will be sent.

EXIT STATUS
       condor_power will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
