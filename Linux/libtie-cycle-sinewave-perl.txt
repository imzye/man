NAME
       Tie::Cycle::Sinewave - Cycle through a series of values on a sinewave

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.05 of Tie::Cycle::Sinewave, released 2007-11-07.

SYNOPSIS
       This module allows you to make a scalar iterate through the values on a sinewave. You set the maximum and minimum values and the number of steps and you're set.

           use strict;
           use Tie::Cycle::Sinewave;

           tie my $cycle, 'Tie::Cycle::Sinewave', {
               min    => 10,
               max    => 50,
               period => 12,
           };
           printf("%0.2f\n", $cycle) for 1..10;

PARAMETERS
       A number of parameters can be passed in to the creation of the tied object. They are as follows (in order of likely usefulness):

       min Sets the minimum value. If not specified, 0 will be used as a default minimum.

       max Sets the maximum value. Should be higher than min, but the values will be swapped if necessary. If not specified, 100 will be used as a default maximum.

       period
           Sets  the period of the curve. The cycle will go through this many values from min to max. If not specified, 20 will be used as a default. If period is set to 0, it will be silently changed to
           1, to prevent internal calculations from attempting to divide by 0.

       start_max
           Optional. When set to 1 (or anything), the cyle will start at the maximum value. ("startmax" exists as a an alias).

       start_min
           Optional. When set to 1 (or anything), the cyle will start at the minimum value. ("startmin" exists as a an alias). If neither "start_max" nor "start_min" are specified, it will at the  origin
           (thus, mid-way between min and max and will move to max).

       at_max
           Optional.  When set to a coderef, will be executed when the cycle reaches the maximum value. This allows the modification of the cycle, e.g. modifying the minimum value or the period. (The key
           "atmax" exists as an alias).

       at_min
           Optional. When set to a coderef, will be executed when the cycle reaches the minimum value. This allows the modification of the cycle, e.g. modifying the maximum value or the period. (The  key
           "atmin" exists as an alias).

OBJECT METHODS
       You can call methods on the underlying object (which you access with the "tied()" function). Have a look at the file "eg/callback" for an example on what you might want to do with these.

       min When called without a parameter, returns the current minimum value. When called with a (numeric) parameter, sets the new current minimum value.  The previous value is returned.

             my $min = (tied $cycle)->min();
             (tied $cycle)->min($min - 20);

       max When called without a parameter, returns the current maximum value. When called with a (numeric) parameter, sets the new current maximum value.  The previous value is returned.

             my $max = (tied $cycle)->max();
             (tied $cycle)->max($max * 10);

           When "min" or "max" are modified, a consistency check is run to ensure that "min <= max". If this check fails, the two values are quietly swapped around.

       period
           When called without a parameter, returns the current period. When called with a (numeric) parameter, sets the new current period.  The previous value is returned.

       angle
           Returns the current angle of the sine, which is guaranteed to be in the range " 0 <= angle <= 2*PI".
