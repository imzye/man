NAME
       MkOneOf - a helper program to use with DtdToHaskell

SYNOPSIS
       MkOneOf n [m]

DESCRIPTION
       DtdToHaskell  translates  XML  DTD  into  equivalent  Haskell  types.   When  there  is  a  choice  between  different  tags,  DtdToHaskell uses types like OneOf2, OneOf3, OneOf4, etc.  The module
       Text.XML.HaXml.OneOfN currently defines these types up OneOf20.  If your DTD requires larger choices, you can use this program to generate them.

       MkOneOf takes an integer N or an integer range N M and writes to the standard output a Haskell module with respectively the datatype OneOfN or the datatypes OneOfN up to and including OneOfM.

EXAMPLES
       If we run "MkOneOf 1 2", the program will print
       module Text.XML.HaXml.OneOfN where

       import Text.XML.HaXml.Xml2Haskell

       data OneOf1 a
           = OneOf1 a
           deriving (Eq,Show)

       instance (XmlContent a)
           => XmlContent (OneOf1 a)
         where
           fromElem cs =
               (choice OneOf1
               $ (    toElem (OneOf1 x) = toElem x

       ----
       data OneOf2 a b
           = OneOf2 a | TwoOf2 b
           deriving (Eq,Show)

       instance (XmlContent a,XmlContent b)
           => XmlContent (OneOf2 a b)
         where
           fromElem cs =
               (choice OneOf2 $ choice TwoOf2
               $ (    toElem (OneOf2 x) = toElem x
           toElem (TwoOf2 x) = toElem x
