NAME
       Bglafile - a Module Access File Generator

SYNOPSIS
       bglafile [ options ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Bglafile is a Module Access File generator. It produces file that suits
       Bigloo option -afile. A Module Access File is a scheme list. Each  ele‐
       ments  of  that list is a list of at least two elements: a module name,
       the file that implements that module. For BEE  (the  Bigloo  Integrated
       Development  Environment)  to  be  able  to  retrieve files from module
       names, it is mandatory that the first parentheses of the global list is
       left alone on one line.

OPTIONS
       file          Is  an  file  implementing a module.  Bglafile reads that
                     file to discover the name of the implemented module.

       -v            Verbose mode

       -o <file>     Print Module Access File into file.  The  default  is  to
                     print the list on the standard output device.

       -suffix <suf> Adds  suf  to the bglafile source file suffixes list. De‐
                     fault suffixes are "scm", "sch" and "bgl".

EXAMPLE
       If the three files exists and contain legal Bigloo module clause, then:

          $ bglafile foo.scm bar.scm gee.scm

       could print out a list like:

       ;; foo
       ;; Tue Aug  15 12:17:24 1998

       (
         (foo "foo.scm")
         (bar "bar.scm")
         (gee "gee.scm")
       )
