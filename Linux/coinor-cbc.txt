NAME
       cbc - Cbc mixed integer programming solver

SYNOPSIS
       cbc [ options ] filename
       cbc [ commands ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cbc command.

       cbc -- Cbc (Coin-or branch and cut) is an open-source mixed integer programming solver written in C++.

OPTIONS
       When  no  options  are given cbc enters the interactive command line mode.  Otherwise the program enters a batch mode, for which a summary of options is included below.  Note that the order of op‐
       tions in the command line of the cbc executable matter The command line of the cbc executable is parsed as if it were in the interactive mode. The take-away is that if your using the command line,
       and things aren't working as you think they should, try ordering the commands in the sequence you'd use if you were interactive mode.

       For a complete description, see /usr/share/doc/coinor-libcbc-doc.

       -      Read input from stdin instead of filename

       -csv   The option "-csv <filename>" causes cbc to print one line of key output statics in comma separated format in a file named <filename>. This option isn't currently included  in  the  list  of
              commands given by the "?" command in interactive mode.

       -threads <num_threads>
              Run cbc in parallel using <num_threads> many CPUs

INTERACTIVE MODE
       In interactive mode one command per line is expected (no leading -).

       ?      lists all available commands

       <command>?
              gives list of possibilities, if only one + explanation

       <command>??
              adds explanation, if only one fuller help

       <command>
              without value (where expected) gives current value

       <command> <value>
               sets value
