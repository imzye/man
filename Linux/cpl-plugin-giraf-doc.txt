NAME
       giframestack - Creates a stacked image from a set of raw images.

SYNOPSIS
       esorex giframestack [OPTIONS] FILE.sof

DESCRIPTION
       TBD

OPTIONS
       --stack-method <str>
              Stacking method: average, median, minmax or ksigma (str; default: ´average´). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is giraffe.stacking.method [default = aver‐
              age].

       --stack-ksigmalow <float>
              Lower threshold multiplier for method ksigma (float; default: 5.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is giraffe.stacking.ksigma.low [default = 5.0].

       --stack-ksigmahigh <float>
              Upper threshold multiplier for method ksigma (float; default: 5.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is giraffe.stacking.ksigma.high [default = 5.0].

       --stack-minreject <int>
              Minimum rejection level for method minmax (int; default: 1). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is giraffe.stacking.minmax.minimum [default = 1].

       --stack-maxreject <int>
              Maximum rejection level for method minmax (int; default: 1). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is giraffe.stacking.minmax.maximum [default = 1].

       Note that it is possible to create a configuration file containing these options, along with suitable default values. Please refer to the details provided by the 'esorex --help' command.
