NAME
       pyocd-flashtool - ARM Cortex-M programming tool

DESCRIPTION
       pyocd-flashtool is an ARM Cortex-M programming tool

   Summary
       pyOCD is an Open Source python based library for programming and debugging ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers using CMSIS-DAP.

       Includes support for flashing new binaries, resetting the device, halt, step, resume read/write memory and set/remove breakpoints.

   Support
       Firmware  files  included  in  the  upstream source are NOT included in the Debian package due to a lack of source code. Target files can be downloaded separately from  <https://github.com/mbedmi‐
       cro/pyOCD/tree/master/binaries>

       Available targets for use with --target option: lpc824, kinetis, w7500, kv11z7, lpc4088qsb, kv10z7, k20d50m, ncs36510, kl28z, kl25z, k82f25615, k28f15, maxwsnenv, max32600mbed,  k22fa12,  lpc4088,
       lpc4330,  ke18f16,  kl46z, stm32f103rc, kl82z7, lpc54114, kl43z4, kl26z, lpc11xx_32, lpc800, rtl8195am, kl05z, lpc1768, kw41z4, lpc4088dm, stm32f051, cortex_m, lpc11u24, kl02z, kw01z4, k64f, k22f,
       ke15z7, nrf51, nrf52, kl27z4, kw40z4, k66f18

              -b BOARD_ID, --board BOARD_ID
                     Connect to board by board id. Use -l to list all connected boards.

              -l, --list
                     List all connected boards.

              -d LEVEL, --debug LEVEL

              -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                     Override target to debug. Supported targets are: lpc824, kinetis, w7500, kv11z7, lpc4088qsb, kv10z7, k20d50m, ncs36510, kl28z,  kl25z,  k82f25615,  k28f15,  maxwsnenv,  max32600mbed,
                     k22fa12, lpc4088, lpc4330, ke18f16, kl46z, stm32f103rc, kl82z7, lpc54114, kl43z4, kl26z, lpc11xx_32, lpc800, rtl8195am, kl05z, lpc1768, kw41z4, lpc4088dm, stm32f051, lpc11u24, kl02z,

              -f FREQUENCY, --frequency FREQUENCY
                     Set the SWD clock frequency in Hz.

              -ce, --chip_erase
                     Use chip erase when programming.

              -se, --sector_erase
                     Use sector erase when programming.

              -u, --unlock
                     Unlock the device.

              -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                     Address. Used for the sector address with sector erase, and for the address where to flash a binary.

              -n COUNT, --count COUNT
                     Number of sectors to erase. Only applies to sector erase. Default is 1.

              -s SKIP, --skip SKIP
                     Skip programming the first N bytes. This can only be used with binary files

              -hp, --hide_progress
                     Don't display programming progress.

              -fp, --fast_program
                     Use only the CRC of each page to determine if it already has the same data.

              -da DAPARG [DAPARG ...], --daparg DAPARG [DAPARG ...]
                     Send setting to DAPAccess layer.

              --mass-erase
                     Mass erase the target device.

       --chip_erase  and --sector_erase can be used alone as individual commands, or they can be used in conjunction with flashing a binary or hex file. For the former, only the erase option will be per‐
       formed. With a file, the erase options specify whether to erase the entire chip before flashing the file, or just to erase only those sectors occupied by the file. For a standalone  sector  erase,
       the --address and --count options are used to specify the start address of the sector to erase and the number of sectors to erase.
