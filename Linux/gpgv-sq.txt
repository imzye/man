NAME
       gpgv-sq - gpgv-sq - Verify OpenPGP signatures like gpgv

SYNOPSIS
       gpgv-sq [-v|--verbose] [-q|--quiet] [--keyring] [-o|--output] [--ignore-time-conflict] [--status-fd] [--weak-digest] [-h|--help] [-V|--version] [SIG-FILE] [DATA-FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a re-implementation and drop-in replacement of gpgv using the Sequoia OpenPGP implementation.

       gpgv-sq is feature-complete. Please report any problems you encounter when replacing gpgv with gpgv-sq.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help (see a summary with '-h')

       -V, --version
              Print version

       [SIG-FILE]
              Signatures or inline-signed message to verify.  If not given, or `-` is given, the signature or inline-signed message is read from stdin.

       [DATA-FILE]
              If SIG-FILE is a detached signature, DATA-FILE is the data the signature is supposed to protect.  If given multiple times, the signature is assumed cover the concatenation of all files.

OPTIONS:
       -v, --verbose
              verbose

       -q, --quiet
              be somewhat more quiet

       --keyring <FILE>
              take the keys from the keyring FILE

       -o, --output <FILE>
              write output to FILE

       --ignore-time-conflict
              make timestamp conflicts only a warning

       --status-fd <FD>
              write status info to this FD

       --weak-digest <ALGO>
              reject signatures made with ALGO

ENVIRONMENT
       GNUPGHOME
              If  set,  must  contain an absolute path to a directory containing the GnuPG state, i.e. the configuration files, the cert rings, the secret keys, and the trust database.  Can be overridden
              using the the option `--gnupghome`.  If unset, and the option `--gnupghome` is not given, defaults to `$HOME/.gnupg`.  In the FILES section below, `$GNUPGHOME` is the location of the  GnuPG
              state directory, independently on how it is set (i.e. unset, set via `--gnupghome`, or set via `$GNUPGHOME).

       SEQUOIA_CRYPTO_POLICY
              If set, must contain an absolute path to a configuration file that changes which cryptographic algorithms are acceptable.  By default, /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/sequoia.config is read,
              which on Fedora contains a reasonable policy set by the distribution.  See https://docs.rs/sequoia-policy-config/latest/sequoia_policy_config/#format for a description of the file format.

FILES
       $GNUPGHOME/trustedkeys.kbx
              The default set of trusted certificates.

       $GNUPGHOME/trustedkeys.gpg
              Legacy default set of trusted certificates.  This file is read if `trustedkeys.kbx` does not exist.

       /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/sequoia.config
              Default  cryptographic  policy.   On  Fedora,  this  contains  a  reasonable  policy  set  by the distribution.  Can be overridden using the SEQUOIA_POLICY_CONFIG environment variable.  See
              https://docs.rs/sequoia-policy-config/latest/sequoia_policy_config/#format for a description of the file format.
