NAME
       dirtbike - dirtbike

DESCRIPTION
       usage: Turn OS packages into wheels [-h] [-d DIRECTORY] package

   positional arguments:
       package
              The name of the package to rewheel, as seen by Python (not your OS!).

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
              Leave the new .whl file in the given directory.  Otherwise the default is to use the current working directory. If DIRECTORY doesn't exist, it will be
              created. This overrides $DIRTBIKE_DIRECTORY

       dirtbike also recognizes the environment variable $DIRTBIKE_DIRECTORY which if set, is used as the directory to put .whl files in. This is analogous  to  the
       -d/--directory option, although the command line switch takes precedence.
