NAME
       flip, toms, toix - do newline conversions between **IX and MS-DOS

SYNOPSIS
       flip -h
       flip [ -umvtsbz] file ...
       flip [ -umvtsbz] -
       toix [ -vtsbz] file ...
       toms [ -vtsbz] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       flip  is  a  file interchange program that converts text file formats between **ix and MS-DOS.  It converts lines ending with carriage-return (CR) and linefeed (LF) to lines ending with just line‐
       feed, or vice versa.  If the special argument "-" is given, input is read from stdin and written to stdout.

       flip has the following features:

              flip will normally refuse to convert binary files.  You can override this.

              When asked to convert a file to the same format that it already has, flip causes no change to the file.  Thus to convert all files to **IX format you can type

                                  flip -u *

              and all files will end up right, regardless of whether they were in MS-DOS or in **IX format to begin with.  This also works in the opposite direction.

              If a file contains isolated CR characters for underlining or overprinting, flip does not change them.

              flip preserves file timestamps.  You can override this.

              flip preserves file permissions.

              flip is written in C and will compile and run under MS-DOS/Turbo C, 4.3BSD, and System V.

              flip accepts wildcards and multiple filenames on the command line.

              If a user interrupt aborts flip, it does not leave behind any garbage files or cause corruption of the files being converted.

              When converting from MS-DOS to **IX format, flip removes any trailing control Z (the last character in the file), but leaves embedded control Z characters  unchanged.   This  minimizes  the
              possibility of accidentally converting a binary file that contains a control Z near the beginning.  You can override this and ask flip to recognize the first control Z found as end-of-file.

              flip can be asked to strip the high (parity) bit as it converts a file.

       flip is normally invoked as:
                      flip -umhvtb file ...
       One of -u, -m, or -h is required.  Switches may be given separately or combined together after a dash.  For example, the three command lines given below are equivalent:
                      flip -uvt *.c
                      flip -u -v -t *.c
                      flip -u -vt *.c

       On systems that allow a program to know its own name, flip may be renamed (or linked) to a file called toix for conversion to **IX format, or to a file called toms for conversion to MS-DOS format.
       When invoked with the name toix or toms, flip will act as if it were invoked with the -u or -m option respectively.

OPTIONS
       -u     Convert to **IX format (CR LF => LF, lone CR or LF unchanged, trailing control Z removed, embedded control Z unchanged).

       -m     Convert to MS-DOS format (lone LF => CR LF, lone CR unchanged).

       -h     Give a help message.

       -v     Be verbose, print filenames as they are processed.

       -t     Touch files (don't preserve timestamps).

       -s     Strip high bit.

       -b     Convert binary files too (else binary files are left unchanged).

       -z     Truncate file at first control Z encountered.
