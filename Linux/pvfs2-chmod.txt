PVFS2-CHMOD(1)              General Commands Manual             PVFS2-CHMOD(1)

NAME
       pvfs2-chmod – modify permissions on files in OrangeFS volumes

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-chmod [-v] mode filename(s)

DESCRIPTION
       The  pvfs2-chmod  utility  modifies the permission bits on the OrangeFS
       files specified.  The mode is specified as a three or four digit  octal
       number in the conventional manner.

       The options are as follows:

       -v     Print version number and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       PVFS2_DEBUGFILE
              If set to the path of a local file, redirect debug output to it.

       PVFS2_DEBUGMASK
              Set  the  OrangeFS debug mask.  Possible masks are documented in
              pvfs2-set-debugmask(1).

       PVFS2TAB_FILE
              If set, the full pathname for an alternate pvfs2tab file

FILES
       /etc/pvfs2tab

EXAMPLES
       Prevent other users from accessing a file.

             pvfs2-chmod 600 /mnt/foo

       Allow the owner and users in the file's group to read  and  modify  the
       file and other users to only read the file.

             pvfs2-chmod 664 /mnt/foo

CAVEATS
       This  utility  does  not support symbolic permissions like the chmod(1)
       utility.

       Note that because OrangeFS is a network  file  system,  any  user  with
       access to the network may be able to circumvent file permissions.
