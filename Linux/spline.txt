NAME
       aspline - Akima spline interpolation

SYNOPSIS
       aspline [-a xstep] [-l llim] [-u ulim] [-n n] {file(s)}

DESCRIPTION
       aspline  reads  pairs  of  numbers  from  the  indicated file(s) (or from stdin if no files were given) as abscissas and ordinates of a function.  It produces a similar set, which is approximately
       equally spaced and includes the input set on standard output. The output is an Akima-interpolated spline which has an continuous first derivative.  The second derivate may  be  discontinuous,  but
       the output does not wiggle as it would do with cubic splines.

       Datasets are separated by blank lines.

OPTIONS
       -a incr, --auto=incr
              supply abscissas automatically, since they are missing from the input; spacing is given by the next argument, or is assumed to be 1, if next argument is not a number.

       -l llim, --llimit=llim
              set lower x-limit to llim,

       -u ulim, --ulimit=ulim
              set upper x-limit to ulim,

       -n n, --points=n
              space output points so that approx.  n intervals occur between the lower and upper limit,

       -v     be verbose,

       -h     print help message on stderr and exit.

BUGS
       If you need a continuous second derivative, use spline from the plotutils package instead.
