NAME
       pydf - report colourised filesystem disk space usage

SYNOPSIS
       pydf [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       pydf  is  a  python script that displays the amount of disk space available on the mounted filesystems, using different colours for different types of filesystems. Output format is completely cus‐
       tomizable.

       If an optional
              file argument is given, pydf displays just information about filesystem containing the file(s), otherwise it displays information about all mounted filesystems.

OPTIONS
       --help Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       -a, --all
              include filesystems having 0 blocks

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 133K 2341M 2448G)

       -H, --si
              likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       --block-size=SIZE
              use SIZE-byte blocks

       -k, --kilobytes
              like --block-size=1024

       -i, --inodes
              show information about inodes instead of blocks

       -l, --local
              limit listing to local filesystems

       -m, --megabytes
              like --block-size=1048576

       -g, --gigabytes
              like --block-size=1073741824

       --blocks
              use filesystem native block size

       --bw   do not use colours

       --mounts=FILE
              file to get mount information from.  On normal linux system, only /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts make sense.  Use /proc/mounts when /etc/mtab is corrupted or inaccessible (the output looks a bit
              weird in this case though)

       -B, --show-binds
              Show also mount --bind mounted filesystems.

BUGS
       POSIX mandates to have f_blocks and f_bfree to be the number in units of f_frsize. However, many programs are buggy, including df(1) from coreutils, and Linux kernel often lies and  reports  f_fr‐
       size  ==  f_bsize.  Some filesystem and some other operating systems don't, and then the size reported by pydf is incorrect. As a stopgap measure, there is a parameter statvfs_block in /etc/pydfrc
       where you can force f_frsize or f_bsize.

FILES
       /etc/pydfrc
              main configuration file

       ~/.pydfrc
              per-user configuration file
