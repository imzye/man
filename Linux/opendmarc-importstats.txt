NAME
       opendmarc-importstats - import OpenDMARC statistics/history data

SYNOPSIS
       opendmarc-importstats

DESCRIPTION
       opendmarc-importstats  is a fairly trivial shell script, typically exe‐
       cuted by cron(8), that rotates  an  OpenDMARC  statistics/history  data
       file  to  a  unique  filename and then attempts to import it to a local
       database for later processing  by  executing  opendmarc-import(8).   On
       successful  import,  the unique file is removed; on failure, the script
       executes ls(1) on the file and exits without removing the unique  file.
       The  intent of this last step is to cause cron to generate a message to
       a responsible party so that the failure will be investigated.

VERSION
       This man page covers the version of opendmarc-importstats that  shipped
       with version 1.4.1 of OpenDMARC.
