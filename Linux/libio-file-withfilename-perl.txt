NAME
       IO::File::WithFilename - filehandles that know their origin

SYNOPSIS
           use IO::File::WithFilename;

           my $fh = IO::File::WithFilename->new('../movies/kin-dza-dza.ogg', O_RDONLY);
           print $fh->filename, "\n";
           print "$fh\n"; # same as above

DESCRIPTION
       This module does everything that "IO::File" does, but implements "filename" method, that "File::Temp" objects have. It lets you write the code that is ignorant of what classes of objects it works
       with.

       If you want to check if it is safe to call "filename" method, you are recommended to call "can" method rather than to check an object's inheritance:

           print $obj->filename, "\n" if eval { $obj->can('filename') };

   EXPORT
       Same as "IO::File", i. e. "O_XXX" constants from the "Fcntl" module (if this module is available).

SEE ALSO
       IO::File, File::Temp
