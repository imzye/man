NAME
       ggthumb - Thumbnail creator for Geogebra files

SYNOPSIS

       ggthumb inuput_file output_file size

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ggthumb command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       ggthumb is a program to build a thumbnail image of a Geogebra file. It isn't meant to be used directly by the user, but as a thumbnail generator for the Gnome file browser.

OPTIONS
       ggthumb will open the input file, which is expected to be a Geogebra file, compute its thumbnail of sizexsize pixels and save it in the output file.
