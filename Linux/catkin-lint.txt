DESCRIPTION
       catkin_lint checks package configurations for the catkin build system of ROS.  It runs a static analysis of the "package.xml" and "CMakeLists.txt" files in your package, and it will detect and
       report a number of common problems.

       All diagnosed problems come in one of three possible severities:

       Errors are severe enough to break the build and/or produce unintended side effects.  Usually, they violate the rules outlined in the catkin manual.

       Warnings are potential errors which may indicate a bug in your package but may be justified for reasons catkin_lint cannot discern. Constructs which trigger a warning can usually be modified in a
       way that is functionally equivalent but more robust.

       Notices are issues which are not objectionable from a technical view point but should be addressed to improve the quality of the package. Many notices highlight violations of the recommendations
       and best practises from the catkin manual.

OPTIONS
       --config FILE
           Read configuration settings from FILE. This option can be used multiple times.  See "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT" for details.

       --quiet, -q
           Suppress all outputs expect for the detected problems, in particular, do not show the summary at the end.

       --no-quiet
           Show a summary of the findings at the end. This is the default setting.

       --severity-level LEVEL, -W LEVEL
           Choose the severity level for diagnostic output. Level 0 displays errors only, level 1 displays errors and warnings, and level 2 displays everything. The default setting is -W1.

       --notice ID, --warning ID, --error ID
           Override the default severity of certain problems. See "PROBLEM IDS" for details on the available IDs.

       --ignore ID
           Ignore a problem. This is mostly useful to work around a known bug in catkin_lint, because problems tend to not go away if you ignore them. See "PROBLEM IDS" for details on the available IDs.

       --show-ignored
           Show all problems you ignored. Use this if an ignored problem did not go away, but you forgot which one.

       --strict
           Treat any reported problem as a fatal error. Some people use the option to enforce that warnings get fixed, too. You can also combine this with -W2 to turn even notices into errors, if you are
           exceptionally pedantic and/or have a high pain tolerance.

       --no-strict
           This will undo the effects of your rash decision to put "strict=yes" in your configuration file. This is also the default setting.

       --pkg PKG
           Check the package PKG for problems. The package must be in the ROS package search path.

       --skip-pkg PKG
           Skip the package PKG when processing a package subtree. The package will not be linted, but it will be treated as a known package for dependency resolutions.

       --package-path PATH[:PATH[...]]
           Add  one or more additional locations to the ROS package search path. Separate multiple locations with ":". catkin_lint will use this path list and the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable to
           resolve the --pkg option and dependencies of linted packages.

       --skip-path MATCH
           Skip packages if their location contains MATCH. No wildcards or pattern matching allowed, only proper substrings are recognized.

       --rosdistro DISTRO
           Assume that all packages are supposed to work with the ROS distribution DISTRO. By default, this value is taken from the ROS_DISTRO environment variable. catkin_lint will use this to query the
           ROS database for packages which are not locally installed.

       --offline
           Forbid metadata queries to the ROS package index. This will disable certain diagnostics which rely on knowing details about all package  dependencies.  Metadata  queries  are  not  needed  for
           packages which can be found locally through the ROS package search path.

       --no-offline
           Allow metadata queries to the ROS package index. This is the default.

       --rosdep-cache-path PATH
           Override the default location of the rosdep sources cache. This option has the same effect as setting the ROSDEP_CACHE_PATH environment variable.

       --resolve-env
           Resolve environment variables $ENV{} in CMake scripts. By default, catkin_lint will treat all environment variables like empty strings and issue a warning.

       --no-resolve-env
           Do not resolve environment variables $ENV{} in CMake scripts and issue a warning if they are used. This is the default.

       --output FORMAT
           Select the output format for the diagnosed problems. Valid output formats are text, explain, json, and xml. See "OUTPUT FORMATS" for more details.

       --text, --explain, --json, --xml
           These are deprecated aliases for --output FORMAT.

       --color MODE
           Configure  the colorization of the text and explain output formats. The default mode is auto, which will use ANSI colors if catkin_lint detects a terminal as output. The modes always and never
           will override the detection and output ANSI colors always or never, respectively.

OUTPUT FORMATS
       catkin_lint supports a variety of output formats as argument for the --output option:

       text
           This is the default format, which outputs a short, human-readable description of all problems.

       explain
           This is an extended text format, which will show an additional explanation when a problem type occurs for the first time. It will also mention the message ID  which  you  need  to  change  the
           severity or ignore a problem.

       json
           Outputs all problems in JSON format.

       xml Outputs all problems in XML format.

ENVIRONMENT
       catkin_lint  uses  ROS_PACKAGE_PATH  to  find locally available packages and ROS_DISTRO to determine the installed ROS distribution when querying the ROS package index or the rosdep database.  All
       other environment variables will be ignored, unless catkin_lint is instructed to resolve them in CMake scripts by --resolve-env.

RETURN VALUES
       0   All packages were linted successfully and no errors occurred.

       1   An error occurred.

       66  No packages found.

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       catkin_lint will look for configuration options in the following files:

       •   Files explicitly specified using --config

       •   .catkin_lint files in all locations from ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

       •   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/catkin_lint

       •   ~/.config/catkin_lint if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset or empty

       •   ~/.catkin_lint

       catkin_lint will read all available configuration files and merge them into a single configuration. Earlier entries in the above list will take precedence if conflicting options are found. Command
       line arguments will override any configuration file setting. Configuration files are in an INI-style format with one or more sections in it.

   [catkin_lint] section
       The main section is called "[catkin_lint]" and will take the following catkin_lint specific options:

       color = auto | never | always
           Determine output colorization mode. The default setting auto will enable colorization if and only if standard output is connected to terminal. The modes always  and  never  will  override  the
           detection and output ANSI colors always or never, respectively.

       offline = no | yes
           Allow  or  forbid metadata queries to the ROS package index. This will disable certain diagnostics which rely on knowing details about all package dependencies. Metadata queries are not needed
           for packages which can be found locally through the ROS package search path. The default setting is no.

       output = text | explain | json | xml
           Select the output format for problem reports. See "OUTPUT FORMATS" for details.  The default setting is text.

       package_path = PATH[:PATH[...]]
           Prepend the specified PATHs to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in order to find locally available packages and/or package dependencies.

       quiet = no | yes
           Select output verbosity. The default setting no allows catkin_lint to print some additional information to standard error, such as a final summary of all detected problems.

       resolve_env = no | yes
           Allow or forbid resolution of environment variables. The default setting no lets catkin_lint ignore environment  variables  and  issue  a  warning  whenever  a  CMake  command  references  the
           environment using $ENV{}.

       rosdistro = DISTRO
           Assume  that  all packages are supposed to work with the ROS distribution DISTRO.  By default, this value is taken from the ROS_DISTRO environment variable.  catkin_lint will use this to query
           the ROS database for packages which are not locally installed.

       rosdep_cache_path = PATH
           Override the default location of the rosdep sources cache. This option has the same effect as setting the ROSDEP_CACHE_PATH environment variable.

       severity_level = 0 | 1 | 2
           Choose the severity level for diagnostic output. Level 0 displays errors only, level 1 displays errors and warnings, and level 2 displays everything. The default setting is 1.

       strict = no | yes
           In strict mode, catkin_lint will treat every reported problem as error and return with exit code 1 (see "RETURN VALUES"). By default, warnings and notices are informational only. This  setting
           is mostly interesting for automated test runs, where the exit code is evaluated. Note that ignored problems and everything hidden by the chosen severity_level will not be considered failures.

   Package-specific severity overrides
       All  section  names besides "[catkin_lint]" are interpreted as package names and will override the reported severities of problems. As a special case, the section "[*]" will apply to all packages.
       The overrides are specified in the format "ID = Severity", where the severity can be one of ignore, error, warning, notice, or default. See "PROBLEM IDS" for details on the available IDs.

       Unlike --strict, this gives you very fine-grained control over which problems are supposed to be fatal, so you are encouraged to integrate catkin_lint into your  CI  test  pipeline  and  tune  the
       settings in a way that fits your project.

PROBLEM IDS
       You can run catkin_lint --help-problem to get a list of all problem IDs, and catkin_lint --help-problem ID for a more detailed explanation of each problem.

EXAMPLES
   Command line arguments
       catkin_lint ~/catkin_ws/src
           Check all packages in ~/catkin_ws/src for problems.

       catkin_lint --pkg foo --pkg bar
           Check the packages "foo" and "bar" for problems, assuming that they can be found in one of the locations listed in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.

       catkin_lint --pkg foo --pkg bar --package-path ~/my_other_ws/src
           Check the packages "foo" and "bar" for problems when the former assumption turned out to be false.

       catkin_lint ~/catkin_ws/src --skip-path unstable
           Check all packages in ~/catkin_ws/src, but skip all packages in a path that contains the string "unstable".

       catkin_lint ~/catkin_ws/src --skip-pkg baz
           Check all packages except "baz" in ~/catkin_ws/src.

   Configuration file
       The following configuration file will instruct catkin_lint to output its results in JSON format, ignore any problems with unknown packages (except in the package foo), and elevate the notice about
       unsorted lists to a warning for all packages (including foo):

           [catkin_lint]
           output = json
           quiet = yes

           [*]
           unknown_package = ignore
           unsorted_list = warning

           [foo]
           unknown_package = default
