NAME
       mangoapp - transparent background application with a built in mangohud

SYNOPSIS
       mangoapp

DESCRIPTION
       MangoHud is a Vulkan/OpenGL overlay for monitoring FPS, temperatures, CPU/GPU load and more.

       Mangoapp  is  a  transparent  background opengl application with a built in MangoHud. It's designed to be run inside a gamescope instance which will display mangoapp ontop of gamescopes output. It
       also takes frame information from gamescope. The purpose of this is to "easily" make MangoHud compatible with any application, or at least any application that gamescope can run. This  solves  is‐
       sues with some OpenGL games and certain ports that have stdc++ issues as it's no longer directly injected into the game.

USAGE
       Create a script (e.g. run.sh) containing the app you want to run (e.g. vkcube) and mangoapp like so:

           #!/bin/sh

           vkcube&
           mangoapp

       And then run it with gamescope ./run.sh.
