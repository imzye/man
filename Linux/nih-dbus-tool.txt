NAME
       nih-dbus-tool - D-Bus binding code generator

SYNOPSIS
       nih-dbus-tool [OPTIONS]...  [-o FILE] [XMLFILE]
       nih-dbus-tool [OPTIONS]...  -o FILE --system|--session --dest=NAME OBJECT-PATH

DESCRIPTION
OVERVIEW
       The D-Bus introspection format is an XML document describing the interfaces implemented by a particular object, including the methods and signals of that in‐
       terface along with their arguments and the properties of that interface.

       A single document describes a single object, represented by the root <node> tag.  Interfaces implemented by that object are  specified  by  <interface>  tags
       within it.  Methods, signals and properties defined by the interface are described by <method>, <signal> and <property> tags within the interface.  Arguments
       to methods and signals are defined by <arg> tags within them.  Names and other values are specified as attributes to the tag.

       Additional properties for external tools or software may be given in <annotation> tags.  These may appear within interfaces, methods, signals, properties and
       arguments.  nih-dbus-tool makes use of many of these.  Note that argument annotations are an nih-dbus-tool extension to the format.

       nih-dbus-tool's  parser is reasonably liberal, to allow for future expansion of the D-Bus introspection format.  Any unknown tag, attribute or annotation, or
       any tag not in an expected location, will be ignored with a warning.  However a missing root node tag, missing attributes, illegal or invalid  format  values
       for defined attributes or non well-formed XML will result in an error.

       Character data and comments are not considered part of description, and are not parsed.
