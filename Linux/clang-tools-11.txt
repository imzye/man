NAME
       find-all-symbols - manual page for find-all-symbols 11

DESCRIPTION
       USAGE: find-all-symbols [options] <source0> [... <sourceN>]

       OPTIONS:

       Generic Options:

       --help                      - Display available options (--help-hidden for more)

       --help-list                 - Display list of available options (--help-list-hidden for more)

       --version                   - Display the version of this program

       find_all_symbols options:

       --extra-arg=<string>        - Additional argument to append to the compiler command line

       --extra-arg-before=<string> - Additional argument to prepend to the compiler command line

       --merge-dir=<string>        -
              The directory for merging symbols.

       --output-dir=<string>       -
              The output directory for saving the results.

       -p=<string>                 - Build path

       -p <build-path> is used to read a compile command database.

              For example, it can be a CMake build directory in which a file named compile_commands.json exists (use -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON CMake option
              to get this output). When no build path is specified, a search for compile_commands.json will be attempted through all parent paths of the first input
              file . See: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html for an example of setting up Clang Tooling on a source tree.

       <source0> ... specify the paths of source files. These paths are

              looked up in the compile command database. If the path of a file is absolute, it needs to point into CMake's source tree. If the path is relative, the
              current working directory needs to be in the CMake source tree and the file must be in a subdirectory of the current working directory. "./"  prefixes
              in the relative files will be automatically removed, but the rest of a relative path must be a suffix of a path in the compile command database.
