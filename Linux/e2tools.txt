NAME
       e2tools -  utilities to manipulate files in an ext2/ext3 filesystem

DESCRIPTION
       E2tools  is  a  simple set of GPL'ed utilities to read, write, and manipulate files in an ext2/ext3 filesystem. These utilities access a filesystem directly using the ext2fs library. I wrote these
       tools in order to copy files into a linux filesystem on a machine that does not have ext2 support. Of course, they can also be used on a linux machine to read/write  to  disk  images  or  floppies
       without having to mount them or have root access.

       Supported functionality:

       e2cp   copy files

       e2mv   move files

       e2rm   remove files

       e2mkdir
              create directory

       e2ln   create hard links

       e2ls   list files/directories

       e2tail output the last part of a file

       In general, to specify a directory or file on an ext2 filesystem for the e2tools utilities, use the following form:

              filesystem:directory_path

       The  filesystem can be an unmounted partition or a regular file that's been formatted to contain an ext2 filesystem.  In general, if a command takes multiple file names on the command line, if the
       first one contains an ext2 file specification, the rest of the files are assumed to be on the same filesystem until another one is explicitly stated:

              /tmp/boot.img:/tmp/file1

              /tmp/file2

              /tmp/file3

              /tmp/boot2.img:/tmp/file4

       Files 1-3 are on /tmp/boot.img and the last file is on /tmp/boot2.img
