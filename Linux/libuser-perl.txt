NAME
       User - API for locating user information regardless of OS

SYNOPSIS
         use User;

         my $cfg = Config::IniFiles->new
               (
                 -file    => sprintf("%s/%s", User->Home, ".ncfg"),
                 -default => 'Default'
               );

         print "Your login is ", User->Login, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module is allows applications to retrieve per-user characteristics.

METHODS
       Home
           Returns a location that can be expected to be a users "Home" directory on either Windows or Unix.

           While one way of writing this would be to check for operating system and then check the expected location for an operation system of that type, I chose to do the following:

            sub Home {

             return $ENV{HOME}        if $ENV{HOME};
             return $ENV{USERPROFILE} if $ENV{USERPROFILE};
             return  "";

            }

           In other words, if $HOME is defined in the user's environment, then that is used. Otherwise $USERPROFILE is used. Otherwise "" is returned.

           A contribution for Macintosh (or any other number of OS/arch combinations) is greatly solicited.

       Login
           Returns login id of user on either Unix or NT by checking "getlogin", "getpwuid", and various environment variables.

SEE ALSO
       File::HomeDir seems to be a very well-done update of the same concept as this module.
