NAME
       ssdd - have a tracer do a bunch of PTRACE_SINGLESTEPs

SYNOPSIS
       ssdd [-f|--forks NUM] [-h|--help] [-i|--iters NUM] [--json FILENAME]

DESCRIPTION
       Have  a  tracer  do a bunch of PTRACE_SINGLESTEPs against a tracee as fast as possible. Create several of these tracer/tracee pairs and see if they can be made to interfere with each other. The tracer
       waits on each PTRACE_SINGLESTEP with a waitpid(2) and checks that waitpid's return values for correctness.

OPTIONS
       -f, --forks=NUM
              number of tracer/tracee pairs to fork off.
              Default is 10.

       -h, --help
              Display usage

       -i, --iters=NUM
              number of PTRACE_SINGLESTEP iterations to do before declaring success, for each tracer tracee pair set up.
              Default is 10,000.

       --json=FILENAME
              Write final results into FILENAME, JSON formatted.
