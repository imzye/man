Pod::Weaver::Section::Support(3pm)                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                  Pod::Weaver::Section::Support(3pm)

NAME
       Pod::Weaver::Section::Support - Add a SUPPORT section to your POD

VERSION
       version 1.014

DESCRIPTION
       This section plugin will produce a hunk of pod that lists the various ways to get support for this module. It will do this only if it is being built with Dist::Zilla because it needs the data from
       the dzil object.

       If you have Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Repository enabled in your dist.ini, be sure to check the repository_link attribute!

       This is added ONLY to the main module's POD, because it would be a waste of space to add it to all modules in the dist.

       For an example of what the hunk looks like, look at the "SUPPORT" section in this POD :)

ATTRIBUTES
   all_modules
       Enable this if you want to add the SUPPORT section to all the modules in a dist, not only the main one.

       The default is false.

   perldoc
       Specify if you want the paragraph explaining about perldoc to be displayed or not.

       The default is true.

   bugs
       Specify the bugtracker you want to use. You can use the CPAN RT tracker or your own, specified in the metadata.

       Valid options are: "rt", "metadata", or "none"

       If you pick the "rt" option, this module will generate a predefined block of text explaining how to use the RT system.

       If you pick the "metadata" option, this module will check the Dist::Zilla metadata for the bugtracker to display. Be sure to verify that your metadata contains both 'web' and 'mailto' keys if you
       want to use them in the content!

       The default is "rt".

   bugs_content
       Specify the content for the bugs section.

       Please put the "{EMAIL}" and "{WEB}" placeholders somewhere!

       The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

   websites
       Specify what website links you want to see. This is an array, and you can pick any combination. You can also specify it as a comma-delimited string. The ordering of the options are important, as
       they are reflected in the final POD.

       Valid options are: "none", "metacpan", "rt", "kwalitee", "testers", "testmatrix", "deps" and "all".

       The default is "all".

               # Where the links go to:
               metacpan        - https://metacpan.org/release/$dist
               rt              - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=$dist
               kwalitee        - http://cpants.perl.org/dist/$dist
               testers         - http://cpantesters.org/distro/$first_char/$dist
               testmatrix      - http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=$dist
               deps            - http://deps.cpantesters.org/?module=$module

               # in weaver.ini
               [Support]
               websites = search
               websites = metacpan
               websites = testers , testmatrix

       P.S. If you know other websites that I should include here, please let me know!

   websites_content
       Specify the content to be displayed before the website list.

       The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

   irc
       Specify an IRC server/channel/nick for online support. You can specify as many networks/channels as you want.  The ordering of the options are important, as they are reflected in the final POD.

       You specify a network, then a list of channels/nicks to ask for support. There are two ways to format the string:

               servername.com,#room,nick
               irc://servername.com/#room

       The default is none.

               # in weaver.ini
               [Support]
               irc = irc.home.org, #support, supportbot
               irc = irc.acme.com, #acmecorp, #acmehelp, #acmenewbies

       You can also add the irc information in the distribution metadata via Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Metadata.  The key is 'x_IRC' but you have to use the irc:// format to retain compatibility with the rest
       of the ecosystem.

               # in dist.ini
               [Metadata]
               x_IRC = irc://irc.perl.org/#perl

   irc_content
       Specify the content to be displayed before the irc network/channel list.

       The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

   repository_link
       Specify which url to use when composing the external link.  The value corresponds to the repository meta resources (for dzil v3 with CPAN Meta v2).

       Valid options are: "url", "web", "both", or "none".

       "both" will include links to both the "url" and "web" in separate POD paragraphs.

       "none" will skip the repository item entirely.

       The default is "both".

       An error will be thrown if a specified link is not found because if you said that you wanted it you probably expect it to be there.

   repository_content
       Specify the content to be displayed before the link to the source code repository.

       The default is a sufficient explanation (see "SUPPORT").

   email
       Specify an email address here so users can contact you directly for help.

       If you supply a string without '@' in it, we assume it is a PAUSE id and mangle it into 'USER at cpan.org'.

       The default is none.

   email_content
       Specify the content for the email section.

       Please put the "{EMAIL}" placeholder somewhere!

       The default is a sufficient explanation ( see "SUPPORT").
