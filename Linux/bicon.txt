BICON(1)                    General Commands Manual                   BICON(1)

NAME
       bicon - a bidirectional console

SYNOPSIS
       bicon [isocode] [command [arguments...]]

DESCRIPTION
       Bicon  is  a  console program that supports bidirectional text display,
       for languages like Arabic, Persian and Hebrew.

       bicon uses bicon.bin(1) to do the real  bidi/joining  conversion  after
       loading a suitable keymap and font.

       While using bicon you can switch between Arabic and English, or between
       Persian and English, using the Alt-Shift key combination.

OPTIONS
       isocode
              The two letter ISO country code,  in  small  letters.   If  left
              empty, the derived value from the LANG variable is used instead.

       command
              is  executed by bicon after it loads. If omitted, bicon uses the
              current SHELL , or /bin/sh if SHELL is undefined.

       arguments
              are passed to the command to run.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are utilized by bicon :

       SHELL  If the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by bicon will  be
              that  shell.  If  SHELL is not set, the Bourne shell is assumed.
              (Most shells set this variable automatically).

       LANG   If isocode is not passed to bicon , it will examine LANG to  de‐
              termine the desired language.

       TERM   Variable  TERM  is  examined in case to determine how to set the
              keymap and font.  Recognized values are  linux  and  xterm  cur‐
              rently.

       DISPLAY
              If the value of TERM is xterm, then DISPLAY is examined by bicon
              to find the X server to contant to load the keymap.
