NAME
       mpDris2 - media player interface (MPRIS2) bridge for MPD

SYNOPSIS
       mpDris2 [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       mpDris2 is an implementation of the MPRIS2 media player interface as a client for MPD, allowing MPRIS2 clients to control MPD and observe its track changes via a standard D-Bus interface.

       It can also respond to multimedia keys if running under GNOME, and send track-change notifications if python-notify is installed.

       It is normally run automatically via D-Bus service activation. On systems following the freedesktop.org Desktop Application Autostart Specification, it will be run automatically on login.

CONFIGURATION
       mpDris2  is  normally configured via the file XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/mpDris2/mpDris2.conf (typically ~/.config/mpDris2/mpDris2.conf), whose contents are documented in /usr/share/doc/mpdris2/README.  Set‐
       tings in this configuration file can be overridden by command-line options and environment variables.

OPTIONS
       -p PATH, --path=PATH
              Set the location of the directory from which mpd reads music, overriding the configuration file. The default is to use the path specified in the configuration file, or try some  likely  di‐
              rectories (XDG_MUSIC_DIR from the environment or XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/user-dirs.dirs, ~/Music, ~/music).

       -h, --help
              Show a help message

       -d, --debug
              Emit debug logging messages

ENVIRONMENT
       XDG_CONFIG_HOME=DIRECTORY, XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=SEARCHPATH
              Used to find the configuration file XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/mpDris2/mpDris2.conf according to the XDG Base Directory Specification.

       MPD_HOST=HOSTNAME
              Set the hostname of the mpd server, overriding the configuration file.

       MPD_PORT=PORT
              Set the port number of the mpd server, overriding the configuration file.
