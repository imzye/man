       PDL::IO::HDF::VS - An interface library for HDF4 files.

SYNOPSIS
         use PDL;
         use PDL::IO::HDF::VS;

          #### no doc for now ####

DESCRIPTION
       This library provides functions to manipulate HDF4 files with VS and V interface (reading, writing, ...)

       For more information on HDF4, see http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf4/

FUNCTIONS
   new
           Open or create a new HDF object with VS and V interface.

           Arguments:
               1 : The name of the HDF file.
                   If you want to write to it, prepend the name with the '+' character : "+name.hdf"
                   If you want to create it, prepend the name with the '-' character : "-name.hdf"
                   Otherwise the file will be opened in read only mode.

           Returns the hdf object (die on error)

           my $hdf = PDL::IO::HDF::VS->new("file.hdf");

   close
           Close the VS interface.

           no arguments

           my $result = $hdf->close();
