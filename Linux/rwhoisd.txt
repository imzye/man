NAME
       rwhoisd  - Server for the RWhois Protocol

SYNOPSIS
       rwhoisd [-c ConfFile] [-rsdiVvq]

DESCRIPTION
       RWhoisd  serves data using the RWhois protocol. The rwhoisd server will serve formatted records based on a query, send referral and see-also information, and change the server environment based on di‐
       rectives.  The server is typically run as a standalone server, although it can be run from inetd(1).

       -s     Attempt a chroot(2) upon startup.

       -d     Start up in "daemon mode".

       -i     Start up in "inetd mode".
