NAME
       cavepacker - Sokoban game

SYNOPSIS
       cavepacker [option]

DESCRIPTION
       cavepacker CavePacker is a sokoban game.  Keep your cave tidy. To do this, make sure that all the spread packages are put onto their targets. You can only push, pulling is not allowed.

       You get higher ratings for lesser moves you need. The first few maps might be easy to solve - but the more you progress in the game, the harder the maps will be.

       There is also a multiplayer mode available.

OPTIONS
       -server
              Start the server for the game (headless mode).

       -set <varname> <value>
              Change the value of a config variable.

CONSOLE COMMANDS
       Open  the  in-game  console  with SHIFT+ESC. Just type a config variable name there to get the current value. The console commands can also be triggered from the commandline by just putting a - in
       front of it.

       -loglevel <LEVEL>
              Possible level values are: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR

CONFIG VARIABLES
       These variables can be modified by using the -set command - or by providing default values for some of them in the config.lua file in the asset directory. You can override any file by  putting  it
       into the same subdir as in your installation folder into ~/.local/share/cavepacker
