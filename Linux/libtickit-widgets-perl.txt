NAME
       "Tickit::Widget::HLine" - a widget displaying a horizontal line

SYNOPSIS
          use Tickit::Widget::VBox;
          use Tickit::Widget::HLine;

          my $vbox = Tickit::Widget::VBox->new;

          $vbox->add( ... );

          $vbox->add( Tickit::Widget::HLine->new );

          Tickit->new( root => $vbox )->run;

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides a widget which displays a single horizontal line, using line-drawing characters. It consumes the full width of the window given to it by its parent. By default it is drawn in
       the vertical middle of the window but this can be adjusted by the "valign" style value.

STYLE
       The default style pen is used as the widget pen.

       The following additional style keys are used:

       line_style => INT
           The style to draw the line in. Must be one of the "LINE_*" constants from Tickit::RenderBuffer.

       valign => NUM | STR
           A fraction giving a position within the window to draw the line. Defaults to 0.5, which puts it in the middle.

           Symbolic names of "top", "middle" and "bottom" are also accepted.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
          $hline = Tickit::Widget::HLine->new( %args );

       Constructs a new "Tickit::Widget::HLine" object.
