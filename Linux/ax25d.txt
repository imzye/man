NAME
       ax25d - General purpose AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ax25d [-v] [-c altconffile] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
       Ax25d  is  a  general purpose server daemon that listens on a number of
       AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose ports and offers different  services  depending
       upon port, callsign and other parameters.  Ax25d is driven by a complex
       configuration file, a full description of which may be found in another
       manual page.

       AX25d has the facility to log information about incoming connections to
       the system log file. By default no logging is done. When ax25d is  run‐
       ning,  and  a  change  in  the configuration file is made, ax25d can be
       forced to re-read its configuration file by sending it a SIGHUP.

OPTIONS
       -c altconffile Specifies an alternate configuration file name.

       -l             Specifies that messages should be logged into the system
                      log file. By default no messages are logged.

       -v             Display the version.
