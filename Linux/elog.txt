NAME
       elog - utility program for Electronic Logbook ELOG

SYNOPSIS
       elog -a attribute=value [ -e id ] [ -f file... ] -h host [ -l logbook ] [ -m textfile ] [ -p port ] [ -r id ] [ -s subdir ] [ -u username password ] [ -v ] [
       -w password ] message  [ -x ]

DESCRIPTION
       The Electronic Logbook ELOG can be used to store and retrieve messages through a Web interface. Depending on the configuration, the ELOG system can host  one
       or  more  logbooks which are stored in separate sections on the server.  elog is the standalone client program which can be used from the command line to in‐
       teract with the ELOG daemon (elogd). The elog message can either be submitted on the command line or piped through `stdin' or in a file with the  `-m'  flag.
       For  the former case, message with blanks must be enclosed in quotes.  Multiple attributes can be specified as well as several attachments. The password must
       match the write password defined on the server.  If user level access is defined on the server (via the `Password file' option), a valid user name / password
       pair must be specified with the `-u' option.

       The  elog program makes it possible to submit logbook entries automatically by the system or from scripts. In some shift logbooks this feature is used to en‐
       ter alarm messages automatically into the logbook.
