DNSSEC-DSFROMKEY(8)                                                                                  BIND9                                                                                  DNSSEC-DSFROMKEY(8)

NAME
       dnssec-dsfromkey - DNSSEC DS RR generation tool

SYNOPSIS
       dnssec-dsfromkey [-1 | -2 | -a alg] [-C | -l domain] [-T TTL] [-v level] [-K directory] {keyfile}

       dnssec-dsfromkey [-1 | -2 | -a alg] [-C | -l domain] [-T TTL] [-v level] [-c class] [-A] {-f file} [dnsname]

       dnssec-dsfromkey [-1 | -2 | -a alg] [-C | -l domain] [-T TTL] [-v level] [-c class] [-K directory] {-s} {dnsname}

       dnssec-dsfromkey [-h | -V]

DESCRIPTION
       The dnssec-dsfromkey command outputs DS (Delegation Signer) resource records (RRs), or CDS (Child DS) RRs with the -C option.

       The input keys can be specified in a number of ways:

       By default, dnssec-dsfromkey reads a key file named like Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key, as generated by dnssec-keygen.

       With the -f file option, dnssec-dsfromkey reads keys from a zone file or partial zone file (which can contain just the DNSKEY records).

       With the -s option, dnssec-dsfromkey reads a keyset- file, as generated by dnssec-keygen-C.

OPTIONS
       -1
           An abbreviation for -a SHA-1. (Note: The SHA-1 algorithm is no longer recommended for use when generating new DS and CDS records.)

       -2
           An abbreviation for -a SHA-256.

       -a algorithm
           Specify a digest algorithm to use when converting DNSKEY records to DS records. This option can be repeated, so that multiple DS records are created for each DNSKEY record.

           The algorithm must be one of SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-384. These values are case insensitive, and the hyphen may be omitted. If no algorithm is specified, the default is SHA-256. (Note: The SHA-1
           algorithm is no longer recommended for use when generating new DS and CDS records.)

       -A
           Include ZSKs when generating DS records. Without this option, only keys which have the KSK flag set will be converted to DS records and printed. Useful only in -f zone file mode.

       -c class
           Specifies the DNS class (default is IN). Useful only in -s keyset or -f zone file mode.

       -C
           Generate CDS records rather than DS records.

       -f file
           Zone file mode: dnssec-dsfromkey's final dnsname argument is the DNS domain name of a zone whose master file can be read from file. If the zone name is the same as file, then it may be omitted.

           If file is "-", then the zone data is read from the standard input. This makes it possible to use the output of the dig command as input, as in:

           dig dnskey example.com | dnssec-dsfromkey -f - example.com

       -h
           Prints usage information.

       -K directory
           Look for key files or keyset- files in directory.

       -s
           Keyset mode: dnssec-dsfromkey's final dnsname argument is the DNS domain name used to locate a keyset- file.

       -T TTL
           Specifies the TTL of the DS records. By default the TTL is omitted.

       -v level
           Sets the debugging level.

       -V
           Prints version information.

EXAMPLE
       To build the SHA-256 DS RR from the Kexample.com.+003+26160 keyfile name, you can issue the following command:

       dnssec-dsfromkey -2 Kexample.com.+003+26160

       The command would print something like:

       example.com. IN DS 26160 5 2 3A1EADA7A74B8D0BA86726B0C227AA85AB8BBD2B2004F41A868A54F0C5EA0B94

FILES
       The keyfile can be designated by the key identification Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii or the full file name Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key as generated by dnssec-keygen(8).

       The keyset file name is built from the directory, the string keyset- and the dnsname.

CAVEAT
       A keyfile error can give a "file not found" even if the file exists.
