NAME
       memcat - libmemcached Documentation

SYNOPSIS
       memcat [options] key [key...]

       Read and output the value of one key or the values of a set of keys.

DESCRIPTION
       memcat reads and outputs the value of a single or a set of keys stored in a memcached(1) server.

       If any key is not found an error is returned.

       It is similar to the standard UNIX cat(1) utility.

NOTES
   PROGRAM PREFIX
       The prefix of this program is variable, i.e. it can be configured at build time.

       Usually the client programs of libmemcached-awesome are prefixed with mem, like memcat or memcp.

       It can be configured, though, to replace the prefix with something else like mc, in case of that, the client programs of libmemcached-awesome would be called mccat, mccp, etc. respectively.
