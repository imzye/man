NAME
       wmacpi - Battery status monitor for systems supporting ACPI

NAME
       wmacpi-cli - Query battery status for systems supporting ACPI

SYNOPSIS
       wmacpi [ -c value ] [ -d display ] [ -m battery no ] [ -s sample rate ] [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -n ] [ -x ] [ -a samples ] [ -v ] [ -h ]

       wmacpi-cli [ -a samples ] [ -V ] [ -v ] ] -b ] [ -r ] [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmacpi command.

       wmacpi is a program that displays the current battery status in a WindowMaker dock app, on systems that support Intel's Advanced Configuration and Power Interface specification (ACPI).

       The  program  monitors a battery, displaying its current percentage charge via a bar and a numeric value. It also displays the current power status for the system, the time remaining (calculated based
       on the remaining battery capacity and the current rate of power usage), and a scrolling message with some hopefully useful information.

       Clicking on the window cycles through the batteries that the ACPI system knows about.

       wmacpi-cli queries the battery status from the command line. It prints the power status, the percentage remaining for each battery found, and the time remaining if the system is  on  battery,  or  the
       time remaining for each battery to reach full charge if the batteries are charging.

OPTIONS
       wmacpi

       -c, --critical=percentage
              Set critical low alarm at <percentage>% (default: 10%).

       -d, --display=display
              Set the X display to open the window on.

       -m, --battery=battery number
              Set the battery to monitor initially.

       -s, --sample-rate=sample rate
              Set the rate at which to sample the ACPI data, in number of times per minute. Minimum is 1, ie once a minute, default is 20, maximum is 600.

       -n, --no-blink
              Disable blinking power glyph when charging. Note that it still blinks when the battery reports its capacity state as critical.

       -f, --force-capacity-mode
              Force  the  use of capacity mode for calculating time remaining. By defalt wmacpi will use the reported values of remaining capacity and present rate to calculate the time remaining on battery.
              This flag will force the use of the remaining capacity and time samples to calculate the present rate of drain, and from there the time remaining. Note that this mode of  calculation  generally
              underreports the time remaining. This mode works around certain buggy ACPI BIOSes that fail to report the current rate.

       -x, --cmdline
              Run wmacpi in command line mode - this operates identically to wmacpi-cli.

       -a, --samples=samples
              Average the time remaining over num samples. This greatly improves the accuracy of the reported time remaining.

       -V, --verbosity=num
              Increase the verbosity of the program. Setting this to 1 will print extra error information; 2 will produce informational output; 3 will produce copious debugging output.

       -v, --version
              Print the version information.

       -r, --no-scroll
              Disable scrolling message.

       -h, --help
              Display help.

       wmacpi-cli

       -a num Average the time remaining over num samples. This greatly improves the accuracy of the reported time remaining.

       -V     Increase the verbosity of the program. If repeated, the result is the same as setting --verbosity for wmacpi to the number of repetitions.

       -v     Print the version information.

       -h     Display help.
