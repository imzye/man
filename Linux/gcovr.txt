   Filter Options:
              Filters decide which files are included in the report. Any filter must match, and no exclude filter must match. A filter is a regular expression that matches a path. Filter paths  use  for‐
              ward slashes, even on Windows. If the filter looks like an absolute path it is matched against an absolute path. Otherwise, the filter is matched against a relative path, where that path is
              relative to the current directory or if defined in a configuration file to the directory of the file.

       --gcov-filter GCOV_FILTER
              Keep only gcov data files that match this filter. Can be specified multiple times. Config key(s): gcovfilter.

       --gcov-exclude GCOV_EXCLUDE
              Exclude gcov data files that match this filter. Can be specified multiple times. Config key(s): gcov-exclude.

       --gcov-exclude-directories GCOV_EXCLUDE_DIRS, --exclude-directories GCOV_EXCLUDE_DIRS
              Exclude directories that match this regex while searching raw coverage files. Can be specified multiple times. Config key(s): gcov-excludedirectories, exclude-directories.

       -f FILTER, --filter FILTER
              Keep  only  source files that match this filter. Can be specified multiple times. Relative filters are relative to the current working directory or if defined in a configuration file. If no
              filters are provided, defaults to --root. Config key(s): filter.

       -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
              Exclude source files that match this filter. Can be specified multiple times. Config key(s): exclude.

   GCOV Options:
              The 'gcov' tool turns raw coverage files (.gcda and .gcno) into .gcov files that are then processed by gcovr. The gcno files are generated by the compiler. The gcda files are generated when
              the instrumented program is executed.

       -g, --gcov-use-existing-files, --use-gcov-files
              Use existing gcov files for analysis. Config key(s): gcov-use-existing-files, use-gcov-files.

       --gcov-ignore-errors [{all,source_not_found,output_error,no_working_dir_found}]
              Ignore errors from invoking GCOV command instead of exiting with an error. A report will be shown on stderr. Default is 'None'. Config key(s): gcov-ignoreerrors.

       --gcov-ignore-parse-errors [{all,negative_hits.warn,negative_hits.warn_once_per_file}]
              Skip lines with parse errors in GCOV files instead of exiting with an error. A report will be shown on stderr. Default is 'None'. Config key(s): gcov-ignoreparse-errors.

       --gcov-executable GCOV_CMD
              Use a particular gcov executable. Must match the compiler you are using, e.g. 'llvm-cov gcov' for Clang. Can include additional arguments. Defaults to  the  GCOV  environment  variable,  or
              'gcov': 'gcov'.  Config key(s): gcov-executable.

       --gcov-object-directory GCOV_OBJDIR, --object-directory GCOV_OBJDIR
              Override  normal  working  directory  detection. Gcovr needs to identify the path between gcda files and the directory where the compiler was originally run.  Normally, gcovr can guess cor‐
              rectly. This option specifies either the path from gcc to the gcda file (i.e. gcc's '-o' option), or the path from the gcda file to gcc's working directory. Config key(s): gcovobject-direc‐
              tory, object-directory.

       -k, --gcov-keep, --keep
              Keep gcov files after processing. This applies both to files that were generated by gcovr, or were supplied via the --gcov-use-existing-files option. Config key(s): keep-gcov-files.

       -d, --gcov-delete, --delete
              Delete gcda files after processing. Config key(s): delete-gcov-files.

       -j [GCOV_PARALLEL]
              Set the number of threads to use in parallel. Config key(s): gcov-parallel.

       --merge-mode-functions MERGE_MODE
              The merge mode for functions coverage from different gcov files for same sourcefile.Default is 'strict'.  Config key(s): merge-mode-functions.

       --include-internal-functions
              Include function coverage of compiler internal functions (starting with '__' or '_GLOBAL__sub_I_').  Config key(s): include-internal-functions.

       --exclude-unreachable-branches
              Exclude branch coverage from lines without useful source code (often, compiler-generated 'dead' code).  Config key(s): exclude-unreachable-branches.

       --exclude-function-lines
              Exclude coverage from lines defining a function.  Config key(s): exclude-function-lines.

       --exclude-noncode-lines
              Exclude coverage from lines which seem to be non-code.  Negation: --no-exclude-noncode-lines. Config key(s): exclude-noncode-lines.

       --exclude-throw-branches
              For branch coverage, exclude branches that the compiler generates for exception handling. This often leads to more 'sensible' coverage reports. Config key(s): exclude-throw-branches.
