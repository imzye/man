NAME
       dbskkd-cdb - a dictionary server for the SKK

SYNOPSIS
       dbskkd-cdb

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       dbskkd-cdb  is a dictionary server for the SKK Japanese input method system.  dbskkd-cdb is based on the code of skkserv (the original SKK server) 3.9.3, using the cdb constant database package of
       D. J. Bernstein (DJB) for faster dictionary access.

       dbskkd-cdb is compatible with skkserv on the protocol behavior.  It is called from "super-server" programs such as inetd or tcpserver, and the I/O operation is solely with the stdio interface,  so
       the code is compact and the access to the server can be easily restricted.
