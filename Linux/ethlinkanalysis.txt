NAME
       ethlinkanalysis

       Encapsulates the capabilities for link analysis. Additionally, this tool includes cable and fabric topology verification capabilities. This tool is built on top of ethreport (and its analysis capabil‐
       ities), and accepts the same syntax for input topology and snapshot files.

       In addition to being able to run assorted ethreport link analysis reports, and generate human-readable output, this tool additionally analyzes the results and appends a concise summary of issues found
       to the FF_RESULT_DIR/punchlist.csv file.

Syntax
       ethlinkanalysis [-U] [-T  topology_inputs] [-X  snapshot_input] [-x  snapshot_suffix]

       [-c  file] [-E file] [-p planes] reports ...

Options
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -U

                 Omits unexpected devices and links in punchlist file from verify reports.

       -T topology_inputs

                 Specifies the name of topology input filenames separated by space. See ethreport for more information on topology_input files.

       -X snapshot_input

                 Performs analysis using data in  snapshot_input.  snapshot_input must have been generated via a previous ethreport -o snapshot run.

       -x snapshot_suffix

                 Creates a snapshot file. The files are created in FF_RESULT_DIR with names of the form: snapshotSUFFIX.xml.

       -c file

                 Specifies the error thresholds configuration file. The default is /etc/eth-tools/ethmon.si.conf.

       -E file

                 Ethernet Mgt configuration file. The default is /etc/eth-tools/mgt_config.xml.

       -p planes

                 Fabric planes separated by space.. The default is the first enabled plane defined in config file. Value 'ALL' will use all enabled planes.

       reports

                 Supports the following reports:

                 errors    Specifies link error analysis.

                 slowlinks Specifies links running slower than expected.

                 misconfiglinks
                           Specifies links configured to run slower than supported.

                 misconnlinks
                           Specifies links connected with mismatched speed potential.

                 all       Includes all reports above. (errors, slowlinks, misconfiglinks, and misconnlinks)

                 verifylinks
                           Verifies links against topology input.

                 verifyextlinks
                           Verifies links against topology input. Limits analysis to links external to systems.

                 verifyniclinks
                           Verifies links against topology input. Limits analysis to NIC links.

                 verifyislinks
                           Verifies links against topology input. Limits analysis to inter-switch links.

                 verifyextislinks
                           Verifies links against topology input. Limits analysis to inter-switch links external to systems.

                 verifynics
                           Verifies NICs against topology input.

                 verifysws Verifies switches against topology input.

                 verifynodes
                           Verifies NICs and switches against topology input.

                 verifyall Verifies links, NICs, and switches against topology input.

       A punchlist of bad links is also appended to the file: FF_RESULT_DIR/punchlist.csv
