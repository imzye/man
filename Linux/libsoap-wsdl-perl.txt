DESCRIPTION
       Generates a interface class for a SOAP web service described by a WSDL definition.

       The following classes are created:

       •   A interface class for every SOAP port in service

           Interface classes are what you will mainly deal with: They provide a method for accessing every web service method.

           If you chose to generate Server interfaces, a class for every SOAP port in every Web service.

           You'll have to implement a method for each of the implemented methods. You may implement these methods in the CGI script / handler, or in any class to dispatch calls to.

       •   A typemap for every service

           Typemaps are used internally by SOAP::WSDL for parsing the SOAP message into object trees.

           If the WSDL definition is incomplete, you may need to add some lines to your typemap. Especially definitions for faults are sometimes left out.

           Additional typemap content may be included by passing a file name as typemap_include (mi) option.

       •   A type class for every element, complexType or simpleType definition

           You may need to write additional type classes if your WSDL is incomplete.

           For writing your own lib classes, see SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Element, SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::ComplexType and SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::SimpleType.

TROUBLESHOOTING
   Accessing HTTPS URLs
       You need Crypt::SSLeay installed for accessing HTTPS URLs.

   Accessing protected documents
       Use the -u option for specifying the user name. You will be prompted for a password.

       Alternatively, you may specify a passowrd with --password on the command line.

   Accessing documents protected by NTLM authentication
       Set the --keep_alive option.

       Note  that  accessing documents protected by NTLM authentication is currently untested, because I have no access to a system using NTLM authentication.  If you try it, I would be glad if you could
       just drop me a note about success or failure.
