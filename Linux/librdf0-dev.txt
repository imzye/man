NAME
       redland-config - script to get information about the installed version of Redland

SYNOPSIS
       redland-config [--cflags] [--help] [--libs] [--libtool-libs] [--prefix[=DIR]] [--private-libs] [--version-decimal] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       redland-config is a tool that is used to determine the compile and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the Redland RDF library.

OPTIONS
       redland-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of redland on the standard output.

       --version-decimal
               Print the currently installed version of redland as a decimal integer.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a redland program.  This excludes linker arguments used to build the librdf shared library.

       --libtool-libs
               Print the flags that are necessary to link a redland program with libtool.

       --private-libs
               Print  the  linker  flags  that  are  necessary to build the librdf shared library.  This option is not usually needed because the librdf shared library has already been dynamically linked
               against these libs.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a redland program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that redland was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option must be specified  before
               any --libs or --cflags options.
