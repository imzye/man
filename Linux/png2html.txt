NAME
       png2html - transforms a PNG image to a web page

SYNOPSIS
       png2html [ imagefile.png textfile.txt output.html compatibility ]
       Where compatibility is either 0, 1 or 2
       0 = Small Source, but uncompatibile with some browsers
       1 = Medium Size, works with almost anything.
       2 = Large Source, strict HTML.

DESCRIPTION
       png2html takes a PNG image and transforms it pixel by pixel to a web page, encoding each pixel as an appropriately coloured letter.
       It is decided which letter to encode each pixel as by using a text file supplied by the user.

NOTES
       This program assumes that 1 pixel should equal 1 character.
       But  characters  are  taller than they are wide, so you may want to resize the image first, else the output image will be taller than the original. Resizing is also advisable as letters are larger
       than pixels.
       Setting the output file to be "-", will direct the output to stdout; setting the text file to "-" will cause the program to read from stdin.
