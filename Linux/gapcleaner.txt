NAME
       gapcleaner - Find the most-parsimonious ordering of indels

SYNOPSIS
       gapcleaner <multi-FASTA or Stockholm alignment>

DESCRIPTION
       gapcleaner from FSA 1.15.9

       Find the most-parsimonious ordering of indels.  Finds the minimal chain decomposition of the POSET of the alignment; this corresponds to minimizing the number of gap-openings across the sequences.

       Input protein alignment must be in multi-FASTA or Stockholm format.
