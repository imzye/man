NAME
       downtimed - system downtime monitoring and reporting daemon

SYNOPSIS
       downtimed [-D] [-d datadir] [-F] [-f timefmt] [-l log] [-p pidfile] [-S] [-s sleep]
       downtimed -v

DESCRIPTION
       The  downtimed  daemon  waits  in  the  background,  frequently updating a time stamp file on the disk. If the daemon is killed with a signal associated with a normal system shutdown procedure, it
       records the shutdown time on the disk.

       When the daemon is restarted during the next boot process, it reports how long the system was down and whether it was properly shut down or crashed. The downtime report is output to the system log
       or to a specified log file. Also a record is appended to the downtime database.

OPTIONS
       -D     Do not create nor update the downtime database.

       -d datadir
              The directory where the time stamp files as well as the downtime database are located. The default directory is determined at compile time.

       -F     Do not call daemon(3) to fork(2) to background. Useful with modern system service managers such as systemd(8), launchd(8) and others.

       -f timefmt
              Specify the time and date format to use when reporting using strftime(3) syntax. The default is "%F %T".

       -l log Logging destination. If the argument contains a slash (/) it is interpreted to be a path name to a log file, which will be created if it does not exist already. Otherwise it is  interpreted
              as a syslog facility name. The default logging destination is "daemon" which means that the messages are written to syslog with the daemon facility code.

       -p pidfile
              The location of the file which keeps track of the process ID of the running daemon process. The system default location is determined at compile time. May be disabled by specifying "none".

       -S     Normally  fsync(2) is performed after each update of the time stamp. This option disables the fsync(2).  It reduces the load on the disk system but makes the downtime measurement less reli‐
              able.

       -s sleep
              Defines how long to sleep between each update of the on-disk time stamp file. More frequent updates result in more accurate downtime reporting in the case of a system crash.  Less  frequent
              updates  decrease  the  amount  of  disk  writes performed. The default is to sleep 15 seconds between each update. If you are using a flash memory based SSD or other disk which has limited
              amount of write cycles per block, it might be a good idea to set the sleep time to a higher value to prolong the lifetime of the storage device.

       -v     Display the program version number, copyright message and the default settings.

SIGNALS
       SIGHUP Close and re-open the output log. Use in case you want to rotate the log file.

       SIGTERM and SIGINT
              Terminate gracefully. These signals signify that a graceful system shutdown is in process.

EXIT STATUS
       The daemon exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
       The reporting accuracy in case of a system crash depends on how often the time stamp is updated.

       Finding out the system startup time is very operating system specific.  If the program does not have specific code to support your operating system, it assumes that the  system  started  when  the
       daemon started.

       Reporting is inaccurate if the system clock changes during system downtime or startup process. Daylight saving time changes have no effect as all calculations are done using UTC.
