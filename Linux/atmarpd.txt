NAME
       atmarpd - ATMARP demon

SYNOPSIS
       atmarpd [-b] [-d] [-D directory] [-l logfile] [-m] [-n]
       atmarpd -V

DESCRIPTION
       atmarpd  implements  the  ATMARP protocol as specified in RFC1577 and RFC1755. Address resolution requests are sent from the kernel (using a comparably simple protocol) to the ATMARP demon, which then
       performs the dialog with the network.

       atmarpd can operate as an ATMARP client and as an ATMARP server.  If also supports the concurrent use of several IP over ATM interfaces.

       atmarpd is configured from the command line using the atmarp program. Unless debugging is enabled, the ATMARP table is written after every change to the file /var/run/atmarpd.table (or to a file  with
       the same name in a different directory, if the -D option is used).

       Note that atmarpd disables support for SVCs if signaling is not available at start time, i.e. if atmsigd is not running.

OPTIONS
       -b     Run in background (i.e. in a forked child process) after initializing.

       -d     Enables (lots of) debugging output. By default, atmarpd is comparably quiet.

       -D dump_dir
              Changes the directory where atmarpd writes its table (atmarpd.table). By default, /var/run is used.

       -l logfile
              Write diagnostic messages to the specified file instead of to standard error. The special name syslog is used to send diagnostics to the system logger.

       -m     Enables  merging  of  incoming calls if the address is known.  An incoming connection on which no InARP reply has been received yet, but which originates from an ATM address for which an ATMARP
              entry already exists, is automatically added to that entry. This assumes that there is a 1:1 mapping between IP addresses and ATMARP addresses. By default, this assumption is  not  made,  which
              frequently  results  in  the  setup  of  duplicate  connections. Note that RFC1577 requires that an ATMARP server sends an InARP request on an incoming connection. Merging may therefore violate
              RFC1577 in this case.

       -n     Prints addresses in numeric format only, i.e. no address to name translation is attempted.

       -V     Prints the version number of atmarpd on standard output and exits.

FILES
       /var/run/atmarpd.table   ATMARP table
       /proc/atm/arp            table of currently active IP over ATM VCs

BUGS
       atmarpd removes ATMARP entries from the kernel table while refreshing them.
