NAME
       cdemu - a simple command-line CDEmu client

SYNOPSIS
       cdemu [options] <command> <command parameters>

DESCRIPTION
       This is cdemu, a command-line client for controlling CDEmu daemon. It is part of the cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux.

       It provides a way to perform the key tasks related to controlling the CDEmu daemon, such as loading and unloading devices, displaying devices' status and retrieving/setting devices' debug masks.

       When  connecting  to daemon, cdemu client can use either session or system bus. By hard-coded default, it uses system bus. The default bus to be used can be specified via /etc/cdemu-client.conf or
       ~/.cdemu-client file; for more information, please read README file. The default can be overridden using --bus option.

ENCRYPTED IMAGES SUPPORT
       CDEmu daemon offers support for encrypted images. When password is required to load an image, cdemu-client will prompt for it and then send it to daemon.

       NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE PASSWORD IS SENT OVER D-BUS IN A PLAIN STRING FORM, WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Displays the help message. If command is specified, help message with synopsis and description for that command is displayed.

       -v --version
              Prints version info and exits.

       -b --bus
              Sets the D-BUS bus type to use for connection. Valid values are session and system. If no bus is specified, the default bus is used.

COMMANDS
       load [parser-parameters] <device> <filename> [...]
              Loads the device; device is the number of the desired device, or any.  If any is used, then the client will attempt to load the image into the first empty device it finds (provided there is
              one available). filename is the image filename. For multi-file images, multiple filenames can be provided.

              The following optional parser parameters can be passed when trying to load the image (whether they are supported by a particular parser or not depends on the parser implementation):

              --encoding <string> Allows an encoding for text-based image format (such as CUE) to be specified. This might be needed if the image descriptor file contains non-ASCII  characters  and  does
              not use Unicode.

       create-blank [options] --writer_id=<writer-id> <device> <image_file>
              Creates  blank  recordable  disc  in  the specified device. device is the number of the desired device, or any. If any is used, then the client will attempt to load the image into the first
              empty device it finds (provided there is one available).  image_file is the image filename/basename. A valid writer-id must also be provided. Other valid options are:

              --medium-type <type> Sets the blank medium type. Valid values are: cdr74, cdr80, cdr90, cdr99 and dvd+r.

              --param="writer.parameter_id=parameter_value" Allows user to pass additional image writer parameters. parameter_id must be a valid parameter ID from image writer's parameter sheet, prefixed
              by "writer.".

       unload <device>
              Unloads the device; device is the number of the desired device, or all.

       status Displays devices' status

       add-device
              Creates another virtual device

       remove-device
              Removes the last virtual device

       device-mapping
              Displays device mapping information

       daemon-debug-mask <device> [new-value]
              Displays/sets daemon debug mask; device is the number of the desired device, or all. new-value is the new debug mask value. If this argument is omitted, current debug mask is displayed. The
              list of supported debug mask identifiers and values can be obtained with enum-daemon-debug-masks command. The new-value can be either a single numeric value (e.g, 0x03), a string of numeric
              values separated by pipe character (e.g., "0x01|0x02"), or a string of identifiers separated by pipe character (e.g., "DAEMON_DEBUG_DEVICE|DAEMON_DEBUG_MMC").

       library-debug-mask <device> [new-value]
              Displays/sets library debug mask; device is the number of the desired device, or all. new-value is the new debug mask value. If this argument is omitted, current debug  mask  is  displayed.
              The  list  of  supported debug mask identifiers and values can be obtained with enum-library-debug-masks command. The new-value can be either a single numeric value (e.g, 0x03), a string of
              numeric values separated by pipe character (e.g., "0x01|0x02"), or a string of identifiers separated by pipe character (e.g., "MIRAGE_DEBUG_PARSER|MIRAGE_DEBUG_DISC").

       dpm-emulation <device> [new-value]
              Displays/sets DPM emulation flag. device is the number of the desired device, or all. new-value is the new value to be set. If this argument is omitted, currently set value is displayed.

       tr-emulation <device> [new-value]
              Displays/sets transfer rate emulation flag. device is the number of the desired device, or all. new-value is the new value to be set.  If this argument is omitted, currently  set  value  is
              displayed.

       bad-sector-emulation <device> [new-value]
              Displays/sets  bad sector emulation flag. device is the number of the desired device, or all. new-value is the new value to be set.  If this argument is omitted, currently set value is dis‐
              played.

       dvd-report-css <device> [new-value]
              Report the loaded DVD as CSS-encrypted. device is the number of the desired device, or all. new-value is the new value to be set.  If this argument is omitted, currently set value  is  dis‐
              played.

              This  flag  influences the generation of fake Disc Structure 0x01, and as such works only with images of DVD videos that do not provide this information (most images, with exception of per‐
              haps mds/mdf, don't).  Enabling this option allows images of CSS-encrypted DVDs (e.g. created using 'dd' or 'readcd' without running through a CSS decryption step when creating  the  image)
              to be played by a deCSS-enabled Linux media player.

       device-id <device> [new-vendor-id] [new-product-id] [new-revision] [new-vendor-specific]
              Displays/sets device ID. device is the number of the desired device.  new-vendor-id is the new vendor ID string to be set (8 characters max).  new-product-id is the new product ID string to
              be  set (16 characters max).  new-revision is the new revision string to be set (4 characters max).  new-vendor-specific is the new vendor-specific string to be set (20 characters max).  If
              new values are omitted, currently set values are displayed.
