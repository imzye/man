NAME
     obfit — superimpose two molecules based on a pattern

SYNOPSIS
     obfit SMARTS-pattern fixed-file outfile

DESCRIPTION
     Superimpose two molecules using a quaternion fit. The atoms used to fit the two molecules are defined by the SMARTS pattern given by the user. It is useful to align congeneric series of molecules on a
     common structural scaffold for 3D-QSAR studies. It can also be useful for displaying the results of conformational generation.

     Any molecules matching the supplied SMARTS pattern will be rotated and translated to provide the smallest possible RMSD between the matching regions. If a molecule does not match the SMARTS pattern, it
     will be output with no transformation.

EXAMPLES
     Align all the molecules in 'testmv.sdf' on a single molecule of 'testref.sdf' by superimposing them on its N-methylpiperidyl portion (and outputting a new SD file to the standard output):

           obfit '[nh]1c2c(=O)n(C)c(=O)n(C)c2cc1' testref.sdf testmv.sdf
