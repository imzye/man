NAME
       libspiro - A clothoid to bezier spline converter

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spiroentrypoints.h> and then compile and link with -lspiro

DESCRIPTION
       Spiro library for curve design which simplifies drawing of beautiful curves.

       libspiro takes an array of spiro control points which can be easier for an artist to create and modify, and then converts these into a series of bezier splines which can then be used in the myriad
       of ways the world has come to use beziers.

       spiroentrypoints.h has technical information on how to connect with libspiro and further information and example code can be found at http://github.com/fontforge/libspiro

REPORTING PROBLEMS
       Before reporting a problem, please check the libspiro web site to verify that you have the latest version of libspiro

LIBSPIRO LICENSE
       libspiro originated from spiro code (in 2007) found in ppedit which is a pattern plate editor for Spiro splines.  ppedit was/is Copyright (C) 2007 Raph Levien. GNU GPL version 2 or higher.  ppedit
       was later relicensed also as Apache-2 MIT code in May of 2019.  This relicensing is fine since all ppedit was written by Raph Levien in 2007. Copyright allows for this.  Unfortunately, this re-li‐
       censing of ppedit has caused some confusion in assuming that this relicensing also applies to libspiro which is not valid and does not apply.

       libspiro  was  based on ppedit spiro code from 2007 (which was GNU GPL2 version 2 or higher) and built into a usable library at http://libspiro.sourceforge.net/ Copyright (C) 2007 George Williams.
       GNU GPL version 2 or higher.  This license also applies to the included Java files which have been forked into javascript and typeset files seen elsewhere.

       libspiro was later picked up in 2013 and continued with further development and improvements at http://github.com/fontforge/libspiro

       libspiro is now Copyright (C) 2013... as GNU GPL version 3 or higher.
