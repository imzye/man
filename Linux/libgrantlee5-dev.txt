NAME
       dh_grantlee - generate proper dependencies for grantlee plugins

SYNOPSIS
       dh_qmlcdeps [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_grantlee is a debhelper program that looks for *.so files of grantlee plugins, installed in /usr/lib/$DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/grantlee or /usr/lib/$DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/qt5/plugins/grantlee, under a
       subdirectory named "MAJOR.MINOR" (e.g. 5.2): in case any is found, a proper dependency "grantlee5-templates-MAJOR-MINOR" dependency is added to the ${grantlee:Depends} substitution variable.

       This is needed because Grantlee loads plugins for templates only in subdirectories named after its "MAJOR.MINOR" version.

       You can pass --with grantlee to dh(1) to make it automatically call dh_grantlee after dh_install, or add the "dh-sequence-grantlee" build dependency.
