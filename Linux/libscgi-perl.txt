NAME
       SCGI::Request - the part of the SCGI protocol that reads the environment

SYNOPISIS
         # $request got from SCGI
         $request->read_env;

         read $request->connection, my $body, $request->env->{CONTENT_LENGTH};

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the part of the SCGI protocol that reads the environment. All that remains after this is the content of the request. The protocol and this module guarantee that there will
       be a CONTENT_LENGTH for the body of the request in the environment.

   public methods
       read_env
           Read the environment in a blocking or non-blocking manner, per parameter to "SCGI-"new>. Returns true if it has finished.

       env Gets the environment for this request after it has been read. This will return undef until "read_env" or "sysread_env" has been called and returned true.

       connection
           Returns the open connection to the client.

       close
           Closes the connection.

       blocking
           Returns true if the connection is blocking.

       set_blocking
           If boolean argument is true turns on blocking, otherwise turns it off.

   private methods
       _new
           Creates a new SCGI::Request. This is used by SCGI in the "accept" method, so if you are considering using this, use that instead.

       _decode_env
           Takes the encoded environment as a string and sets the env ready for access with "env".

       _set_env
           Sets the environment for this request.

       _blocking_read_env
           Reads and decodes the environment in one go. Returns true on success, raises an exception on failiure.
