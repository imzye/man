NAME
       fprcp - Free Pascal windres preprocessor program.

SYNOPSIS
       fprcp -i file_name [-n] [-C] [-l PASCAL|C] [-p <include_path>]

DESCRIPTION
       fprcp  reads a .rc file and preprocesses it, writing the result to standard output as it goes along. It replaces defined constants with their values, so windres can process the resulting file and cre‐
       ate a resource.

USAGE
       fprcp needs as a minimum the -i filename option, which is the file to process.

OPTIONS
       fprcp has a small number of options to control its behaviour:

       -C     Define the symbol symbol before processing is started.

       -i file
              Specify the input file name. This argument is mandatory.

       -l language
              Set the programming language for include files. The language constant may be one of the following:

              C      The C programming language.

              PASCAL the Pascal programming language

       -n     Do not support nested comments. By default, pascal nested comments are enabled.

       -p path
              Set the include path. This may contain several files, separated by semicolons.
