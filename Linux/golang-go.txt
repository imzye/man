NAME
       go - tool for managing Go source code

DESCRIPTION
       An  import path (see go-importpath(1)) denotes a package stored in the local file system.  Certain import paths also describe how to obtain the source code for the package using a revision control
       system.

       A few common code hosting sites have special syntax:

       BitBucket (Mercurial)
              import "bitbucket.org/user/project"
              import "bitbucket.org/user/project/sub/directory"

       GitHub (Git)
              import "github.com/user/project"
              import "github.com/user/project/sub/directory"

       Google Code Project Hosting (Git, Mercurial, Subversion)
              import "code.google.com/p/project"
              import "code.google.com/p/project/sub/directory"

              import "code.google.com/p/project.subrepository"
              import "code.google.com/p/project.subrepository/sub/directory"

       Launchpad (Bazaar)

              import "launchpad.net/project"
              import "launchpad.net/project/series"
              import "launchpad.net/project/series/sub/directory"

              import "launchpad.net/~user/project/branch"
              import "launchpad.net/~user/project/branch/sub/directory"

       For code hosted on other servers, import paths may either be qualified with the version control type, or the go tool can dynamically fetch the import path over https/http and  discover  where  the
       code resides from a <meta> tag in the HTML.

       To declare the code location, an import path of the form

           repository.vcs/path

       specifies the given repository, with or without the .vcs suffix, using the named version control system, and then the path inside that repository.  The supported version control systems are:

       Bazaar
               .bzr

       Git
               .git

       Mercurial
               .hg

       Subversion
               .svn

       For example,

           import "example.org/user/foo.hg"

       denotes the root directory of the Mercurial repository at example.org/user/foo or foo.hg, and

           import "example.org/repo.git/foo/bar"

       denotes the foo/bar directory of the Git repository at example.com/repo or repo.git.

       When a version control system supports multiple protocols, each is tried in turn when downloading.  For example, a Git download tries git://, then https://, then http://.

       If  the  import  path  is not a known code hosting site and also lacks a version control qualifier, the go tool attempts to fetch the import over https/http and looks for a <meta> tag in the docu‐
       ment's HTML <head>.

       The meta tag has the form:

           <meta name="go-import" content="import-prefix vcs repo-root">

       The import-prefix is the import path corresponding to the repository root. It must be a prefix or an exact match of the package being fetched with "go get". If it's not  an  exact  match,  another
       http request is made at the prefix to verify the <meta> tags match.

       The vcs is one of "git", "hg", "svn", etc,

       The repo-root is the root of the version control system containing a scheme and not containing a .vcs qualifier.

       For example,

           import "example.org/pkg/foo"

       will result in the following request(s):

           https://example.org/pkg/foo?go-get=1 (preferred)
           http://example.org/pkg/foo?go-get=1  (fallback)

       If that page contains the meta tag

           <meta name="go-import" content="example.org git https://code.org/r/p/exproj">

       the go tool will verify that https://example.org/?go-get=1 contains the same meta tag and then git clone https://code.org/r/p/exproj into GOPATH/src/example.org.

       New downloaded packages are written to the first directory listed in the GOPATH environment variable (see go-path(1)).

       The go command attempts to download the version of the package appropriate for the Go release being used.  See go-install(1) for more.
