ARES_GET_SERVERS(3)                                                                       Library Functions Manual                                                                      ARES_GET_SERVERS(3)

NAME
       ares_get_servers, ares_get_servers_ports - Retrieve name servers from an initialized ares_channel (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ares.h>

       int ares_get_servers(const ares_channel_t *channel,
                            struct ares_addr_node **servers)

       int ares_get_servers_ports(const ares_channel_t *channel,
                                  struct ares_addr_port_node **servers)

DESCRIPTION
       The ares_get_servers(3) function retrieves name servers configuration from the channel data identified by channel, as a linked list of ares_addr_node structs storing a pointer to the first node at
       the address specified by servers.

       The ares_get_servers_ports(3) function also retrieves any per-server port information that may have been previously configured, returning a linked list of ares_addr_port structures.

       Function  caller may traverse the returned name server linked list, or may use it directly as suitable input for the ares_set_servers(3) / ares_set_servers_ports(3) functions, but shall not shrink
       or extend the list on its own.

       Each node of the name server linked list is stored in memory dynamically allocated  and  managed  by  c-ares.  It  is  the  caller's  responsibility  to  free  the  resulting  linked  list,  using
       ares_free_data(3) , once the caller does not need it any longer.

       This  function  is  capable  of handling IPv4 and IPv6 name server addresses simultaneously, rendering ares_save_options(3) with optmask ARES_OPT_SERVERS functionally obsolete except for IPv4-only
       name server usage.

RETURN VALUES
       This function may return any of the following values:

       ARES_SUCCESS   The name servers configuration was successfully retrieved

       ARES_ENOMEM    The memory was exhausted

       ARES_ENODATA   The channel data identified by channel was invalid.

SEE ALSO
       ares_set_servers(3), ares_init_options(3), ares_save_options(3)

AVAILABILITY
       ares_get_servers(3) was added in c-ares 1.7.1; ares_get_servers_ports(3) was added in c-ares 1.11.0.

NOTES
       As of c-ares 1.24, these functions are deprecated due to their lack of ability to store the entire server configuration.  Use ares_get_servers_csv(3).
