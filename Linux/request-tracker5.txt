NAME
       rt-clean-attributes - clean obsolete RT attributes

SYNOPSIS
            rt-clean-attributes
            rt-clean-attributes --older 1M

DESCRIPTION
       This script deletes obsolete "DeferredRecipients" attributes.

       "DeferredRecipients" attributes are used by rt-email-digest to store email to be sent at a later time, either daily or weekly. Since rt-email-digest processes transactions created at most one week
       in the past, it's safe to delete "DeferredRecipients" attributes older than one week since they will never be accessed.

OPTIONS
       "--older"
           Date interval in the "<NUM>[<unit>]" format. Default unit is D(ays), H(our), M(onth) and Y(ear) are also supported.

       "--verbose"
           Show additional output on the command line when running.
