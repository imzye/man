NAME
       wmagnify - magnify parts of the screen

SYNOPSIS
       wmagnify [options]

DESCRIPTION
       wmagnify is a tool which allows you to magnify parts of the screen. The main difference from xmag is that the image is refreshed automatically, following the cursor on the screen.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available:

       -display display
              Show the magnified area on this display.

       --help print a help message with the list of options.

       -m factor
              Change the magnification factor, default is 2. You can change this also while running the program, using the keys described below.

       -r delay
              Change the refresh delay, in milliseconds. Default is 200.

       -vdisplay display
              Take the area to be magnified from this display instead of using the same display as for visualisation.

       The following keys can be pressed while wmagnify is running to change its behaviour.

       1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
              Change the magnification factor.
