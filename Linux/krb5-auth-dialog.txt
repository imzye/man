NAME
       krb5-auth-dialog - Kerberos 5 credential checking

SYNOPSIS
       krb5-auth-dialog [--auto]

DESCRIPTION
       The  krb5-auth-dialog  application will periodically check (every 30 seconds) if the user has Kerberos credentials, and if so, if they will expire soon (in less than 30 minutes).  If it determines
       that this is the case, krb5-auth-dialog will attempt to obtain fresh credentials, prompting the user for whatever information is necessary.

ARGUMENTS
       --auto If this option is specified, rb5-auth-dialogwill start only if it finds that the user has Kerberos credentials. This may be used to ensure that only users who actually use Kerberos see  the
              program.  Note that in some settings, users may authenticate to Kerberos at a later time even if they do not have Kerberos credentials initially.

       Probably, but let's hope not.  If you find any, please file them in the bug database at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/krb5-auth-dialog/-/issues
