NAME
       pmvers - print out a module's version

DESCRIPTION
       Given one or more module names, show the version number if present.  If
       more than one argument is given, the name of the module will also be
       printed.  Not all modules define version numbers, however.

EXAMPLES
           $ pmvers CGI
           2.46

           $ pmvers IO::Socket Text::Parsewords
           IO::Socket: 1.25
           Text::ParseWords: 3.1

           $ oldperl -S pmvers CGI
           2.42

           $ filsperl -S pmvers CGI
           2.46

           $ pmvers Devel::Loaded
           pmvers: unknown version for module `Devel::Loaded'
