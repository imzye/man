NAME
       Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole - (DEPRECATED) Apply roles to action instances

VERSION
       version 0.17

SYNOPSIS
           package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;

           BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole' }

           sub bar : Local Does('Moo') { ... }

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows one to apply Moose::Roles to the "Catalyst::Action"s for different controller methods.

       For that a "Does" attribute is provided. That attribute takes an argument, that determines the role, which is going to be applied. If that argument is prefixed with "+", it is assumed to be the
       full name of the role. If it's prefixed with "~", the name of your application followed by "::ActionRole::" is prepended. If it isn't prefixed with "+" or "~", the role name will be searched for
       in @INC according to the rules for role prefix searching.

       It's possible to apply roles to all actions of a controller without specifying the "Does" keyword in every action definition:

           package MyApp::Controller::Bar

           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;

           BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole' }

           __PACKAGE__->config(
               action_roles => ['Foo', '~Bar'],
           );

           # Has Catalyst::ActionRole::Foo and MyApp::ActionRole::Bar applied.
           #
           # If MyApp::ActionRole::Foo exists and is loadable, it will take
           # precedence over Catalyst::ActionRole::Foo.
           #
           # If MyApp::ActionRole::Bar exists and is loadable, it will be loaded,
           # but even if it doesn't exist Catalyst::ActionRole::Bar will not be loaded.
           sub moo : Local { ... }

       Additionally, roles can be applied to selected actions without specifying "Does" using "action" in Catalyst::Controller and configured with "action_args" in Catalyst::Controller:

           package MyApp::Controller::Baz;

           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;

           BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole' }

           __PACKAGE__->config(
               action_roles => [qw( Foo )],
               action       => {
                   some_action    => { Does => [qw( ~Bar )] },
                   another_action => { Does => [qw( +MyActionRole::Baz )] },
               },
               action_args  => {
                   another_action => { customarg => 'arg1' },
               }
           );

           # has Catalyst::ActionRole::Foo and MyApp::ActionRole::Bar applied
           sub some_action : Local { ... }

           # has Catalyst::ActionRole::Foo and MyActionRole::Baz applied
           # and associated action class would get additional arguments passed
           sub another_action : Local { ... }

ATTRIBUTES
   _action_role_prefix
       This class attribute stores an array reference of role prefixes to search for role names in if they aren't prefixed with "+" or "~". It defaults to "[ 'Catalyst::ActionRole::' ]".  See "role
       prefix searching".

   _action_roles
       This attribute stores an array reference of role names that will be applied to every action of this controller. It can be set by passing a "action_roles" argument to the constructor. The same
       expansions as for "Does" will be performed.

METHODS
   gather_action_roles(\%action_args)
       Gathers the list of roles to apply to an action with the given %action_args.

DEPRECATION NOTICE
       As of version 5.90013, Catalyst has merged this functionality into the core Catalyst::Controller.  You should no longer use it for new development and we recommend switching to the core controller
       as soon as practical.

ROLE PREFIX SEARCHING
       Roles specified with no prefix are looked up under a set of role prefixes.  The first prefix is always "MyApp::ActionRole::" (with "MyApp" replaced as appropriate for your application); the
       following prefixes are taken from the "_action_role_prefix" attribute.
