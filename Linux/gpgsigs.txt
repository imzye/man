NAME
       gpgsigs - annotate list of GnuPG keys with already done signatures

SYNOPSIS
       gpgsigs [options] keyid[,keyid[,...]] keytxt [outfile]

DESCRIPTION
       gpgsigs was written to assist the user in signing keys during a keysigning party. It takes as input a file containing keys in "gpg --list-keys" format and prepends every line with a tag indicating if
       the user has already signed that uid. When the file contains "ALGO Checksum:" lines and placeholders ("__ __"), the checksum is inserted. ALGO can be set to the following algorithms: MD5 SHA1 SHA256
       or RIPEMD160.

OPTIONS
       -r  Call gpg --recv-keys before creating the output.

       -f charset
           Convert keytxt from charset. The default is ISO-8859-1.

       -t charset
           Convert UIDs to charset. The default is derived from LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and if all these are unset, the default is ISO-8859-1.

       --refresh
           Refresh the UID lists per key from gpg. Useful when UIDs were added or revoked since the input text was generated.

       --latex
           Generate LaTeX output, including photo IDs. Implies --refresh.  Note: This writes jpg files to the current directory.

       keyid
           Use this keyid (8 or 16 bytes, or full fingerprint) for annotation.  Multiple keyids can be separated by a comma (,).

       keytxt
           Read input from keytxt.

       outfile
           Write output to outfile. Default is stdout.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME
           The default home directory.

       GNUPGBIN
           The gpg binary.  Default: "gpg".

       GNUPGHOME
           The default working directory for gpg.  Default: "$HOME/.gnupg".

EXAMPLES
       The following key signing parties are using gpgsigs:

BUGS
       GnuPG is known to change its output format quite often. This version has been tested with gpg 1.4.18 and gpg 2.0.26. YMMV.
