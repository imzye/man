NAME
       love — 2D game development framework

SYNOPSIS
       love [--fused] game.love

       love --version

DESCRIPTION
       LÖVE was created to be a user-friendly engine in which simple (or complicated) games could be made without having extensive knowledge of system or graphics functions and without having to dedicate
       time towards developing the same engine features time and time again.

       Developed  with  cross-platform  implementation  in mind, it utilizes the latest open source libraries to deliver a similar game experience, independent of operating system.  By relying on the Lua
       scripting language for game-specific programming, it allows even the novice game creator to quickly and efficiently develop an idea into a fully working game.
