NAME
       scap-workbench - GUI tool for systems compliance evaluation

SYNOPSIS
       scap-workbench [--skip-valid] [XCCDF_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       SCAP Workbench is GUI tool for security compliance checking. Compliance can be described with SCAP standards - XCCDF and OVAL.

       This tool enables users to:
               * evaluate local and/or remote machines using SCAP content (scanning)
               * perform remediation on both local and remote machines (remediation)
               * adjust XCCDF scanning profiles (tailoring)

OPTIONS
       --skip-valid
              If this option is provided openscap validation will not be performed.  This is recommended only for advanced users and may cause OpenSCAP or SCAP Workbench to crash!

       XCCDF_FILE
              If this parameter is provided the scanner will immediately open given XCCDF or source datastream (SDS) file after it starts.
