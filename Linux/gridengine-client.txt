NAME
       qrdel - delete Grid Engine Advance Reservations (AR)

SYNTAX
       qrdel [-f] [-help] [-u wc_user_list] wc_ar_list

DESCRIPTION
       Qrdel  provides a means for a user/operator/manager to delete one or more Advance Reservations (AR) referenced by numeric id or name. A manager/operator can delete ARs belonging to any user, while
       regular users can only delete their own ARs.  If a manager wants to delete another user's AR, the manager can specify the AR id.  By default, "qrdel wc_ar_name" will delete only the ARs  belonging
       to  that  user. A manager is able to delete another user's AR via "-u wc_user_list".  Jobs referring to an AR tagged for deletion will also be removed.  Only if all jobs referring to an AR are re‐
       moved from the Grid Engine database will the AR also be removed.  Qrdel deletes ARs in the order in which the AR identifiers are presented. Find additional information concerning wc_user_list  and
       wc_ar_list in sge_types(5).

OPTIONS
       -f     Force  action.  The AR and the jobs using the AR are deleted from the Grid Engine queuing system even if the sge_execd(8) controlling the AR jobs does not respond to the delete request sent
              by the sge_qmaster(8).
              Users who have with neither Grid Engine manager nor operator status can only use the -f option for their own ARs.

       -help  Prints a list of all options.

       -u wc_user_list
              Deletes only those ARs which were submitted by users specified in the list of usernames.  For managers, it is possible to use qrdel -u "*" to delete all ARs for all users.  To delete a spe‐
              cific AR for a user, a manager has to specify the user and the AR id. If no AR is specified, all ARs belonging to that user are deleted.

       wc_ar_list
              A list of ARs that should be deleted (either numeric or names assigned with qrsub -N).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard configuration files.

       SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell qrdel uses (in the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. default.

       SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which debug information is generated is defined.

       SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which the sge_qmaster(8) is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most installations will  use  a  service  map  entry  for  the  service
                      "sge_qmaster" instead of defining the port.

FILES
       <sge_root>/<cell>/common/act_qmaster
