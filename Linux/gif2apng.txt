NAME
       gif2apng -  convert animated GIF to animated PNG files

SYNOPSIS
       gif2apng <INPUT *.gif> [<OUTPUT *.png>] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Progrmam converts animated GIF into animated PNG format. Wu64 quantization is used for true-color files. Transparency is handled either using a threshold, or composed over chosen background color.

       The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) file format is an extension to the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification. It allows for animated PNG files that work similarly to animated GIF
       files, while retaining backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files and adding support for 8-bit transparency and 24-bit images.

OPTIONS
       -kp Keep original palette from GIF and do not optimize it for PNG.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.

STANDARDS
