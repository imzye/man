Module::Install::ExtraTests(3pm)                                                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                    Module::Install::ExtraTests(3pm)

NAME
       Module::Install::ExtraTests - contextual tests that the harness can ignore

VERSION
       0.008

COMMANDS
       This plugin adds one Module::Install command:

   extra_tests
         extra_tests;

       This declares that the test files found in the directory ./xt should be run only in certain instances:

         ./xt/author  - run when the tests are being run in an author's working copy
         ./xt/smoke   - run when the dist is being smoked (AUTOMATED_TESTING=1)
         ./xt/release - run during "make disttest"

       These directories are recurisvely scanned for *.t files.  If any directories or files exist in ./xt that are not recognized, the Makefile.PL will die.

       Achtung!  This is pretty scary, experimental code, mostly because it relies on the pretty scary, non-experimental-but-seriously-sketchy underlying customization system for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  I
       may remove this warning when I've decided that this is stable enough, but until then:

AUTHOR TESTS
       "Is this being run by an author?" is determined internally by Module::Install, but at the time of the writing of this version it's determined by the existence of a directory called .author in
       ./inc.  (On VMS, it's _author.)  This directory is created when Module::Install's Makefile.PL is run in a directory where no ./inc directory exists.

BUGS
       Please report any bugs or feature requests through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org>. I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make
       changes.
