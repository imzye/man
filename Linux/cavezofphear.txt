SYNOPSIS
       phear [-e <level filename>] | [level name]

OPTIONS
       This program has several arguments:

       -e     Start editor instead of game on a specific level.

       level name
              Name of the level to play, f.ex 01

       level filename
              Filename of the level to edit. f.ex /usr/share/phear/data/levels/01

DESCRIPTION
       This is a boulder dash type of game, for terminals. You walk around in a ASCII underground cave system, where you need to keep clear of boulders falling down while you are digging through the dirt
       searching for diamonds.

       To play you have to know these keys:

       right -  move right

       left  -  move left

       up    -  move up

       down  -  move down

       b     -  place bomb

       t     -  detonate bombs

       q     -  leave game

       By picking up a diamond (*) you get 10 points, picking up money ($) gives you 100 points. You get one extra life for every 1000 points you score.

       Move around with the arrow keys or the 2-4-8-6 keys. Press 'k' to commit suicide if you should get stuck.

       Got the bombs (%)? Great! Press 'b' to place them, and 't' to detonate them all at once. Note that the bombs you place will act just like stones, affected by gravity, rolling, and so on..

       Watch out for monsters (M) -- if they catch you, you will die. To fight back, drop stones on them or blow them up using your bombs.

       Pressing 's' will enable/disable sound, 'w' will highlight your current position.

EDITOR
       The editor has its own keys you need to know:

       0-9   -  Keys 0-9 places objects

       s     -  Saves the map

       l     -  Enables lock-mode (lets you draw continuously using the arrow-keys)

       q     -  Quits the editor
