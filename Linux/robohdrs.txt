NAME
       robohdrs - insert ROBODoc headers to source code.

SYNOPSIS
       robohdrs [options] <source file>

DESCRIPTION
       robohdrs  inserts ROBODoc headers to source code files.  This program processes one source file at the time. Existing ROBODoc headers, if any, are not checked for. Beware since this may result in dou‐

       -p     Specify project name for source file header.

       -s     Include SOURCE item.

       -t     Specify version control tag to be included in the main header.

       -x     Specify path to ctags binary which is used.

EXAMPLES
       robohdrs -s -p myproj -i "MODIFICATION HISTORY" -i IDEAS test.c

       Specifies project name myproj and inserts extra items MODIFICATION HISTORY, IDEAS, and SOURCE to all template headers (excluding source file header).
