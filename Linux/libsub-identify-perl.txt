NAME
       Sub::Identify - Retrieve names of code references

SYNOPSIS
           use Sub::Identify ':all';
           my $subname = sub_name( $some_coderef );
           my $packagename = stash_name( $some_coderef );
           # or, to get all at once...
           my $fully_qualified_name = sub_fullname( $some_coderef );
           defined $subname
               and say "this coderef points to sub $subname in package $packagename";
           my ($file, $line) = get_code_location( $some_coderef );
           $file
               and say "this coderef is defined at line $line in file $file";
           is_sub_constant( $some_coderef )
               and say "this coderef points to a constant subroutine";

DESCRIPTION
       "Sub::Identify" allows you to retrieve the real name of code references.

       It provides six functions, all of them taking a code reference.

       "sub_name" returns the name of the code reference passed as an argument (or "__ANON__" if it's an anonymous code reference), "stash_name" returns its package, and "sub_fullname" returns the
       concatenation of the two.

       "get_code_info" returns a list of two elements, the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried by the speed.)

       In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the original name.

       "get_code_location" returns a two-element list containing the file name and the line number where the subroutine has been defined.

       "is_sub_constant" returns a boolean value indicating whether the subroutine is a constant or not.

   Pure-Perl version
       By default "Sub::Identify" tries to load an XS implementation of the "get_code_info", "get_code_location" and (on perl versions 5.16.0 and later) "is_sub_constant" functions, for speed; if that
       fails, or if the environment variable "PERL_SUB_IDENTIFY_PP" is defined to a true value, it will fall back to a pure perl implementation, that uses perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the
       "B" module.

SEE ALSO
       Sub::Util, part of the module distribution Scalar::List::Utils since version 1.40. Since this will be a core module starting with perl 5.22.0, it is encouraged to migrate to Sub::Util when
       possible.
