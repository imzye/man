NAME
       rmagic - Report Magic for Analog

SYNOPSIS
       rmagic

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the rmagic command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it
       has documentation in /usr/share/doc/rmagic; see below.

       rmagic is an add-on to Analog that turns statistics into nice graphics.
