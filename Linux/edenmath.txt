NAME
       EdenMath - scientific calculator for GNUstep

SYNOPSIS
       EdenMath

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the EdenMath command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have
       a manual page.

       EdenMath is a scientific calculator, providing standard 4-function arithmetic, probability, trigometric and algebraic functions.   EdenMath  works  like  any
       standard calculator with binary (+, -, *, /) and unary (!, %) operators.
