NAME
       ninvaders - ncurses version of space invaders

SYNOPSIS
       ninvaders

DESCRIPTION
       In  short,  this is a space invaders game written for the ncurses terminal control library.  It uses ASCII art to draw everything, and you can play it just about anywhere.  Space Invaders over di‐
       alup!

       To play the game, simply run the program.  You will be placed in the game arena with a large block of aliens.  To move your gun pod (at the bottom of the screen) use the left and right arrow keys.
       To shoot, press space.  You can move faster if you hold the arrow keys down.

       The object of the game is to shoot all the aliens (the multi-coloured moving things) before they reach the ground.  Since these aliens aren't friendly (which is why you're  trying  to  stop  them)
       they will shoot back.  Dodge the descending bullets or hang about under the large stationary blocks for cover.
