NAME
       nauty-nbrhoodg - extract neighbourhoods of vertices

SYNOPSIS
       nbrhoodg [-lq] [-c|-C] [-d#|d#:#] [-v#|-v#:#] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Extract neighbours of vertices of a graph.

              The output file has a header if and only if the input file does.  No isomorph reduction is done.

       -l     Canonically label outputs (default is same labelling as input)

       -C     Extract closed neighbourhoods instead.

       -c     Extract non-neighbourhoods instead.

       -d# -d#:# Only include vertices with original degree in the given range

       -v# -v#:# Only include vertices with these vertex numbers (first is 0).

              No empty graphs are output.  For digraphs, out-degree and out-neighbourhoods are used.

       -q     Suppress auxiliary information
