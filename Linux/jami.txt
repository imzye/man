NAME
       jami - Qt-based user interface for Jami

SYNOPSIS
       jami [options]

DESCRIPTION
       jami is a Qt-based client application (user interface) for Jami, an official GNU package for universal communication that respects the freedom and privacy of its users.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help on command line options and exit.

       --help-all
              Display help including Qt-specific command line options and exit.

       -v, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       --disable-web-security
              Don't enforce the same-origin policy.  This is currently used by jami by default to allow loading local resources in the chatview (for media and link preview, and emoji picker).

              This is a Qt WebEngine Chromium flag and is only applicable if jami was built with Qt WebEngine.

       --no-sandbox
              Disable the security sandbox for Qt WebEngine's renderer and plugin processes.

              This is a Qt WebEngine Chromium flag and is only applicable if jami was built with Qt WebEngine.

       --single-process
              Run Qt WebEngine's renderer and plugins in the same process as its browser, useful for getting stack traces for renderer crashes.  This is currently used by jami by default.

              This is a Qt WebEngine Chromium flag and is only applicable if jami was built with Qt WebEngine.

       --remote-debugging-port=<port_number>
              Local port to run the Qt WebEngine developer tools interface on, useful for inspecting and debugging web views.

              To access the Qt WebEngine developer tools after launching jami with this flag, open the address http://localhost:<port_number> in your web browser.

              This is a Qt WebEngine flag and is only applicable if jami was built with Qt WebEngine.

       -m, --minimized
              Start jami minimized.

       -d, --debug
              Enable debug mode for more verbose console output.

       -f, --file=<file>
              Write debug output to <file>.

       -t, --term
              Terminate all other currently running instances of jami.

       -q, --quiet
              Mute daemon logging, useful for debugging only the Qt-based client application (user interface).

              This is only applicable when debug mode is enabled.
