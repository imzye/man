       Please refer to the module source for detailed information about how every holiday is calculated. Too much detail would be far beyond the scope of this document, but it's not particularly hard
       once you've found the date for Easter.

USAGE
   OUTPUT FORMAT
       The list returned by holidays() consists of UNIX-Style timestamps in seconds since The Epoch. You may pass a strftime() style format string to get the dates in any format you desire:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(FORMAT=>"%d.%m.%Y");

       Here are a few examples to get you started:

         FORMAT=>"%d.%m.%Y"              25.12.2001
         FORMAT=>"%Y%m%d"                20011225
         FORMAT=>"%a, %B %d"             Tuesday, December 25

       Please consult the manual page of strftime() for a complete list of available format definitions.

       There is, however, one "proprietary" extension to the formats of strftime(): The format definition %# will print the internal abbreviation used for each holiday.

         FORMAT=>"%#:%d.%m"              wei1:25.12.

       As the module doesn't want to deal with i18n issues, you'll have to find your own way to translate the aliases into your local language. See the example/feiertage.pl script included in the
       distribution to get the idea. This was added in version 0.6.

   LOCAL HOLIDAYS
       The module also knows about different regulations throughout Germany.

       When calling holidays(), the resulting list by default contains the list of Germany-wide holidays.

       You can specify one ore more of the following federal states to get the list of holidays local to that state:

         bw  Baden-Wuerttemberg
         by  Freistaat Bayern
         be  Berlin
         bb  Brandenburg
         hb  Freie Hansestadt Bremen
         hh  Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg
         he  Hessen
         mv  Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
         ni  Niedersachsen
         nw  Nordrhein-Westfalen
         rp  Rheinland-Pfalz
         sl  Saarland
         sn  Freistaat Sachsen
         st  Sachsen-Anhalt
         sh  Schleswig-Holstein
         th  Freistaat Thueringen

       For example,

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(WHERE=>['by', 'bw']);

       returns the list of holidays local to Bayern or Baden-Wuerttemberg.

       To get the list of local holidays along with the default list of common German holidays, use the following:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(WHERE=>['common', 'bw']);

       returns the list of common German holidays merged with the list of holidays specific to Baden-Wuerttemberg.

       You can also request a list containing all holidays this module knows about:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(WHERE=>['all']);

       will return a list of all known holidays. This was added in version 0.6.

   ADDITIONAL HOLIDAYS
       There are a number of holidays that aren't really holidays, e.g. New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve. These aren't contained in the common set of holidays returned by the holidays() function. The
       aforementioned silv and heil are probably the most likely ones that you'll need. If you live in Koeln, you'll probably want to include romo and fadi, too. ;-)

       As if things weren't bad enough already, there even are Holidays that aren't valid in an entire state. This refers to fron, alhe and mari in particular.

       If you want one or several of them to appear in the output from holidays(), use the following:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(ADD=>['heil', 'silv']);

   SPECIFYING THE YEAR
       By default, holidays() returns the holidays for the current year. Specify a year as follows:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(YEAR=>2004);

   HOLIDAYS ON WEEKENDS
       By default, holidays() includes Holidays that occur on weekends in its listing.

       To disable this behaviour, set the WEEKENDS option to 0:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays(WEEKENDS=>0);

COMPLETE EXAMPLE
       Get all holidays for Germany and Bayern in 2004, count New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve as Holidays. Also, we live in a catholic region where Assumption day is a holiday, too. Exclude weekends and
       return the date list in human readable format:

         my $feiertage_ref = holidays( WHERE    => ['common', 'he'],
                                       FORMAT   => "%a, %d.%m.%Y",
                                       WEEKENDS => 0,
                                       YEAR     => 2004,
                                       ADD      => ['heil', 'silv', 'mari']);

PREREQUISITES
       Uses Date::Calc 5.0 for all calculations. Makes use of the POSIX and Time::Local modules from the standard Perl distribution.

BUGS & SUGGESTIONS
       If you run into a miscalculation, need some sort of feature or an additional holiday, or if you know of any new changes to our funky holiday situation, please drop the author a note.

       Patches are welcome. If you can, please fork the project on github to submit your change:

         http://github.com/mschmitt/Date-Holidays-DE

       Tag der Deutschen Einheit was moved from June 17th to October 3rd in 1990 and is therefore listed twice when calculating holidays for 1990. This is not a bug. Awareness for this was introduced in
       Version 1.1.

OFFICIAL HOLIDAY INFORMATION
       The German Federal Ministry of the Interior used to publish a comprehensive list of holiday dates. This does currently not appear to be the case.

LIMITATIONS
       Date::Calc works with year, month and day numbers exclusively. Even though this module uses Date::Calc for all calculations, it represents the calculated holidays as UNIX timestamps (seconds since
       The Epoch) to allow for more flexible formatting. On Perl versions earlier than 5.12.0 (released 2010), this limits the range of years to work on to the years from 1972 to 2037.

       Historic regulations for Buss- und Bettag are still not implemented.

       Date::Holidays::DE is not configurable. Holiday changes don't come over night and a new module release can be rolled out within a single day.
