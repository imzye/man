Debian::Package::HTML(3pm)                                                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                          Debian::Package::HTML(3pm)

NAME
       Debian::Package::HTML - Generates a webpage information (and Linda/Lintian checks) about a Debian binary or source package using HTML::Template

SYNOPSIS
         use strict;
         use Debian::Package::HTML;
         my $package = Debian::Package::HTML->new(%packageHash);
         $package->output(%contextHash);

REQUIRES
       HTML::Template

EXPORTS
       Nothing

DESCRIPTION
       This module outputs a webpage using HTML::Template templates which resumes the information of a normal build environment for a package in Debian (source files, binary packages and changelogs)
       using Linda/Lintian for sanity checks. It is useful for making unified presentation webpages for those packages which are being sponsorized by someone in Debian.

METHODS
   Constructor
       •   $object->new(%packageHash)

           Constructs  an  $object  with  all information concerning the package, including location for binary/source files, changelogs, diffs, pristine sources, as well as templates, charsets and other
           settings.

           Possible elements for the hash are:

           "binary", "control", "source", "diff", "changes", each one of them specifying one of the five possible files generated by a package building process in Debian.

           "control" is mandatory.

   Output
       •   $object->output(%contextHash)

           Does the actual XHTML output. Possible elements for the hash are:

           "briefing" (boolean): if TRUE, WebInfo will look for a briefing.html in the current directory, and will include the content in the resulting output. Useful for introducing commentaries without
           touching the final HTML. Defaults to FALSE.

           "charset": determines the output charset. Defaults to "ISO-8859-1".

           "resultTemplate": specifies the location of an HTML::Template style template for output. This is mandatory, and defaults to "result.tmpl"

           "pageStyle": specifies the location of a CSS file which might be included.

           "doChecks" (boolean): if TRUE, WebInfo will run linda and lintian over the control file and will generate a ${packageName}-checks.txt file which will be included in the final output.  Defaults
           to FALSE.

           "dump": determines where to put the resulting HTML output. Defaults to index.html

DIAGNOSTICS
   No DSC could be found/open
       You  need to specify a DSC control file using the "control" parameter for the new() method. If you don't, WebInfo can't do much. The package will inform if the file could not be FOUND or could not
       be OPEN.

       Please report the bugs, I'd love to work on them.

CUSTOMIZATION
   Template customization
       You can customize the final output using your own HTML::Template template file and specifying it as a parameter for the output() method. The  following  template  variable  names  are  honored  by
       WebInfo:

       packageName: the name of the package

       packageVersion: the version of the package

       maintainerName: the name of the maintainer

       maintainerMail: the e-mail address of the maintainer

       maintainerPlus: a "+" separated name/surname for the maintainer (useful for URL searching)

       pageCharset: the page charset (customizable in the output() method)

       pageStyle: the CSS file (customizable in the output() method)

       packagef: the available package files as an array reference, so HTML::Template should iterate over the "packagefile" variable.

       date: the date specified by the current locale

       doChecks: a boolean variable specifying if Linda/Lintian checks were made

       briefing: a boolean variable specifying if a briefing.html file should be included

EXAMPLES
   Only a control file
         #!/usr/bin/perl

         use strict;
         use warnings;

         use Debian::Package::HTML;

         my $package = Debian::Package::HTML->new( "control" => "falselogin.dsc" );
         $package->output ( "resultTemplate" => "result.tmpl", "dump" => "index.html" );

   A complete building environment
         #!/usr/bin/perl

         use strict;
         use warnings;

         use Debian::Package::HTML;

         my $package = Debian::Package::HTML->new("control" => "falselogin.dsc",
         "binary" => "falselogin.deb",
         "diff" => "falselogin.diff.gz",
         "source" => "falselogin.orig.tar.gz",
         "changes" => "falselogin.changes"
         ;

         $package -> output ( "resultTemplate" => "anotherTemplate.tmpl",
         "style" => "groovy-style.css",
         "charset" => "UTF-8",
         "doChecks" => "1",
         "dump" => "firstPackage.html"
         );

   Some ideas
       Well,  throw  the  files generated by your compilations (dpkg-buildpackage, i.e.)  in a /var/www/<my package> served by your webserver of choice and run a small program using Debian::Package::HTML
       and a nice CSS/Template. You will have a great webpage for all your Debian packages, really useful if you're not yet a Developer and need to handle several packages with your sponsors.
