NAME
       ufo2map - UFO: Alien Invasion map compiler

SYNOPSIS
       ufo2map <param1 <subparam1> <subparam2> <...>> <param2> <...> [map]

DESCRIPTION
       This is the UFO: AI map compiler.

OPTIONS
   General options:
       -h --help
              : print (this) help and exit

       -nice <prio>
              : priority level [unix nice level from -20 to 19 where 19 is the lowest priority]

       -nofootstep
              : don't generate a footstep file

       -tracefile
              : generate two csv files describing the floors and walls found by the trace functions

       -debugfile (TODO)
              : generate a trace debug file. The client can load the file to highlight map obstructions

       -stats --statistics
              : print statistics and quit. may be used with -check or -fix

       -v --verbosity <int>
              :  set  verbosity.  higher <int> gives more output if it is required, this should be the first option 0 - no stdout, 1 - only check/fix messages, 2  - (compile) only mapname 2 - (check/fix)
              mapname if findings, 4 - normal output, 5 - extra output, 6 - dump (a lot extra from BSPing)

       -V --version
              : return Version and Revision level

       -material
              : generate a material (.mat) file, do not proceed to compilation

   Lighting options:
       -extra : extra light samples

       -nolighting TYPE
              : don't perform the lighting calculations, where TYPE is one of day, night, all default is all

       -quant : lightquant - lightmap resolution downscale (e.g. 4 = 1 << 4) (values between 1 and 6)

       -scale : global light scale factor

       -saturation
              : saturation factor (e.g. 1.5 - default is 1.0)

       -contrast
              : contrast factor (e.g. 1.05, default is 1.0)

       -t --threads
              : thread amount

   Binary space partitioning (BSPing) options:
       -block <xl> <yl>
              :

       -blocks <xl> <yl> <xh> <yh>:

       -subdivide
              : subdivide brushes for better light effects (but higher polycount)

       -surface
              : surface light scaling (float value)

       -entity
              : entity light scaling (float value)

       -fulldetail
              : don't treat details (and trans surfaces) as details

       -info  : print bsp file info

       -micro <float>
              : warn if a brush has a volume lower than the specified float.  brushes are tested after CSG.

       -nobackclip
              : draw downward pointing faces. (so actors cannot see up through floors in first person view). default is to set SURF_NODRAW to downard faces.

       -nocsg :

       -gamedir
              : Add another game dir to the search directories

       -nodetail
              : skip detail brushes

       -nomerge
              : skip node face merging

       -noprune
              : don't prune (or cut) nodes

       -noshare
              :

       -notjunc
              :

       -nowater
              : skip water brushes in compilation

       -noweld
              :

       -onlyents
              : modify existing bsp file with entities from map file

       -exportlightmaps
              : write lightmaps into tga images

       -verboseentities
              : also be verbose about submodels (entities)

   Mapping options:
              These options operate on map file only. No bsp file is created.  Output prefixed by an asterisk (*) indicates operations that would change the map file.  -check                     :  check
              source map, only print information.  -fix                       : same subparameters as -check, changes the source map file.

              subparameters for -check and -fix

       all    : performs all checks and fixes. This is the default.

       bru brushes
              : includes 'lvl tex mfc mbr'. Performs all checks and fixes associated with brushes.

       ent entities
              : performs all checks and fixes associated with entities.

       con contained
              : checks for brushes contained entirely within other brushes. includes coincident duplicates.

       isc intersection
              : report intersection between optimisable brushes from worldspawn and func_group entities

              this is not included in all or bru as it is not always a bad thing

       mbr microbrush <float>
              : test for brushes smaller than <float> unit^3. this is done without the csg

              step, unlike the bsp -micro option. default 1 unit^3.

       lvl levelflags
              : if no levelflags for a brush or entity are set, all of them are set

       flv filllevelflags
              : ensure set levelflag bits are uninterrupted

       ndr nodraws
              : assigns SURF_NODRAW to hidden faces

       tex textures
              : warns when no texture or error texture is assigned.

              ensures special textures and content/surface flags are consistent.

       mfc mixedfacecontents
              : ensures the contentflags are the same on each face of each brush.

       zft zfighting
              : intersecting brushes with a common face: prevent textures shimmering together
