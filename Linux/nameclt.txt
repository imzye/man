NAME
       nameclt - Naming Service client

SYNOPSIS
       nameclt [-ior <object-reference>] [-advanced] <operation>

DESCRIPTION
       The nameclt command invokes operations on the Naming Service.  The allowed operations are:

              list <context-name>
                     lists contexts and objects bound in the context with the specified name.

              bind_new_context <context-name>
                     binds name to a new context, and returns the stringified context IOR.

              remove_context <context-name>
                     unbinds and destroys the named context, as long as it is empty.

              bind <object-name> <stringified-IOR>
                     binds name to object.

              unbind <object-name>
                     unbinds name and object.

              resolve <object-name>
                     returns stringified IOR bound to specified name.

OPTIONS
       -ior NameService-object-reference
              Use  the  given  stringified IOR as the "root" context of the naming service.  By default, nameclt uses the object reference returned by calling CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references("NameSer‐
              vice").

       -advanced
              Allow advanced operations.  These are operations which should not normally need to be used.  They may however be useful for testing the naming service and also for cleaning up in the event of a
              client messing up the namespace.  The operations are:

              bind_context <context-name> <stringified-IOR>
                     binds name to context.

              rebind <object-name> <stringified-IOR>
                     binds name to object even if binding already exists.

              rebind_context <context-name> <stringified-IOR>
                     binds name to context even if binding already exists.

              new_context
                     returns stringified IOR for a new context.

              destroy
                     destroys the naming context given with -ior flag.
