NAME
       drawxtl - display crystal structures on ordinary computer hardware

SYNOPSIS
       drawxtl [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       drawxtl reads a basic description of the crystal structure, which includes unit-cell parameters, space group, atomic coordinates, thermal parameters or a Fourier map, and outputs a geometry object
       that contains polyhedra, planes, lone-pair cones, spheres or ellipsoids, bonds, iso-surface Fourier contours and the unit-cell boundary.

       Four forms of graphics are produced:

       •   an OpenGL window for immediate viewing

       •   the Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer (POV-RAY) scene language for publication-quality drawings

       •   the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) for dissemination across the Internet

       •   Postscript rendering of the OpenGL window for those who want high-quality output but do not have POV-RAY installed

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options to use.

FILES
       ~/.drawxtlrc
              Per user configuration file.

       A short tutorial about this file and configuring drawxtl is available online at http://home.att.net/~larry.finger/drawxtl/configure.htm.

BUGS
       When opening a structures (.str) file, drawxtl needs write permissions in the directory the file is located in. Otherwise it will return an error ("Cannot open structures files.").
