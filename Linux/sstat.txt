NAME
       sstat - Display various status information of a running job/step.

SYNOPSIS
       sstat [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       Status information for running jobs invoked with Slurm.

       The  sstat  command  displays job status information for your analysis.  The sstat command displays information pertaining to CPU, Task, Node, Resident Set Size (RSS) and Virtual Memory (VM).  You can
       tailor the output with the use of the --fields= option to specify the fields to be shown.

       For the root user, the sstat command displays job status data for any job running on the system.

       For the non-root user, the sstat output is limited to the user's jobs.

       NOTE:  The sstat command requires that the jobacct_gather plugin be installed and operational.

       NOTE:  The sstat command is not supported on Cray ALPS.

       -a, --allsteps
              Print all steps for the given job(s) when no step is specified.

       -e, --helpformat
              Print a list of fields that can be specified with the '--format' option.

       -h, --help
              Displays a general help message.

       -i, --pidformat
              Predefined format to list the pids running for each job step.  (JobId,Nodes,Pids)

       -j, --jobs
              Format is <job(.step)>. Stat this job step or comma-separated list of job steps. This option is required.  The step portion will default to the lowest numbered (not  batch,  extern,  etc)  step
              running  if  not specified, unless the --allsteps flag is set where not specifying a step will result in all running steps to be displayed.  NOTE: A step id of 'batch' will display the informa‐
              tion about the batch step.  NOTE: A step id of 'extern' will display the information about the extern step.  This step is only available when using PrologFlags=contain

       -n, --noheader
              No heading will be added to the output. The default action is to display a header.

       --noconvert
              Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to 2G).

       -o, --format, --fields
              Comma separated list of fields.  (use '--helpformat' for a list of available fields).

              NOTE: When using the format option for listing various fields you can put a %NUMBER afterwards to specify how many characters should be printed.

              i.e. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name right justified.  A -30 will print 30 characters left justified.

       -p, --parsable
              output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end

       -P, --parsable2
              output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end

       --usage
              Display a command usage summary.

       -v, --verbose
              Primarily for debugging purposes, report the state of various variables during processing.

       -V, --version
              Print version.

PERFORMANCE
       Executing sstat sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from sstat or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmctld daemon come in at once,  it  can
       result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do  not  run  sstat or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to sstat to the minimum
       necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Some sstat options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.  (Note: Command line options will always override  these
       settings.)

       SLURM_CONF          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

EXAMPLES
       Display job step information for job 11 with the specified fields:

              $ sstat --format=AveCPU,AvePages,AveRSS,AveVMSize,JobID -j 11
              25:02.000  0K         1.37M      5.93M      9.0

       Display job step information for job 11 with the specified fields in a parsable format:

              $ sstat -p --format=AveCPU,AvePages,AveRSS,AveVMSize,JobID -j 11
              25:02.000|0K|1.37M|5.93M|9.0|
