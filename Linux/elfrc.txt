NAME
       elfrc — a resource compiler for ELF systems

SYNOPSIS
       elfrc [-o filename]  [-h filename]  [-v ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the elfrc command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       elfrc is a program which can turn arbitrary files into ELF object files which can then be linked into your program directly and accessed via simple, user-defined symbol names.

       For instance, it's possible to embed even huge (16MB+) files directly into the executable and then access the data in constant time without making the compiler or linker eat loads of memory.

OPTIONS
       Here's what the arguments do:

       -o filename
                 Store resulting ELF object in filename. If not given, no ELF object will be generated.

       -h filename
                 Store C header file which can be used to access the resource data in filename. If not given, no header file will be generated.

       -v        Be a little verbose about what's going on.

       In  any  case,  the  most important argument is resfile - the path to a resource file which can be parsed by elfrc. If no resource file is given, or if "-" (a dash) is given, the resources will be
       read from the standard input.

       A resource file is just a plain text file, each line in the file describing a resource to be compiled into the ELF output. Each line is expected to three fields, separated by tab  characters:  the
       type of the resource (can be either 'binary' or 'text'), the symbol name (this should be a valid C identifier) and the path to the file to be compiled in.
