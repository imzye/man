NAME
       ~/.postgresqlrc - Per-user PostgreSQL cluster configuration

DESCRIPTION
       The  file ~/.postgresqlrc configures the default PostgreSQL version/cluster and the default database for an user. If it is not present, the system-wide file /etc/postgresql-common/user_clusters is
       used instead.

FORMAT
       Comments are introduced by the character #.  Comments may follow data on a line; the first comment character terminates the data.  Leading whitespace and blank lines are ignored.

       The first uncommented, non-blank line is used, all following lines are ignored.

       Fields must be given in the following order, separated by white space:

       VERSION
              The major PostgreSQL version of the cluster to connect to.

       CLUSTER
              The name of a cluster to connect to. A remote cluster is specified with host:port. If port is empty, it defaults to 5432.

       DATABASE
              Within the cluster, the database to which the user will connect by default if he does not specify a database on the command line.  If this is *, the default database will be the  one  named
              by the user's login id.
