NAME
       hocon - manipulate HOCON files

SYNOPSIS
       hocon [options] {get,set,unset} PATH [VALUE]

DESCRIPTION
       The  hocon(1) command can be used to get and set values on HOCON files.  HOCON (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation) is a data format with the semantics of JSON, but more convenient as a human-
       editable config file format.

EXAMPLES
       hocon -i settings.conf -o new_settings.conf set some.nested.value 42

       hocon -f settings.conf set some.nested.value 42

       cat settings.conf | hocon get some.nested.value

COMMANDS

              Returns the value at the given path
