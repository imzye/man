NAME
       PCP::LogSummary - Perl interface for pmlogsummary(1)

SYNOPSIS
         use PCP::LogSummary;

         my $summary = new PCP::LogSummary($log, \@metrics, $start, $end);

DESCRIPTION
       The PCP::LogSummary module is a wrapper around the Performance Co-Pilot pmlogsummary(1) command.  Its primary purpose is to automate the production of post-processed pmlogsummary data, in
       particular to automate the step where the summarised data is imported into a spreadsheet for further anaylsis.  This has proven to often be an iterative process - done manually it involves much
       cutting+pasting, and can be a significant time waster.

   EXPORT
       new

       metric_instance

SEE ALSO
