NAME
     utempter_add_record, utempter_remove_added_record, utempter_remove_record, utempter_set_helper — utempter interface

SYNOPSIS
     #include <utempter.h>

     int
     utempter_add_record(int fd, const char *host);

     int
     utempter_remove_added_record(void);

     int
     utempter_remove_record(int fd);

     void
     utempter_set_helper(const char *pathname);

DESCRIPTION
     utempter_add_record() function adds a login record to the database for the TTY belonging to the pseudo-terminal master file descriptor fd, using the username corresponding with the real user ID of the
     calling process and the optional hostname host.  This function spawns a privileged process to perform the actual logging.

     utempter_remove_record() function marks the login session as being closed for the TTY belonging to the pseudo-terminal master file descriptor fd.  This function spawns a privileged process to perform
     the actual logging.

     utempter_remove_added_record() function has the same properties as the previously mentioned function, except that it uses an internally cached value of the file descriptor passed to the login functions.

     utempter_set_helper() function changes default helper path to the specified value.  The pointer passed to this function must remain valid all the time while utempter interface is in use.

RETURN VALUES
     On error, zero is returned.  On success, a non-zero value is returned.

NOTES
     During execution of the privileged process spawned by these functions, SIGCHLD signal handler will be temporarily set to the default action.
