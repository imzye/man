NAME
       Bit::Vector::Minimal - Object-oriented wrapper around vec()

SYNOPSIS
         use Bit::Vector::Minimal;
         my $vec = Bit::Vector->new(size => 8, width => 1, endianness => "little");
         # These are the defaults

         $vec->set(1); # $vec's internal vector now looks like "00000010"
         $vec->get(3); # 0

DESCRIPTION
       This is a much simplified, lightweight version of Bit::Vector, and wraps Perl's (sometimes confusing) "vec" function in an object-oriented abstraction.

METHODS
   new
       Creates a new bit vector. By default, this creates a one-byte vector with 8 one-bit "slots", with bit zero on the right of the bit pattern.  These settings can be changed by passing parameters to
       the constructor: "size" will alter the size in bits of the vector; "width" will alter the width of the slots. The module will die if "width" is not an integer divisor of "size". "endianness"
       controls whether the zeroth place is on the right or the left of the bit vector.

   set(POS[, VALUE])
       Sets the bit or slot at position "POS" to value "VALUE" or "all bits on" if "VALUE" is not given.

   get(POS)
       Returns the bit or slot at position "POS".

   display
       Display the vector. For debugging purposes.
