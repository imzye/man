NAME
       chemdiff - finding duplications and visual comparison of two files containing multiple structures

SYNOPSIS
       chemdiff

DESCRIPTION
       chemdiff  is  a  graphical  Indigo-based  utility for finding duplications and visual comparison of two files containing multiple structures. SDF, SMILES, CML, MOLFILE input formats are supported.
       Files can contains large amount of molecules.

       There are at least three use cases:

       •      compare 2 sets of molecules

       •      find duplicates in a single set of molecules

       •      test whether a specified molecule (or some set of molecules) belongs to another set of molecules
