QEMU-TRACE-STAP.1(1)                                      QEMU-TRACE-STAP.1(1)

NAME
       qemu-trace-stap - QEMU SystemTap trace tool

SYNOPSIS
       qemu-trace-stap GLOBAL-OPTIONS COMMAND COMMAND-OPTIONS ARGS...

DESCRIPTION
       The qemu-trace-stap program facilitates tracing of the execution of
       QEMU emulators using SystemTap.

       It is required to have the SystemTap runtime environment installed to
       use this program, since it is a wrapper around execution of the stap
       program.

OPTIONS
       The following global options may be used regardless of which command is
       executed:

       --verbose, -v
           Display verbose information about command execution.

       The following commands are valid:

       list BINARY PATTERN...
           List all the probe names provided by BINARY that match PATTERN.

           If BINARY is not an absolute path, it will be located by searching
           the directories listed in the $PATH environment variable.

           PATTERN is a plain string that is used to filter the results of
           this command. It may optionally contain a "*" wildcard to
           facilitate matching multiple probes without listing each one
           explicitly. Multiple PATTERN arguments may be given, causing
           listing of probes that match any of the listed names. If no PATTERN
           is given, the all possible probes will be listed.

           For example, to list all probes available in the qemu-system-x86_64
           binary:

                   $ qemu-trace-stap list qemu-system-x86_64

           To filter the list to only cover probes related to QEMU's
           cryptographic subsystem, in a binary outside $PATH

                   $ qemu-trace-stap list /opt/qemu/4.0.0/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 'qcrypto*'

       run OPTIONS BINARY PATTERN...
           Run a trace session, printing formatted output any time a process
           that is executing BINARY triggers a probe matching PATTERN.

           If BINARY is not an absolute path, it will be located by searching
           the directories listed in the $PATH environment variable.

           PATTERN is a plain string that matches a probe name shown by the
           list command. It may optionally contain a "*" wildcard to
           facilitate matching multiple probes without listing each one
           explicitly.  Multiple PATTERN arguments may be given, causing all
           matching probes to be monitored. At least one PATTERN is required,
           since stap is not capable of tracing all known QEMU probes
           concurrently without overflowing its trace buffer.

           Invocation of this command does not need to be synchronized with
           invocation of the QEMU process(es). It will match probes on all
           existing running processes and all future launched processes,
           unless told to only monitor a specific process.

           Valid command specific options are:

           --pid=PID, -p PID
               Restrict the tracing session so that it only triggers for the
               process identified by "PID".

           For example, to monitor all processes executing qemu-system-x86_64
           as found on $PATH, displaying all I/O related probes:

                   $ qemu-trace-stap run qemu-system-x86_64 'qio*'

           To monitor only the QEMU process with PID 1732

                   $ qemu-trace-stap run --pid=1732 qemu-system-x86_64 'qio*'

           To monitor QEMU processes running an alternative binary outside of
           $PATH, displaying verbose information about setup of the tracing
           environment:

                   $ qemu-trace-stap -v run /opt/qemu/4.0.0/qemu-system-x86_64 'qio*'
