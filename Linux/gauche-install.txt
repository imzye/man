NAME
       gauche-install - install files and set attributes

SYNOPSIS
         1)* gauche-install [OPTION...] FILE DEST
         2)* gauche-install [OPTION...] FILE... DIRECTORY
         3)* gauche-install -d [OPTION...] DIRECTORY...
         4)  gauche-install -T DIRECTORY [OPTION...] FILE...
         5)  gauche-install -U DIRECTORY [OPTION...] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       gauche-install is a program to install and remove files.  On
       installation it allows to set ownership and permissions.  This command
       is upward compatible with BSD install(1) and can be used as a drop-in
       replacement of it.   Notably, 1st, 2nd and 3rd command-line format
       above are compatible with BSD install.

       This command is provided mainly for Gauche's extension packages to have
       simpler installation and configuration process.   Being certain that
       gauche-install is available, those packages don't need to worry about
       subtle differences between various install(1) commands.

       The first format copies FILE on the file or in the directory named by
       DEST.  The second format copies FILE ...  into the directory DIRECTORY.

       The third format ensures DIRECTORY exists.  If it doesn't, the command
       creates the path to the DIRECTORY , including any intermediate ones.

       The fourth format installing FILE ...  to the DIRECTORY.  It is more
       convenient than the first and second formats in the following regards:

          * If the destination directory does not exist, it is created (with
          any intermediate paths as needed).

          * The list of files can be empty, so that when the list of installed
          files can be generated by configuration, you don't need to handle
          the empty case specially in Makefile.  (With BSD install format,
          empty file list yields an error.)

          * The directory prefix of files are preserved within the destination
          directory.  This is handy to install subtree of files.  For example,
          the following command installs '/usr/share/foo/main',
          '/usr/share/foo/conf/x' and '/usr/share/foo/conf/y' with a single
          command.

            gauche-install -T /usr/share/foo main conf/x conf/y

          Giving -p option suppresses this behavior and strips any directory
          prefix like the second format.  The following command line installs
          '/usr/share/foo/main', '/usr/share/foo/x' and '/usr/share/foo/y'.

            gauche-install -T /usr/share/foo -p main conf/x conf/y

       The fifth format removes FILE ...  in the DIRECTORY.  Irrelevant
       options are ignored, so it is handy to uninstall files just by chaning
       -T in the fourth format to -U.

OPTIONS
       -C, --canonical-suffix
           This is used specially to install Gauche's autogenerated Scheme
           source by experimental precompilation.  The generated file has a
           *.sci.  Upon installation, this command replaces the suffix for
           *.scm.

       -d, --directory
           Creates directories. (3rd format only).  It is only for the
           compatibility.  Using the -T option, the destination directories
           are created automatically if missing.

       -g, --group=GROUP
           Change group of the installed file.

       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

       -m, --mode=MODE
           Change mode of the installed file.

       -n, --dry-run
           Just prints what actions to be done.

       -o, --owner=OWNER
           Change owner of the installed file.

       -p, --strip-prefix=PREFIX
           Strip PREFIX directories from FILE(s) before installation. (4th/5th
           format only).

       --shebang=PATH
           Adds #!PATH before the file contents. Useful to install scripts.

       -S, --srcdir=directory
           Look for files within directory; useful if VPATH is used in
           Makefiles.

       -T, --target=directory
           Installs files to the directory, creating paths if needed.  Partial
           path of files are preserved unless -p option is given.  (4th format
           only)

       -U, --uninstall=directory
           Reverse of -T, e.g. removes files from its destination.  Other
           options (except -h and -n) are ignored.

       -v, --verbose
           Work verbosely.
