NAME
       poly-5d.x - manual page for poly-5d.x 2.11

SYNOPSIS
       poly-5d.x [-<Option-string>] [in-file [out-file]]

DESCRIPTION
       This is 'bin/poly-5d.x':  computing data of a polytope P

       Options (concatenate any number of them into <Option-string>): h  print this information f  use as filter g  general output:

              P reflexive: numbers of (dual) points/vertices, Hodge numbers P not reflexive: numbers of points, vertices, equations

       p   points  of  P  v   vertices  of  P  e  equations of P/vertices of P-dual m  pairing matrix between vertices and equations d  points of P-dual (only if P reflexive) a  all of the above except h,f l
       LG-`Hodge numbers' from single weight input r  ignore non-reflexive input D  dual polytope as input (ref only) n  do not complete polytope or calculate Hodge numbers i  incidence information s   check
       for span property (only if P from CWS) I  check for IP property S  number of symmetries T  upper triangular form N  normal form t  traced normal form computation V  IP simplices among vertices of P* P
       IP simplices among points of P* (with 1<=codim<=# when # is set) Z  lattice quotients for IP simplices #  #=1,2,3  fibers spanned by IP simplices with codim<=# ##  ##=11,22,33,(12,23):  all  (fibered)
       fibers with specified codim(s)

              when combined: ### = (##)#

       A   affine normal form B  Barycenter and lattice volume [# ... points at deg #] F  print all facets G  Gorenstein: divisible by I>1 L  like 'l' with Hodge data for twisted sectors U  simplicial facets
       in N-lattice U1 Fano (simplicial and unimodular facets in N-lattice) U5 5d fano from reflexive 4d projections (M lattice) C1 conifold CY (unimodular or square 2-faces) C2 conifold FANO (divisible by 2
       & basic 2 faces) E  symmetries related to Einstein-Kaehler Metrics

       Input:    degrees and weights `d1 w11 w12 ... d2 w21 w22 ...'
