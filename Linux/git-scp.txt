GIT-SCP(1)                        Git Extras                        GIT-SCP(1)

NAME
       git-scp - Copy files to SSH compatible git-remote

SYNOPSIS
       `git scp` -h|help|?
       `git scp` <remote> [<commits>...|<path>...]
       `git rscp` <remote> <path>

DESCRIPTION
       A  convenient  way  to  copy files from the current working tree to the
       working directory of a remote repository. If  a  <commits>...  is  pro‐
       vided,  only  files  that  has  changed within the commit range will be
       copied.

       Internally this script uses rsync and not scp as the name suggests.

       git-rscp - The reverse of git-scp. Copies specific files from the work‐
       ing directory of a remote repository to the current working directory.

OPTIONS
       <remote>

           The git remote where you want to copy your files.

       <commits>...

           Any commit, commit range or tree. Uses `git-diff`(1)

       <path>...

           The <paths> parameters, when given, are used to limit the diff to the named paths (you can give directory names and get diff for all files under them).

GIT CONFIGS
       To sanitize files using dos2unix before copying files

           $ git config --global --add extras.scp.sanitize dos2unix

       You  can  run  the  files through PHP lint (i.e. php -l) before copying
       files

           $ git config --global --add extras.scp.sanitize php_lint

EXAMPLES
       Make sure you have git-remote(1) setup

           $ git remote add staging myStagingServer:/var/www/html

       Copy unstaged files to remote. Useful when you want to make quick  test
       without making any commits

           $ git scp staging

       Copy staged and unstaged files to remote

           $ git scp staging HEAD

       Copy files that has been changed in the last commit, plus any staged or
       unstaged files to remote

           $ git scp staging HEAD~1

       Copy files that has been changed between now and a tag

           $ git scp staging v1.2.3

       Copy specific files

           $ git scp staging index.html .gitignore .htaccess

       Copy specific directory

           $ git scp staging js/vendor/

       Copy files from specific directory to multiple servers

           $ for dest in web1 web2 web3; do
               git diff --name-only 4.8.3 4.8.2 app/code/community app/design skin/ | xargs git scp $dest
