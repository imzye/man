NAME
       qrq - High speed Morse telegraphy trainer

SYNOPSIS
       qrq

       qrqscore [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       qrq is an open source Morse code trainer for various platforms and operating systems, similar to the classic DOS version of Rufz by DL4MM.

       It's  not  intended for learning telegraphy (have a look at http://radio.linux.org.au/ for CW learning software), but to improve the ability to copy callsigns at high speeds, as needed for example
       for contesting.

       After starting the software and setting up the parameters (speed, CW waveform...), the program sends 50 amateur radio callsigns. When entering a copied callsign  correctly,  the  speed  increases,
       otherwise it decreases. Points are awarded for correctly copied callsigns, depending on the speed.

       A  scoreboard/toplist  exists  on  the author's website, at https://fkurz.net/ham/qrqtop.php. The local toplist file can be synchronized with the online toplist with qrqscore -d and you can upload
       your own top scores by invoking qrqscore -u.

FILES
       qrqrc
              Default configuration file
       callbase.qcb
              Database of amateur radio callsigns used by qrq. Other files may be loaded.
       toplist
              Default toplist file

       qrq is looking for these files in the current directory, in ~/.qrq/ or in DESTDIR/share/qrq/ (in that order). In the latter case, ~/.qrq/ is created, for an user-specific  toplist  and  configura‐
       tion.
