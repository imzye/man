NAME
       discus - print a report of disk space usage

SYNOPSIS
       discus [options]

DESCRIPTION
       discus aims to make df(1) prettier. Features include color, bar graphs, and smart formatting of numbers (automatically choosing the most suitable size from kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or ter‐
       abytes). Or choose your own size, along with specifying the number of decimal places you'd like to see. You may also copy /etc/discusrc to $HOME/.discusrc and customize things to your preference.

       -t, -g, -m, -k
