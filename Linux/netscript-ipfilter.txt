NETSCRIPT.CONF(5)                                                                           File Formats Manual                                                                           NETSCRIPT.CONF(5)

NAME
       /etc/netscript/network.conf - firewalling configuration file.

       /etc/netscript/ipfilter.conf - IP iptables filtering shell script file

DESCRIPTION
       This manpage is a place holder until something better is written when the netscript itself has stopped changing rapidly.

       Please see the README file in the /etc/netscript directory, and READ the configuration files if you need to change them.  Apart from network.conf, all of them contain sh (1) shell script functions
       which  are there so that various things can be altered or hooked in at the right place. Network.conf contains the various firewall helper chain set up settings, as well as control of kernel packet
       forwarding for IPv4 and IPv6.
