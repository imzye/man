NAME
       yosys-filterlib - Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite Filterlib

SYNOPSIS
       yosys-filterlib [ rules-files [liberty-file]]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the yosys-filterlib command.

       yosys-filterlib is a program used to strip sensitive information from Liberty files.

       Occasionally  Liberty files contain trade secrets (such as sensitive timing information) that cannot be shared freely. This complicates processes such as reporting bugs in the tools involved. When the
       information in the Liberty file used by Yosys and ABC are not part of the sensitive information, this tool yosys-filterlib can be used to strip the sensitive information from the Liberty file.
