NAME
       x0vncserver - TigerVNC Server for X displays

SYNOPSIS
       x0vncserver [options]
       x0vncserver -version

DESCRIPTION
       x0vncserver  is a TigerVNC Server which makes any X display remotely accessible via VNC, TigerVNC or compatible viewers.  Unlike Xvnc(1), it does not create a virtual display.  Instead, it just shares
       an existing X server (typically, that one connected to the physical screen).

       XDamage will be used if the existing X server supports it. Otherwise x0vncserver will fall back to polling the screen for changes.

OPTIONS
       x0vncserver interprets the command line as a list of parameters with optional values.  Running x0vncserver -h will show a list of all valid parameters with  short  descriptions.   All  parameters  are
       optional, but normally you would have to use the PasswordFile parameter (see its description below).

       There are several forms of specifying parameters in the command line (here we use `SomeParameter' as an example parameter name):

       -SomeParameter
              Enable the parameter, turn the feature on.  This form can be used with parameters that simply enable or disable some feature.

       -SomeParameter=0
              Disable the parameter, turn the feature off.

       -SomeParameter=value
              Assign the specified value to the parameter.  The leading dash can be omitted, or it can be doubled if desired (like in GNU-style long options).

       Parameter names are case-insensitive, their order in the command line can be arbitrary.

PARAMETERS
       -display display
              The X display name.  If not specified, it defaults to the value of the DISPLAY environment variable.

       -rfbport port
              Specifies the TCP port on which x0vncserver listens for connections from viewers (the protocol used in VNC is called RFB - "remote framebuffer").  The default port is 5900.

       -UseIPv4
              Use IPv4 for incoming and outgoing connections. Default is on.

       -UseIPv6
              Use IPv6 for incoming and outgoing connections. Default is on.

       -rfbunixpath path
              Specifies the path of a Unix domain socket on which x0vncserver listens for connections from viewers, instead of listening on a TCP port.

       -rfbunixmode mode
              Specifies the mode of the Unix domain socket.  The default is 0600.

       -Log logname:dest:level
              Configures  the  debug log settings.  dest can currently be stderr, stdout or syslog, and level is between 0 and 100, 100 meaning most verbose output.  logname is usually * meaning all, but you
              can target a specific source file if you know the name of its "LogWriter".  Default is *:stderr:30.

       -HostsFile filename
              This parameter allows to specify a file name with IP access control rules.  The file should include one rule per line, and the rule format is one of the following: +address/prefix (accept  con‐
              nections  from  the specified address group), -address/prefix (reject connections) or ?address/prefix (query the local user).  The first rule matching the IP address determines the action to be
              performed.  Rules that include only an action sign (+, - or ?) will match any IP address.  Prefix is optional and is specified as a number of bits (e.g. /24).  Default is to accept  connections
              from any IP address.

       -SecurityTypes sec-types
              Specify  which  security  scheme  to  use for incoming connections.  Valid values are a comma separated list of None, VncAuth, Plain, TLSNone, TLSVnc, TLSPlain, X509None, X509Vnc and X509Plain.
              Default is VncAuth,TLSVnc.

       -rfbauth passwd-file, -PasswordFile passwd-file
              Password file for VNC authentication.  There is no default, you should specify the password file explicitly.  Password file should be  created  with  the  vncpasswd(1)  utility.   The  file  is
              accessed each time a connection comes in, so it can be changed on the fly.

       -Password password
              Obfuscated binary encoding of the password which clients must supply to access the server.  Using this parameter is insecure, use PasswordFile parameter instead.

       -PlainUsers user-list
              A comma separated list of user names that are allowed to authenticate via any of the "Plain" security types (Plain, TLSPlain, etc.). Specify * to allow any user to authenticate using this secu‐
              rity type. Default is to deny all users.

       -pam_service name, -PAMService name
              PAM service name to use when authentication users using any of the "Plain" security types. Default is vnc.

       -X509Cert path
              Path to a X509 certificate in PEM format to be used for all X509 based security types (X509None, X509Vnc, etc.).

       -X509Key path
              Private key counter part to the certificate given in X509Cert. Must also be in PEM format.

       -GnuTLSPriority priority
              GnuTLS priority string that controls the TLS session’s handshake algorithms.  See the GnuTLS manual for possible values. Default is NORMAL.

       -UseBlacklist
              Temporarily reject connections from a host if it repeatedly fails to authenticate. Default is on.

       -BlacklistThreshold count
              The number of unauthenticated connection attempts allowed from any individual host before that host is black-listed.  Default is 5.

       -BlacklistTimeout seconds
              The initial timeout applied when a host is first black-listed.  The host cannot re-attempt a connection until the timeout expires.  Default is 10.

       -QueryConnect
              Prompts the user of the desktop to explicitly accept or reject incoming connections. Default is off.

       -QueryConnectTimeout seconds
              Number of seconds to show the Accept Connection dialog before rejecting the connection.  Default is 10.

       -localhost
              Only allow connections from the same machine. Useful if you use SSH and want to stop non-SSH connections from any other hosts.

       -AlwaysShared
              Always treat incoming connections as shared, regardless of the client-specified setting. Default is off.

       -NeverShared
              Never treat incoming connections as shared, regardless of the client-specified setting. Default is off.

       -DisconnectClients
              Disconnect existing clients if an incoming connection is non-shared. Default is on. If DisconnectClients is false, then a new non-shared connection will be  refused  while  there  is  a  client
              active.  When combined with NeverShared this means only one client is allowed at a time.

       -AcceptKeyEvents
              Accept key press and release events from clients. Default is on.

       -AcceptPointerEvents
              Accept pointer press and release events from clients. Default is on.

       -AcceptSetDesktopSize
              Accept requests to resize the size of the desktop. Default is on.

       -RemapKeys mapping
              Sets  up a keyboard mapping.  mapping is a comma-separated string of character mappings, each of the form char->char, or char<>char, where char is a hexadecimal keysym. For example, to exchange
              the " and @ symbols you would specify the following:

                 RemapKeys=0x22<>0x40

       -RawKeyboard
              Send keyboard events straight through and avoid mapping them to the current keyboard layout. This effectively makes the keyboard behave according to the layout configured on the server  instead
              of the layout configured on the client. Default is off.

       -Protocol3.3
              Always use protocol version 3.3 for backwards compatibility with badly-behaved clients. Default is off.

       -Geometry geometry
              This option specifies the screen area that will be shown to VNC clients.  The format is widthxheight+xoffset+yoffset , where `+' signs can be replaced with `-' signs to specify offsets from the
              right and/or from the bottom of the screen.  Offsets are optional, +0+0 is assumed by default (top left corner).  If the argument is empty, full screen is shown to  VNC  clients  (this  is  the
              default).

       -MaxProcessorUsage percent
              Maximum percentage of CPU time to be consumed when polling the screen.  Default is 35.

       -PollingCycle milliseconds
              Milliseconds per one polling cycle.  Actual interval may be dynamically adjusted to satisfy MaxProcessorUsage setting.  Default is 30.

       -FrameRate fps
              The  maximum  number  of updates per second sent to each client. If the screen updates any faster then those changes will be aggregated and sent in a single update to the client. Note that this
              only controls the maximum rate and a client may get a lower rate when resources are limited. Default is 60.

       -CompareFB mode
              Perform pixel comparison on framebuffer to reduce unnecessary updates. Can be either 0 (off), 1 (always) or 2 (auto). Default is 2.

       -UseSHM
              Use MIT-SHM extension if available.  Using that extension accelerates reading the screen.  Default is on.

       -ZlibLevel level
              Zlib compression level for ZRLE encoding (it does not affect Tight encoding).  Acceptable values are between 0 and 9.  Default is to use the standard compression level provided by  the  zlib(3)
              compression library.

       -ImprovedHextile
              Use improved compression algorithm for Hextile encoding which achieves better compression ratios by the cost of using slightly more CPU time.  Default is on.

       -IdleTimeout seconds
              The number of seconds after which an idle VNC connection will be dropped.  Default is 0, which means that idle connections will never be dropped.

       -MaxDisconnectionTime seconds
              Terminate when no client has been connected for N seconds.  Default is 0.

       -MaxConnectionTime seconds
              Terminate when a client has been connected for N seconds.  Default is 0.

       -MaxIdleTime seconds
              Terminate after N seconds of user inactivity.  Default is 0.

       -ClientWaitTimeMillis time
              Time  in  milliseconds  to  wait for a viewer which is blocking the server. This is necessary because the server is single-threaded and sometimes blocks until the viewer has finished sending or
              receiving a message - note that this does not mean an update will be aborted after this time.  Default is 20000 (20 seconds).

       -AcceptCutText
       -SendCutText
       -MaxCutText
              Currently unused.
