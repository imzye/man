NAME
       paxtest — program to test buffer overflow protection

SYNOPSIS
       paxtest [kiddie|blackhat]  [logfile]

DESCRIPTION
       paxtest  is  a program that attempts to test kernel enforcements over memory usage. Some attacks benefit from kernels that do not impose limitations. For example, execution in some memory segments
       makes buffer overflows possible. It is used as a regression test suite for PaX, but might be useful to test other memory protection patches for the kernel.

       paxtest runs a set of programs that attempt to subvert memory usage. For example:

       Executable anonymous mapping             : Killed
       Executable bss                           : Killed
       Executable data                          : Killed
       Executable heap                          : Killed
       Executable stack                         : Killed
       Executable anonymous mapping (mprotect)  : Killed
       Executable bss (mprotect)                : Killed
       Executable data (mprotect)               : Killed
       Executable heap (mprotect)               : Killed
       Executable shared library bss (mprotect) : Killed
       Executable shared library data (mprotect): Killed
       Executable stack (mprotect)              : Killed
       Anonymous mapping randomisation test     : 16 bits (guessed)
       Heap randomisation test (ET_EXEC)        : 13 bits (guessed)
       Heap randomisation test (ET_DYN)         : 25 bits (guessed)
       Main executable randomisation (ET_EXEC)  : No randomisation
       Main executable randomisation (ET_DYN)   : 17 bits (guessed)
       Stack randomisation test (SEGMEXEC)      : 23 bits (guessed)
       Stack randomisation test (PAGEEXEC)      : 24 bits (guessed)
       Return to function (strcpy)              : Vulnerable
       Return to function (strcpy, RANDEXEC)    : Vulnerable
       Return to function (memcpy)              : Vulnerable
       Return to function (memcpy, RANDEXEC)    : Vulnerable
       Executable shared library bss            : Killed
       Executable shared library data           : Killed
       Writable text segments                   : Killed

       The ``Executable ...'' tests basically put an instruction in a place that is supposed to be data (i.e. malloced data, C variable, etc.)  and tries to execute it. The ``(mprotect)''  tests  try  to
       trick  the  kernel  in marking this piece of memory as executable first.  Return to function tests overwrite the return address on the stack, these are hard to prevent from inside the kernel.  The
       last test tries to overwrite memory which is marked as executable.

       A normal Linux kernel (unpatched to protect for buffer overflows) will show all tests as Vulnerable and no stack randomisation or 6 bits (due to stack colouring). In other words, on a normal Linux
       kernel you can execute any data inside a process's memory or overwrite any code at will.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

OPTIONS
       This program can take two options: the tests to run, which are indicated using either kiddie or blackhat       and (optionally) a file to which log all the test results. By default it will log  to
       the user's HOME directory in a paxtest.log file.
