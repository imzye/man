NAME
       check_rabbitmq_cluster - Nagios plugin using RabbitMQ management API to check how many node are alived in the cluster

SYNOPSIS
       check_rabbitmq_cluster [options] -H hostname

DESCRIPTION
       Use the management interface of RabbitMQ to check if a cluster partition has occured.

       It uses Monitoring::Plugin and accepts all standard Nagios options.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
           Display help text

       -v | --verbose
           Verbose output

       -t | --timeout
           Set a timeout for the check in seconds

       -H | --hostname | --host
           The host to connect to

       --port
           The port to connect to (default: 15672)

       --ssl
           Use SSL when connecting (default: false)

       --username | --user
           The user to connect as (default: guest)

       -p | --password
           The password for the user (default: guest)

EXAMPLES
       The defaults all work with a standard fresh install of RabbitMQ, and all that is needed is to specify the host to connect to:

           check_rabbitmq_cluster -H rabbit.example.com

       This returns a standard Nagios result:

           RABBITMQ_NODE OK - The cluster has 3 nodes

ERRORS
       The check tries to provide useful error messages on the status line for standard error conditions.

       Otherwise it returns the HTTP Error message returned by the management interface.

EXIT STATUS
       Returns zero if check is OK otherwise returns standard Nagios exit codes to signify WARNING, UNKNOWN or CRITICAL state.
