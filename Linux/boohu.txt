NAME
       boohu — coffee-break roguelike game

SYNOPSIS
       boohu [-c] [-n] [-o] [-s] [-v] [-x] [-r file]

DESCRIPTION
       Break  Out Of Hareka's Underground (Boohu) is a turn-based coffee-break roguelike game with a heavy focus on tactical positioning mechanisms.  This focus strongly influenced its weapon attack pat‐
       terns, consumables and terrain features.  Aiming for a replayable streamlined experience, the game avoids manual inventory management and complex character building, relying on  items  and  player
       adaptability for character progression.

       “Every  year, the elders send someone to collect medicinal simella plants in the Underground.  This year, the honor fell upon you, and so here you are.  According to the elders, deep in the Under‐
       ground, magical stairs will lead you back to your village.”

       The options are as follows:

       -c      Use a centered camera.

       -n      No animations.

       -o      Use 8-color palette.

       -r file
               Watch replay file file instead of launching a normal game.  If file is ‘_’, the last game replay is used.  The following key bindings are available: + and - for changing speed,  the  arrow
               keys for going to next or previous frame, space and p for pausing/resuming the video, and Q for exiting the program.

       -s      Use the 16-color solarized palette.

       -v      Print version number.

       -x      Use xterm 256-color palette (solarized approximation). This is the default.
