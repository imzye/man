NAME
       dave - DAV Explorer

SYNOPSIS
           dave [OPTIONS] URL

       E.g.

          $ dave -u pcollins -p mypass www.host.org/dav_dir/
          ...
          dave> get file.txt

       Use "dave -h" to get help on options.

       Use "perldoc dave" for the whole manpage.

DESCRIPTION
       dave is a powerful command-line program for interacting with WebDAV-enabled webservers. With dave you can:

       •   get and put files

       •   make directories on a remote webserver

       •   remove files and directories from a remote webserver

       •   edit a file on the webserver with a single command

       •   recursively get a remote directory

       •   recursively put a local directory

       •   lock and unlock remote files and directories

       •   securely transfer over https

       •   authenticate using the safer Digest authentication

       Dave is a part of the PerlDAV project (http://www.webdav.org/perldav/) and is built on top of the HTTP::DAV perl API.

       If you would like to script webdav interactions in Perl checkout the HTTP::DAV API as it's commands are the basis for dave's.

OPTIONS
       "-debug N"
           Sets the debug level to N. 0=none. 3=noisy.

       "-h"
           Prints basic help and options.

       "-man"
           Prints the full manual (equivalent to perldoc dave).

           You will need to use a pager like "more" or "less". e.g.

               dave -man |less

       "-p <password>"
           Sets the password to be used for the URL.  You must also supply a user. See "-u".

       "-u <username>"
           Sets the username to be used for the URL.  You must also supply a pass. See "-p".

       "-tmpdir /some/path"
           Create temporary files in "/some/path" instead of the default "/tmp".

COMMANDS
       cd URL
           changes directories

              dave> open host.org/dav_dir/
              dave> cd dir1
              dave> cd ../dir2

       cat URL
           shows the contents of a remote file

              dave> open host.org/dav_dir/
              dave> cat index.html

           Note: you cannot cat a directory (collection).

       cp
       copy SOURCE_URL DEST_URL
           copies one remote resource to another

             dave> open host.org/dav_dir/

           Create a copy of dir1/ as dav2/

             dave> cp dir1 dav2

           Create a copy of dir1/file.txt as dav2/file.txt

             dave> cd dir1
             dave> copy file.txt ../dav2

           Create a copy of file.txt as ../dav2/new_file.txt

             dave> copy file.txt dav2/new_file.txt

           Aliases: cp

       rmdir URL
       rm URL
       delete URL
           deletes a remote resource

              dave> open host.org/dav_dir/
              dave> delete index.html
              dave> rmdir ./dir1
              dave> delete /dav_dir/dir2/
              dave> delete /dav_dir/*.html

           This command recursively deletes directories. BE CAREFUL :)

           This command supported wildcards (globbing). See get.

           Aliases: rm, rmdir

       edit URL
           edits the contents of a remote file

              dave> open host.org/dav_dir/
              dave> edit index.html

           Edit is equivalent to the following sequence of commands:

              LOCK index.html (if allowed)
              GET index.html /tmp/dave.perldav.421341234124
              sh $EDITOR /tmp/dave.perldav.421341234124
              PUT index.html (if modified)
              UNLOCK index.html (if locked)

           Where $EDITOR is determined from the environment variables DAV_EDITOR or EDITOR.

           If DAV_EDITOR is set, it will use that, otherwise it will use EDITOR. If neither variables are set, then "vi" will be used.

           Notes:

           The lock only lasts for 10 hours.

           You cannot edit a directory (collection).

           The temporary save directory is editable by editing dave and changing TMP_DIR

       get URL [FILE]
           downloads the file or directory at URL

           If FILE is not specified it will be saved to your current working directory using the same name as the remote name.

             dave> open host.org/dav_dir/

           Recursively get remote my_dir/ to .

             dave> get my_dir/

           Recursively get remote my_dir/ to /tmp/my_dir/

             dave> get my_dir /tmp

           Get remote my_dir/index.html to /tmp/index.html

             dave> get /dav_dir/my_dir/index.html /tmp

           Get remote index.html to /tmp/index1.html

             dave> get index.html /tmp/index1.html

           Use globs and save to /tmp

             dave> get index* /tmp                   # Gets index*.html, index*.txt, etc.
             dave> get index*.html /tmp/index1.html  # Gets index*.html
             dave> get index[12].htm?                # Gets file1 and file2, .htm and .html

       ? [CMD]
       h [CMD]
       help [CMD]
           prints list of commands or help for CMD

             dave> ?

             dave> help get

           Aliases: ?, h

       lcd [DIR]
           changes local directory

             dave> lcd /tmp

       lls [DIR]
           lists local directory contents

             dave> lcd /tmp
             dave> lls
             dave> lls /home

           This command simply execs the local ls command and is equivalent to "!ls"

       dir [URL]
       ls [URL]
           lists remote directory contents or file props

             dave> ls
             Listing of http://host.org/dav_dir/
                             ./          Aug 29 02:26  <dir>

       lock [URL [TIMEOUT] [DEPTH]]
           locks a resource

           Without a URL you will lock the current remote collection.

           TIMEOUT can be any of the following formats:
                        30s          30 seconds from now
                        10m          ten minutes from now
                        1h           one hour from now
                        1d           tomorrow
                        3M           in three months
                        10y          in ten years time
                        2000-02-31 00:40:33
                        2000-02-31

           Default is an infinite timeout

           See perldoc "HTTP::DAV::Resource" for more information about timeouts.

           DEPTH can be either "0" or "infinity" (default)

           Seeting the lock Scope and Type is not currently implemented. Let me know if you need it as it shouldn't be too much effort.

       mkdir URL
       mkcol URL
           make a remote collection (directory)

             dave> open host.org/dav_dir/
             dave> mkcol new_dir
             dave> mkdir /dav_dir/new_dir

           Aliases: mkdir

       mv
       move SOURCE_URL DEST_URL
           moves a remote resource to another

             dave> open host.org/dav_dir/

           Move dir1/ to dav2/

             dave> move dir1 dav2

           Move file dir2/file.txt to ../file.txt

             dave> cd dir2
             dave> move file.txt ..

           Move file.txt to dav2/new_file.txt

             dave> move file.txt dav2/new_file.txt

           Aliases: mv

       open URL
           connects to the WebDAV-enabled server at URL

              dave> open host.org/dav_dir/

           Note that if authorization details are required you will be prompted for them.

           https and Digest authorization are not currently supported. Please let me know if you need it.

       options [URL]
           show the HTTP methods allowed for a URL

              dave> options index.html
              OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, DELETE, TRACE, PROPFIND,
              PROPPATCH, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK

           Note that Microsoft's IIS does not support LOCK on collections (directories). Nor does it support PROPPATCH.

       propfind [URL]
           show the properties of a resource

             dave> propfind test

           Using ls will get you the same printout if you ls a file. But ls'ing a collection will show you the collections contents.

       put FILE [URL]
           uploads a local file or directory to URL or the currently opened location.

           If URL is an existing collection then the dir/file will be copied INTO that collection.

             dave> open host.org/dav_dir/

           Recursively put local my_dir/ to host.org/dav_dir/my_dir/:

             dave> put my_dir/

           Put local index.html to host.org/dav_dir/index1.html:

             dave> put /tmp/index.html index1.html

           Put * to remote directory

             dave> put *

           Put index[12].htm? to remote directory /dav_dir (/dav_dir must exist)

             dave> put index[12].htm? /dav_dir

           Put index[1234].htm? to remote directory /dav_dir (/dav_dir must exist)

             dave> put index[1-4].htm? /dav_dir

           Glob types supported are, * (matches any characters), ? (matches any one character), [...] (matches any characters in the set ...).

       pwd prints the currently opened URL (working directory)

            dave> open host.org/dav_dir/
            dave> cd new_dir/
            dave> pwd
            http://host.org/dav_dir/new_dir/

       q
       bye
       quit
           exits dave

           Note that dave does not unlock any locks created during your session.

           Aliases: q, quit

       set URL PROPERTY VALUE [NAMESPACE]
           sets a custom property on a resource

              dave> set file.txt author "Patrick Collins"
              dave> set file.txt author "Patrick Collins" "mynamespace"

           The NAMESPACE by default is "DAV:".

       !
       sh  executes a local command (alias !)

              dave> sh cat localfile
              dave> !gzip localfile.gz
              dave> ! "cat localfile | less"

           Aliases: !

       showlocks
           show my locks on a resource

           Shows any locked resources that you've locked in this session.

           See "propfind" if you'd like to see anyone's locks held against a particular resource.

       steal [URL]
           remove ANY locks on a resource

           Useful if you accidentally forgot to unlock a resource from a previous session or if you think that somebody has forgotten to unlock a resource.

       unlock [URL]
           unlocks a resource

           Note that unlock will only unlock locks that you have created. Use steal if you want to forcefully unlock somebody else's lock.

       unset URL PROPERTY [NAMESPACE]
           unsets a property from a resource

              dave> unset file.txt author
              dave> unset file.txt author "mynamespace"

           The NAMESPACE by default is "DAV:".

GETTING HELP
       The perldav mailing list There is a mailing list for PerlDAV and dave for use by Developers and Users.  Please see http://mailman.webdav.org/mailman/listinfo/perldav

INSTALLATION
       dave is installed to /usr/local/bin by default when you install the PerlDAV library. See http://www.webdav.org/perldav/ for installation details of PerlDAV.

WHAT PLATFORMS WILL IT WORK ON?
       dave is pure perl so only needs Perl5.003 (or later) and the "PerlDAV" library to be installed.

       I have not ported dave to Windows but would like somebody to have a shot at it.

SEE ALSO
       The "PerlDAV" perl API at http://www.webdav.org/perldav/ or by typing "perldoc HTTP::DAV" on your command line.
