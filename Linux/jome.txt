NAME
       jome-ctl - control a jome server

SYNOPSIS
       jome-ctl SERVER-NAME [pick | quit]

DESCRIPTION
       jome-ctl controls the jome(1) server named SERVER-NAME.

       See the “Server mode” section and -s option of jome(1) to learn more.

       On Unix, jome-ctl reads from and writes to the socket file /tmp/SERVER-NAME.

       The two available commands are:

       pick (default)
           Show the window of the jome server SERVER-NAME to pick an emoji.

           If you accept an emoji, then jome closes its window and sends what it prints to the standard output to jome-ctl which prints it as is and exits with status 0.

           If you cancel (press Escape or Ctrl+C, or close the window), then jome-ctl doesn’t print anything and exits with status 1.

       quit
           Terminate the jome server SERVER-NAME, also removing the associated socket file.

EXIT STATUS
       0 when the jome server accepts an emoji or 1 otherwise.
