NAME
       tfprof - profile a Taskflow program

SYNOPSIS
       tfprof [options]

DESCRIPTION
       tfprof  is  a program that visualises and profiles programs compiled using Taskflow.  The program should be compiled using cmake with the option -D TF_BUILD_PROFILER=ON, and then run with an envi‐
       ronment variable specifying the profile data output file, for example under the build directory:

       $ cmake ../ -D TF_BUILD_PROFILER=ON
       $ make
       $ TF_ENABLE_PROFILER=my_taskflow.tfp ./my_taskflow

       The profiler is then run to visualise the output, for example

       $ tfprof --input my_taskflow.tfp

       and the results can be seen at http://localhost:8080/

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -i, --input
              The profiling data file; this option is required.

       -m, --mount
              The location of the static Taskflow profiler server files.  In the Debian version of tfprof, this is optional; it defaults to /usr/share/taskflow.

       -p, --port
              The port the server should listen on; this defaults to 8080.
