DESCRIPTION
       geninfo  converts  all GCOV coverage data files found in directory into
       tracefiles, which the genhtml tool can convert to HTML output.

       Unless the --output-filename option is specified,  geninfo  writes  its
       output to one file per .da file, the name of which is generated by sim‐
       ply appending ".info" to the respective .da file name.

       Note that the current user needs write access to both directory as well
       as to the original source code location. This is necessary because some
       temporary files have to be created there during the conversion process.

       Note also that geninfo is called from within lcov,  so  that  there  is
       usually no need to call it directly.

       Exclusion markers

       To  exclude specific lines of code from a tracefile, you can add exclu‐
       sion markers to the source code. Additionally you can exclude  specific
       branches from branch coverage without excluding the involved lines from
       line and function coverage. Exclusion markers are  keywords  which  can
       for  example  be  added in the form of a comment.  See lcovrc(5) how to
       override some of them.

       The following markers are recognized by geninfo:

       LCOV_EXCL_LINE
              Lines containing this marker will be excluded.
       LCOV_EXCL_START
              Marks the beginning of an excluded section. The current line  is
              part of this section.
       LCOV_EXCL_STOP
              Marks  the end of an excluded section. The current line not part
              of this section.
       LCOV_EXCL_BR_LINE
              Lines containing this marker will be excluded from branch cover‐
              age.
       LCOV_EXCL_BR_START
              Marks  the  beginning of a section which is excluded from branch
              coverage. The current line is part of this section.
       LCOV_EXCL_BR_STOP
              Marks the end of a section which is excluded from branch  cover‐
              age. The current line not part of this section.

OPTIONS
       -b directory
       --base-directory directory
              Use directory as base directory for relative paths.

              Use  this  option to specify the base directory of a build-envi‐
              ronment when geninfo produces error messages like:

                     ERROR: could not read source file /home/user/project/sub‐
                     dir1/subdir2/subdir1/subdir2/file.c

              In this example, use /home/user/project as base directory.

              This  option  is  required  when using geninfo on projects built
              with libtool or similar build environments that work with a base
              directory,  i.e.  environments, where the current working direc‐
              tory when invoking the compiler is not  the  same  directory  in
              which the source code file is located.

              Note that this option will not work in environments where multi‐
              ple base directories are used. In that  case  use  configuration
              file setting geninfo_auto_base=1 (see lcovrc(5)).

       --checksum
       --no-checksum
              Specify  whether  to  generate checksum data when writing trace‐
              files.

              Use --checksum to enable checksum generation or --no-checksum to
              disable it. Checksum generation is disabled by default.

              When  checksum  generation is enabled, a checksum will be gener‐
              ated for each source code line and stored along with the  cover‐
              age data. This checksum will be used to prevent attempts to com‐
              bine coverage data from different source code versions.

              If you don't work with different source code  versions,  disable
              this  option  to speed up coverage data processing and to reduce
              the size of tracefiles.

       --compat mode=value[,mode=value,...]
              Set compatibility mode.

              Use --compat to specify that geninfo should enable one  or  more
              compatibility  modes  when capturing coverage data. You can pro‐
              vide a comma-separated list of mode=value pairs to  specify  the
              values for multiple modes.

              Valid values are:

              on
                     Enable compatibility mode.
              off
                     Disable compatibility mode.
              auto
                     Apply  auto-detection  to determine if compatibility mode
                     is required. Note that auto-detection  is  not  available
                     for all compatibility modes.

              If no value is specified, 'on' is assumed as default value.

              Valid modes are:

              libtool
                     Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a
                     project that was built using the libtool  mechanism.  See
                     also --compat-libtool.

                     The default value for this setting is 'on'.

              hammer
                     Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a
                     project that was built using a version of  GCC  3.3  that
                     contains  a modification (hammer patch) of later GCC ver‐
                     sions. You can identify a modified GCC  3.3  by  checking
                     the  build  directory of your project for files ending in
                     the extension '.bbg'. Unmodified versions of GCC 3.3 name
                     these files '.bb'.

                     The default value for this setting is 'auto'.

              split_crc
                     Enable this mode if you are capturing coverage data for a
                     project that was built using a version of  GCC  4.6  that
                     contains  a  modification  (split  function checksums) of
                     later GCC versions. Typical error messages  when  running
                     geninfo  on  coverage  data produced by such GCC versions
                     are ´out of memory' and 'reached unexpected end of file'.

                     The default value for this setting is 'auto'

       --compat-libtool
       --no-compat-libtool
              Specify whether to enable libtool compatibility mode.

              Use --compat-libtool to enable  libtool  compatibility  mode  or
              --no-compat-libtool  to  disable  it.  The libtool compatibility
              mode is enabled by default.

              When libtool compatibility mode is enabled, geninfo will  assume
              that  the source code relating to a .da file located in a direc‐
              tory named ".libs" can be found in its parent directory.

              If you have directories named ".libs" in your build  environment
              but  don't  use libtool, disable this option to prevent problems
              when capturing coverage data.

       --config-file config-file
              Specify a configuration file to use.

              When this option is specified, neither the system-wide  configu‐
              ration  file  /etc/lcovrc,  nor  the per-user configuration file
              ~/.lcovrc is read.

              This option may be useful when there is a need  to  run  several
              instances  of  geninfo with different configuration file options
              in parallel.

       --derive-func-data
              Calculate function coverage data from line coverage data.

              Use this option to collect function coverage data, even  if  the
              version  of  the gcov tool installed on the test system does not
              provide this data. lcov will instead  derive  function  coverage
              data  from  line coverage data and information about which lines
              belong to a function.

       --exclude pattern
              Exclude source files matching pattern.

              Use this switch if you want to exclude coverage data for a  par‐
              ticular  set of source files matching any of the given patterns.
              Multiple patterns can be specified by using  multiple  --exclude
              command line switches. The patterns will be interpreted as shell
              wildcard patterns (note that they may need to be escaped accord‐
              ingly to prevent the shell from expanding them first).

              Can  be  combined  with  the --include command line switch. If a
              given file matches both the include pattern and the exclude pat‐
              tern, the exclude pattern will take precedence.

       --external
       --no-external
              Specify  whether  to  capture  coverage data for external source
              files.

              External source files are files which are not located in one  of
              the  directories  specified  by --directory or --base-directory.
              Use --external to include external source files while  capturing
              coverage data or --no-external to ignore this data.

              Data for external source files is included by default.

       -f
       --follow
              Follow links when searching .da files.

       --gcov-tool tool
              Specify the location of the gcov tool.

       -h
       --help
              Print a short help text, then exit.

       --include pattern
              Include source files matching pattern.

              Use  this switch if you want to include coverage data for only a
              particular set of source files matching any of  the  given  pat‐
              terns.  Multiple  patterns  can  be  specified by using multiple
              --include command line switches. The  patterns  will  be  inter‐
              preted as shell wildcard patterns (note that they may need to be
              escaped accordingly to prevent the  shell  from  expanding  them
              first).

       --ignore-errors errors
              Specify a list of errors after which to continue processing.

              Use  this  option  to  specify  a list of one or more classes of
              errors after which geninfo should continue processing instead of
              aborting.

              errors can be a comma-separated list of the following keywords:

              gcov: the gcov tool returned with a non-zero return code.

              source: the source code file for a data set could not be found.

       -i
       --initial
              Capture initial zero coverage data.

              Run  geninfo with this option on the directories containing .bb,
              .bbg or .gcno files before running any test case. The result  is
              a  "baseline" coverage data file that contains zero coverage for
              every instrumented line and function.  Combine  this  data  file
              (using  lcov  -a) with coverage data files captured after a test
              run to ensure that the percentage of total lines covered is cor‐
              rect  even when not all object code files were loaded during the
              test.

              Note: currently, the --initial option does not  generate  branch
              coverage information.

       --no-markers
              Use  this option if you want to get coverage data without regard
              to exclusion markers in the source code file.

       --no-recursion
              Use this option if you want to get coverage data for the  speci‐
              fied directory only without processing subdirectories.

       -o output-filename
       --output-filename output-filename
              Write all data to output-filename.

              If  you want to have all data written to a single file (for eas‐
              ier handling), use this option to specify the  respective  file‐
              name.  By  default,  one tracefile will be created for each pro‐
              cessed .da file.

       -q
       --quiet
              Do not print progress messages.

              Suppresses all informational progress output. When  this  switch
              is enabled, only error or warning messages are printed.

       --rc keyword=value
              Override a configuration directive.

              Use this option to specify a keyword=value statement which over‐
              rides the corresponding configuration statement  in  the  lcovrc
              configuration  file.  You can specify this option more than once
              to override multiple configuration  statements.   See  lcovrc(5)
              for a list of available keywords and their meaning.

       -t testname
       --test-name testname
              Use  test case name testname for resulting data. Valid test case
              names can consist of letters, decimal digits and the  underscore
              character ('_').

              This  proves  useful when data from several test cases is merged
              (i.e. by simply  concatenating  the  respective  tracefiles)  in
              which case a test name can be used to differentiate between data
              from each test case.

       -v
       --version
              Print version number, then exit.

FILES
       /etc/lcovrc
              The system-wide configuration file.

       ~/.lcovrc
              The per-user configuration file.

       Following is a quick description of the tracefile  format  as  used  by
       genhtml, geninfo and lcov.

       A tracefile is made up of several human-readable lines of text, divided
       into sections. If available, a tracefile begins with the testname which
       is stored in the following format:

         TN:<test name>

       For  each  source  file  referenced in the .da file, there is a section
       containing filename and coverage data:

         SF:<absolute path to the source file>

       Following is a list of line numbers for each function name found in the
       source file:

         FN:<line number of function start>,<function name>

       Next,  there  is a list of execution counts for each instrumented func‐
       tion:

         FNDA:<execution count>,<function name>

       This list is followed by two lines containing the number  of  functions
       found and hit:

         FNF:<number of functions found>
         FNH:<number of function hit>

       Branch coverage information is stored which one line per branch:

         BRDA:<line number>,<block number>,<branch number>,<taken>

       Block  number  and  branch  number are gcc internal IDs for the branch.
       Taken is either '-' if the basic block containing the branch was  never
       executed or a number indicating how often that branch was taken.

       Branch coverage summaries are stored in two lines:

         BRF:<number of branches found>
         BRH:<number of branches hit>

       Then  there  is  a  list of execution counts for each instrumented line
       (i.e. a line which resulted in executable code):

         DA:<line number>,<execution count>[,<checksum>]

       Note that there may be an optional checksum present  for  each  instru‐
       mented  line.  The  current  geninfo implementation uses an MD5 hash as
       checksumming algorithm.

       At the end of a section, there is a summary about how many  lines  were
       found and how many were actually instrumented:

         LH:<number of lines with a non-zero execution count>
         LF:<number of instrumented lines>

       Each sections ends with:

         end_of_record

       In  addition  to  the  main source code file there are sections for all
       #included files which also contain executable code.

       Note that the absolute path of a source file is generated by interpret‐
       ing  the  contents  of  the  respective .bb file (see gcov (1) for more
       information on this file type). Relative filenames  are  prefixed  with
       the directory in which the .bb file is found.

       Note  also that symbolic links to the .bb file will be resolved so that
       the actual file path is used instead  of  the  path  to  a  link.  This
       approach  is  necessary  for  the mechanism to work with the /proc/gcov
       files.
