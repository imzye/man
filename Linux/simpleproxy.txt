NAME
       simpleproxy - Simple tcp socket proxy

SYNOPSIS
       simpleproxy [-7] [-v] [-V] [-d] [-i] [-u] -P <POP3 users file> -L [<local host>:]<local port> -R <remote host>:<remote port> [-S <proxy host>:<proxy port>]

DESCRIPTION
       The simpleproxy program acts as a simple tcp proxy. It opens listening socket on local machine and forwards any connection to the remote host.

OPTIONS
       simpleproxy accepts following options:

       -V      Version information.

       -v      Makes simpleproxy to write activity information to syslog or stderr.

       -7      Makes simpleproxy to strip 8th bit.

       -i      Use this flag when starting simpleproxy from INETD.

       -d      By default simpleproxy does not detach itself from control terminal and writes all messages to stderr. This option will detach it from terminal and make it write messages to  syslog.

       -L [<local host>:]<local port>
               Local host and port name or number to bind for listening. Host name is optional.

       -R <remote host>:<remote port>
               Remote host and port name or number

       -P <POP3 users list>
               If specified, simpleproxy will load list of users from the <filename> (one per line). After this it will be forwarding POP3 sessions only if client trying to authenificate as this user.

       -S <proxy host>:<proxy port>
               HTTPS proxy server host and port name or number.

       -a <HTTPS Auth User>:<HTTPS Auth Password>
               Authenticate to the HTTPS proxy server with the given userid and password.  This option performs BASIC HTTP authentication as specified in RFC 2617.  Used only in conjunction with -S.

       -A <HTTP Auth User>:<HTTP Auth Password>
               Requires HTTP proxy authentication.  Client browser must supply username and password to use this proxy.  This option performs BASIC HTTP authentication as specified in RFC 2617.

       -u      URLs of visited pages are emitted on stdout.  It is used for logging or for remote lecturing, if the output is redirected to a remote command that change a dynamic web page, it is possible
               to synchronize all the learner web browsers to the same page visited by the instructor.  (see the "simple remote lecturing" project on sourceforge).

       -t <trace file>
               If specified, simpleproxy will dump all data that passes through connection to the specified file.

BUGS
       Only tcp ports are supported.
