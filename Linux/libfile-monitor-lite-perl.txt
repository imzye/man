File::Monitor::Lite(3pm)                                                            User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                            File::Monitor::Lite(3pm)

NAME
       File::Monitor::Lite - Monitor file changes

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Monitor::Lite;

         my $monitor = File::Monitor::Lite->new (
             in => '.',
             name => '*.html',
         );

         while ($monitor->check() and sleep 1){
             my @deleted_files = $monitor->deleted;
             my @modified_files = $monitor->modified;
             my @created_files = $monitor->created;
             my @observing_files = $monitor->observed;
             `do blah..` if $monitor->anychange;
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This is another implementation of File::Monitor. While File::Monitor cannot detect file creation (unless you declare file name first), I use File::Find::Rule to rescan files every time when
       $monitor->check() is executed. To use this module, just follow synopsis above.

       Currently one cannot change file observing rules. To do so, create another monitor object with new rules.

           $m1=File::Monitor::Lite->new(
               name => '*.html',
               in => '.',
           );
           $m1->check();
           #blah...
           $m2=File::Monitor::Lite->new(
               name => '*.css',
               in => '.',
           );
           $m2->check();
           #blah...

INTERFACE
       " new ( args ) "
           Create a new "File::Monitor::Lite" object.

               my $monitor = File::Monitor::Lite->new(
                   in => '.',
                   name => '*.mp3',
               );

           The syntax is inherited from File::Find::Rule. It will applied on File::Find::Rule as

               File::Find::Rule
                   ->file()
                   ->name('*.mp3')
                   ->in('.');

           As described in File::Find::Rule, name can be globs or regular expressions.

               name => '*.pm',                     # a simple glob
               name => qr/.+\.pm$/,                # regex
               name => ['*.mp3', qr/.+\.ogg$/],    # array of rules
               name => @rules,

       " check() "
           Check if any file recognized by File::Find::Rule has changed (created, modified, deleted.) The usage is simple:

               $monitor->check();

       " created "
           Returns an array of file names which has been created since last check.

       " modified "
           Returns an array of file names which has been modified since last check.

       " deleted "
           Returns an array of file names which has been deleted since last check.

       " observed "
           Returns an array of file names which monitor is observing at.
