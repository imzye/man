NAME
       eu-srcfiles - Lists the source files of a DWARF/ELF file.

SYNOPSIS
       eu-srcfiles [-0|--null] [-c|--cu-only] [-v|--verbose] [-z|--zip] INPUT

DESCRIPTION
       eu-srcfiles  lists all the source files of a given DWARF/ELF file.  This list is based on a search of the DWARF debuginfo, which may be automatically fetched by debuginfod if applicable.  The tar‐
       get file may be an executable, a coredump, a process, or even the running kernel.  The default input is the file 'a.out'.  The source file names are made unique by prepending the  full  path  name
       and then printed to standard output. The source files can be placed in a zip file that is sent to stdout.

       Note that all occurrences of '/./' and '/../' in the path name are canonicalized.

INPUT OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.

       --core=COREFILE
              Find addresses from signatures found in COREFILE.

       --debuginfo-path=PATH
              Search path for separate debuginfo files.

       -e FILE, --executable=FILE
              Find addresses in FILE.

       -k, --kernel
              Find addresses in the running kernel.

       -K, --offline-kernel[=RELEASE]
              Kernel with all modules.

       -M FILE, --linux-process-map=FILE
              Find addresses in files mapped as read from FILE in Linux /proc/PID/maps format.

       -p PID, --pid=PID
              Find addresses in files mapped into process PID.

       -?, --help
              Give this help list.

       --usage
              Give a short usage message.

       -V, --version
              Print program version.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
       -0, --null
              Separate items by a null instead of a newline.

       -b, --no-backup
              Disables local source file search when debuginfod fails to fetch files.  This option is only applicable when fetching and zipping files.

       -c, --cu-only
              Only list the CU (compilation unit) names.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase verbosity of logging messages.

       -z, --zip
              Zip all the source files and send to stdout.  By default, files will be automatically fetched by debuginfod (if applicable) or locally as a backup. Any source files that were not found will
              not be archived.

EXAMPLES
       List all source files for a binary.
       eu-srcfiles -e /bin/ls

       List all compilation units (CU) names for a given process (including shared libraries).
       eu-srcfiles -c -p $$

       List source files of a binary based on its buildid, using debuginfod.
       binary=`debuginfod-find executable 9c22d8d9e42bd051ffdc1064fdfd456ba781c629`
       eu-srcfiles -c -e $binary

       Show the source code of the first CU of a shared library.
       binary=/usr/lib64/libc.so.6
       srcfile=`eu-srcfiles -c -e $binary | head -1`
       cat `debuginfod-find source $binary $srcfile`

       List the source files of a kernel image.
       eu-srcfiles -e /boot/vmlinuz-`uname -r`

       Zip all the source files for a binary.
       eu-srcfiles -z -e /bin/ls > ls.zip
