NAME
       pfsrotate - Rotate images 90 degrees.

SYNOPSIS
       pfsrotate [--r] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  command to rotate images from a stream of pfs. This command is useful for output on hardcopy devices with aspect ratios opposite to the input image.  By default, the image is rotated clock‐
       wise. The --r option may be used to rotate the image counter-clockwise instead.

OPTIONS
       --r, -r

              Rotate the image counter-clockwise instead of clockwise.

EXAMPLES
       pfsin memorial.hdr | pfsrotate -r | pfsout memorial_gc.hdr

              Rotate memorial image 90 degrees counter-clockwise and save to memorial_gc.hdr.

NOTES
       To rotate an image 180 degrees, use pfsflip(1) with both the --h and --v options specified.
