NAME
       Net::NBName::NodeStatus - NetBIOS Node Status Response

       Net::NBName::NodeStatus represents a decoded NetBIOS node status response.

METHODS
       $ns->names
           Returns a list of NetBIOS names registered on the responding host. These are returned as a list of "Net::NBName::NodeStatus::RR" objects.
