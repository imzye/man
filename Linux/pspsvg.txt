NAME
       pspsvg - convert PaintShop Pro® gradients (jgd, PspGradient) to the SVG
       format.

SYNOPSIS
       pspsvg [-g geometry] [-h] [-o file] [-p] [-v] [-V] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The pspsvg utility converts the gradient files used by PaintShop Pro
       (which usually have the extension jgd or PspGradient) to the Scalar
       Vector Graphics (SVG) format.

       The program will read from stdin if a file is not specified as the
       final argument, and write to stdout if the -o option is not specified.

       The output is formatted for machines to read, rather than humans. A
       post-processor such as tidy(1) could be used in the latter case.

OPTIONS
       --backtrace-file path
           Specify a file to which to write a formatted backtrace. The file
           will only be created if there is a backtrace created, typically
           when an error occurs.

       --backtrace-format format
           Specify the format of the backtrace written to the files specified
           by --backtrace-file, one of plain, xml or json.

       -g, --geometry widthxheight
           Specify the size of the SVG preview in pixels.

       -h, --help
           Brief help.

       -o, --output file
           Write the output to file, rather than stdout.

       -p, --preview
           Include a preview in the SVG output. See also the --geometry
           option.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose operation.

       -V, --version
           Version information.

EXAMPLES
       Create a machine-readable SVG file:

           pspsvg -v -o new.svg old.jgd

       Create a human-readable SVG file:

           pspsvg old.jgd | tidy -xml -indent -o new.svg

NOTES
       The author could find no public documentation for the PaintShop Pro
       gradient file format and so reverse-engineered it for the first version
       of this program. An improved analysis of the format by Olivier
       Berten[1] was used for the present version.

       The PaintShop Pro format can be read by Photoshop, but Photoshop's
       native (grd) gradient format cannot be read by this program. To convert
       Photoshop gradients, see the pssvg(1) documentation.
