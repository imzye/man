NAME
       amadmin - administrative interface to control Amanda backups

SYNOPSIS
       amadmin [--version] [--no-default] [--print-source] [--exact-match]
               [-o configoption...] config command [command_options...]

DESCRIPTION
       Amadmin performs various administrative tasks on the config Amanda
       configuration.

       See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Print the version and exit.

       --no-default
           Do not print default values for config and disklist commands.

       --print-source
           Print where a value is defined for config and disklist commands.

       --exact-match
           The host and disk are parsed as exact values

COMMANDS
       Commands that take a hostname [ disks ] parameter pair operate on all
       disks in the disklist(5) for that hostname if no disks are specified.
       Where hostname is also marked as being optional, the command operates
       on all hosts and disks in the disklist(5) when no hostname is given.
       Both hostname and disks are match expressions; see amanda-match(7) for
       a description.

       version
           Show the current version and some compile time and runtime
           parameters. The config parameter must be present but is ignored.

       estimate [ hostname [ disks ]* ]*
           Print the server estimate for the dles, each output lines have the
           following format:
             hostname diskname level size

           hostname
               The quoted hostname

           diskname
               The quoted diskname

           level
               The level of the estimate

           size
               The estimate size in kbytes

       force-bump [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+
           Force the disks on hostname to bump to a new incremental level
           during the next Amanda run.

       force-no-bump [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+
           Force the disks on hostname to not bump to a new incremental level
           during the next Amanda run.

       unforce-bump [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+
           Undo a previous force-bump or force-no-bump command.

       force [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+
           Force the disks on hostname to do a full (level 0) backup during
           the next Amanda run.

       force-level-1 [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+
           Force the disks on hostname to do a level 1 backup during the next
           Amanda run.

       unforce [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+
           Undo a previous force or force-level-1 command.

       retention [ tapelabel ... ]
           Print the retention for each tapes.

       reuse tapelabel [ ... ]
           The tapes listed will be available for reuse at their point in the
           tape cycle.

       no-reuse tapelabel [ ... ]
           The tapes listed will not be reused when their turn comes up again
           in the tape cycle. Note that if this causes the number of reusable
           tapes to drop below the amanda.conftapecycle value, Amanda will
           request new tapes until the count is satisfied again.

           Tape marked no-reuse are available for recovery, marking them
           no-reuse is a security to be sure amanda will not overwrite them.

       due [ hostname [ disks ]* ]*
           Show when the next full dump is due.

       find [ --sort hkdlspbfw ] [ hostname [ disks ]* ]*
           Display all backups currently on tape or in the holding disk. The
           storage name, tape label or holding disk filename, file number, and
           status are displayed.

           The --sort option changes the sort order using the following flags:

           h: host name
           k: disk name
           d: dump timestamp
           l: backup level
           p: dump part
           b: tape label
           s: storage name
           f: filenum on tape
           w: write timestamp

           An uppercase letter reverses the sort order for that key. The
           default sort order is hkdlspbfw.

       holding delete hostname [ disk [ datestamp [ .. ] ] ]
           Delete holding files matching the given specification. At least a
           hostname must be provided.

       holding list [-l] [-d] [ hostname [ disk [ datestamp [ .. ] ] ] ]
           List holding files matching the given dump specification, or all
           holding files if no specification is provided. See amanda-match(7)
           for more information on dump specifications. With '-l', additional
           information (size, level, and whether the dump is outdated) is
           provided. With '-d', only outdated dumps are shown.

           An outdated holding file is one which is not required for a restore
           of the most recent dump. Note that outdated dumps may still be
           required for restores at earlier dates. For example, assume that a
           DLE had a level 0 on Monday, level 1's Tuesday through Thursday,
           and a level 2 on Friday. Then the files required for a restore of
           Fridays (the most recent) dump are those from Monday (level 0),
           Thursday (level 1), and Friday (level 2). Tuesday and Wednesday's
           files are outdated.

       delete [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+
           Delete the specified disks on hostname from the Amanda database.

               Note
               If you do not also remove the disk from the disklist(5) file,
               Amanda will treat it as a new disk during the next run.

       tape [ --days <num> ]
           Display the tape(s) Amanda expects to write to during the next run.
           See also amcheck(8).

       bumpsize
           Display the current bump threshold parameters, calculated for all
           backup levels.

       balance [ --days <num> ]
           Display the distribution of full backups throughout the dump
           schedule.

       export [ hostname [ disks ]* ]*
           Convert records from the Amanda database to a text format that may
           be transmitted to another Amanda machine and imported.

       import
           Convert exported records read from standard input to a form Amanda
           uses and insert them into the database on this machine.

       config
           Dump the full internal representation of this config, in text
           format.

       disklist [ hostname [ disks ]* ]*
           Display the disklist(5) information for each of the disks on
           hostname (or all hosts). Mostly used for debugging.

       hosts
           Output a list of distinct hosts in the disklist(5), one per line,
           for easy use in shell scripts.

       dles
           Output a list of distinct DLEs in the disklist(5), one per line
           with host and diskname separated by a space, for easy use in shell
           scripts.

       info [ hostname [ disks ]* ]*
           Display the database record for each of the disks on hostname (or
           all hosts). Mostly used for debugging.

       -o configoption
           See the "CONFIGURATION OVERRIDE" section in amanda(8).

EXAMPLES
       Request three specific file systems on machine-a get a full level 0
       backup during the next Amanda run.
       $ amadmin daily force machine-a / /var /usr
       amadmin: machine-a:/ is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
       amadmin: machine-a:/var is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
       amadmin: machine-a:/usr is set to a forced level 0 tonight.

       Request all file systems on machine-b get a full level 0 backup during
       the next Amanda run.
       $ amadmin daily force machine-b
       amadmin: machine-b:/ is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
       amadmin: machine-b:/var is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
       amadmin: machine-b:/usr is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
       amadmin: machine-b:/home is set to a forced level 0 tonight.

       Undo the previous force request for /home on machine-b. The other file
       systems will still get a full level 0 backup.
       $ amadmin daily unforce machine-b /home
       amadmin: force command for machine-b:/home cleared.

       Locate backup images of /var from machine-c. The tape or file column
       displays either a tape label or a filename depending on whether the
       image is on tape or is still in the holding disk. If the image is on
       tape, the file column tells you which file on the tape has the image
       (file number zero is a tape label). This column shows zero and is not
       meaningful if the image is still in the holding disk. The status column
       tells you whether the backup was successful or had some type of error.
       $ amadmin daily find machine-c /var
       date        host      disk lv tape or file                 file part  status
       2000-11-09  machine-c /var  0 000110                       9   --  OK
       2000-11-08  machine-c /var  2 000109                       2   --  OK
       2000-11-07  machine-c /var  2 /amanda/20001107/machine-c._var.2  0 OK
       2000-11-06  machine-c /var  2 000107                       2   --  OK
       2000-11-05  machine-c /var  2 000106                       3   --  OK
       2000-11-04  machine-c /var  2 000105                       2   --  OK
       2000-11-03  machine-c /var  2 000104                       2   --  OK
       2000-11-02  machine-c /var  2 000103                       2   --  OK
       2000-11-01  machine-c /var  1 000102                       5   --  OK
       2000-10-31  machine-c /var  1 000101                       3   --  OK

       Forget about the /workspace disk on machine-d. If you do not also
       remove the disk from the disklist(5) file, Amanda will treat it as a
       new disk during the next run.
       $ amadmin daily delete machine-d /workspace
       amadmin: machine-d:/workspace deleted from database.
       amadmin: NOTE: you'll have to remove these from the disklist(5) yourself.

       Find the next tape Amanda will use (in this case, 123456).
       $ amadmin daily tape
       The next Amanda run should go onto tape 123456 or a new tape.

       Show how well full backups are balanced across the dump cycle. The
       due-date column is the day the backups are due for a full backup.  #fs
       shows the number of filesystems doing full backups that night, and orig
       KB and out KB show the estimated total size of the backups before and
       after any compression, respectively.

       The balance column shows how far off that night's backups are from the
       average size (shown at the bottom of the balance column). Amanda tries
       to keep the backups within +/- 5%, but since the amount of data on each
       filesystem is always changing, and Amanda will never delay backups just
       to rebalance the schedule, it is common for the schedule to fluctuate
       by larger percentages. In particular, in the case of a tape or backup
       failure, a bump will occur the following night, which will not be
       smoothed out until the next pass through the schedule.

       The last line also shows an estimate of how many Amanda runs will be
       made between full backups for a file system. In the example, a file
       system will probably have a full backup done every eight times Amanda
       is run (e.g. every eight days).
       $ amadmin daily balance
        due-date  #fs   orig KB    out KB  balance
