NAME
       dnss - DNS over HTTPS

SYNOPSIS
       dnss [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       dnss is a daemon for using DNS over HTTPS.

       It can act as a proxy, receiving DNS requests and resolving them using DNS-over-HTTPs (DoH). This can be useful to improve DNS security and privacy on laptops and small/home networks.

       It can also act as a DoH server, in case you want end to end control.

       In the default mode of operation, it listens for DNS requests on port 53, and will query a DNS-over-HTTP server (dns.google by default) to resolve them.

OPTIONS
       Run dnss --help for more details, or see the README file.
