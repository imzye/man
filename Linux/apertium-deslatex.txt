NAME
     apertium-deslatex — LaTeX format processor for Apertium

SYNOPSIS
     apertium-deslatex [-hin] [input_file [output_file]]

DESCRIPTION
     This tool is part of the Apertium open-source machine translation toolbox: https://www.apertium.com/.

     The apertium-deslatex filter preprocesses apertium-prelatex(1) output to a deformatted “XMLish” LaTeX custom format.  The output is suitable for processing with lt-proc(1).  Format information (new‐
     lines, tabs, etc.) is enclosed in brackets so that lt-proc(1) treats it as whitespace between words.

OPTIONS
     -h, --help
             Display this help.

     -i      Makes the addition of trailing sentence terminator (‘.’) unconditional, often leading to duplicates.

     -n      Suppresses the addition of a trailing sentence terminator.

EXAMPLES
     You could write the following to show how the word “gener” is analysed:
           echo "<textit/><CONTENTS>gener</CONTENTS>" | apertium-deslatex | lt-proc ca-es.automorf.bin
