NAME
       sf2cfg - construct gt cfg files for SoundFonts

SYNOPSIS
       sf2cfg sffilename [> cfgname]

DESCRIPTION
       sf2cfg  is a utility program which constructs a gt configure file, with a list of instrument patch names by bank, for an AWE SoundFont file.  Just give it the name of the SoundFont file, either an old
       style .sbk font or a .sf1 or .sf2 font.  Capture the output in a file, edit it if you want, then edit gt's main configure file (timidity.cfg) to refer to the new cfg file by adding, e.g., lines:
       if 0
       source cfgname
