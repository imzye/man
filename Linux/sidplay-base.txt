NAME
       sid2wav - output wav files out of sid files

SYNOPSIS
       sid2wav [-commands] <datafile>|- [outputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Sid2wav  is  a  synthetic  waveform generator from sid files, named after the Sound Interface Chip found in Commodore 64 personal computers. With this tool, one can 'convert' sid files to wav ones
       that popular music players like XMMS can play. Note that you don't have to convert sid files just to listen them, sidplay can play it for you just as it would sound on a real C64. Also,  XMMS  has
       an  input  plugin  to  play sid files directly. The use is that you may convert sid tunes to wav and later to any compressed format like Ogg or MP3 for users lacking sidplay. Other use would be to
       convert files to wav for audio CD creation.
