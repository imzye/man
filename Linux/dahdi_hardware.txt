NAME
       dahdi_hardware - Shows Dahdi hardware devices.

SYNOPSIS
       dahdi_hardware [-v][-x]

OPTIONS
       -v  Verbose output - show spans used by each device etc. Currently only implemented for the Xorcom Astribank.

       -x  Show disconnected Astribank unit, if any.

DESCRIPTION
       Show all Dahdi hardware devices. Devices are recognized according to lists of PCI and USB IDs in Dahdi::Hardware::PCI.pm and Dahdi::Hardware::USB.pm . For PCI it is possible to detect by sub-vendor
       and sub-product ID as well.

       The first output column is the connector: a bus specific field that shows where this device is.

       The second field shows which driver should handle the device. a "-" sign marks that the device is not yet handled by this driver. A "+" sign means that the device is handled by the driver.

       For the Xorcom Astribank (and in the future: for other Dahdi devices) some further information is provided from the driver. Those extra lines always begin with spaces.

       Example output:
