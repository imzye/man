NAME
       radon - Python tool to compute code metrics

DESCRIPTION
       radon is a Python tool which computes various code metrics.

   Summary
       Radon is a Python tool which computes various code metrics. Supported metrics are:

       • raw metrics: SLOC, comment lines, blank lines, etc.

       • Cyclomatic Complexity (i.e. McCabe's Complexity)

       • Halstead metrics (all of them)

       • the Maintainability Index (a Visual Studio metric)

       Radon can be used either from the command line or programmatically through its API.

   Usage
       radon [-h] [-v] {cc,raw,mi,hal} ...

   positional arguments
          {cc,raw,mi,hal}
              cc             Analyze the given Python modules and compute Cyclomatic Complexity (CC).

              raw            Analyze the given Python modules and compute raw metrics.

              mi             Analyze the given Python modules and compute the Maintainability Index.

              hal            Analyze the given Python modules and compute their Halstead metrics.

   optional arguments
          -h, --help
                 show this help message and exit

          -v, --version
                 show program's version number and exit

       Cyclomatic Complexity can be seen simply as the number of independent paths that exist between the input of the function and its output

       radon output consists of columns. The first column indicates F M C - or function method class.
