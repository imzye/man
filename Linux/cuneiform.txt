NAME
       cuneiform - multi-language OCR system

SYNOPSIS
       cuneiform [--dotmatrix] [--fax] [--singlecolumn] [-f format] [-l language] [-o output] input

DESCRIPTION
       Cuneiform is an OCR system. In addition to text recognition it also does layout analysis and text format recognition. Cuneiform supports several languages.

OPTIONS
       --dotmatrix
           Use recognition mode optimized for text printed with a dot matrix printer.

       --fax
           Use recognition mode optimized for text that has been faxed.

       --singlecolumn
           Disable page layout analysis and assumes that the image consists of only one column of text.

       -f format
           Select  output  format. The following formats are available: html (HTML format), hocr (hOCR HTML format), native (native Cuneiform 2000), rtf (RTF format), smarttext (plain text with TeX para‐
           graphs), text (plain text).  The default is plain text.

       -l language
           By default Cuneiform recognizes English text. To change the language use the command line switch -l followed by a language code (typically an ISO 639-2 three-letter code). The  following  lan‐
           guages are supported:

       -o output
           If you do not define an output file with the -o switch, Cuneiform writes the result to a file ‘cuneiform-out.format’. The file extension depends on your output format.

INPUT FORMAT
       Cuneiform can process any single-page image that GraphicsMagick knows how to open. Please consult the gm(1) manual page for the comprehensive list of supported image formats.
