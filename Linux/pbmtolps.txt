NAME
       pbmtolps - convert PBM image to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtolps [-dpi n] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtolps reads a PBM image as input and outputs PostScript.  The output
       Postscript uses lines instead of  the  image  operator  to  generate  a
       (device dependent) picture which will be imaged much faster.

       pnmtops  is  a more general program for converting from the Netpbm for‐
       mats to Postscript, though it cannot produce the particular arcane sub‐
       format that pbmtolps does.

       The  Postscript  path length is constrained to be less that 1000 points
       so that no limits are overrun on the Apple Laserwriter and (presumably)
       no other printers.
