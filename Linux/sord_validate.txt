NAME
       sord_validate - Validate RDF data

SYNOPSIS
       sord_validate [OPTION]... INPUT...

OPTIONS
       -h     Print the command line options.

       -l     Print errors on a single line.

       -v     Display version information and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a simple validator which checks that all used properties are actually defined, and that the domain and range of properties is explicitly correct.  Note that an "error" from this program does
       not necessarily mean data is invalid, since it is not required to explicitly list types in RDF, however it is a good idea to do so.

       This program never retrieves data from the web or magical places on the file system, it only processes files passed directly on the command line.  This means you must pass all used vocabularies to get
       a useful result.

       If  an appropriate schema is available, literals are checked against datatype definitions (both the explicit datatype of the literal itself as well as any types implied by the corresponding property).
       Three XML Schema Datatypes (XSD) constraints are currently supported: regular expressions (xsd:pattern), and inclusive range (xsd:minimumInclusive  and  xsd:maximumInclusive).   Given  an  appropriate
       schema, this is enough to validate against most of the standard XSD datatypes.

EXAMPLES
       sord_validate `find ~/schemas/ -name '*.ttl'` data.ttl
