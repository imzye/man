NAME
       dose-outdated - detect uninstallable packages due to obsolete dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       dose-outdated [option] ... file ...

DESCRIPTION
       dose-outdated identifies in a debian package repository those packages that are not installable with respect to that repository by the their inter-package relationships (dependencies, conflicts, ...),
       and that furthermore cannot become installable (in the current version) how matter how the rest of the repository evolves. This means that this package has to be updated in the repository to ever
       become installable again.

Input Specification
       Input files have to contain stanzas in the format of deb-control(5), separated by one blank line. For instance, the Packages files as found on a Debian mirror server, or in the directory
       /var/lib/apt/lists/ of a Debian system, are suitable as input. The repository used in the analysis consists of the union of all packages from the input files.

Output Specification
       The output of dose-outdated is in the YAML format.

OPTIONS
       -f --failure
               Print the list of broken packages

       -e --explain
               Explain the results in more detail.

       -s      Print a summary of broken packages.

       --dump  Dump to standard output in CUDF format the packages that are internally generated and exit (mostly useful for debugging purposes).

       --checkonly package[,package] ...
               Specifies a list of packages to check. By default all packages are checked.  Takes a comma-separated list of package names, each of them possibly with a version constraint, as argument.

               Example: --checkonly "libc6 , 2ping (>= 1.2.3-1)"

       -v      Enable info / warnings / debug messages. This option may be repeated up to three times in order to increase verbosity.

       --progress
               Display progress bars.

       -h, --help
               Display this list of options.

EXIT CODES
       Exit codes 0-63 indicate a normal termination of the program, codes 64-127 indicate abnormal termination of the program (such as parse errors, I/O errors).

EXAMPLE
        dose-outdated -f -v /var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_binary-amd64_Packages
