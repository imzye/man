NAME
       aj, aj5 — command-line launchers for load-time weaving

SYNOPSIS
       aj [Options]  [arg... ]

       aj5 [Options]  [arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The aj command runs Java programs in Java 1.4 or later by setting up WeavingURLClassLoader as the system class loader, to do load-time bytecode weaving.

       The aj5 command runs Java programs using AspectJ Java5 JVMTI agent to do load-time bytecode weaving.

       The arguments are the same as those used to launch the Java program.  Users should define the environment variables CLASSPATH and ASPECTPATH.

                                                                                                                                                                                                          aj(1)
