NAME
       stops - Query Västtrafik to show the incoming vehicles on a stop

SYNOPSIS
       stops
       stops STOP

DESCRIPTION
       This command queries the online API provided by Västtrafik to list the incoming vehicles on the desired stop, and the amount of time before they arrive.
       The easier way to use it is to write the name of the stop as parameter.
       Alternatively, calling it without parameter will make it use an interactive mode, which can be used to show suggestions for the names.
       A ghost symbol is used to indicate that the trip is partially cancelled.

EXAMPLE
       stops stigbergs
