NAME
       coreinject - inject binary dumps from minicoredumper(1) into a core file

SYNOPSIS
       coreinject [OPTION]... core symbol.map binary-dump...

DESCRIPTION
       If  an  application  using  libminicoredumper(7) registers a binary dump to not be included in the core file, the minicoredumper(1) will create a separate dump file containing the contents of that
       variable.  A symbol map file symbol.map is also created by the minicoredumper(1).  Using these files, coreinject can inject that binary data into the stripped core file for use with gdb(1).

       The options are as follows:

       --data=IDENT:SIZE@SRCFILE+SRCOFF
              Inject SIZE bytes of data at offset SRCOFF of file SRCFILE to the core(5).  The data is injected at the location of the IDENT as stored in the symbol map. This option is useful for  inject‐
              ing data other than that which was actually dumped by the minicoredumper(1).

NOTES
       If  the binary dump used MCD_DATA_PTR_DIRECT, the separate binary file contains exactly that data. If MCD_DATA_PTR_INDIRECT was used, the separate binary file contains first the pointer value fol‐
       lowed by the data pointed to by the pointer.

EXAMPLE
       Insert the binary data in bdump.bin into core.

              coreinject core symbol.map bdump.bin
