NAME
       MesaFlash - utility to flash Mesa Electronics FPGA Cards

SYNOPSIS
       mesaflash [options] [commands]

DESCRIPTION
       mesaflash Read, write, configure Mesa Electronics FPGA cards.

OPTIONS
       --device name
              Select active device name. If no command is given it will detect board with given name and print info about it.

              The special values "ETHER", "SPI" and "AUTO" will attempt to detect a device on ethernet, SPI, or any interface; --addr still needs to be specified for non-PCI devices.

       --addr [ip]|[device]
              Use ip or device name to look for <name> (IP address for Ethernet boards, serial device name for USB boards and serial boards, SPI device name for SPI boards)

       --addr_hi
              Set the high register address for the EPP interface.

       --epp  Use EPP interface to connect to board, only for boards with multiple interfaces (7c80, 7c81, 7i43, 7i90, 7i64).

       --usb  Use USB interface to connect to board, only for boards with multiple interfaces (7c80, 7c81, 7i43, 7i90, 7i64).

       --spi  Use SPI interface to connect to board, only for boards with multiple interfaces (7c80, 7c81, 7i43, 7i90, 7i64).

       --serial
              Use serial interface to connect to board, only for boards with multiple interfaces (7i43, 7i90, 7i64).

       --fallback
              Use the fallback area of the FLASH memory while executing commands.

       --recover
              Access board using PCI bridge GPIO (currently only 6I24/6I25).

       --xml  Format output from 'readhmid' command into XML.

       --dbname# name
              Set daughter board name to 'name' for FPGA connector 'N'.  Allows readhmid to include daughterboard terminal names, where # can be in the range 1 to 6 (1 means first FPGA connector).

       --verbose
              Print detailed information while running commands.

COMMANDS
       --write filename
              Writes a standard bitfile 'filename' configuration to the userarea of the FLASH memory (IMPORTANT! 'filename' must be VALID FPGA configuration file).

       --fix-boot-block
              If a write operation does not detect a valid boot block, write one.

       --no-auto-verify
              Don't automatically verify after writing.

       --verify filename
              Verifies the FLASH memory configuration against the bitfile 'filename'.

       --program filename
              Writes a standard bitfile 'filename' configuration to the FPGA (IMPORTANT! 'filename' must be VALID FPGA configuration file).

       --backup-flash filename|dirname
              Backup all content the FLASH memory to the file 'filename' or to the directory 'dirname' with auto naming dump file.

       --restore-flash filename
              Restore all content the FLASH memory from a file 'filename' (IMPORTANT! Can't use a dump file from different types of boards. Unacceptable interrupt the restoring process.  If the restoring
              process was interrupted, do not turn off the board power and do not reload board, and run restore process again). Required SHA256 checksum file 'filename.sha256'.

       --sha256-check
              Integrity check FPGA configuration bitfile before writing.  Required SHA256 checksum file 'filename.sha256'.

       --readhmid
              Print hostmot2 configuration in PIN file format.

       --print-pd
              Print hostmot2 Pin Descriptors.

       --reload
              Do full FPGA reload from FLASH memory (only Ethernet, SPI and PCI boards).

       --reset
              Do full firmware reset (only Ethernet and serial boards).

       --sserial
              Print full information about all sserial remote boards.

       --rpo address
              Read hostmot2 variable directly at 'address'.

       --wpo address value
              Write hostmot2 variable directly at 'address' with 'value'.

       --setip="n.n.n.n"
              Set board IP address in EEPROM memory to n.n.n.n (only Ethernet boards).

       --info filename
              Print info about configuration in 'filename'.

       --help Print the help message
