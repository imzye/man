NAME
       MusE - MIDI/Audio Sequencer

SYNOPSIS
       muse4 [ options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       MusE  is  a MIDI/Audio sequencer that can also record and edit sound files, apply effects and filters from an intuitive graphical interface.  It is based on the Linux-specific ALSA interface for audio
       i/o.  The Jack Audio Connection Kit is used for routing.  LADSPA-compliant plugins allow to extend the list of available effects.

       The optional file argument denotes a project file in MusE-internal format that is loaded on startup.  Project files can also be loaded later on through the graphical menu.
