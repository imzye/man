Mono(mono-api-info)                                        Mono(mono-api-info)

NAME
       mono-api-info - Expose IL structure of CLR assemblies as XML.

SYNOPSIS
       mono-api-info [--abi] assembly1.dll assembly2.exe ...

DESCRIPTION
       Expose  the  structure of your CLR assemblies by examining their IL and
       giving XML output.

       By default this tool gives information about just the public API of the
       assemblies  to  scan.  So  it's  good  for  comparing API compatibility
       between versions of libraries.

OPTIONS
       --abi  Show the ABI instead of the  API,  that  is,  non-static  fields
              (even  the  non-public  ones) that are not marked as [NonSerial‐
              ized()].
