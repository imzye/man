NAME
       camera-calib - GUI for calibrating a monocular camera using a checker-board

SYNOPSIS
       camera-calib

DESCRIPTION
       camera-calib-gui is a graphical application which allows the user to select a sequence of images where a checkerboad (calibration pattern) appears, then it computes the intrinsic and distortion
       parameters of the camera, using the OpenCV implementation of Zhang's algorithm.

       The sequence of images can be grabbed directly from a webcam, firewire camera or any other video source.
