NAME
       uflash - utility for flashing the BBC micro:bit with Python scripts and the MicroPython runtime

SYNOPSIS
       uflash [--runtime RUNTIME] [--watch] [--minify] [source] [target [target...]]

       uflash --extract HEXFILE [source]

       uflash --version

       uflash --help

DESCRIPTION
       uflash  flashes Python onto a BBC micro:bit or extracts Python source from a .hex file.  If no path to the micro:bit is provided, uflash will attempt to autodetect the correct path to the de‐
       vice.  If no path to the Python script is provided, uflash will flash an unmodified MicroPython firmware onto the device.

OPTIONS
       uflash supports the following options:

       -r, --runtime RUNTIME
              use the specified MicroPython runtime file

       -w, --watch
              watch the source file for changes

       -m, --minify
              minify the source

       -e, --extract HEXFILE
              extract Python source from given hex file

       source the Python source file to flash or extract to

       target path to one or more mounted micro:bit devices

       -h, --help
              display usage information and exit

       --version
              display current version and exit

EXAMPLES
       If you type the command on its own then uflash will attempt to find a connected BBC micro:bit and flash an unmodified default version of the MicroPython runtime onto it:

              $ uflash
              Flashing Python to: /media/ntoll/MICROBIT/micropython.hex

       To flash a version of the MicroPython runtime with a specified script embedded within it (so that script is run when the BBC micro:bit boots up) then pass the path to the Python script in  as
       the first argument to the command:

              $ uflash my_script.py
              Flashing Python to: /media/ntoll/MICROBIT/micropython.hex

       You can let uflash watch for changes of your script.  It will be flashed automatically every time you save it:

              $ uflash --watch my_script.py

       At this point uflash will try to automatically detect the path to the device.  However, if you have several devices plugged in and/or know what the path on the filesystem to the BBC micro:bit
       already is, you can specify this as a second argument to the command:

              $ uflash myscript.py /media/ntoll/MICROBIT
              Flashing Python to: /media/ntoll/MICROBIT/micropython.hex

       You can even flash multiple devices at once:

              $ uflash myscript.py /media/ntoll/MICROBIT /media/ntoll/MICROBIT1
              Flashing Python to: /media/ntoll/MICROBIT/micropython.hex
              Flashing Python to: /media/ntoll/MICROBIT1/micropython.hex

       To extract a Python script from a hex file use the “–extract” flag like this:

              $ uflash --extract something.hex myscript.py

       This will save the Python script recovered from “something.hex” into the file “myscript.py”.  If you don’t supply a target the recovered script will emit to STDOUT.

       If you’re developing MicroPython and have a custom runtime hex file you can specify that uflash use it instead of the default version of MicroPython in the following way:

              $ uflash --runtime=firmware.hex

FILES
       The default MicroPython firmware file is located in /usr/share/firmware-microbit-micropython/firmware.hex.
