NAME
       gfcksum - print checksum

SYNOPSIS
       gfcksum [-rl] [-T | -t] path...

       gfcksum -c [-rlv] [-h host] path...

DESCRIPTION
       gfcksum prints checksum of specified files. When -r option is specified, it prints checksum of subentries in the specified directories recursively.

       When -t option is specified, only checksum type which is currently set to the file is printed. When -T option is specified, which checksum type will be calculated is printed.

       When the -c option is specified, it calculates the checksum of the specified files, and compares it with the checksum stored in the metadata. The -h option specifies the location of the file replica
       to be calculated. With the -v option, the verbose information including modification time of the file replica is displayed.

       If the -l option is present, gfcksum displays a path for each file. By default, gfcksum shows its basename only.
