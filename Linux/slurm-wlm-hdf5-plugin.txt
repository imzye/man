NAME
       sh5util - Tool for merging HDF5 files from the acct_gather_profile plugin that gathers detailed data for jobs running under Slurm

SYNOPSIS
       sh5util

DESCRIPTION
       sh5util  merges  HDF5  files  produced  on  each node for each step of a job into one HDF5 file for the job. The resulting file can be viewed and manipulated by common HDF5 tools such as HDF5View,
       h5dump, h5edit, or h5ls.

       sh5util also has two extract modes. The first, writes a limited set of data for specific nodes, steps, and data series in "comma separated value" form to a file which can be  imported  into  other
       analysis tools such as spreadsheets.

       The second, (Item-Extract) extracts one data time from one time series for all the samples on all the nodes from a jobs HDF5 profile.

       - Finds sample with maximum value of the item.

       - Write CSV file with min, ave, max, and item totals for each node for each sample

OPTIONS
       -E, --extract

              Extract data series from a merged job file.

              Extract mode options

              -i, --input=path
                        merged file to extract from (default ./job_$jobid.h5)

              -N, --node=nodename
                        Node name to extract (default is all)

              -l, --level=[Node:Totals | Node:TimeSeries]
                        Level to which series is attached. (default Node:Totals)

              -s, --series=[Energy | Filesystem | Network | Task | Task_#]
                        Task is all tasks, Task_# (# is a task id) (default is everything)

       -h, --help
              Print this description of use.

       -I, --item-extract

              Extract one data item from all samples of one data series from all nodes in a merged job file.

              Item-Extract mode options

              -s, --series=[Energy | Filesystem | Network | Task]

              -d, --data
                        Name of data item in series (See note below).

       -j, --jobs=<job[.step]>
              Format is <job[.step]>. Merge this job/step (or a comma-separated list of job steps). This option is required.  Not specifying a step will result in all steps found to be processed.

       -L, --list

              Print the items of a series contained in a job file.

              List mode options

              -i, --input=path
                        Merged file to extract from (default ./job_$jobid.h5)

              -s, --series=[Energy | Filesystem | Network | Task]

       -o, --output=<path>
              Path to a file into which to write.  Default for merge is ./job_$jobid.h5 Default for extract is ./extract_$jobid.csv

       -p, --profiledir=<dir>
              Directory location where node-step files exist default is set in acct_gather.conf.

       -S, --savefiles
              Instead of removing node-step files after merging them into the job file, keep them around.

       --usage
              Display brief usage message.

       --user=<user>
              User who profiled job.  (Handy for root user, defaults to user running this command.)

PERFORMANCE
       Executing  sh5util sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from sh5util or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmctld daemon come in at once,
       it can result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run sh5util or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to  sh5util  to  the
       minimum necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

EXAMPLES
       Merge node-step files (as part of a sbatch script):

              $ sbatch -n1 -d$SLURM_JOB_ID --wrap="sh5util --savefiles -j $SLURM_JOB_ID"

       Extract all task data from a node:

              $ sh5util -j 42 -N snowflake01 --level=Node:TimeSeries --series=Tasks

       Extract all energy data:

              $ sh5util -j 42 --series=Energy --data=power
