NAME
       bw_file_rd - time the reading and summing of a file

SYNOPSIS
       bw_file_rd [ -P <parallelism> ] [ -W <warmups> ] [ -N <repetitions> ] size file

DESCRIPTION
       bw_file_rd times the read of the specified file in 64KB blocks. Each block is summed up as a seried of 4 byte integers in an unrolled loop.  Results are reported in megabytes read per second.

       The  data  is  not  accessed  in the user program; the benchmark relies on the operating systems read interface to have actually moved the data.  Systems that implement page flipping may fool this
       benchmark.

       The benchmark is intended to be used on a file that is in memory, i.e., the benchmark is a reread benchmark.  Other file benchmarking can be done with lmdd(8).

       The size specification may end with ``k'' or ``m'' to mean kilobytes (* 1024) or megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).

OUTPUT
       Output format is "%0.2f %.2f\n", megabytes, megabytes_per_second, i.e.,

       8.00 25.33

MEMORY UTILIZATION
       This benchmark can move up to three times the requested memory.  Most Unix systems implement the read system call as a bcopy from kernel space to user space.  Bcopy will use 2-3 times as much mem‐
       ory bandwidth: there is one read from the source and a write to the destionation.  The write usually results in a cache line read and then a write back of the cache line at some later point.  Mem‐
       ory utilization might be reduced by 1/3 if the processor architecture implemented ``load cache line'' and ``store cache line'' instructions (as well as ``getcachelinesize'').
