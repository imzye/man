NAME
       polymake - tool for algorithmic treatment of polytopes and polyhedra

SYNOPSIS
       polymake [-dv] [-A|-a application] [--reconfigure]
                [--config-path filename|user[=directory]]
                [--no-config] [--ignore-config]
                [--script|--iscript [application::]script_file arguments ...]
                [--touch data_file [ data_file ... ]]
                [-]

DESCRIPTION
       polymake  is  open  source software for research in polyhedral geometry. It deals with polytopes, polyhedra, and fans as well as simplicial complexes, matroids, graphs, tropical hypersurfaces, and
       various other objects.  When called without arguments it will start an interactive shell, use help; for a very short introduction.

ARGUMENTS
       --help print help text and exit.

       --version
              print the version number, copyright notice, and exit.

       [application::]script_file
              execute the perl script in the file.  If an application prefix is specified, this application is loaded and the script file is looked up in its script directory.

       --script [application::]script_file arguments ...
              execute the perl script in the file, passing the arguments in @ARGV.

       --iscript [application::]script_file arguments ...
              execute the perl script in the file, which may contain interactive commands, passing the arguments in @ARGV.

       'script text'
              interpret the string as an inline polymake/perl script.

       -      read and execute the commands from the standard input.  standard output and error streams are not redirected.

       --touch data_file [ data_file ... ]
              read the files and write them out; useful for converting from earlier polymake versions

OPTIONS
       -A application_name
              start with this application, ignoring the $default_application and @start_applications settings.

       -a application_name
              start with this application, ignoring the $default_application but in contrast to -A, load everything in @start_applications.

       -d     produce some debug output; can be repeated to increase the debug level.

       -v     tell what's going on; can be repeated to increase the verbosity level.  This is an obsolete option, please use custom variables $Verbose::* to gain more detailed control.

       --reconfigure
              rerun the autoconfiguration sections in all rule files.

       --config-path settings_file
              Import settings from a global configuration file.  Several --config-path options are allowed, later instances have higher priority.

       --config-path user[=config_directory]
              Specify the location of user's private settings, by default it's ~/.polymake which may be overridden via POLYMAKE_USER_DIR environment variable.  All global --config-path imports must  pre‐
              cede this option.

       --no-config
              Don't read any configuration files, don't try to configure rules automatically, don't load rule files requiring auto-configuration.  Equivalent to --config-path=none.

       --ignore-config
              Don't read any configuration files, skip auto-configuration routines in the rule files.  Equivalent to --config-path=ignore.
