NAME
     lumina-xconfig — graphical front-end to xrandr, which manages monitor configurations.

SYNOPSIS
     lumina-xconfig [--reset-monitors]
     lumina-xconfig [--mirror-monitors]
     lumina-xconfig [--list-profiles]
     lumina-xconfig [--apply-profile ⟨profile⟩]

DESCRIPTION
     lumina-xconfig opens the graphical utility for managing monitor configurations and requires the runtime utility xrandr.  lumina-xconfig offers the ability to drag connected displays and orient them
     freely.  It is also easy to select the resolution and rotation from a drop down box for each screen.  The Add Screen tab provides an option to enable a connected monitor that is not in use.

     lumina-xconfig Options:

     --reset-monitors
             Reset the monitor configuration to the default profile

     --mirror-monitors
             Setup all connected monitors as a single display output

     --list-profiles
             Return the list of all the currently-known profiles

     --apply-profile <profile>
             Apply the given monitor profile (will do nothing if profile does not exist)

DEPENDENCIES
     A single extra runtime dependency is required:

     xrandr
