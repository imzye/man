DT-GETHOST(1)                    User Commands                   DT-GETHOST(1)

NAME
       dt-gethost - command-line test program for the val_gethostbyname() (and
       related) functions

SYNOPSIS
          dt-gethost [options] name

DESCRIPTION
       This utility is a command-line wrapper around the val_gethostbyname()
       (and related) functions.  It invokes the val_gethostbyname(),
       val_gethostbyname_r() and val_gethostbyname2() functions for the given
       command-line arguments and displays the returned hostent, the
       validation status value, and the value of the h_errno variable.

       The exit status for this program is 1 if the answer received is
       trusted, 2 if the answer received is validated, and -1 for an error.
       The program returns 0 if no validation was performed or if the result
       was neither trusted nor validated.  The trusted and validated status
       values are obtained using the val_istrusted() and val_isvalidated()
       functions from libval(3).
