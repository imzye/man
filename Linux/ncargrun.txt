NAME
       ncargrun - to run a user program and redirect the metafile output

SYNOPSIS
       ncargrun program-name [-t] [-o metafile-name]

DESCRIPTION
       ncargrun is a script that invokes "program-name", which uses the NCAR GKS library, and applies the specified options.

       Prior to running your program, this script sets the environment variables NCARG_GKS_OUTPUT, NCARG_GKS_PSOUTPUT, and NCARG_GKS_PDFOUTPUT to produce the desired effect.

OPTIONS
       -o filename

       specifies the name of the output metafile or PostScript file.  If filename is replaced by "| translator-name", the effect is to pipe the metafile to the named translator.

       -t specifies that metafile output should be piped to the default translator "ctrans".
