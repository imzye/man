XML2PO(1)                       [FIXME: manual]                      XML2PO(1)

NAME
       xml2po - program to create a PO-template file from a DocBook XML file
       and merge it back into a (translated) XML file

SYNOPSIS
       xml2po [OPTIONS] [XMLFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xml2po command.

       xml2po is a simple Python program which extracts translatable content
       from free-form XML documents and outputs gettext compatible POT files.
       Translated PO files can be turned into XML output again.

       It can work it´s magic with most "simple" tags, and for complicated
       tags one has to provide a list of all tags which are "final" (that will
       be put into one "message" in PO file), "ignored" (skipped over) and
       "space preserving".

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-´). A summary of options is
       included below.

       -a, --automatic-tags
           Automatically decide if tags are to be considered "final" or not.

       -k, --keep-entities
           Don´t expand entities (default). See also the -e option.

       -e, --expand-all-entities
           Expand all entities (including SYSTEM ones).

       -m, --mode=TYPE
           Treat tags as type TYPE (default: docbook).

       -o, --output=FILE
           Print resulting text (XML while merging translations with "-p" or
           "-t" options, POT template file while extracting strings, and
           translated PO file with "-r" option) to the given FILE.

       -p, --po-file=FILE
           Specify a PO FILE containing translation and output XML document
           with translations merged in.

       -r, --reuse=FILE
           Specify a translated XML document in FILE with the same structure
           to generate translated PO file for XML document given on command
           line.

       -t, --translation=FILE
           Specify a MO file containing translation and output XML document
           with translations merged in.

       -u, --update-translation=LANG.po
           Update a PO file using msgmerge.

       -l, --language=LANG
           Explicitly set language of the translation.

       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
           Show version of program.

EXAMPLES
   Creating POT template files
       To create a POT template book.pot from an input file book.xml, which
       consists of chapter1.xml and chapter2.xml (external entities), run:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -o book.pot book.xml chapter1.xml chapter2.xml

       To expand entities use the -e option:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -e -o book.pot book.xml

   Creating translated XML files (merging back PO files)
       After translating book.pot into LANG.po, merge the translations back by
       using -p option for each XML file:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -p LANG.po -o book.LANG.xml book.xml
                               /usr/bin/xml2po -p LANG.po -o chapter1.LANG.xml chapter1.xml
                               /usr/bin/xml2po -p LANG.po -o chapter2.LANG.xml chapter2.xml

       If you used the -e option to expand entities, you should use it again
       to merge back the translation into an XML file:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -e -p LANG.po -o book.LANG.xml book.xml

   Updating PO files
       When base XML file changes, the real advantages of PO files come to
       surface. There are 2 ways to merge the translation. The first is to
       produce a new POT template file (additionally use the -e if you decided
       earlier to expand entities). Afterwards run msgmerge to merge the
       translation with the new POT file:

                               /usr/bin/msgmerge -o tmp.po LANG.po book.pot

       Now rename tmp.po to LANG.po and update your translation.
       Alternatively, xml2po provides the -u option, which does exactly these
       two steps for you. The advantage is, that it also runs msgfmt to give
       you a statistical output of translation status (count of translated,
       untranslated and fuzzy messages). Additionally use the -e if you
       decided earlier to expand entities:

                               /usr/bin/xml2po -u LANG.po book.xml
