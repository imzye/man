NAME
       xosd-config - script to get information about the installed version of libxosd

SYNOPSIS
       xosd-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       xosd-config  is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use libxosd. It is also used internally to the .m4
       macros for GNU autoconf that are included with libxosd.

OPTIONS
       xosd-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of libxosd on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a libxosd program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a libxosd program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that libxosd was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec
               prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that libxosd was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must  be  specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
