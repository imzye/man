NAME
       pilot-addresses - Read and write address book databases to and from a Palm handheld.

SECTION
       pilot-link: Userland conduits

LOCATION
       ./src

SYNOPSIS
        pilot-addresses  [-p|--port  <port>]  [--version]  [-?|--help] [--usage] [-q|--quiet] [--delete-all] [-t|--delimiter  INT] [-d|--delete-category   category  ] [-c|--category  category] [-a|--augment]
       [-r|--read  file] [-w|--write   file  ] [-C|--human-readable]

DESCRIPTION
        pilot-addresses allows the user to read all entries from a Palm handheld such as those made by Palm, Handspring, Handera, TRGPro, Sony or other Palm handheld in the  Palm  Address  Book  application,
       write new entries into the database, and delete a category or delete all entries in the database.

COMMANDS
       Provide exactly one of --read or --write.

                           -r,
                           --read=<file>

       Reads records from <file> and install them to the Palm Address Book application. (Use the -w <file> option to get a sample "template file" for input records to see how the fields are laid out).

                           -w, --write=file

       Reads all address book records from the Palm Address Book application and writes them into  file

OPTIONS
   pilot-addresses options
                               -a, --augment

       Augments fields in address book records with additional information. The augmented information is placed before and separated from the field with a semi-colon, (;).

       Augmented information can include any of the following below.

        category # Placed in front of each record or..

       Placed in front of each phone number field:

       ["Work"|"Home"|"Fax"|"Other"|"E-mail"|"Main"|"Pager"|"Mobile"]

       Empty fields are not augmented.

                               -c,
                               --category=category

       Install records to category category by default. Normally pilot-addresses uses the Unfiled category by default. This option is overridden by the category specified in the record with the  -a  option.

                               -d, --delete-category

       Delete all records in the specified category category before installing new records.

       Note that the long name of this option has changed since 0.11.8

                               -D, --delete-all

       Delete all address book records in all categories. Obviously, be very careful with this one.

       Note that the long name of this option has changed since 0.11.8

                               -t,
                               --delimiter INT

       Include category in each record, use the delimiter specified to separate all fields of a record. Delimiters are specified as follows: 3=tab, 2=;, 1=,. This overrides the default delimiter of comma be‐
       tween fields and semi-colon between a field's augmented information. (Please note that this may generate confusing results when used with the -a option.)

       Note that the long name of this option has changed since 0.11.8

                               -T, --titles

       Obsolete. This option has been removed since 0.11.8

                               -C|--human-readable

       Write generic human-readable output instead of CSV.

   Conduit Options
                               -p,
                               --port <port>

       Use device file <port> to communicate with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-addresses will look for the  $PILOTPORT  environment variable. If neither are found or supplied, pilot-ad‐
       dresses will print the usage information.

                               -q,
                               --quiet

       Suppress 'Hit HotSync button' message

                               -v, --version

       Display version of pilot-addresses and exit without connecting.

   Help Options
                               -h, --help

       Display the help synopsis for pilot-addresses and exit without connecting.

                               --usage

       Display a brief usage message and exit without connecting.

USAGE
       The program will connect to the Palm handheld, and perform the requested read or write operation specified by the user.

EXAMPLES
       To write all address records in a Palm to the file addrbook.csv:

        pilot-addresses  -w  addrbook.csv

       or

        pilot-addresses  -p  /dev/pilot  -w  addrbook.csv

       To read the address book records in the file addrbook.csv and install them onto the Palm:

        pilot-addresses  -r  addrbook.csv

       To  read the address book records in the file addrbook.csv and place them into the Palm address book database category Special after first deleting all current records in the  Special  category on the
       palm:

        pilot-addresses  -c  Special  -d  Special  -r  addrbook.csv
