NAME
       pamhomography - map one arbitrary quadrilateral image region to another

SYNOPSIS
       pamhomography
         [-from=coords]
         [-to=coords]
         [-mapfile=map_file]
         [-view=coords]
         [-fill=color]
         [pam_file]

       You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix. You can use two hyphens instead of one to delimit an option. You can separate an option from its value with whitespace instead of =.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm ⟨http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/⟩ .

       pamhomography transforms a quadrilateral-not necessarily rectangular-region of an image, producing a new image.

       You can do any affine image transformation ⟨https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation#Image_transformation⟩ : translation,  reflection,  scaling,  rotation,  and  shearing/skewing.  However,
       pamhomography  additionally  can  do  bilinear transforms, which means it can warp any quadrilateral to any other quadrilateral, even when this mapping cannot be described using a single set of linear
       equations. This can be useful, for example, for creating perspective views of rectangular images or for reverse-mapping a perspective view back to a rectangular projection.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably -quiet, see Common Options ⟨http://index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pamhomography recognizes the following  command  line
       options:

       -from=coords

              This defines the source quadrilateral. coords is a list of four
                integer-valued (x, y) coordinates. If you do not
                specify -from, the source quadrilateral is taken to be the four
                corners of the input image in clockwise order, starting from the upper
                left.

       -to=coords

              This defines the target quadrilateral. coords is a list of four integer-valued (x, y) coordinates. If you do not specify -to, the target quadrilateral is taken to be the four corners of the in‐
              put image in clockwise order, starting from the upper left.

       -mapfile=map_file

              This names a text file that describes the mapping from the source to the target quadrilateral. The file map_file must contain either eight integer-valued (x,  y)  coordinates,  being  the  four
              source  coordinates  followed by the corresponding four target coordinates, or only four (x, y) coordinates, being only the four target coordinates. In the latter case, the source quadrilateral
              is taken to be the four corners of the input image in clockwise order, starting from the upper left.

       -view=coords

              This defines the target view. coords is a list of two integer-valued (x, y) coordinates: the upper left and lower right boundaries, respectively, of the pixels that will be visible in the  out‐
              put image. If -view is not specified, the target view will fit precisely the target quadrilateral.

       -fill=color

              This is the color with which the program fills all pixels that lie outside of the target quadrilateral. Specify the color as described for the
               argument of the pnm_parsecolor() library routine ⟨http://libnetpbm_image.html#colorname⟩ .

              The default is black, and for images with a transparency plane, transparent.

       Cooordinates should normally be specified in clockwise order. The syntax is fairly flexible: all characters other than the plus sign, minus sign, and digits are treated as separators. Although coordi‐
       nates need to be integers, they may lie outside the image's boundary.

       If you specify -mapfile along with -from and/or -to, -from and -to override the quadrilaterals specified by map_file.

PARAMETERS
       pamhomography's only parameter, pam_file, is the name of the
         file containing the input image. If you don't specify pam_file, the
         image comes from Standard Input.

NOTES
       The output image uses the same Netpbm format as the input image.

       Simple transformations are best handled by other Netpbm programs, such as those listed in the 'SEE ALSO' ⟨#SEE-ALSO⟩  section below. Use pamhomography for more sophisticated  transformations  such  as
       perspective adjustments, rotations around an arbitrary point in the image, extraction of non-rectangular quadrilaterals, shearings by coordinates rather than by angle, and, in general, all transforma‐
       tions that are most easily expressed as mapping four points in one image to four points in another image.

EXAMPLES
       The following examples use the park_row.ppm ⟨park_row.ppm⟩  test image, which is a
        photograph of New York City's Park Row Building ⟨https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:15_Park_Row_3.JPG⟩ , scaled to 441&times;640, converted to a PPM file, and redistributed under  the  terms  of
       the
        GFDL ⟨https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License⟩ .

       The first example showcases the real power of bilinear transformations.  Assuming park_row_rect.map has the following contents:

             (0,  0) (440,   0) (440, 639)  (0, 639)

       then

       projects  the  building's  facade from a perspective view to a rectilinear front-on view. Remember that pamhomography ignores the parentheses and commas used in park_row_rect.map; they merely make the
       file more human-readable. We equivalently could have written

       or any of myriad other variations.

       pamhomography can warp the image to a trapezoid to make it look like it's leaning backwards in 3-D:

       As a very simple example,

       flips the image left-to-right. Note that in this case the target quadrilateral's coordinates are listed in counterclockwise order because that represents  the  correspondence  between  points  (0,  0)
       &harr; (440, 0) and (0, 639) &harr; (639, 0).

       Scaling is also straightforward. The following command scales down the image from 441&times;640 to 341&times;540:

       Let's add 100 pixels of tan border to the above. We use -view and -fill to accomplish that task:

       We can add a border without having to scale the image:

       The -view option can also be used to extract a rectangle out of an image, discarding the rest of the image:

       Specifying the same set of coordinates to -from and -to has the same effect but also allows you to extract non-rectangular quadrilaterals from an image:

       Rotation  is  doable  but  takes  some effort. The challenge is that you need to compute the rotated coordinates yourself. The matrix expression to rotate points \((x_1, y_1)\) \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3,
       y_3)\), and \((x_4, y_4)\) clockwise by \(\theta\) degrees around point \((c_x, c_y)\) is

       \[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & c_x \\ 0 & 1 & c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1  &
       0 & -c_x \\ 0 & 1 & -c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & x_4 \\ y_1 & y_2 & y_3 & y_4 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad. \]

       For example, to rotate park_row.ppm 30&deg; clockwise around (220, 320) you would compute

       \[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 220 \\ 0 & 1 & 320 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \cos 30^{\circ} & -\sin 30^{\circ} & 0 \\ \sin 30^{\circ} & \cos 30^{\circ} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \be‐
       gin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -220 \\ 0 & 1 & -320 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 440 & 440 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 639 & 639 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}  =  \begin{bmatrix}  189.4744  &  570.5256  &
       251.0256 & -130.0256 \\ -67.1281 & 152.8719 & 706.2621 & 486.2621 \\ 1.0000 & 1.0000 & 1.0000 & 1.0000 \end{bmatrix} \quad, \]

       round these coordinates to integers, transpose the matrix, and produce the following map file, park_row_rot30.map:

            571  153
            251  706
           -130  486

       (These are the 'to' coordinates; we use the default, full-image 'from' coordinates.) The mapping then works as in all of the preceding examples:
