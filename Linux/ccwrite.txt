SYNOPSIS
       ccwrite [options] [outputtype] [file(s)]

DESCRIPTION
       :B ccwrite is a simple command-line interface to cclib that allows one to parse one or more computational chemistry output files and convert them into the given format.

OPTIONS
       These options are currently supported:

       -t, --terse
              CJSON by default is not indented for readability to save space. This option is indented for readability.

              Enable more verbose parsing output (only errors by default).

       The output format to write can be one of 'json', 'cjson', 'cml', 'xyz' whereas 'json' and 'cjson' are identical. Further one or more computational chemistry output files to parse and convert.
