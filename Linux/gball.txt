NAME
       GBall - The Console Ball and Racket Game

SYNOPSIS
       gball [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       GBall  is  a  simple yet nice implementation of the well known ball and
       racket game. It is designed to run under the GNU/Linux console (includ‐
       ing  terminal  emulators).  The aim of the game is simple: control your
       racket and move it around to bounce the ball and hit  all  the  bricks.
       If  the  ball  hits  a wall, it will bounce. If it fell down the screen
       without bouncing on the racket, you lose.  The game includes 10  levels
       with an option to play levels randomly, and a high score board.

       The  racket  is controlled by using the arrows keys, or the "a" and "d"
       keys as shown below.

           +---+                 +----+
           |   |                 |    |
           +---+                 +----+
       +---+---+---+        +----+----+----+
       | a |   | d |        | LT |    | RT |
       +---+---+---+        +----+----+----+

       Controlling game speed is easy. Press '9' repeatedly to  decrease  game
       speed,  thus making the ball run slower. Press '0' repeatedly to do the
       opposite, i.e.  make the ball run faster.
