NAME
         trayer - a lightweight GTK2-based systray for UNIX desktop

SYNOPSIS
       trayer  [--edge left|right|top|bottom|none] [--align left|right|center] [--margin <size>] [--widthtype request|pixel|percent ] [--width <size>] [--heighttype <pixel>] [--height <size>] [--SetDock‐
       Type true|false] [--SetPartialStrut true|false]  [--transparent  true|false]  [--alpha  <value>]  [--tint  <color>]  [--distance  <length>]  [--distancefrom  left|right|top|bottom|none]  [--expand
       true|false] [--padding <size>]

DESCRIPTION
       trayer  is small program designed to provide systray functionality present in GNOME / KDE desktop environments for window managers which doesn't support that function. It's similar to other appli‐
       cations such as peksystray and docker.

       trayer code was extracted from fbpanel application, you can find more about it on it's homepage: http://fbpanel.sourceforge.net/

       You can find new versions of trayer and support on FVWM-Crystal project homepage: http://fvwm-crystal.berlios.de/

       trayer-srg was forked from trayer in January 2010 to add some fancy features and clean up code.  It contains all changes from above versions as far as known.  Code of trayer-srg can  be  found  on
       github: http://github.com/sargon/trayer-srg

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              prints help message and exits

       -v, --version
              prints version and exits

       --edge <edge>
              Use EDGE for orientation. Possible values for EDGE are left, right, top, bottom or none.  The default value is bottom.

       --align <alignment>
              Orientation of docked icons inside the trayer panel. Possible values are left, center, right, or none.  The default value is center.

       --margin <size>
              Length of margin in pixels. The default value is 0.

       --distance <length>
              Distance between trayer's window and screen edge (in pixels).  When set to 0 the option has no effect.  The default value is 0.

       --distancefrom <edge>
              Specifies which edge to calculate distance from, see --edge.  The default value is top.
               When --distance is 0 this option has no effect.

       --widthtype request|pixel|percent|none
              Determine how width is calculated.

              request
                     Follow application icons' size, so trayer may shrink or expand dynamically.

              pixel  Set a fixed size, given with --width option in pixels.

              percent
                     Set a fixed size, given with --width option in percentage of a length of screen edge.

              none

              The default value is percent.

       --width <size>
              Width of a panel. When --widthtype=request this option has no effect. The default value is 100.

       --heighttype request|pixel|percent|none
              Determine how height is calculated.

              request
                     Follow application icons' size, so trayer may shrink or expand dynamically.

              pixel  Set a fixed size, given with --height option in pixels.

              percent
                     Set a fixed size, given with --height option in percentage of a length of screen edge.

              none

              The default value is pixel.

       --height <size>
              Height of trayer's window. When --heigthtype=request this option has no effect. The default value is 26.

       --SetDockType true|false
              Identify panel window type as dock. The default value is true.

       --SetPartialStrut true|false
              Reserve panel space so that it will not be covered by maximized windows. The default value is false.

       --transparent true|false
              Use transparency. The default value is false.

       --tint <color>
              Color  used to "tint" transparent background. Color is given as a 24-bit C hexadecimal integer, for example: 0xff0000 is red, 0xff8800 is orange and 0x00ff00 is green.  The default value is
              0xFFFFFFFF.

       --alpha <value>
              Percentage of transparency (0 - nontransparent, 255 - fully transparent).  value should be a value between 0 and 255. The default value is 127.

       --expand true|false
              Specifies if trayer can accommodate extra space or not. The default value is true.

        --padding <size>
              Number of extra pixel space between trayer's window frame and docked icons. The default value is 0.

       --monitor<monitor>
              Define the monitor on which you like trayer to appear. Number of zero to number of monitors minus one, or the string "primary" are valid. The default value is 0.

EXAMPLES
       Place trayer to the top right edge of the screen and prevent other fullsize windows to overlay it:

                trayer trayer --edge top --align right --SetDockType true \
                    --SetPartialStrut true --expand true --transparent true
