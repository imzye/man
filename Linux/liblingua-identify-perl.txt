MAKE-LINGUA-IDENTIFY-LANGUAGE(1p)                                                   User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                   MAKE-LINGUA-IDENTIFY-LANGUAGE(1p)

NAME
       make-lingua-identify-language - creates language modules for Lingua::Identify

SYNOPSIS
         make-lingua-identify-language Language-Tag Language-Name file1 [file2 ...]

       or

         make-lingua-identify-language -d TAG1-LANGUAGE1/ [TAG2-LANGUAGE2/ ...]

       or

         make-lingua-identify

DESCRIPTION
       Creates language modules to be used by Lingua::Identify.

       After creating the modules, you still have to install them.

       Please note that this script is still at an early stage. Please do not even look at the code...

       Without parameters, make-lingua-identify-language assumes mode -d and goes through all the directories in the current one. This is useful to be used in a directory where you something like this:

         .
         |-- en-english
         |   `-- english.txt
         |-- fr-french
         |   `-- french1.txt
         |   `-- french2.txt
         `-- pt-portuguese
             `-- portuguese.txt

   OPTIONS
   -d
       Directory mode. Each parameter passed should be a directory whose name must be of the form tag-name (e.g., en-english/ ). Each of the directories passed should contain text files that can be used
       to train Lingua::Identify.

   -D
       Debug mode. Only for development.

   -h
       Display help and exit.

   -v
       Show version and exit.

   -verbose
       Verbose mode.

   -locale="<locale>"
       Set a specific locale. This way your text will be all lowercased before analysed.

META.yml
       "META.yml" files are not parsed as other files, they are ignored.

       In directory mode ("-d" switch), "META.yml" files are checked for info on languages codes and sets.

       Here's a simple "META.yml" for you to put in your directories:

         two_letter_code:   pt
         three_letter_code: por
         sets:
           spoken_in_portugal

       With that, the language will be identified with the two letter code "pt" or the three letter code "por"; it will also be in the set ":spoken_in_portugal".

CONTRIBUTING WITH NEW LANGUAGES
       Please do not contribute with modules you made yourself. It's easier to contribute with unprocessed text, because that allows for new versions of Lingua::Identify not having to drop languages down
       in case I can't contact you by that time.

       Use make-lingua-identify-language to create a new module for your own personal use, if you must, but try to contribute with unprocessed text rather than those modules.
