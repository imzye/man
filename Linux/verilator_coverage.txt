VERILATOR_COVERAGE(1)                                                                 User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                 VERILATOR_COVERAGE(1)

NAME
       verilator_coverage - Verilator coverage analyzer

SYNOPSIS
           verilator_coverage --help
           verilator_coverage --version

           verilator_coverage --annotate <obj>

           verilator_coverage  -write merged.dat -read <datafiles>...

       Verilator_coverage processes Verilator coverage reports.

       With --anotate, it reads the specified data file and generates annotated source code with coverage metrics annotated.  If multiple coverage points exist on the same line, additional lines will be
       inserted to report the additional points.

       Additional Verilog-standard arguments specify the search paths necessary to find the source code that the coverage analysis was performed on.

       To get correct coverage percentages, you may wish to read logs/coverage.dat into Emacs and do a M-x keep-lines to include only those statistics of interest.

       For Verilog conditions that should never occur, you should add a $stop statement.  This will remove the coverage during the next build.

ARGUMENTS
       filename
           Specify input data file, may be repeated to read multiple inputs.  If no data file is specified, by default coverage.dat is read.

       --annotate output_directory
           Sprcifies the directory name that source files with annotated coverage data should be written to.

       --annotate-all
           Specifies all files should be shown.  By default, only those source files which have low coverage are written to the output directory.

       --annotate-min count
           Specifies the minimum occurrence count that should be flagged if the coverage point does not include a specified threshold.  Defaults to 10.

       --help
           Displays this message and program version and exits.

       --rank
           Print an experimental report listing the relative importance of each test in covering all of the coverage points.  The report shows "Covered" which indicates the number of points that test covers;
           a test is considered to cover a point if it has a bucket count of at least 1. The "rank" column has a higher number t indicate the test is more important, and rank 0 means the test does not need
           to be run to cover the points.  "RankPts" indicates the number of coverage points this test will contribute to overall coverage if all tests are run in the order of highest to lowest rank.

       --unlink
           When using --write to combine coverage data, unlink all input files after the output has been created.

       --version
           Displays program version and exits.

       --write filename
           Specifies the aggregate coverage results, summed across all the files, should be written to the given filename.  This is useful in scripts to combine many sequential runs into one master coverage
           file.

VERILOG ARGUMENTS
       The following arguments are compatible with GCC, VCS and most Verilog programs.

       +libext+ext+ext...
           Defines the extensions for Verilog files.

       +define+var+value =item -Dvar=value
           Defines the given variable.

       +incdir+dir =item -Idir
           Specifies a directory for finding include files.

       -f file
           Specifies a file containing additional command line arguments.

       -y dir
           Specifies a module search directory.
