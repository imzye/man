NAME
       cg-proc - This application is part of ( cg3 )

       This tool is part of the CG-3 constraint grammar system: https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html.

SYNOPSIS
       cg-proc [OPTIONS] grammar_file [input_file [output_file]]

DESCRIPTION
       cg-proc  is the grammar parser and disambiguator in the VISL constraint grammar system. It chooses between different analyses (or "readings") of a word delivered by a morphological analyser based on a
       set of grammatical rules.

       By default, cg-proc reads input from stdin and writes output to stdout. The binary grammar files read by the parser are generated by cg-comp(1)

OPTIONS
       -d:    morphological disambiguation (default behaviour)

       -s:    specify number of sections to process

       -f:    set the format of the I/O stream to NUM,

              where `0' is VISL format and `1' is Apertium format (default: 1)

       -r:    run only the named rule

       -t:    print debug output on stderr

       -w:    enforce surface case on lemma/baseform

              (to work with -w option of lt-proc)

       -n:    do not print out the word form of each cohort

       -1:    only output the first analysis if ambiguity remains

       -z:    flush output on the null character

       -v:    version

       -h:    show this help
