NAME
       public-inbox-learn - spam trainer and remover for public-inbox

SYNOPSIS
         public-inbox-learn <spam|ham|rm> </path/to/RFC2822_message

DESCRIPTION
       public-inbox-learn can remove spam or inject ham messages into an inbox while training a SpamAssassin instance.

       It is intended for users of public-inbox-mda(1) or public-inbox-watch(1), but not users relying on git-fetch(1) to mirror inboxes.

       It reads one message from standard input and operates on it depending on the command given:

COMMANDS
       public-inbox-learn takes one of the following commands as its first and only argument:

       spam    Treat the message as spam.  This will mark the message as removed so it becomes inaccessible via NNTP or WWW endpoints for all configured inboxes.

               The message remains accessible in git history.

               It will also be fed to spamc(1) for training purposes unless "publicinboxmda.spamcheck" is "none" in public-inbox-config(5).

       ham     Treat standard input as ham.  This is useful for manually injecting messages into the archives which failed the spam check run by public-inbox-mda(1) or public-inbox-watch(1).

               It relies on the "To:", "Cc:", and "List-ID:" headers to match configured inbox addresses and "listid" directives.

               It will also be fed to spamc(1) for training purposes unless "publicinboxmda.spamcheck" is "none" in public-inbox-config(5).

       rm      This is similar to the "spam" command above, but does not feed the message to spamc(1) and only removes messages which match on any of the "To:", "Cc:", and "List-ID:" headers.

               The "--all" option may be used match "spam" semantics in removing the message from all configured inboxes.  "--all" is only available in public-inbox 1.6.0+.

       PI_CONFIG
