NAME
       cws-11d.x - manual page for cws-11d.x 2.11

SYNOPSIS
       cws.x -<options>; the first option must be -w, -c, -i, -d or -h.

DESCRIPTION
       This is `cws.x': create weight systems and combined weight systems.

       Options: -h        print this information

       -f     use as filter; otherwise parameters denote I/O files

       -w# [L H] make IP weight systems for #-dimensional polytopes.

              For #>4 the lowest and highest degrees L<=H are required.

              -r/-t make reflexive/transversal weight systems (optional).

       -c#    make combined weight systems for #-dimensional polytopes.  For #<=4 all relevant combinations are made by default, otherwise the following option is required:

              -n[#] followed by the names wf_1 ... wf_# of weight files

              currently #=2,3 are implemented.

              [-t] followed by # numbers n_i specifies the CWS-type, i.e.

              the numbers n_i of weights to be selected from wf_i.  Currently all cases with n_i<=2 are implemented.

       -i     compute  the  polytope data M:p v [F:f] N:p [v] for all IP CWS, where p and v denote the numbers of lattice points and vertices of a dual pair of IP polytopes; an entry F:f and no v for N indi‐
              cates a non-reflexive `dual pair'.

       -d#    compute basic IP weight systems for #-dimensional reflexive Gorenstein cones;

       -r#    specifies the index as #/2.

       -2     adjoin a weight of 1/2 to the input weight system.
