NAME
       PerlIO::utf8_strict - Fast and correct UTF-8 IO

VERSION
       version 0.010

SYNOPSIS
        open my $fh, '<:utf8_strict', $filename;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a fast and correct UTF-8 PerlIO layer. Unlike perl's default ":utf8" layer it checks the input for correctness.

LAYER ARGUMENTS
       allow_noncharacters
       allow_surrogates

EXPORT
       PerlIO::utf8_strict exports no subroutines or symbols, just a perl layer "utf8_strict"

DIAGNOSTICS
       Can't decode ill-formed UTF-8 octet sequence <%s>
           (F) Encountered an ill-formed UTF-8 octet sequence. <%s> contains a hexadecimal representation of the maximal subpart of the ill-formed subsequence.

       Can't interchange noncharacter code point U+%.4X
           (F)  Noncharacters  is permanently reserved for internal use and that should never be interchanged. Noncharacters consist of the values U+nFFFE and U+nFFFF (where n is from 0 to 10^16) and the
           values U+FDD0..U+FDEF.
