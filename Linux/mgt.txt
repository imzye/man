NAME
       wrapmgt - wraps long lines in Smart-Go files to make them safe to post or email

SYNOPSIS
       wrapmgt [nn]

DESCRIPTION
       Wrapmgt  formats Smart-Go files as generated by mgt so that the lines are shorter than nn, the number specified on the command line.  The default format width is 79 characters.  Wrapmgt reads
       its input from stdin and writes to stdout.  This means you should invoke it using I/O redirection which is done under unix and DOS with wrapmgt < infile > outfile.

       The files are formatted in such a way that if the files are viewed in mgt after being formatted, they will look the same as the original.  The new line breaks will be visible from within  the
       editor, however.
