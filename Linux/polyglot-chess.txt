NAME
       polyglot-chess - is a chess engine protocol adaptor. It connects a UCI protocol engine to xboard frontend.

SYNOPSIS
       polyglot-chess <INI files>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the polyglot-chess command.

       polyglot-chess acts as an xboard engine.  There should be no difference with a normal chess program as far as the interface (e.g. scid, knights, xboard) is concerned.

       To use PolyGlot with XBoard, you would type something like this:

       > xboard -fd 'polyglot-chess_dir' -fcp 'polyglot engine.ini'

       Quotes are important when there is a space in the argument.

OPTIONS
       <INI file>

       PolyGlot  is  invoked  using  "polyglot-chess <INI file>".  Note that PolyGlot will look for the INI file in the current directory.  So the user is encuraged to make a .polyglot-chess directory in his
       home and put the <INI files> there. If no <INI file> is given, "polyglot-chess.ini" is selected.
