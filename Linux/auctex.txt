NAME
       update-auctex-elisp - Update AUCTeX automatically generated TeX macros and LaTeX styles data

SYNOPSIS
       update-auctex-elisp [--daemon] [--no-act] [FLAVOR ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  update-auctex-elisp  script  updates  the automatically generated TeX and LaTeX data used by AUCTeX and stored in /var/lib/auctex/<FLAVOR>, where <FLAVOR> stands for any valid installed Emacs
       flavor.

       It is called automatically by the Debian auctex package (via dpkg triggers) whenever new (La)TeX macros and style files are installed in the TeX and METAFONT system trees; beside, it is called  on
       GNU AUCTeX and GNU Emacs flavor upgrades and installations, to ensure up to date parsing.  It may and should also be called manually after additions to the local TeX and METAFONT system tree.

       If no arguments are specified, update-auctex-elisp caters to every supported GNU Emacs flavor installed on the system; else it updates only the specified flavors, if they are installed.
