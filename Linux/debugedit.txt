NAME
       find-debuginfo - finds debuginfo and processes it

SYNOPSIS
       find-debuginfo [OPTION]... [builddir]

DESCRIPTION
       automagically generates debug info and file lists

OPTIONS
       [--strict-build-id]  [-g]  [-r]  [-m]  [-i]  [-n]  [-q]  [-v] [--keep-section SECTION] [--remove-section SECTION] [--g-libs] [--no-ar-files] [-j N] [--jobs N] [-o debugfiles.list] [-S debugsource‐
       files.list] [--run-dwz] [--dwz-low-mem-die-limit N] [--dwz-max-die-limit N] [--dwz-single-file-mode] [--build-id-seed  SEED]  [--unique-debug-suffix  SUFFIX]  [--unique-debug-src-base  BASE]  [[-l
       filelist]... [-p 'pattern'] -o debuginfo.list] [builddir]

       The -g flag says to use strip -g instead of full strip on DSOs or EXEs.  The --g-libs flag says to use strip -g instead of full strip ONLY on DSOs.  Options -g and --g-libs are mutually exclusive.

       The -r flag says to use eu-strip --reloc-debug-sections.

       Use  --keep-section  SECTION  or  --remove-section  SECTION to explicitly keep a (non-allocated) section in the main executable or explicitly remove it into the .debug file. SECTION is an extended
       wildcard pattern.  Both options can be given more than once.

       The --strict-build-id flag says to exit with failure status if any ELF binary processed fails to contain a build-id note.

       The -m flag says to include a .gnu_debugdata section (MiniDebugInfo) in the main binary.

       The -i flag says to include a .gdb_index section in the .debug file.

       The -n flag says to not recompute the build-id.

       The -j, --jobs N option will spawn N processes to do the debuginfo extraction in parallel.

       A single -o switch before any -l or -p switches simply renames the primary output file from debugfiles.list to something else.  A -o switch that follows a -p switch or some -l switches produces an
       additional output file with the debuginfo for the files in the -l filelist file, or whose names match the -p pattern.  The -p argument is an grep -E -style regexp matching the  a  file  name,  and
       must not use anchors (^ or $).

       The  --run-dwz  flag instructs find-debuginfo to run the dwz utility if available, and --dwz-low-mem-die-limit and --dwz-max-die-limit provide detailed limits.  See dwz(1) -l and -L option for de‐
       tails.  Use --dwz-single-file-mode to disable multi-file mode, see dwz(1) -m for more details.

       If --build-id-seed SEED is given then debugedit is called to update the build-ids it finds adding the SEED as seed to recalculate the build-id hash.  This makes sure the build-ids in the ELF files
       are unique between versions and releases of the same package.  (Use --build-id-seed "%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}".)

       If --unique-debug-suffix SUFFIX is given then the debug files created for <FILE> will be named <FILE>-<SUFFIX>.debug.  This makes sure .debug are unique between package version, release and archi‐
       tecture.  (Use --unique-debug-suffix "-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{_arch}".)

       If --unique-debug-src-base BASE is given then the source directory will be called /usr/debug/src/<BASE>.  This makes sure the debug source dirs are unique  between  package  version,  release  and
       achitecture (Use --unique-debug-src-base "%{name}-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{_arch}")

       If  --no-ar-files  is  given,  then static libraries will be ignored.  Otherwise, they receive only with source-path rewriting and collection.  They are not stripped, since they have no persistent
       build-ids to accommodate eventual reunification.

       The -q or --quiet flag silences all non-error output from the script.  The -v or --verbose flag add more output for all files processed.  When neither -q or -v is given then only output  for  each
       pass is given.

       All file names in switches are relative to builddir ('.' if not given).
