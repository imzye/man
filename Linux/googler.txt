GOOGLER(1)                                                                                   User Commands                                                                                  GOOGLER(1)

NAME
       googler - Google from the command-line

SYNOPSIS
       googler [OPTIONS] [KEYWORD [KEYWORD ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       googler is a command-line tool to search Google (web, news, videos and site search) from the terminal. Google site search works too. googler shows the title, URL and text context for each re‐
       sult. Results are fetched in pages. Next or previous page navigation is possible using keyboard shortcuts. Results are indexed and a result URL can be opened in a browser using the index num‐
       ber. There is no configuration file as aliases serve the same purpose for this utility. Supports sequential searches in a single instance.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help text and exit.

       -s, --start=N
              Start at the Nth result.

       -n, --count=N
              Show N results (default 10).

       -N, --news
              Show results from news section.

       -c, --tld=TLD
              Country-specific search with top-level domain .TLD, e.g., in for India.

       -l, --lang=LANG
              Search for the language LANG, e.g., fi for Finnish.

       -g, --geoloc=CC
              Country-specific geolocation search with country code CC, e.g. 'in' for India. Country codes are the same as top-level domains.

       -x, --exact
              Disable automatic spelling correction. Search exact keywords.

       -C, --nocolor
              Disable color output.

       --colors=COLORS
              Set output colors. Refer to the COLORS section below for details.

       -j, --first, --lucky
              Open the first result in a web browser; implies --noprompt. Feeling Lucky?

       -t, --time=dN
              Time limit search [h5 (5 hrs), d5 (5 days), w5 (5 weeks), m5 (5 months), y5 (5 years)].

       -w, --site=SITE
              Search a site using Google.

       -e, --exclude=EXCLUDE
              Exclude site from results.

       --unfilter
              Do not omit similar results.

       -p, --proxy=PROXY
              Tunnel  traffic  through an HTTP proxy. PROXY is of the form [http://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]. The proxy server must support HTTP CONNECT tunneling and must not block port 443
              for the relevant Google hosts. If a proxy is not explicitly given, the https_proxy environment variable (if available) is used instead.

       --noua Disable user agent. Results are fetched faster.

       --notweak
              Disable TCP optimizations. Negotiate Transport Layer Security protocol instead of forcing TLS 1.2 (on Python 3.4 and above). Should be used only in case of connection issues.

       --json Output in JSON format; implies --noprompt.

       --url-handler=UTIL
              Custom script or command-line utility to open urls with.

       --show-browser-logs
              Do not suppress browser output when opening result in browser; that is, connect stdout and stderr of the browser to googler's stdout  and  stderr  instead  of  /dev/null.  By  default,
              browser output is suppressed (due to certain graphical browsers spewing messages to console) unless the BROWSER environment variable is a known text-based browser: elinks, links, lynx,
              w3m or www-browser.

       --np, --noprompt
              Perform search and exit; do not prompt for further interactions.

       -u, --upgrade
              Perform  in-place  self-upgrade.  By default, the latest stable version is used. However, the latest git master is used instead if --include-git is also supplied. This mechanism is not
              available on Windows (including Cygwin), and if you installed googler with a package manager, this mechanism may have been disabled by your packager at packaging or install time.

       --include-git
              See --upgrade.

       -v, --version
              Show version number and exit.

       -d, --debug
              Enable debugging.

OMNIPROMPT KEYS
       n, p   Fetch the next or previous set of search results.

       index  Open the result corresponding to index in browser.

       f      Jump to the first page.

       o [index|range|a ...]
              Open space-separated result indices, numeric ranges (sitelinks unsupported in ranges) or all indices, if 'a' is specified, in the browser. Open the current search in the browser, if no
              arguments.

       O [index|range|a ...]
              Works similar to key 'o', but tries to ignore text-based browsers (even if BROWSER is set) and open links in a GUI browser.

       g keywords
              Initiate a new Google search for keywords with original options. This key should be used to search omniprompt keys (including itself) and indices.

       c index
              Copy url to clipboard.

       u      Toggle url expansion.

       q, ^D, double Enter
              Exit googler.

       ?      Show omniprompt help.

       *      Any other string initiates a new search with original options.

GOOGLER @T
       googler @t is a convenient add-on to Google Site Search with unique keywords. While googler has an integrated option to search a site, it could be simplified further with  aliases.  The  file
       googler_at (https://github.com/jarun/googler/blob/master/auto-completion/googler_at/googler_at) contains a list of website search aliases. To source it, run:

           source googler_at

       or

           . googler_at

       With googler @t, the following command searches Wikipedia for hexspeak:

           @w hexspeak

       Other googler options can be combined. The shell can be configured to be source the file at start-up for further convenience.

       All the aliases start with the @ symbol (hence the name googler @t) and there is minimum chance they will conflict with any shell commands. Users can add new aliases to the file.

COLORS
       googler allows you to customize the color scheme via a six-letter string, reminiscent of BSD LSCOLORS. The six letters represent the colors of

       - indices
       - titles
       - URLs
       - metadata/publishing info (Google News only)
       - abstracts
       - prompts

       respectively. The six-letter string is passed in either as the argument to the --colors option, or as the value of the environment variable GOOGLER_COLORS.

       We offer the following colors/styles:
         ┌────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
         │ Letter │ Color/Style                                       │

       The default colors string is GKlgxy, which stands for

       - bold bright cyan indices
       - bold bright green titles
       - bright yellow URLs
       - cyan metadata/publishing info
       - normal abstracts
       - reverse video prompts

       Note that

       - Bright colors (implemented as \x1b[90m - \x1b[97m) may not be available in all color-capable terminal emulators;

       - Some terminal emulators draw bold text in bright colors instead;

       - Some terminal emulators only distinguish between bold and bright colors via a default-off switch.

       Please consult the manual of your terminal emulator as well as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code for details.

EXAMPLES
       1.  Google hello world:

              googler hello world

       2.  Fetch 15 results updated within the last 14 months, starting from the 3rd result for the keywords jungle book in site imdb.com:

              googler -n 15 -s 3 -t m14 -w imdb.com jungle book

       3.  Read recent news on gadgets:

              googler -N gadgets

       4.  Fetch results on IPL cricket from Google India server in English:

              googler -c in -l en IPL cricket

       5.  Search quoted text:

              googler it\'s a \"beautiful world\" in spring

       6.  Search for a specific file type:

              googler instrumental filetype:mp3

       7.  Disable automatic spelling correction, e.g. fetch results for googler instead of google:

              googler -x googler

       8.  I'm feeling lucky search:

              googler -j leather jackets

       9.  Website specific search:

              googler -w amazon.com -w ebay.com digital camera

           Site specific search continues at omniprompt.

       10. Alias to find definitions of words:

              alias define='googler -n 2 define'

       11. Look up n, p, o, O, q, g keywords or a result index at the omniprompt: as the omniprompt recognizes these keys or index strings as commands, you need to prefix them with g, e.g.,

              g n
              g g keywords
              g 1

       12. Input and output redirection:

              googler -C hello world < input > output

           Note that -C is required to avoid printing control characters (for colored output).

       13. Pipe output:

              googler -C hello world | tee output

       14. Use a custom color scheme, e.g., one warm color scheme designed for Solarized Dark:

              googler --colors bjdxxy google

              GOOGLER_COLORS=bjdxxy googler google

       15. Tunnel traffic through an HTTPS proxy, e.g., a local Privoxy instance listening on port 8118:

              googler --proxy localhost:8118 google

           By default the environment variable https_proxy is used, if defined.

       16. Quote multiple search keywords to auto-complete (using completion script):

              googler 'hello w<TAB>
