NAME
       pam_passwdqc — Password quality-control PAM module

SYNOPSIS
       [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_passwdqc [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  pam_passwdqc  module  is  a  simple password strength checking module for PAM.  In addition to checking regular passwords, it offers support for passphrases and can provide randomly generated
       ones.

       The pam_passwdqc module provides functionality for only one PAM management group: password changing.  In terms of the module-type parameter, this is the “password” feature.

       The pam_chauthtok() service function may ask the user for a new password, and verify that it meets certain minimum standards.  If the chosen password is unsatisfactory, the  service  function  re‐
       turns PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR.

       The  set  of options that may be passed to the module is exactly the same as the set of options that may be specified in the configuration file (suggested location /etc/passwdqc.conf, to be speci‐
       fied in the config=/etc/passwdqc.conf option).  These options are described in passwdqc.conf(5).

AUTHORS
       The pam_passwdqc module was written for Openwall GNU/*/Linux by Solar Designer <solar at openwall.com>.  This manual page was written for the FreeBSD Project by ThinkSec AS and NAI Labs, the Secu‐
       rity Research Division of Network Associates, Inc. under DARPA/SPAWAR contract N66001-01-C-8035 (“CBOSS”), as part of the DARPA CHATS research program.  It has since been revised, most importantly
       to refer to passwdqc.conf(5) instead of describing the options right on this page.
