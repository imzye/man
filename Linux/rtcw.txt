NAME
       wolfmp - Return to Castle Wolfenstein multi-player

SYNOPSIS
       wolfmp [-h|--help] [-q|--quiet] [+set option value]...  [+command] ...

DESCRIPTION
       wolfmp runs the multi-player version of the first-person shooter Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

OPTIONS
       The wrapper script used for RTCW in Debian accepts these options:

       -h, --help
              Display a short help summary

       -q, --quiet
              Disable all output

       Any console command can also be prefixed with + and used as a command-line option (press Shift+Esc to access the in-game console), including:

       +set option value
              Set an option (see below for some options)

       +connect server[:port]
              Connect to a server

       Options that can be set with +set (note that this is not a full list!) include:

       r_fullscreen <bool>
              1: Play in fullscreen mode; 0: Play in window mode

       r_mode <num>
              Sets the screen resolution mode. Set num to -1 to use a customized resolution set via r_customheight and r_customwidth, or -2 to use your normal desktop resolution.

       r_customwidth <pixels>
              Use pixels as width if r_mode is set to -1.

       r_customheight <pixels>
              Use pixels as height if r_mode is set to -1.

FILES
       ~/.wolf/main
              Configuration and state for RTCW

ENVIRONMENT
       The wrapper script used to launch RTCW allows it to be debugged by setting environment variables.

       RTCW_DEBUGGER=command
              A debugger or other prefix to prepend to the RTCW command line, such as strace; overridden by RTCW_BACKTRACE

       RTCW_BACKTRACE=1
              Use gdb(1) to get a backtrace if RTCW crashes (the gdb package must be installed for this to work)
