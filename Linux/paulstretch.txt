NAME
       paulstretch - Extreme Sound Time-Stretch

SYNOPSIS
       paulstretch

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a  program  for  stretching  the audio.  It is suitable only for extreme sound stretching of the audio (like 50x) and for applying special effects by "spectral smoothing" the sounds.  It can
       transform any sound/music to a texture.

       It produces high quality extreme sound stretching. While most sound stretching software sounds bad when trying to stretch the sounds a lot, this one is optimized for extreme sound stretching.

       The stretch amount is unlimited.  You can play the stretched sound in real-time (including the possibility to "freeze" the sound) or you can render the whole sound or a part of it to audio files.
