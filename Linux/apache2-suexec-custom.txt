NAME
       suexec - Switch User For Exec

SYNOPSIS
       suexec -V

       This is a customized version that can be configured with config files in /etc/apache2/suexec.

       No other synopsis for usage, because this program is otherwise only used internally by the Apache HTTP server.

DESCRIPTION
       suexec  is  the "wrapper" support program for the suexec behaviour for the Apache HTTP server.  It is run from within the server automatically to switch the user when an external program has to be
       run  under  a  different  user.  For  more  information  about  suexec  in  general,  see  the  online  document  `Apache  suexec  Support'   on   the   HTTP   server   project's   Web   site   at
       http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html .

       This version of suexec reads a config file on every execution. Therefore it is a bit slower than the standard suexec version from the apache2-suexec package.

CONFIGURATION
       If  suexec  is  called  by  a user with name 'username', it will look into /etc/apache2/suexec/username for configuration. If the file does not exist, suexec will abort. By creating several config
       files, you can allow several different apache run users to use suexec.

       The first line in the file is used as the document root (/var/www in the standard suexec) and the second line in the file is used as the suffix that is appended to users'  home  directories  (pub‐
       lic_html in standard suexec).

       If any of the lines is commented out (with #), suexec will refuse the corresponding type of request. It is recommended to comment out the userdir suffix if you don't need it.

SECURITY
       Do  not  set  the document root to a path that includes users' home directories (like /home or /var) or directories where users can mount removable media.  Doing so would create local security is‐
       sues. Suexec does not allow one to set the document root to the root directory / .

OPTIONS
       -V     Display the list of compile-time settings used when suexec was built.  No other action is taken.

FILES
       /etc/apache2/suexec/www-data
