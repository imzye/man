NAME
       avahi.service - avahi-daemon static service file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/avahi/services/*.service

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/avahi/services/*.service  are  XML  fragments  containing static DNS-SD service data. Every service file can contain multiple service definitions which share the same name. This is useful for
       publishing service data for services which implement multiple protocols. (i.e. a printer implementing _ipp._tcp and _printer._tcp)

XML TAGS
       <service-group> The document tag of avahi service files. Should contain one <name> and one or more <service> elements.

       <name replace-wildcards="yes|no"> The service name. If replace-wildcards is "yes", any occurence of the string "%h" will be replaced by the local host name. This can be used for service names like
       "Remote Terminal on %h". If replace-wildcards is not specified, defaults to "no".

       <service protocol="ipv4|ipv6|any"> Contains the service information for exactly one service type. Should contain one <type> and one <port> element. Optionally it may contain one <domain-name>, one
       <host-name>, any number of <subtype> and any number of <txt-record> elements. The attribute protocol specifies the protocol to advertise the service on. If any is used (which is the default), the
       service will be advertised on both IPv4 and IPv6.

       <type> Contains the DNS-SD service type for this service. e.g. "_http._tcp".

       <subtype> Contains an additional DNS-SD service subtype for this service. e.g. "_anon._sub._ftp._tcp".

       <domain-name> The domain name this service should be registered. If omited defaults to the default domain of the avahi daemon. (probably .local)

       <host-name> The host name of the host that provides this service. This should be a host that is resolvable by multicast or unicast DNS. Please note that you need to specify a fully-qualified do‐
       main name (FQDN) here, i.e. .local is not appended implicitly! The host name doesn't need to be part of the domain specified in <domain-name>. See avahi.hosts(5) for more information how to pub‐
       lish additional host name mappings.

       <port> The IP port number the service listens on.

       <txt-record value-format="text|binary-hex|binary-base64"> DNS-SD TXT record data. If value-format is "text", the value of the TXT record is taken verbatim. If value-format is "binary-hex" then the
       value of TXT record is decoded by taking pairs of characters after the "=" char and interpreting them as the textual representation of the two-digit hexadecimal number. Both uppercase and lower‐
       case hexadecimal digits are allowed. The 0x or 0X prefix is not allowed. This requires the length of the value to be even. If value-format is "binary-base64" then the value of TXT record is de‐
       coded with a base64 decoder. The character set used is A-Za-z0-9+/. This requires the length of the value to be a multiple of 4, with "=" as padding at the end. If value-format is not specified,
       defaults to "text". Examples (all the values are decoded to the string "value" without quotes):

              <txt-record>key=value<txt-record>

              <txt-record value-format="text">key=value<txt-record>

              <txt-record value-format="binary-hex">key=76616c7565<txt-record>

              <txt-record value-format="binary-base64">key=dmFsdWU=<txt-record>
