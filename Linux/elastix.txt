NAME
       transformix - manual page for transformix version: 5.2.0

DESCRIPTION
       transformix version: 5.2.0

       transformix applies a transform on an input image and/or generates a deformation field.  The transform is specified in the transform-parameter file.

       --help, -h displays this message and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   Call transformix from the command line with mandatory arguments:
       -out   output directory

       -tp    transform-parameter file, only 1

   Optional extra commands:
       -in    input image to deform

       -def   file  containing  input-image points; the point are transformed according to the specified transform-parameter file use "-def all" to transform all points from the input-image, which effec‐
              tively generates a deformation field.

       -jac   use "-jac all" to generate an image with the determinant of the spatial Jacobian

       -jacmat
              use "-jacmat all" to generate an image with the spatial Jacobian matrix at each voxel

       -loglevel set the log level to "off", "error", "warning", or "info" (default),

       -priority set the process priority to high, abovenormal, normal (default),

              belownormal, or idle (Windows only option)

       -threads
              set the maximum number of threads of transformix

       At least one of the options "-in", "-def", "-jac", or "-jacmat" should be given.

       The transform-parameter file must contain all the information necessary for transformix to run properly. That includes which transform to use, with which  parameters,  etc.  For  a  usable  trans‐
       form-parameter file, run elastix, and inspect the output file "TransformParameters.0.txt".
