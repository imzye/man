NAME
       odbx-sql - Swiss army knife for communicating with databases and interactive SQL shell

SYNOPSIS
       odbx-sql [-?] [-b backend] [-c configfile] [-d database] [-f delimiter] [-h host] [-i] [-k keywordfile] [-p port] [-s separator] [-u username] [-w]

DESCRIPTION
       odbx-sql  is  a  small  and flexible utiltiy to communicate with the databases supported by the OpenDBX library. In batch mode, it's main purpose is automating tasks in shell scripts which require
       working with databases. On the other side, the interactive mode provides a convenient SQL shell for modifying database content or testing statements. The format of the output can be controlled  to
       some extend by defining strings for separation between columns and for delimiting field values.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help including a short description of available options.

       -b, --backend=name
              Name of the database backend that should be used or path to the backend library of the OpenDBX driver.

       -c, --config=configfile
              Configuration  file with parameters required for connecting to the database. The file can include values for the backend that should be used, the host name or ip address (and maybe the port
              if required), the database name and the user and password. These values should be placed into the configuration file to be able to access them from non-interactive program execution  savely
              without revealing the password anywhere. A full example of such a configuration file can be found in the example section of this manual.

       -d, --database=name
              Name of the database on the server or path to the database file in the local file system.

       -f, --delimiter=character
              Single character or string that should surround field values which are returned by SELECT-like statements and printed to stdout.

       -h, --host=name
              Host name, IP address or path to the database file. It can also be the path to a named pipe in order to communicate to the database server only locally.

       -i, --interactive
              Run in interactive mode and provide a convenient SQL shell contrary to batch mode which is waiting for input from stdin and printing results to stdout.

       -k keywordfile
              Location of a keyword file used for providing auto-completion of keywords.

       -p, --port=port
              TCP/IP  port  name  or  number the database server is listening to. If this parameter isn't added at the command line, most database client libraries use the default value. Many but not all
              database server can resolve the port number from its name and for a maximum of portability the parameter value should be the port number.

       -s separator
              Single character or string that should separate field values which are returned by SELECT-like statements and printed to stdout.

       -u, --username=name
              Name of the user which is sent to the database server for authentication.

       -w, --password
              Prompt for a password at the command line.

EXAMPLES
       Configuration file

        backend = mysql
        host = localhost
        port = 3306
        database = test
        username = myuser
        password = secret

       Starting in interactive mode

       odbx-sql -c mysql.conf -i

       Executing commands in batch mode

       cat stmt.sql | odbx-sql -c mysql.conf

EXIT STATUS
       odbx-sql returns 1 if an error occured and 0 if all commands succeeded or only warnings are reported. If warnings occur, they are written to stderr.
