NAME
       qexo - the XQuery language implemented on a Java VM

SYNOPSIS
       qexo [options]
       java kawa.repl --xquery [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the qexo package, an XQuery implementation written completely in the Java language.  XQuery expressions are compiled into Java bytecodes for efficiency.

       XQuery is a new language designed for querying, manipulating, and generating XML and similar data sets.

       Using the qexo script is equivalent to invoking an interpreter of the Java language on the kawa.repl class and specifying the --xquery option.

       This manual page is just a quick synopsis.  For more information, see the links below.

OPTIONS
       -e expression
              Evaluate the expression.

       -c expression
              Evaluate the expression, but does not cause the start-up file ~/.kawarc.scm to be read.

       -f filename
              Read and evaluate XQuery expressions from the filename.

       -s     Enter an interactive read-evaluate-print command loop.

       -w     Enter an interactive read-evaluate-print in a new top-level window.

       -C filename
              Compile filename to one or more Java class files.  See the Kawa manual for details.

       If no options are specified, it is equivalent to -s.
       GNU readline(3) can normally be used to edit commands.

FILES
       /usr/bin/qexo
              The qexo executable just invokes kawa(1) with the --xquery option.

       ~/.kawarc.scm
              Commands that are executed when qexo (or kawa) is started.
