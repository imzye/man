NAME
       eboard - a graphical chess board

SYNOPSIS
       eboard [-log] [-debug] [-dgtport device ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly describes the eboard command.

       eboard  is  a  graphical  chess board. It acts as an interface to chess engines (like GNU Chess, Sjeng and Crafty) and Internet Chess Servers (ICS) like FICS
       (http://www.freechess.org), and works as a browser for chess games saved as PGN (Portable Game Notation) files.  eboard itself is  not  a  chess  engine:  it
       won't play games, it will just act as a graphical interface between programs that play games like GNU chess (or ICS servers) and the end-user.

       To  move pieces click on the source square and then click to destination square. Optionally, you may drag the piece from the source to the destination square
       (you won't see the piece being dragged). To drop pieces on crazyhouse and bughouse variants (ICS-only) right-click the  destination  square  and  select  the
       piece to drop from the popup menu.

       For help with ICS commands consult the server (most of them have online help and help channels).

       For  help  setting up associated programs (chess engines, timestamping, etc.)  see the documentation in /usr/share/doc/eboard or visit the eboard web site at
       https://github.com/fbergo/eboard. If the documentation is not installed in your system, you can find it in the source distribution, available  from  the  web
       site.

OPTIONS
       -log   Log network communications to "~/LOG.eboard". Communications held in password mode are not logged.

       -debug Print miscellaneous debug info to "~/DEBUG.eboard".

       -dgtport device
              Use the DGT board connected to the given device.
