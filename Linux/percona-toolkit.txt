NAME
       pt-sift - Browses files created by pt-stalk.

SYNOPSIS
       Usage: pt-sift FILE|PREFIX|DIRECTORY

       pt-sift browses files created by pt-stalk.  If no options are given, the tool browses all pt-stalk files in "/var/lib/pt-stalk" if that directory exists, else the current working directory is
       used.  If a FILE is given, the tool browses files with the same prefix in the given file's directory.  If a PREFIX is given, the tool browses files in "/var/lib/pt-stalk" (or the current working
       directory) with the same prefix.  If a DIRECTORY is given, the tool browses all pt-stalk files in it.

RISKS
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

DESCRIPTION
       pt-sift  downloads  other tools that it might need, such as pt-diskstats, and then makes a list of the unique timestamp prefixes of all the files in the directory, as written by the pt-stalk tool.
       If the user specified a timestamp on the command line, then it begins with that sample of data; otherwise it begins by showing a list of the timestamps and prompting for a selection.   Thereafter,
       it displays a summary of the selected sample, and the user can navigate and inspect with keystrokes.  The keystroke commands you can use are as follows:

       •   d

           Sets the action to start the pt-diskstats tool on the sample's disk performance statistics.

       •   i

           Sets the action to view the first INNODB STATUS sample in less.

       •   m

           Displays the first 4 samples of SHOW STATUS counters side by side with the pt-mext tool.

       •   n

           Summarizes the first sample of netstat data in two ways: by originating host, and by connection state.

       •   j

           Select the next timestamp as the active sample.

       •   k

           Select the previous timestamp as the active sample.

       •   q

           Quit the program.

       •   1

           Sets the action for each sample to the default, which is to view a summary of the sample.

       •   Sets the action to just list the files in the sample.

       •   *

           Sets the action to view all of the sample's files in the less program.
