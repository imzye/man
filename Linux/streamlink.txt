OPTIONS
   Positional arguments
       URL    A URL to attempt to extract streams from.

              Usually, the protocol of http(s) URLs can be omitted (https://), depending on the implementation of the plugin being used.

              Alternatively, the URL can also be specified by using the --url option.

       STREAM Stream to play.

              Use best or worst for selecting the highest or lowest available quality.

              Fallback streams can be specified by using a comma-separated list:

                 "720p,480p,best"

              If no stream is specified and --default-stream is not used, then a list of available streams will be printed.

   General options
       -h

       --help Show this help message and exit.

       -V

       --version
              Show version string and exit.

       --version-check
              Run a version check and exit.

       --auto-version-check {yes,true,1,on,no,false,0,off}
              Unused, kept for compatibility reasons.

              Default is: "no".

       --config FILENAME
              Load options from this config file.

              Can be repeated to load multiple files, in which case the options are merged on top of each other where the last config has highest priority.

       --no-config
              Disable loading any default or custom config files.

       --locale LOCALE
              Override the system's locale setting, for selecting the preferred subtitle and audio language.

              The locale is formatted as [language_code]_[country_code], e.g. en_US or es_ES.

              Default is: system locale.

   Logging arguments
       -l LEVEL

       --loglevel LEVEL
              Set the log message threshold.

              Valid levels are, in order of increasing verbosity:

              none, critical, error, warning, info, debug, trace, all

              Default is: "info".

       --logformat FORMAT
              Set a custom logging format.

              See  the  Python  standard library's logging.Formatter docs for more information about the logging format and the available LogRecord attributes. Streamlink's formatter uses the curly brace
              style.

              The default format depends on the chosen log level.

              For verbose levels (trace and all):

              Default is: "[{asctime}][{threadName}][{name}][{levelname}] {message}".

              Otherwise:

              Default is: "[{name}][{levelname}] {message}".

       --logdateformat DATEFORMAT
              Set a custom logging date format.

              This formats the LogRecord's asctime attribute via strftime().

              The default date format depends on the chosen log level.

              For verbose levels (trace and all):

              Default is: "%H:%M:%S.%f".

              Otherwise:

              Default is: "%H:%M:%S".

       --logfile FILE
              Append log output to FILE instead of writing to stdout/stderr.

              User prompts and download progress won't be written to FILE.

              A value of - (dash) will set the file name to an ISO8601-like string and will choose the following default log directories.

              Windows:

                 %TEMP%\streamlink\logs

              macOS:

                 ${HOME}/Library/Logs/streamlink

              Linux/BSD:

                 ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/state}/streamlink/logs

       -Q

       --quiet
              Suppress all console and log output, and also disable user prompts.

       -j

       --json Output JSON representations instead of the normal text output.

              Useful for external scripting.

   Plugin options
       --plugins
              Print a list of all currently installed plugins.

       --show-matchers PLUGIN
              Show the list of matchers of a specific plugin (URL regex pattern with opt. priority and opt. name).

              The output is a human-readable pseudo YAML format. Please use --json when reading matcher data programmatically.

       --can-handle-url URL
              Check if Streamlink has a plugin that can handle the specified URL.

              Status code is 0 on success, 1 on failure.

              Useful for external scripting.

       --can-handle-url-no-redirect URL
              Same as --can-handle-url, but without following redirects when looking up the URL.

       --no-plugin-cache
              Disable I/O of the plugin key-value store.

              If disabled, plugins won't be able to load or store data like cookies, authentication data, etc.  The data which is loaded or stored depends on each plugin implementation.

       --no-plugin-sideloading
              Disable automatic sideloading of third-party plugins from the default location.

              See the plugin-sideloading documentation for where third-party plugins are loaded from.

       --plugin-dir DIRECTORY
              Load additional plugins from this directory.

              Can be set multiple times to load plugins from multiple directories.

       --plugin-dirs DIRECTORY
              Load additional plugins from a list of comma-separated directories. (deprecated)

   Network arguments
       --interface INTERFACE
              Set the network interface.

       -4

       --ipv4 Resolve address names to IPv4 only. This option overrides --ipv6.

       -6

       --ipv6 Resolve address names to IPv6 only. This option overrides --ipv4.

   Player options
       -p PATH

       --player PATH
              Set the player executable that will be launched (unless a different output method was chosen).

              Either set an absolute or relative path to the player executable, or just set the executable's name if it can be resolved from the paths of the system's PATH environment variable.

              In addition to setting the player executable path, custom player arguments can be set via --player-args.

              NOTE:
                 In the past, --player allowed defining additional player arguments, which as a consequence required wrapping player paths that contained spaces in quotation marks.  This  is  unsupported
                 since release 6.0.0.

              Default is: VLC player, if available.

       -a ARGUMENTS

       --player-args ARGUMENTS
              Set a string of custom --player launch arguments that will be parsed and tokenized.

              The value can contain formatting variables surrounded by curly braces, { and }.  Curly brace characters can be escaped by doubling, e.g. {{ and }}.

              Available formatting variables:

              {playerinput}
                     This  is  the input argument that the --player will receive. For standard input (stdin), it is - (dash), but it can also be a file path or URL, depending on the options used.  If un‐
                     set, then the player input argument will be appended to the parsed player arguments list.

              {playertitleargs}
                     The automatically generated player title arguments, if a supported --player was found. See --title for more.  If  unset,  automatically  generated  player  title  arguments  will  be
                     prepended to the parsed player arguments list.

              Example:

                 streamlink -p vlc -a "--play-and-exit --no-one-instance" <url> [stream]

              Default is: "".

       --player-env KEY=VALUE
              Add  an  additional environment variable to the spawned --player process, in addition to the ones inherited from the Streamlink/Python parent process. This allows setting player environment
              variables in config files.

              Can be repeated to add multiple environment variables.

       -v

       --player-verbose
              Write the --player's stdout/stderr output to Streamlink's stdout/stderr output.

       --verbose-player
              Deprecated in favor of --player-verbose.

       -n

       --player-fifo
              Make the --player read the stream through a named pipe instead of the stdin pipe.

       --fifo Deprecated in favor of --player-fifo.

       --player-http
              Make the --player read the stream through HTTP instead of the stdin pipe.

       --player-continuous-http
              Make the --player read the stream through HTTP, but unlike --player-http, it will continuously try to open the stream if the player requests it.

              This enables the handling of stream disconnects if the player is capable of reconnecting to a HTTP stream. This is usually done by setting the player to a "repeat mode".

       --player-external-http
              Serve stream data through HTTP without opening the --player. This is useful to allow external devices like smartphones or streaming boxes to watch streams they wouldn't be  able  to  other‐
              wise.

              The default behavior is similar to the --player-continuous-http option, but no player program will be started, and the server will listen on all available connections instead of just in the
              local (loopback) interface.

              See --player-external-http-interface for choosing a specific network interface, and see --player-external-http-port for choosing a non-randomized port.

              Optionally, the --player-external-http-continuous option allows for disabling the continuous run-mode, so that Streamlink will stop when the stream ends.

              The URLs that can be used to access the stream will be printed to the console, and the server can be interrupted using CTRL-C.

       --player-external-http-continuous {yes,true,1,on,no,false,0,off}
              Set the run-mode of --player-external-http to continuous or non-continuous.

              In the continuous run-mode, Streamlink will keep running after the stream has ended and will wait for the next HTTP request being made unless it gets shut down via CTRL-C.

              If set to non-continuous, Streamlink will stop once the stream has ended.

              Default is: true.

       --player-external-http-interface INTERFACE
              Set the network interface on which the HTTP server will be listening on.  If unset or set to 0.0.0.0, all available interfaces will be bound.

       --player-external-http-port PORT
              Set the port of the external HTTP server if that mode is enabled.  Omit or set to 0 to use a random high ( >1024) port.

       --player-passthrough TYPES
              A comma-delimited list of stream types to pass to the --player as a URL to let it handle the transport of the stream instead of Streamlink.

              Stream types that can be converted into a playable URL are:

              hls, http

              Make sure the player can handle the stream type when using this.

       --player-no-close
              By default, Streamlink will close the --player when the stream ends.  This is to avoid "dead" GUI players lingering after Streamlink has exited.

              It does however have the side-effect of sometimes closing a player before it has played back all of its cached data.

              This option will instead let the player decide when to exit.

       -t TITLE

       --title TITLE
              Change the title of the --player's window.

              Please  see  the "Metadata variables" section of Streamlink's CLI documentation for all available metadata variables, as well as the "Plugins" section for the list of metadata variables de‐
              fined in each plugin.

              Only the following players are supported:

              mpv, potplayer, vlc

              Example:

                 streamlink -p mpv --title "{author} - {category} - {title}" <URL> [STREAM]

   File output options
       -O

       --stdout
              Write stream data to stdout instead of playing it in the --player.

       -o FILENAME

       --output FILENAME
              Write stream data to FILENAME instead of playing it in the --player.  If FILENAME is set to - (dash), then the stream data will be written to stdout, similar to the --stdout argument.

              Directories and subdirectories will be created if they do not exist, if filesystem permissions allow.

              Unless --force is set, Streamlink will ask for confirmation before writing if FILENAME already exists.

              Please see the "Metadata variables" section of Streamlink's CLI documentation for all available metadata variables, as well as the "Plugins" section for the list of metadata  variables  de‐
              fined in each plugin.

              Unsupported characters in substituted variables will be replaced with an underscore.

              Example:

                 streamlink --output "~/recordings/{author}/{category}/{id}-{time:%Y%m%d%H%M%S}.ts" <URL> [STREAM]

       -r FILENAME

       --record FILENAME
              Write  stream  data  to FILENAME while at the same time allowing playback in the --player or writing it to --stdout.  If FILENAME is set to - (dash), then the stream data will be written to
              stdout, similar to the --stdout argument, while still opening the player.

              Directories and subdirectories will be created if they do not exist, if filesystem permissions allow.

              Unless --force is set, Streamlink will ask for confirmation before writing if FILENAME already exists.

              Please see the "Metadata variables" section of Streamlink's CLI documentation for all available metadata variables, as well as the "Plugins" section for the list of metadata  variables  de‐
              fined in each plugin.

              Unsupported characters in substituted variables will be replaced with an underscore.

              Example:

                 streamlink --record "~/recordings/{author}/{category}/{id}-{time:%Y%m%d%H%M%S}.ts" <URL> [STREAM]

       -R FILENAME

       --record-and-pipe FILENAME
              Deprecated in favor of --stdout --record=FILENAME.

       --fs-safe-rules {POSIX,Windows}
              The rules used to make formatting variables filesystem-safe are chosen automatically according to the type of system in use. This overrides the automatic detection.

              Intended  for use when Streamlink is running on a UNIX-like OS but writing to Windows filesystems such as NTFS; USB devices using VFAT or exFAT; CIFS shares that are enforcing Windows file‐
              name limitations, etc.

              These characters are replaced with an underscore for the rules in use:

              • POSIX: \x00-\x1F /

              • Windows: \x00-\x1F \x7F " * / : < > ? \ |

       -f

       --force
              When using --output or --record, always write to file even if it already exists (overwrite).

       --skip When using --output or --record, never write to file if it already exists (don't prompt).

              Takes precedence over --force.

       --progress {yes,force,no}
              When using --output or --record, show or hide the download progress bar, or force it if there's no terminal.

              Default is: yes.

   Stream options
       --url URL
              A URL to attempt to extract streams from.

              Usually, the protocol of http(s) URLs can be omitted (https://), depending on the implementation of the plugin being used.

              This is an alternative to setting the URL using a positional argument and can be useful if set in a config file.

       --default-stream STREAM
              Stream to play.

              Use best or worst for selecting the highest or lowest available quality.

              Fallback streams can be specified by using a comma-separated list:

                 "720p,480p,best"

              This is an alternative to setting the stream using a positional argument and can be useful if set in a config file.

       --stream-url
              If possible, translate the resolved stream to a URL and print it.

       --retry-streams DELAY
              Retry fetching the list of available streams until streams are found while waiting DELAY second(s) between each attempt.

              The number of retry attempts can be capped with --retry-max.  A default value of 1 is implied for non-zero values of --retry-max.

              If both --retry-streams and --retry-max are set to 0, then only one attempt will be made to fetch the list of available streams. This is the default behavior.

       --retry-max COUNT
              Stop fetching the list of available streams after COUNT retry attempt(s).

              A value of 0 makes Streamlink fetch streams indefinitely if --retry-streams is set to a non-zero value.  If --retry-streams is unset, then  the  default  delay  between  fetching  available
              streams is 1 second.

       --retry-open ATTEMPTS
              After a successful fetch, try ATTEMPTS time(s) to open the stream until giving up.

              Default is: 1.

       --stream-types TYPES

       --stream-priority TYPES
              A comma-delimited list of stream types to allow.

              The  order  will  be  used  to  separate streams when there are multiple streams with the same name but different stream types. Any stream type not listed will be omitted from the available
              streams list.  An * (asterisk) can be used as a wildcard to match any other type of stream, e.g. dash.

              Default is: "hls,http,*".

       --stream-sorting-excludes STREAMS
              Fine-tune the best and worst stream name synonyms by excluding unwanted streams.

              If all of the available streams get excluded, best and worst will become inaccessible and new special stream synonyms best-unfiltered and worst-unfiltered can be used as a  fallback  selec‐
              tion method.

              The filter-expression's format is:

                 [operator]<value>

              Valid operators are >, >=, < and <=. If no operator is specified then equality is tested.

              For example this will exclude streams ranked higher than "480p":

                 --stream-sorting-excludes ">480p"

              Multiple filters can be used by separating each expression with a comma.

              For example this will exclude streams from two quality types:

                 --stream-sorting-excludes ">480p,>medium"

   Stream transport options
       --ringbuffer-size SIZE
              The maximum size of the ringbuffer.

              Mebibytes or kibibytes (base 2) can be specified via the M or K suffix respectively.

              The  ringbuffer  is  used as a temporary storage between the stream and the player.  This allows Streamlink to download the stream faster than the player which reads the data from the ring‐
              buffer.

              The smaller the size of the ringbuffer, the higher the chance of the player buffering if the download speed decreases, and the higher the size, the more data can be use as a storage to  re‐
              cover from volatile download speeds.

              Most players have their own additional cache and will read the ringbuffer's content as soon as data is available.  If the player stops reading data while playback is paused, Streamlink will
              continue to download the stream in the background as long as the ringbuffer doesn't get full.

              Default is: "16M".

       --stream-segment-attempts ATTEMPTS
              The number of download attempts of each stream segment before giving up.

              This applies to all different kinds of segmented stream types, such as DASH, HLS, etc.

              Default is: 3.

       --stream-segment-threads THREADS
              The size of the thread pool used to download segments. Minimum value is 1 and maximum is 10.

              This applies to all different kinds of segmented stream types, such as DASH, HLS, etc.

              Default is: 1.

       --stream-segment-timeout TIMEOUT
              The maximum time to wait for each segment to start downloading.

              This applies to all different kinds of segmented stream types, such as DASH, HLS, etc.

              Default is: 10.0.

       --stream-timeout TIMEOUT
              The maximum time to wait for an unfiltered stream to continue outputting data.

              This applies to all different kinds of stream types, such as DASH, HLS, HTTP, etc.

              Default is: 60.0.

       --mux-subtitles
              Automatically mux available subtitles into the output stream.

              Needs to be supported by the used plugin.

   HLS options
       --hls-live-edge SEGMENTS
              Number of segments from the live stream's current live position to begin streaming.  The size or length of each segment is determined by the streaming provider.

              Lower  values will decrease the latency, but will also increase the chance of buffering, as there is less time for Streamlink to download segments and write their data to the output buffer.
              The number of parallel segment downloads can  be  set  with  --stream-segment-threads  and  the  HLS  playlist  reload  time  to  fetch  and  queue  new  segments  can  be  overridden  with
              --hls-playlist-reload-time.

              Default is: 3.

              NOTE:
                 During live playback, the caching/buffering settings of the used player will add additional latency.  To adjust this, please refer to the player's own documentation for the required con‐
                 figuration.  Player parameters can be set via --player-args.

       --hls-segment-stream-data
              Immediately write segment data into output buffer while downloading.

       --hls-playlist-reload-attempts ATTEMPTS
              The maximum number of attempts when reloading the HLS playlist before giving up.

              Default is: 3.

       --hls-playlist-reload-time TIME
              Set a custom HLS playlist reload time value, either in seconds or by using one of the following keywords:

              • segment: The duration of the last segment in the current playlist

              • live-edge: The sum of segment durations of the live edge value minus one

              • default: The playlist's target duration metadata

              Default is: default.

       --hls-segment-queue-threshold FACTOR
              The  multiplication  factor of the HLS playlist's target duration after which the stream will be stopped early if no new segments were queued after refreshing the playlist (multiple times).
              The target duration defines the maximum duration a single segment can have, meaning new segments must be available during this time frame, otherwise playback issues can occur.

              The intention of this queue threshold is to be able to stop early when the end of a stream doesn't get announced by the server, so Streamlink doesn't have to wait until a  read-timeout  oc‐
              curs. See --stream-timeout.

              Set to 0 to disable.

              Default is: 3.

       --hls-segment-ignore-names NAMES
              A comma-delimited list of segment names that will get filtered out.

              Example: --hls-segment-ignore-names 000,001,002

              This will ignore every segment that ends with 000.ts, 001.ts and 002.ts

              Default is: None.

       --hls-segment-key-uri URI
              Override the segment encryption key URIs for encrypted streams.

              The value can be templated using the following variables, which will be replaced with their respective part from the source segment URI:

                 {url} {scheme} {netloc} {path} {query}

              Examples:

                 --hls-segment-key-uri "https://example.com/hls/encryption_key"
                 --hls-segment-key-uri "{scheme}://1.2.3.4{path}{query}"
                 --hls-segment-key-uri "{scheme}://{netloc}/custom/path/to/key"

              Default is: None.

       --hls-audio-select CODE
              Select one or more specific audio sources by language code or name.  Can be set to * (asterisk) to include all audio sources.

              Examples:

                 --hls-audio-select "English,German"
                 --hls-audio-select "en,de"
                 --hls-audio-select "*"

              NOTE:
                 This is only useful in special circumstances where the regular locale option fails, such as when multiple sources of the same language exist.

       --hls-start-offset [[XX:]XX:]XX[.XX] | [XXh][XXm][XX[.XX]s]
              The amount of time to skip from the beginning of the stream.  For live streams, this is a negative offset from the end of the stream (rewind).

              Default is: 0.

       --hls-duration [[XX:]XX:]XX[.XX] | [XXh][XXm][XX[.XX]s]
              Limit the playback duration, useful for watching segments of a stream.  The actual duration may be slightly longer, as it is rounded to the nearest HLS segment.

              Default is: unlimited.

       --hls-live-restart
              Skip to the beginning of a live stream, or as far back as possible.

   DASH options
       --dash-manifest-reload-attempts ATTEMPTS

   FFmpeg options
       --ffmpeg-ffmpeg FILENAME
              Set the location of the FFmpeg executable if it can't be resolved from the paths of the system's PATH environment variable.

              FFmpeg is required to access or mux separate video and audio streams, e.g. in DASH streams or HLS streams with multiple sources.

              Example: --ffmpeg-ffmpeg "/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg"

       --ffmpeg-no-validation
              Disable FFmpeg validation and version logging.

       --ffmpeg-verbose

       --ffmpeg-verbose-path PATH
              Write FFmpeg's stderr output to PATH.

       --ffmpeg-loglevel LOGLEVEL
              Change FFmpeg's -loglevel value to LOGLEVEL.

              Unless --ffmpeg-verbose or --ffmpeg-verbose-path is set, changing the log level won't have any effect.

              Default is: "info".

       --ffmpeg-fout OUTFORMAT
              Set the output format to OUTFORMAT. This only applies to streams which require muxing.

              Default is: "matroska".

              Example: --ffmpeg-fout "mpegts"

       --ffmpeg-video-transcode CODEC
              Transcode the video to CODEC. This only applies to streams which require muxing.

              Default is: "copy".

              Example: --ffmpeg-video-transcode "h264"

       --ffmpeg-audio-transcode CODEC
              Transcode the audio to CODEC. This only applies to streams which require muxing.

              Default is: "copy".

              Example: --ffmpeg-audio-transcode "aac"

       --ffmpeg-copyts
              Set the -copyts FFmpeg option, so input timestamps won't be processed and the initial start time offset value be kept.

       --ffmpeg-start-at-zero
              Enable the -start_at_zero FFmpeg option when using --ffmpeg-copyts.

       --http-no-ssl-verify
              Don't attempt to verify TLS/SSL certificates.

              Use with caution, as it has TLS/SSL security implications.

       --http-disable-dh
              Disable Diffie Hellman key exchange.

              Use with caution, as it has TLS/SSL security implications.

              Enable or disable support for Streamlink's webbrowser API.

              Streamlink's  webbrowser API allows plugins which implement it to launch a web browser and extract data from websites which they otherwise couldn't do via the regular HTTP session in Python
              due to specific JavaScript restrictions.

              The web browser is run isolated and in a clean environment without access to regular user data.

              Streamlink currently only supports Chromium-based web browsers using the Chrome Devtools Protocol (CDP).  This includes Chromium itself, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave,  Vivaldi,  and
              others, but full support for third party Chromium forks is not guaranteed. Please try Chromium or Google Chrome when encountering any issues.

              Default is: true.

       --webbrowser-executable PATH
              Path to the web browser's executable.

              By default, it is looked up automatically according to the rules of the used webbrowser API implementation.  This usually involves a list of known executable names and fallback paths on all
              supported operating systems.

       --webbrowser-timeout TIME
              The maximum amount of time which the web browser can take to launch and execute.

       --webbrowser-cdp-host HOST
              Host for the web browser's inter-process communication interface (CDP specific).

              Default is: 127.0.0.1.

       --webbrowser-cdp-port PORT
              Port for the web browser's inter-process communication interface (CDP specific).

              Tries to find a free port by default.

       --webbrowser-cdp-timeout TIME
              The maximum amount of time for waiting on a single CDP command response.

       --webbrowser-headless {yes,true,1,on,no,false,0,off}
              Whether to launch the web browser in headless mode or not.  When enabled, it stays completely hidden and doesn't require a desktop environment to run.

              Please be aware that headless mode might be blocked by websites which implement bot detections.

              Default is: false.

   Plugin-specific options

   Kick
       --kick-low-latency
              Enables  low  latency streaming by prefetching HLS segments.  Sets --hls-segment-stream-data to true and --hls-live-edge to 2, if it is higher.  Reducing --hls-live-edge to 1 will result in
              the lowest latency possible, but will most likely cause buffering.

              In order to achieve true low latency streaming during playback, the player's caching/buffering settings will need to be adjusted and reduced to a value as low as possible,  but  still  high
              enough to not cause any buffering.  This depends on the stream's bitrate and the quality of the connection to Kick's servers. Please refer to the player's own documentation for the required
              configuration. Player parameters can be set via --player-args.

              NOTE:
                 Low  latency  streams  have  to be enabled by the broadcasters on Kick themselves.  Regular streams can cause buffering issues with this option enabled due to the reduced --hls-live-edge
                 value.
