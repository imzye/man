NAME
       beesu - A wrapper for "su" that provides a graphical interface in Fedora.

SYNOPSIS
       beesu [-P] [-v] [-l] [-m] [-f] [-s] [-c] COMMAND ARGs ...

DESCRIPTION
       beesu is a wrapper around su(1) and works with consolehelper(8) in Fedora to provide a graphical interface like gksu.

       beesu is dedicated to all the friends of honey bees!

OPTIONS
       --version
              display the software version and exit

       --print-conf
              display the configuration file contents and exit

       -P     don't join ARGs together

       -v     verbose output

       -, -l, --login
              make the shell a login shell

       -c COMMAND
              pass a single COMMAND to the shell with -c

       -f, --fast
              pass -f to the shell (for csh or tcsh)

       -m, --preserve-environment
              do not reset environment variables

       -s SHELL
              run SHELL

EXAMPLES
       beesu - nautilus

       To start nautilus as root.

       beesu -l -P whoami test

       That will start whoami impersonating the user test (note that the root's password is asked, and not test's).  Due to the -P switch, all parameters are directly passed to su(1).  Therefore, the command
       to execute must be single or double quoted together with its arguments (but in this case there isn't anything to quote).

FILES
       /etc/beesu.conf
              This is the configuration file for beesu.  This file allows you to restrict the usage of beesu to run only with a specified list of commands. This may prevent you to run commands that,  because
              of your mistakes, can damage your system.

BUGS
       The command name could be any command. Be careful to not type something that could wipe away your system.
