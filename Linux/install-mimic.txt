NAME
       install-mimic — overwrite files preserving the destination's ownership and access mode

SYNOPSIS
       install-mimic [-v] [-r reffile] srcfile dstfile
       install-mimic [-v] [-r reffile] file1 [file2...] directory
       install-mimic -V | -h

DESCRIPTION
       The  install-mimic  utility  copies  the specified files to the specified destination (file or directory) similarly to install(1), but it preserves the ownership and access mode of the destination
       files.  This is useful when updating files that have already been installed with locally modified copies that may be owned by the current user and not by the desired owner of the destination  file
       (e.g. root).

       Options:

       -h      Display program usage information and exit.

       -r      Specify a file to obtain the ownership and access information from; useful when installing a new file that should be similar to other files in the same location.

       -V      Display program version information and exit.

       -v      Verbose operation; display diagnostic output.

       The install-mimic utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
