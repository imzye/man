NAME
       prometheus-alertmanager - the Prometheus alert manager

SYNOPSIS
       prometheus-alertmanager [<flags>]

DESCRIPTION
OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).

       --config.file
              Alertmanager configuration file name.

       --storage.path
              Base path for data storage.

       --data.retention=120h
              How long to keep data for.

       --data.maintenance-interval=15m
              Interval between garbage collection and snapshotting to disk of the silences and the notification logs.

       --silences.max-silences=0
              Maximum number of silences, including expired silences. If negative or zero, no limit is set.

       --silences.max-silence-size-bytes=0
              Maximum silence size in bytes. If negative or zero, no limit is set.

       --alerts.gc-interval=30m
              Interval between alert GC.

       --web.systemd-socket
              Use systemd socket activation listeners instead of port listeners (Linux only).

       --web.listen-address=:9093
              Addresses on which to expose metrics and web interface. Repeatable for multiple addresses. Examples: `:9100` or `[::1]:9100` for http, `vsock://:9100` for vsock

       --web.config.file
              Path to configuration file that can enable TLS or authentication. See: https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit/blob/master/docs/web-configuration.md

       --web.external-url=WEB.EXTERNAL-URL
              The  URL  under which Alertmanager is externally reachable (for example, if Alertmanager is served via a reverse proxy). Used for generating relative and absolute links back to Alertmanager
              itself. If the URL has a path portion, it will be used to prefix all HTTP endpoints served by Alertmanager. If omitted, relevant URL components will be derived automatically.

       --web.route-prefix=WEB.ROUTE-PREFIX
              Prefix for the internal routes of web endpoints. Defaults to path of --web.external-url.

       --web.get-concurrency=0
              Maximum number of GET requests processed concurrently. If negative or zero, the limit is GOMAXPROC or 8, whichever is larger.

       --web.timeout=0
              Timeout for HTTP requests. If negative or zero, no timeout is set.

       --web.ui-path
              Path to static UI directory.

       --auto-gomemlimit.ratio=0.9
              The ratio of reserved GOMEMLIMIT memory to the detected maximum container or system memory. The value must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.

       --cluster.listen-address
              Listen address for cluster. Set to empty string to disable HA mode.

       --cluster.advertise-address=CLUSTER.ADVERTISE-ADDRESS
              Explicit address to advertise in cluster.

       --cluster.peer=CLUSTER.PEER
              Initial peers (may be repeated).

       --cluster.peer-timeout=15s
              Time to wait between peers to send notifications.

       --cluster.gossip-interval=200ms
              Interval between sending gossip messages. By lowering this value (more frequent) gossip messages are propagated across the cluster more quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth.

       --cluster.pushpull-interval=1m0s
              Interval for gossip state syncs. Setting this interval lower (more frequent) will increase convergence speeds across larger clusters at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.

       --cluster.tcp-timeout=10s
              Timeout for establishing a stream connection with a remote node for a full state sync, and for stream read and write operations.

       --cluster.probe-timeout=500ms
              Timeout to wait for an ack from a probed node before assuming it is unhealthy. This should be set to 99-percentile of RTT (round-trip time) on your network.

       --cluster.probe-interval=1s
              Interval between random node probes. Setting this lower (more frequent) will cause the cluster to detect failed nodes more quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.

       --cluster.settle-timeout=1m0s
              Maximum time to wait for cluster connections to settle before evaluating notifications.

       --cluster.reconnect-interval=10s
              Interval between attempting to reconnect to lost peers.

       --cluster.reconnect-timeout=6h0m0s
              Length of time to attempt to reconnect to a lost peer.

       --cluster.tls-config
              [EXPERIMENTAL] Path to config yaml file that can enable mutual TLS within the gossip protocol.

       --cluster.allow-insecure-public-advertise-address-discovery
              [EXPERIMENTAL] Allow alertmanager to discover and listen on a public IP address.

       --cluster.label
              The cluster label is an optional string to include on each packet and stream. It uniquely identifies the cluster and prevents cross-communication issues when sending gossip messages.

       --enable-feature
              Comma-separated experimental features to enable. Valid options: receiver-name-in-metrics, classic-mode, utf8-strict-mode, auto-gomemlimit, auto-gomaxprocs

       --log.level=info
              Only log messages with the given severity or above. One of: [debug, info, warn, error]

       --log.format=logfmt
              Output format of log messages. One of: [logfmt, json]

       --version
              Show application version.
