NAME
       tkpod - Perl/Tk Pod browser

SYNOPSIS
           tkpod   [-tk] [[-no]tree] [-Mblib] [-I dir] [-d|debug] [-s|server]
                   [-filedialog module]
                   [-f function | -q FAQRegex | directory | name [...]]

DESCRIPTION
       tkpod is a simple Pod browser with hypertext capabilities.  Pod (Plain Old Document) is a simple and readable markup language that could be mixed with perl code.

       Pods are searched by default in @INC and $ENV{PATH}. Directories listed on the command line or with the -I option are added to the default search path.

       For each "name" listed on the command line tkpod tries to find Pod in "name", "name.pod" and "name.pm" in the search path.  For each "name" a new Pod browser window is opened.

       If no "name" is listed, then the main "perl" pod is opened instead.

OPTIONS
       -tree
           When specified, "tkpod" will show a tree window with all available Pods on the local host. However, this may be slow on startup, especially first time because there is no cache yet. You can always
           turn on the tree view with the menu entry 'View' -> 'Pod Tree'.

       -tk Useful for perl/Tk documentation.  When specified it adds all "Tk" subdirectories in @INC to the Pod search path.   This way when "Scrolled" is selected in the browser the "Tk/Scrolled"
           documentation is found.

       -s or -server
           Start "tkpod" in server mode. Subsequent calls to "tkpod" (without the -s option) will cause to load the requested Pods into the server program, thus minimizing startup time and memory usage. Note
           that there is no access control, so this might be a security hole!

       -Mblib
           Add the "blib" directories under the current directory to the Pod search path.

       -I dir
           Add another directory to the Pod search path. Note that the space is mandatory.

       -f function
           Show documentation for function.

       -q FAQRegex
           Show the FAQ entry matching FAQRegex.

       -filedialog module
           Use an alternative file dialog module, e.g. Tk::FileSelect, Tk::FBox or Tk::PathEntry::Dialog.

       -d or -debug
           Turn debugging on.

       -exit
           Only for internal testing: exit before entering "MainLoop".

USAGE
       How to navigate with the Pod browser is described in Tk::Pod_usage.  It's also accessible via the menu 'Help' -> 'Usage...'.

ENVIRONMENT
       TKPODPORT
           Force a port for tkpod's server mode.

       TKPODDIRS
           A list of directories (on Unix usually separated by ":", on Windows by ";") for additional Pod directories. These directories will appear in the "local dirs" section of the tree view.

       See "Environment" in Tk::Pod::Text and "Environment" in Tk::Pod::FindPods for more environment variables.
