DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the program wmcliphist.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       wmcliphist is a dockable application which provides a history for the last few selections made in the X11 Window System.

       Note, that most of wmcliphist's features are accessed by installing a configuration file .wmcliphistrc into your $HOME. Find a well documented example in /usr/share/doc/wmcliphist.
