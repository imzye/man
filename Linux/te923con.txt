NAME
       te923con, - connector for TE923 weatherstations v0.6.1

DESCRIPTION
       usage: te923con [options]

       -D - Debug output (please send this output for bugfixing)

       -d - dump all values from internal (small) memory

       -b - dump all values from internal (big) memory (new hardware version)

       -s - get status from weather station

       -i - set the output for invalid values (unreachable sensors), default it is i

       -h - print this help information

       -v - print version number of this program

       Output format is colon separatet values. Invalid values or values from not present sensors are hidden by default. You can set output for invalid with -i option. Output format:

       T0:H0:T1:H1:T2:H2:T3:H3:T4:H4:T5:H5:PRESS:UV:FC:STORM:WD:WS:WG:WC:RC

       T0     - temperature from internal sensor in ??C

       H0     - humidity from internal sensor in % rel

              T1..5  - temperature from external sensor 1..4 in ??C H1..5 - humidity from external sensor 1...4 in % rel PRESS - air pressure in mBar UV    - UV index from UV sensor FC    - station fore‐
              cast, see below for more details STORM - stormwarning; 0 - no warning, 1 - fix your dog WD    - wind direction in n x 22.5??; 0 -> north WS    - wind speed in m/s WG    - wind gust speed in
              m/s WC    - windchill temperature in ??C RC    - rain counter (maybe since station starts measurement) as value

              weather forecast means (as precisely as possible)

              0 - heavy snow 1 - little snow 2 - heavy rain 3 - little rain 4 - cloudy 5 - some clouds 6 - sunny

       Status output means:

       SYSSW:BARSW:EXTSW:RCCSW:WINSW:BATR:BATU:BATW:BAT5:BAT4:BAT5:BAT2:BAT1

       SYSSW  - software version of system controller

       BARSW  - software version of barometer

       EXTSW  - software version of UV and channel controller

       RCCSW  - software version of rain controller

       WINSW  - software version of wind controller

       BATR   - battery of rain sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)

       BATU   - battery of UV sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)

       BATW   - battery of wind sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)

       BAT5   - battery of sensor 5 (1-good (not present), 0-low)

       BAT4   - battery of sensor 4 (1-good (not present), 0-low)

       BAT3   - battery of sensor 3 (1-good (not present), 0-low)

       BAT2   - battery of sensor 2 (1-good (not present), 0-low)

       BAT1   - battery of sensor 1 (1-good (not present), 0-low)
