NAME
       k3conf - TI K3 Configuration Diagnostic Tool

SYNOPSIS
       k3conf - [--host <id>] [--version] [--help] [--cpuinfo] <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       k3conf  is  a  standalone  application designed to provide a quick'n easy way to diagnose/debug/audit TI K3 based architecture processors configuration at runtime, with no particular kernel depen‐
       dency.  k3conf is designed to be as platform-agnostic as possible, being able to run on any Linux platform and easy to port to any other OS.  Even if k3conf today focuses on  TISCI  related  func‐
       tionality, it is intended to any other area.
