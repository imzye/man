NAME
       websec - Web Secretary

SYNOPSIS
       websec [options]

OPTIONS
       --help  Print a brief help message and exits.

       --man   Prints the manual page and exits.

       --base  Base directory for configuration (~/.websec by default)

       --urllist
               Use another file for the url list, by default it is "url.list".

DESCRIPTION
       websec is a web page monitoring software.  It will send you a changed web page with the contents highlighted.

       The base directory is the place from which websec will read the config files and in which it will store its data.

       When called without an argument, websec will look for a base directory.  If the current directory has url.list it will use it, otherwise it will try to use $HOME/.websec/. You can also override this
       process with the --base option.

       You can add a line like AddSubject = [websec] to url.list, websec will add [websec] to every subject as a first word when mail is sent. You can then easily detect this line by a mail filter.

       The keywords Retry, Retrywait, and Timeout in url.list lets you specify the number of times to retry, time to wait between retries, and a timeout setting.

       Websec waits for a random number of seconds between retries up to the value specified by the Randomwait keyword. This is to prevent websec from being blocked by websites that perform log analysis to
       find time similarities between requests.
