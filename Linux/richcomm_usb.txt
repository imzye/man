RICHCOMM_USB(8)                   NUT Manual                   RICHCOMM_USB(8)

NAME
       richcomm_usb - Driver UPS equipment using Richcomm dry-contact to USB
       solution

NOTE
       This man page only documents the specific features of the richcomm_usb
       driver. For information about the core driver, see nutupsdrv(8).

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The Richcomm dry-contact to USB solution is a generic interface that is
       used to upgrade an existing (RS-232) contact closure UPS interface to
       USB. As such, all the limitations of the underlying contact closure
       interface apply. This means that you will only get the essentials in
       ups.status: OL, OB, and LB. See also genericups(8).

BUGS
       Most contact-closure UPSes will not power down the load if the line
       power is present. This can create a race when using slave upsmon(8)
       systems. See the upsmon(8) man page for more information.

       The solution to both of these problems is to upgrade to a smart
       protocol UPS of some kind that allows detection and proper load cycling
       on command.
