CHECK-MANIFEST(1)                                                                         General Commands Manual                                                                         CHECK-MANIFEST(1)

NAME
       check-manifest - Check a Python MANIFEST.in file for completeness

SYNOPSIS
       check-manifest [OPTION...] [SOURCE TREE]

DESCRIPTION
       check-manifest  performs a check on a MANIFEST.in file from a Python project and verifies its completeness.  It can also create a MANIFEST.in file from scratch or append suggestions to it, and the
       user can also ignore certain patterns if needed.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       --version
              Show version of program.

       -v, --verbose
              More verbose output (default: False).

       -c, --create
              Create a MANIFEST.in if missing (default: False).

       -u, --update
              Append suggestions to MANIFEST.in (implies --create) (default: False).

       -p PYTHON, --python PYTHON
              Use the specified PYTHON interpreter when running setup.py sdist (default: sys.executable).

       --ignore PATTERNS
              Ignore files/directories matching PATTERNS, a comma-separated list of patterns (default: None).

       --ignore-bad-ideas PATTERNS
              Ignore bad idea files/directories matching PATTERNS, a comma-separated list of patterns (default: []).

CONFIGURATION
       You can tell check-manifest to ignore certain file patterns by adding a check-manifest section to your package's setup.cfg.  Example:

              [check-manifest]
              ignore =
                  .travis.yml

       The following options are recognized:

       ignore
              A list of newline separated filename patterns that will be ignored by check-manifest.  Use this if you want to keep files in your version control system that shouldn't be included  in  your
              source distributions.  The default ignore list is

              PKG-INFO
              *.egg-info
              *.egg-info/*
              setup.cfg
              \.hgtags
              \.hgsigs
              \.hgignore
              \.gitignore
              \.bzrignore
              \.gitattributes
              \.travis.yml
              Jenkinsfile
              *.mo

       ignore-default-rules
              If set to true, your ignore patterns will replace the default ignore list instead of adding to it.

       ignore-bad-ideas
              A  list  of newline separated filename patterns that will be ignored by check-manifest's generated files check.  Use this if you want to keep generated files in your version control system,
              even though it is generally a bad idea.
