NAME
       ftpmirror - Mirroring directory hierarchy using FTP protocol

SYNOPSIS
       ftpmirror [package]

DESCRIPTION
       ftpmirror is an utility to copy directory hierarchy (usually called 'mirror') using FTP protocol.

       A similar perl script exists, whose name is 'mirror', but ftpmirror requires less memory than mirror.

OPTIONS
       Please, note that the original documentation about ftpmirror was written originally in japanese. (README.jis and RELEASE.jis)

       If you can contribute by translating any aspect of these files, please contact Dario Minnucci <debian@midworld.net>. I'll be glad to include your contributions here to improve this manual.

       Formerly ftpmirror operatio mode was MASTER->SLAVE but seems that since version 1.96 the SLAVE->MASTER (reverse mirror) is supported.

       This behaviour can be controlled for each package section in the main configuration file (/etc/ftpmirror/ftpmirror.cf).

       MASTER->SLAVE  --> get-mode = yes (default)
       SLAVE->MASTER  --> put-mode = yes

EXAMPLES
       ftpmirror provides a 'ready-to-use' sample package for testing porpouses.  In order to run the provided test package you need to issue the following commands (both commands must be run by the same
       user):

       mkdir -p /tmp/upstream
       /usr/bin/ftpmirror upstream

       This package should copy directory hierarchy from the original author's FTP location (ftp://ftp.intec.co.jp/pub/utils/ftpmirror) to your local hard drive (/tmp/upstream).
