NAME
       CD5 - Compute checksum of individual track on CD-ROMS

SYNOPSIS
       cd5

DESCRIPTION
       CD-ROM  Digest  is a program that checks a multi-track CD-ROM.  It reports the MD5 digest and size for each track on a CD-ROM.  The digest is done as the track is read, without dumping CD-ROM data
       on the hard drive. This tool helps users that are burning a multi-track CD-ROM to check the result.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
       Currently, cd5 uses /dev/cdrom as CD-ROM device, and you can't change it.

       Tracks are often bigger than the data written inside.  The program will report an error at the end of the data, but the checksum and the size will be good.
