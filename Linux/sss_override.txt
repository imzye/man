NAME
       sss_override - create local overrides of user and group attributes

SYNOPSIS
       sss_override COMMAND [options]

DESCRIPTION
       sss_override enables to create a client-side view and allows to change
       selected values of specific user and groups. This change takes effect
       only on local machine.

       Overrides data are stored in the SSSD cache. If the cache is deleted,
       all local overrides are lost. Please note that after the first override
       is created using any of the following user-add, group-add, user-import
       or group-import command. SSSD needs to be restarted to take effect.
       sss_override prints message when a restart is required.

       NOTE: The options provided in this man page only work with “ldap” and
       “AD” “ id_provider”. IPA overrides can be managed centrally on the IPA
       server.

AVAILABLE COMMANDS
       Argument NAME is the name of original object in all commands. It is not
       possible to override uid or gid to 0.

       user-add NAME [-n,--name NAME] [-u,--uid UID] [-g,--gid GID] [-h,--home
       HOME] [-s,--shell SHELL] [-c,--gecos GECOS] [-x,--certificate BASE64
       ENCODED CERTIFICATE]
           Override attributes of an user. Please be aware that calling this
           command will replace any previous override for the (NAMEd) user.

       user-del NAME
           Remove user overrides. However be aware that overridden attributes
           might be returned from memory cache. Please see SSSD option
           memcache_timeout for more details.

       user-find [-d,--domain DOMAIN]
           List all users with set overrides. If DOMAIN parameter is set, only
           users from the domain are listed.

       user-show NAME
           Show user overrides.

       user-import FILE
           Import user overrides from FILE. Data format is similar to standard
           passwd file. The format is:

           original_name:name:uid:gid:gecos:home:shell:base64_encoded_certificate

           where original_name is original name of the user whose attributes
           should be overridden. The rest of fields correspond to new values.
           You can omit a value simply by leaving corresponding field empty.

           Examples:

           ckent:superman::::::

           ckent@krypton.com::501:501:Superman:/home/earth:/bin/bash:

       user-export FILE
           Export all overridden attributes and store them in FILE. See
           user-import for data format.

       group-add NAME [-n,--name NAME] [-g,--gid GID]
           Override attributes of a group. Please be aware that calling this
           command will replace any previous override for the (NAMEd) group.

       group-del NAME
           Remove group overrides. However be aware that overridden attributes
           might be returned from memory cache. Please see SSSD option
           memcache_timeout for more details.

       group-find [-d,--domain DOMAIN]
           List all groups with set overrides. If DOMAIN parameter is set,
           only groups from the domain are listed.

       group-show NAME
           Show group overrides.

       group-import FILE
           Import group overrides from FILE. Data format is similar to
           standard group file. The format is:

           original_name:name:gid

           where original_name is original name of the group whose attributes
           should be overridden. The rest of fields correspond to new values.
           You can omit a value simply by leaving corresponding field empty.

           Examples:

           admins:administrators:

           Domain Users:Users:501

       group-export FILE
           Export all overridden attributes and store them in FILE. See
           group-import for data format.

COMMON OPTIONS
       Those options are available with all commands.

       --debug LEVEL
           SSSD supports two representations for specifying the debug level.
           The simplest is to specify a decimal value from 0-9, which
           represents enabling that level and all lower-level debug messages.
           The more comprehensive option is to specify a hexadecimal bitmask
           to enable or disable specific levels (such as if you wish to
           suppress a level).

           Currently supported debug levels:

           0, 0x0010: Fatal failures. Anything that would prevent SSSD from
           starting up or causes it to cease running.

           1, 0x0020: Critical failures. An error that doesn't kill SSSD, but
           one that indicates that at least one major feature is not going to
           work properly.

           2, 0x0040: Serious failures. An error announcing that a particular
           request or operation has failed.

           3, 0x0080: Minor failures. These are the errors that would
           percolate down to cause the operation failure of 2.

           4, 0x0100: Configuration settings.

           5, 0x0200: Function data.

           6, 0x0400: Trace messages for operation functions.

           7, 0x1000: Trace messages for internal control functions.

           8, 0x2000: Contents of function-internal variables that may be
           interesting.

           9, 0x4000: Extremely low-level tracing information.

           10, 0x10000: Even more low-level libldb tracing information. Almost
           never really required.

           To log required bitmask debug levels, simply add their numbers
           together as shown in following examples:

           Example: To log fatal failures, critical failures, serious failures
           and function data use 0x0270.

           Example: To log fatal failures, configuration settings, function
           data, trace messages for internal control functions use 0x1310.

           Note: The bitmask format of debug levels was introduced in 1.7.0.

           Default: 0x0070 (i.e. fatal, critical and serious failures;
           corresponds to setting 2 in decimal notation)
