NAME
       siqs_ftdi - Sdr IQ Server

DESCRIPTION
       This program attempt to mimic the sdrxx server created by Moe WHEATLEY in order to provide SDR-IQ with a network interface compatible with that of more sophisticated radio from RFSPACE.

       Alas the sdrxx server source code resulted unfeasible to port to Linux, but was invaluable as a reference.

       A special mention deservers Ken N9VV that put his radio, Linux computer and Internet connection to my disposal in order to develop and test this software.

       The application is compatible with the SDR-IP and NetSDR networked software defined radio receivers made by RFSPACE, Inc. of Atlanta, GA

       Running with other receivers that have USB interfaces (such as the SDR-IQ) is made possible by the siqs_ftdi program.

SYNOPSIS
       siqs_ftdi

       In order to run CuteSDR you have to remove from your system the standard Linux kernel FTDI driver; this is feasible at run time:

       sudo rmmod usbserial ftdi_sio

       Next check that the radio is correctly linked to the system:

       lsusb

       Bus 006 Device 002: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC

       If everything is fine, open a terminal window and start the server:

       siqs_ftdi ------

       ------ SDR-IQ server for Cute SDR

       ------

       ------ libftdi version

       ------

       ------ (C) 2012, Ken N9VV && Andrea IW0HDV

       interfaces = 2:

       lo - 127.0.0.1

       eth0 - 192.168.10.1

       SRXXX STARTED: size 56

       Press q <ENTER> to exit.

       Listening for TCP connections on port 50000 socket: 6

       Last,  run  CuteSDR from another terminal window, and into the menu Setup->Network press "Find SDR" push button or manually insert the network data.  The auto discovery proceudre works only if the
       CuteSDR and the server are placed on the same LAN (broadcast domain).

       Please not that the server is not yet completed with all the features: e.g. the discovery messages is only partially supported.
