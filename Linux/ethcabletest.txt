NAME
       ethcabletest

       Initiates or stops Cable Bit Error Rate stress tests for Network Interface Card (NIC)-to-switch links.

       -f hostfile

                 Specifies the file with hosts to include in NIC-to-SW test. Default is /etc/eth-tools/hosts file.

       -h hosts

                 Specifies the list of hosts to include in NIC-SW test.

       stop

       The NIC-SW cable test requires that the FF_MPI_APPS_DIR is set, and it contains a pre-built copy of the Intel(R)   mpi_apps for an appropriate message passing interface (MPI).
