OWFS(5)                                                                                     One-Wire File System                                                                                    OWFS(5)

NAME
       owfs.conf - owfs programs configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       An OWFS configuration file is specified on the command line:

       owfs -c config_file [other options]
              The file name is arbitrary, there is no default configuration file used.

USAGE
       A configuration file can be invoked for any of the OWFS programs ( owfs (1) owhttpd (1) owserver (1) owftpd (1) ) or any of the language bindings ( owperl (1) owcapi (1) owtcl (1) owphp owpython )
       to set command line parameters.

SYNTAX
       Similar to Unix shell script or perl syntax

       Comments
              # Any # marks the start of a comment
              # blank lines are ignored

       Options
              option # some options (like 'foreground') take no values
              option = value # other options need a value
              option value # '=' can be omitted if whitespace separates
              Option # Case is ignored (for options, not values)
              opt # non-ambiguous abbreviation allowed
              -opt --opt # hyphens ignored

       owserver
              server: opt = value # only owserver effected by this line
              ! server: opt = value # owserver NOT effected by this line

       owhttpd
              http: opt = value # only owhttpd effected by this line
              ! http: opt = value # owhttpd NOT effected by this line

       owftpd ftp: opt = value # only owftpd effected by this line
              ! ftp: opt = value # owftpd NOT effected by this line

       owfs   owfs: opt = value # only owfs effected by this line
              ! owfs: opt = value # owfs NOT effected by this line

       Limits # maximum line length of 250 characters
              # no limit on number of lines

DESCRIPTION
   1-Wire
       1-wire is a wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector scheme where the data line can also provide
       power.

       Each  device  is  uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage, contact, current), switches,
       timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also 1-wire devices that have encryption included.

       The 1-wire scheme uses a single bus master and multiple slaves on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be individually discovered  and  addressed  using  their
       unique ID.

       Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB adapters.

   OWFS design
       OWFS  is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique ID being the direc‐
       tory, and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.

       Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or  control  ap‐
       plications.  There  are  some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundamental
       goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed.

   Configuration
       owfs.conf (5) allows a uniform set of command line parameters to be set.

       Not all OWFS programs use the same command line options, but the non-relevant ones will be ignored.

       Command line and configuration options can mixed. They will be invoked in the order presented. Left to right for the command line. Top to bottom for the configuration file.

       Configuration files can call other configuration files. There is an arbitrary depth of 5 levels to prevent infinite loops. More than one configuration file can be specified.
