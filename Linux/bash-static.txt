DESCRIPTION
       Bash is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input, from a string, or from a file.  It is a reimplementation and extension of the Bourne shell, the histori‐
       cal Unix command language interpreter.  Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

       POSIX  is  the  name for a family of computing standards based on Unix.  Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE
       Standard 1003.1).  Bash POSIX mode (hereafter referred to as posix mode) changes the shell's behavior where its default operation differs from the standard to strictly  conform  to  the  standard.
       See SEE ALSO below for a reference to a document that details how posix mode affects bash's behavior.  Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

OPTIONS
       All  of  the  single-character shell options documented in the description of the set builtin command, including -o, can be used as options when the shell is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets
       the following options when it is invoked:

       -c        If the -c option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument command_string.  If there are arguments after the command_string, the first argument is assigned to
                 $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.  The assignment to $0 sets the name of the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.

       -i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.

       -l        Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).

       -r        If the -r option is present, the shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).

       -s        If the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after option processing, the shell reads commands from the standard input.  This option allows the positional parameters to be  set
                 when invoking an interactive shell or when reading input through a pipe.

       -v        Print shell input lines as they are read.

       -x        Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.

       -D        Print a list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ on the standard output.  These are the strings that are subject to language translation when the current locale is not C or POSIX.
                 This implies the -n option; no commands will be executed.

       [-+]O [shopt_option]
                 shopt_option  is  one  of the shell options accepted by the shopt builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  If shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O unsets it.
                 If shopt_option is not supplied, bash prints the names and values of the shell options accepted by shopt on the standard output.  If the invocation option is +O, the output is  displayed
                 in a format that may be reused as input.

       --        A  --  signals  the  end  of  options  and disables further option processing.  Any arguments after the -- are treated as a shell script filename (see below) and arguments passed to that
                 script.  An argument of - is equivalent to --.

       Bash also interprets a number of multi-character options.  These options must appear on the command line before the single-character options to be recognized.

       --debugger
              Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell starts.  Turns on extended debugging mode (see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).

       --dump-po-strings
              Equivalent to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext “po” (portable object) file format.

       --dump-strings
              Equivalent to -D.

       --help Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

       --init-file file
       --rcfile file
              Execute commands from file instead of the system wide initialization file /etc/bash.bashrc and the standard personal initialization file ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive  (see  INVOCA‐
              TION below).

       --login
              Equivalent to -l.

       --noediting
              Do not use the GNU readline library to read command lines when the shell is interactive.

       --noprofile
              Do  not  read either the system-wide startup file /etc/profile or any of the personal initialization files ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile.  By default, bash reads these files
              when it is invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).

       --norc Do not read and execute the system wide initialization file /etc/bash.bashrc and the personal initialization file ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive.  This option is on by default if the
              shell is invoked as sh.

       --posix
              Enable posix mode; change the behavior of bash where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard.

       --restricted
              The shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).

       --verbose
              Equivalent to -v.

       --version
              Show version information for this instance of bash on the standard output and exit successfully.

ARGUMENTS
       If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the -c nor the -s option has been supplied, the first argument is treated as the name of a file containing shell commands (a shell script).
       When bash is invoked in this fashion, $0 is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments.  Bash reads and executes commands from  this  file,  then
       exits.   Bash's  exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script.  If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0.  Bash first attempts to open the file in the current
       directory, and, if no file is found, searches the directories in PATH for the script.

INVOCATION
       A login shell is one whose first character of argument zero is a -, or one started with the --login option.

       An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments (unless -s is specified) and without the -c option, and whose standard input and standard error are both connected to terminals (as
       determined by isatty(3)), or one started with the -i option.  Bash sets PS1 and $- includes i if the shell is interactive, so a shell script or a startup file can test this state.

       The following paragraphs describe how bash executes its startup files.  If any of the files exist but cannot be read, bash reports an error.  Tildes are expanded in filenames  as  described  below
       under Tilde Expansion in the EXPANSION section.

       When  bash  is  invoked  as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.
       After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.   The  --nopro‐
       file option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell executes the exit builtin command, bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if that file exists.  The --norc option inhibits this behavior.
       The --rcfile file option causes bash to use file instead of etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.

       When  bash  is  started  non-interactively,  to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded
       value as the name of a file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:

              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi

       but does not use the value of the PATH variable to search for the filename.

       If bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as an
       interactive login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from /etc/profile and ~/.profile, in that order.  The --noprofile option
       inhibits this behavior.  When invoked as an interactive shell with the name sh, bash looks for the variable ENV, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the  name  of  a
       file  to  read and execute.  Since a shell invoked as sh does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup files, the --rcfile option has no effect.  A non-interactive shell in‐
       voked with the name sh does not attempt to read any other startup files.

       When invoked as sh, bash enters posix mode after reading the startup files.

       When bash is started in posix mode, as with the --posix command line option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode, interactive shells expand the ENV variable and read and
       execute commands from the file whose name is the expanded value.  No other startup files are read.

       Bash attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input connected to a network connection, as when executed by the historical and rarely-seen remote shell daemon, usually rshd,  or
       the secure shell daemon sshd.  If bash determines it is being run non-interactively in this fashion, it reads and executes commands from etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist and are
       readable.   Bash does not read this file if invoked as sh.  The --norc option inhibits this behavior, and the --rcfile option makes bash use a different file instead of ~/.bashrc, but neither rshd
       nor sshd generally invoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.

       If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, no startup files are read, shell functions  are  not  inherited
       from  the  environment,  the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set to the real user id.  If the -p
       option is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.

DEFINITIONS
       The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document.
       blank  A space or tab.
       whitespace
              A character belonging to the space character class in the current locale, or for which isspace(3) returns true.
       word   A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.  Also known as a token.
       name   A word consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.  Also referred to as an identifier.
       metacharacter
              A character that, when unquoted, separates words.  One of the following:
              |  & ; ( ) < > space tab newline
       control operator
              A token that performs a control function.  It is one of the following symbols:
              || & && ; ;; ;& ;;& ( ) | |& <newline>

RESERVED WORDS
       Reserved words are words that have a special meaning to the shell.  The following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and either the first word of a command (see SHELL  GRAMMAR  below),
       the third word of a case or select command (only in is valid), or the third word of a for command (only in and do are valid):

       ! case  coproc  do done elif else esac fi for function if in select then until while { } time [[ ]]

SHELL GRAMMAR
       This section describes the syntax of the various forms of shell commands.

   Simple Commands
       A  simple  command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a control operator.  The first word specifies the command to
       be executed, and is passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.

       The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.

   Pipelines
       A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:

              [time [-p]] [ ! ] command1 [ [|⎪|&] command2 ... ]

       The standard output of command1 is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.  This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command1(see  REDIRECTION  below).
       If  |&  is  the  pipeline operator, command1's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |.  This im‐
       plicit redirection of the standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by command1.

       The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command, unless the pipefail option is enabled.  If pipefail is enabled, the pipeline's return  status  is  the  value  of  the  last
       (rightmost)  command  to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully.  If the reserved word !  precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical nega‐
       tion of the exit status as described above.  If a pipeline is executed synchronously, the shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.

       If the time reserved word precedes a pipeline, the shell reports the elapsed as well as user and system time consumed by its execution when the pipeline terminates.  The -p option changes the out‐
       put format to that specified by POSIX.  When the shell is in posix mode, it does not recognize time as a reserved word if the next token begins with a “-”.  The value of the TIMEFORMAT variable is
       a format string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed; see the description of TIMEFORMAT below under Shell Variables.

       When the shell is in posix mode, time may appear by itself as the only word in a simple command.  In this case, the shell displays the total user and system time consumed  by  the  shell  and  its
       children.  The TIMEFORMAT variable specifies the format of the time information.

       Each  command  in a multi-command pipeline, where pipes are created, is executed in a subshell, which is a separate process.  See COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT for a description of subshells and a
       subshell environment.  If the lastpipe option is enabled using the shopt builtin (see the description of shopt below), and job control is not active, the last element of a pipeline may be  run  by
       the shell process.

   Lists
       A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;, &, &&, or ||, and optionally terminated by one of ;, &, or <newline>.

       Of these list operators, && and || have equal precedence, followed by ; and &, which have equal precedence.

       A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a list instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.

       If  a  command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is
       0.  These are referred to as asynchronous commands.  Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn.  The return status is the exit sta‐
       tus of the last command executed.

       AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the && and || control operators, respectively.  AND and OR lists are executed with left associativity.  An  AND  list  has  the
       form

              command1 && command2

       command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of zero (success).

       An OR list has the form

              command1 || command2

       command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.

   Compound Commands
       A compound command is one of the following.  In most cases a list in a command's description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline
       in place of a semicolon.

       (list) list  is executed in a subshell (see COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT below for a description of a subshell environment).  Variable assignments and builtin commands that affect the shell's en‐
              vironment do not remain in effect after the command completes.  The return status is the exit status of list.

       { list; }
              list is executed in the current shell environment.  list must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a group command.  The return status is the exit status of list.

              Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and } are reserved words and must occur where a reserved word is permitted to be recognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they  must
              be separated from list by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.

       ((expression))
              The arithmetic expression is evaluated according to the rules described below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the
              return  status  is 1.  The expression undergoes the same expansions as if it were within double quotes, but unescaped double quote characters in expression are not treated specially and are
              removed.  Since this can potentially result in empty strings, this command treats those as expressions that evaluate to 0.

       [[ expression ]]
              Evaluate the conditional expression expression and return a status of zero (true) or non-zero (false).  Expressions are composed of the primaries described below under  CONDITIONAL  EXPRES‐
              SIONS.   The  words  between the [[ and ]] do not undergo word splitting and pathname expansion.  The shell performs tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion,
              command substitution, process substitution, and quote removal on those words.  Conditional operators such as -f must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries.

              When used with [[, the < and > operators sort lexicographically using the current locale.

       See the description of the test builtin command (section SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) for the handling of parameters (i.e.  missing parameters).

              When the == and != operators are used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the rules described below under Pattern Matching, as  if  the
              extglob  shell option were enabled.  The = operator is equivalent to ==.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic charac‐
              ters.  The return value is 0 if the string matches (==) or does not match (!=) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  If any part of the pattern is quoted,  the  quoted  portion  is  matched  as  a
              string: every character in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of having any special pattern matching meaning.

              An  additional binary operator, =~, is available, with the same precedence as == and !=.  When it is used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a POSIX extended regular ex‐
              pression and matched accordingly (using the POSIX regcomp and regexec interfaces usually described in regex(3)).  The return value is 0 if the string matches the pattern, and  1  otherwise.
              If  the  regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the conditional expression's return value is 2.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to
              the case of alphabetic characters.

              If any part of the pattern is quoted, the quoted portion is matched literally, as above.  If the pattern is stored in a shell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire pat‐
              tern to be matched literally.  Treat bracket expressions in regular expressions carefully, since normal quoting and pattern characters lose their meanings between brackets.

              The match succeeds if the pattern matches any part of the string.  Anchor the pattern using the ^ and $ regular expression operators to force it to match the entire string.

              The array variable BASH_REMATCH records which parts of the string matched the pattern.  The element of BASH_REMATCH with index 0 contains the portion of the string matching the entire regu‐
              lar expression.  Substrings matched by parenthesized subexpressions within the regular expression are saved in the remaining BASH_REMATCH indices.  The element of BASH_REMATCH with index  n
              is the portion of the string matching the nth parenthesized subexpression.  Bash sets BASH_REMATCH in the global scope; declaring it as a local variable will lead to unexpected results.

              Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence:

              ( expression )
                     Returns the value of expression.  This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.
              ! expression
                     True if expression is false.
              expression1 && expression2
                     True if both expression1 and expression2 are true.
              expression1 || expression2
                     True if either expression1 or expression2 is true.

              The && and || operators do not evaluate expression2 if the value of expression1 is sufficient to determine the return value of the entire conditional expression.

       for name [ [ in word ... ] ; ] do list ; done
              First,  expand  The  list of words following in, generating a list of items.  Then, the variable name is set to each element of this list in turn, and list is executed each time.  If the in
              word is omitted, the for command executes list once for each positional parameter that is set (see PARAMETERS below).  The return status is the exit status of the  last  command  that  exe‐
              cutes.  If the expansion of the items following in results in an empty list, no commands are executed, and the return status is 0.

       for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) [;] do list ; done
              First, evaluate the arithmetic expression expr1 according to the rules described below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  Then, repeatedly evaluate the arithmetic expression expr2 until it eval‐
              uates  to zero.  Each time expr2 evaluates to a non-zero value, execute list and evaluate the arithmetic expression expr3.  If any expression is omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1.
              The return value is the exit status of the last command in list that is executed, or non-zero if any of the expressions is invalid.

              Use the break and continue builtins (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) to control loop execution.

       select name [ in word ] ; do list ; done
              First, expand the list of words following in, generating a list of items, and print the set of expanded words the standard error, each preceded by a number.  If  the  in  word  is  omitted,
              print the positional parameters (see PARAMETERS below).  select then displays the PS3 prompt and reads a line from the standard input.  If the line consists of a number corresponding to one
              of  the displayed words, then select sets the value of name to that word.  If the line is empty, select displays the words and prompt again.  If EOF is read, select completes and returns 1.
              Any other value sets name to null.  The line read is saved in the variable REPLY.  The list is executed after each selection until a break command is executed.  The exit status of select is
              the exit status of the last command executed in list, or zero if no commands were executed.

       case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac
              A case command first expands word, and tries to match it against each pattern in turn, proceeding from first to last, using the matching rules described under  Pattern  Matching  below.   A
              pattern  list  is a set of one or more patterns separated by , and the ) operator terminates the pattern list.  The word is expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,
              arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process substitution and quote removal.  Each pattern examined is expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and  variable  expansion,  arithmetic
              expansion,  command substitution, process substitution, and quote removal.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic char‐
              acters.  A clause is a pattern list and an associated list.

              When a match is found, case executes the corresponding list.  If the ;; operator terminates the case clause, the case command completes after the first match.   Using  ;&  in  place  of  ;;
              causes execution to continue with the list associated with the next pattern list.  Using ;;& in place of ;; causes the shell to test the next pattern list in the statement, if any, and exe‐
              cute any associated list if the match succeeds, continuing the case statement execution as if the pattern list had not matched.  The exit status is zero if no pattern matches.

              Otherwise, it is the exit status of the last command executed in the last list executed.

       if list; then list; [ elif list; then list; ] ... [ else list; ] fi
              The  if list is executed.  If its exit status is zero, the then list is executed.  Otherwise, each elif list is executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the corresponding then list
              is executed and the command completes.  Otherwise, the else list is executed, if present.  The exit status is the exit status of the last command executed, or zero if  no  condition  tested
              true.

       while list-1; do list-2; done
       until list-1; do list-2; done
              The  while command continuously executes the list list-2 as long as the last command in the list list-1 returns an exit status of zero.  The until command is identical to the while command,
              except that the test is negated: list-2 is executed as long as the last command in list-1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The exit status of the while and until commands is the exit status
              of the last command executed in list-2, or zero if none was executed.

   Coprocesses
       A coprocess is a shell command preceded by the coproc reserved word.  A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command had been terminated with the & control operator,  with
       a two-way pipe established between the executing shell and the coprocess.

       The syntax for a coprocess is:

              coproc [NAME] command [redirections]

       This  creates  a  coprocess named NAME.  command may be either a simple command or a compound command (see above).  NAME is a shell variable name.  If NAME is not supplied, the default name is CO‐
       PROC.

       The recommended form to use for a coprocess is

              coproc NAME { command [redirections]; }

       This form is preferred because simple commands result in the coprocess always being named COPROC, and it is simpler to use and more complete than the other compound commands.

       If command is a compound command, NAME is optional. The word following coproc determines whether that word is interpreted as a variable name: it is interpreted as NAME if it is not a reserved word
       that introduces a compound command.  If command is a simple command, NAME is not allowed; this is to avoid confusion between NAME and the first word of the simple command.

       When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array variable (see Arrays below) named NAME in the context of the executing shell.  The standard output of command is connected via a pipe  to
       a  file  descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to NAME[0].  The standard input of command is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and
       that file descriptor is assigned to NAME[1].  This pipe is established before any redirections specified by the command (see REDIRECTION below).  The file descriptors can be utilized as  arguments
       to shell commands and redirections using standard word expansions.  Other than those created to execute command and process substitutions, the file descriptors are not available in subshells.

       The process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is available as the value of the variable NAME_PID.  The wait builtin may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.

       Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the coproc command always returns success.  The return status of a coprocess is the exit status of command.

   Shell Function Definitions
       A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command and executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters.  Shell functions are declared as follows:

       fname () compound-command [redirection]
       function fname [()] compound-command [redirection]
              This defines a function named fname.  The reserved word function is optional.  If the function reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional.  The body of the function is the com‐
              pound  command  compound-command (see Compound Commands above).  That command is usually a list of commands between { and }, but may be any command listed under Compound Commands above.  If
              the function reserved word is used, but the parentheses are not supplied, the braces are recommended.  compound-command is executed whenever fname is specified as the name of a simple  com‐
              mand.   When  in  posix mode, fname must be a valid shell name and may not be the name of one of the POSIX special builtins.  In default mode, a function name can be any unquoted shell word
              that does not contain $.

       Any redirections (see REDIRECTION below) specified when a function is defined are performed when the function is executed.

       The exit status of a function definition is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly function with the same name already exists.  When executed, the exit status of a function  is  the  exit
       status of the last command executed in the body.  (See FUNCTIONS below.)

COMMENTS
       In  a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the interactive_comments option to the shopt builtin is enabled (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below), a word beginning with # introduces
       a comment.  A word begins at the beginning of a line, after unquoted whitespace, or after an operator.  The comment causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to  be  ignored.   An
       interactive shell without the interactive_comments option enabled does not allow comments.  The interactive_comments option is enabled by default in interactive shells.

QUOTING
       Quoting  is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from
       being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

       Each of the metacharacters listed above under DEFINITIONS has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.

       When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see HISTORY EXPANSION below), the history expansion character, usually !, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.

       There are four quoting mechanisms: the escape character, single quotes, double quotes, and dollar-single quotes.

       A non-quoted backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, removing any special meaning it has, with the exception of <newline>.  If  a
       \<newline> pair appears, and the backslash is not itself quoted, the \<newline> is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).

       Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.

       Enclosing  characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \, and, when history expansion is enabled, !.  When the shell is
       in posix mode, the ! has no special meaning within double quotes, even when history expansion is enabled.  The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within double quotes.  The  backslash
       retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: $, `, ", \, or <newline>.  Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified.

       A  double  quote  may  be  quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an !  appearing in double quotes is escaped using a
       backslash.  The backslash preceding the !  is not removed.

       The special parameters * and @ have special meaning when in double quotes (see PARAMETERS below).

       Character sequences of the form $'string' are treated as a special variant of single quotes.  The sequence expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters in string replaced as  specified  by
       the ANSI C standard.  Backslash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows:
              \a     alert (bell)
              \b     backspace
              \e
              \E     an escape character
              \f     form feed
              \n     new line
              \r     carriage return
              \t     horizontal tab
              \v     vertical tab
              \\     backslash
              \'     single quote
              \"     double quote
              \?     question mark
              \nnn   The eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three octal digits).
              \xHH   The eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits).
              \uHHHH The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits).
              \UHHHHHHHH
                     The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits).
              \cx    A control-x character.

       The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had not been present.

   Translating Strings
       A  double-quoted  string  preceded by a dollar sign ($"string") causes the string to be translated according to the current locale.  The gettext infrastructure performs the lookup and translation,
       using the LC_MESSAGES, TEXTDOMAINDIR, and TEXTDOMAIN shell variables.  If the current locale is C or POSIX, if there are no translations available, or if the string is not translated,  the  dollar
       sign  is  ignored, and the string is treated as double-quoted as described above.  This is a form of double quoting, so the string remains double-quoted by default, whether or not it is translated
       and replaced.  If the noexpand_translation option is enabled using the shopt builtin, translated strings are single-quoted instead of double-quoted.  See the description of shopt below under SHELL
       BUILTIN COMMANDS.

PARAMETERS
       A parameter is an entity that stores values.  It can be a name, a number, or one of the special characters listed below under Special Parameters.  A variable is a parameter denoted by a  name.   A
       variable has a value and zero or more attributes.  Attributes are assigned using the declare builtin command (see declare below in SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS).  The export and readonly builtins assign
       specific attributes.

       A  parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the unset builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
       below).

       A variable is assigned to using a statement of the form

              name=[value]

       If value is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All values undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,  and  quote  re‐
       moval  (see  EXPANSION below).  If the variable has its integer attribute set, then value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see Arithmetic Expan‐
       sion below).  Word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed.  Assignment statements may also appear as arguments to the alias, declare, typeset, export, readonly, and local builtin  com‐
       mands (declaration commands).  When in posix mode, these builtins may appear in a command after one or more instances of the command builtin and retain these assignment statement properties.

       In  the  context  where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index, the “+=” operator appends to or adds to the variable's previous value.  This includes argu‐
       ments to declaration commands such as declare that accept assignment statements.  When “+=” is applied to a variable for which the integer attribute has been set, the variable's current value  and
       value  are  each  evaluated  as arithmetic expressions, and the sum of the results is assigned as the variable's value.  The current value is usually an integer constant, but may be an expression.
       When “+=” is applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see Arrays below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using “=”), and new values are appended to the array begin‐
       ning at one greater than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays) or added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array.  When applied to a string-valued variable, value is expanded
       and appended to the variable's value.

       A variable can be assigned the nameref attribute using the -n option to the declare or local builtin commands (see the descriptions of declare and local below) to create a nameref, or a  reference
       to  another  variable.   This  allows  variables to be manipulated indirectly.  Whenever the nameref variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has its attributes modified (other than using or
       changing the nameref attribute itself), the operation is actually performed on the variable specified by the nameref variable's value.  A nameref is commonly used within shell functions  to  refer
       to a variable whose name is passed as an argument to the function.  For instance, if a variable name is passed to a shell function as its first argument, running

              declare -n ref=$1

       inside  the  function  creates  a  local  nameref variable ref whose value is the variable name passed as the first argument.  References and assignments to ref, and changes to its attributes, are
       treated as references, assignments, and attribute modifications to the variable whose name was passed as $1.  If the control variable in a for loop has the nameref attribute, the list of words can
       be a list of shell variables, and a name reference is established for each word in the list, in turn, when the loop is executed.  Array variables cannot be given the nameref  attribute.   However,
       nameref  variables can reference array variables and subscripted array variables.  Namerefs can be unset using the -n option to the unset builtin.  Otherwise, if unset is executed with the name of
       a nameref variable as an argument, the variable referenced by the nameref variable is unset.

       When the shell starts, it reads its environment and creates a shell variable from each environment variable that has a valid name, as described below (see ENVIRONMENT).

   Positional Parameters
       A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked,  and  may  be
       reassigned using the set builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to with assignment statements.  The positional parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is ex‐
       ecuted (see FUNCTIONS below).

       When  a  positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see EXPANSION below).  Without braces, a digit following $ can only refer to one of
       the first nine positional parameters ($1-$9) or the special parameter $0 (see the next section).

   Special Parameters
       The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.  Special parameters are denoted by one of the following characters.

       *      ($*) Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion is not within double quotes, each positional parameter expands to a separate word.  In contexts where  word
              expansions  are  performed,  those  words are subject to further word splitting and pathname expansion.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the
              value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS variable.  That is, "$*" is equivalent to "$1c$2c...", where c is the first character of the value of the  IFS  variable.
              If IFS is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces.  If IFS is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.
       @      ($@) Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  In contexts where word splitting is performed, this expands each positional parameter to a separate word; if not within double
              quotes,  these  words  are subject to word splitting.  In contexts where word splitting is not performed, such as the value portion of an assignment statement, this expands to a single word
              with each positional parameter separated by a space.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, and word splitting is performed, each parameter expands to a separate word.   That  is,
              "$@"  is  equivalent  to  "$1" "$2" ...   If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the expansion of the beginning part of the
              original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the expansion of the last part of the original word.  When there are no positional parameters, "$@" and  $@  expand  to
              nothing (i.e., they are removed).
       #      ($#) Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
       ?      ($?) Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed command.
       -      ($-) Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the set builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the -i option).
       $      ($$) Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a subshell, it expands to the process ID of the parent shell, not the subshell.
       !      ($!)Expands to the process ID of the job most recently placed into the background, whether executed as an asynchronous command or using the bg builtin (see JOB CONTROL below).
       0      ($0)  Expands  to  the  name of the shell or shell script.  This is set at shell initialization.  If bash is invoked with a file of commands, $0 is set to the name of that file.  If bash is
              started with the -c option, then $0 is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it is set to the filename used to invoke bash, as  given  by
              argument zero.

   Shell Variables
       The shell sets following variables:

       _      ($_,  an underscore) This has a number of meanings depending on context.  At shell startup, _ is set to the pathname used to invoke the shell or shell script being executed as passed in the
              environment or argument list.  Subsequently, it expands to the last argument to the previous simple command executed in the foreground, after expansion.  It is also set to the full pathname
              used to invoke each command executed and placed in the environment exported to that command.  When checking mail, $_ expands to the name of the mail file currently being checked.
       BASH   Expands to the full filename used to invoke this instance of bash.
       BASHOPTS
              A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in the list is a valid argument for the -s option to the shopt builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).   The  options
              appearing  in  BASHOPTS  are those reported as on by shopt.  If this variable is in the environment when bash starts up, the shell enables each option in the list before reading any startup
              files.  If this variable is exported, child shells will enable each option in the list.  This variable is read-only.
       BASHPID
              Expands to the process ID of the current bash process.  This differs from $$ under certain circumstances, such as subshells that do not require bash to be  re-initialized.   Assignments  to
              BASHPID have no effect.  If BASHPID is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BASH_ALIASES
              An  associative  array variable whose members correspond to the internal list of aliases as maintained by the alias builtin.  Elements added to this array appear in the alias list; however,
              unsetting array elements currently does not remove aliases from the alias list.  If BASH_ALIASES is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BASH_ARGC
              An array variable whose values are the number of parameters in each frame of the current bash execution call stack.  The number of parameters to the current subroutine  (shell  function  or
              script  executed  with . or source) is at the top of the stack.  When a subroutine is executed, the number of parameters passed is pushed onto BASH_ARGC.  The shell sets BASH_ARGC only when
              in extended debugging mode (see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).  Setting extdebug after the shell has started to execute a script,  or  referencing  this
              variable when extdebug is not set, may result in inconsistent values.  Assignments to BASH_ARGC have no effect, and it may not be unset.
       BASH_ARGV
              An array variable containing all of the parameters in the current bash execution call stack.  The final parameter of the last subroutine call is at the top of the stack; the first parameter
              of the initial call is at the bottom.  When a subroutine is executed, the shell pushes the supplied parameters onto BASH_ARGV.  The shell sets BASH_ARGV only when in extended debugging mode
              (see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).  Setting extdebug after the shell has started to execute a script, or referencing this variable when extdebug is not
              set, may result in inconsistent values.  Assignments to BASH_ARGV have no effect, and it may not be unset.
       BASH_ARGV0
              When referenced, this variable expands to the name of the shell or shell script (identical to $0; see the description of special parameter 0 above).  Assigning a value to BASH_ARGV0 sets $0
              to the same value.  If BASH_ARGV0 is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BASH_CMDS
              An associative array variable whose members correspond to the internal hash table of commands as maintained by the hash builtin.  Adding elements to this array makes them appear in the hash
              table; however, unsetting array elements currently does not remove command names from the hash table.  If BASH_CMDS is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently re‐
              set.
       BASH_COMMAND
              Expands  to  the  command currently being executed or about to be executed, unless the shell is executing a command as the result of a trap, in which case it is the command executing at the
              time of the trap.  If BASH_COMMAND is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BASH_EXECUTION_STRING
              The command argument to the -c invocation option.
       BASH_LINENO
              An array variable whose members are the line numbers in source files where each corresponding member of FUNCNAME was invoked.  ${BASH_LINENO[$i]} is the  line  number  in  the  source  file
              (${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}) where ${FUNCNAME[$i]} was called (or ${BASH_LINENO[$i-1]} if referenced within another shell function).  Use LINENO to obtain the current line number.  Assignments to
              BASH_LINENO have no effect, and it may not be unset.
       BASH_LOADABLES_PATH
              A colon-separated list of directories in which the enable command looks for dynamically loadable builtins.
       BASH_MONOSECONDS
              Each  time  this  variable  is  referenced,  it  expands  to  the value returned by the system's monotonic clock, if one is available.  If there is no monotonic clock, this is equivalent to
              EPOCHSECONDS.  If BASH_MONOSECONDS is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BASH_REMATCH
              An array variable whose members are assigned by the =~ binary operator to the [[ conditional command.  The element with index 0 is the portion of the string matching the entire regular  ex‐
              pression.  The element with index n is the portion of the string matching the nth parenthesized subexpression.
       BASH_SOURCE
              An  array variable whose members are the source filenames where the corresponding shell function names in the FUNCNAME array variable are defined.  The shell function ${FUNCNAME[$i]} is de‐
              fined in the file ${BASH_SOURCE[$i]} and called from ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}.  Assignments to BASH_SOURCE have no effect, and it may not be unset.
       BASH_SUBSHELL
              Incremented by one within each subshell or subshell environment when the shell begins executing in that environment.  The initial value is 0.  If BASH_SUBSHELL is unset, it loses  its  spe‐
              cial properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BASH_TRAPSIG
              Set  to  the signal number corresponding to the trap action being executed during its execution.  See the description of trap under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below for information about signal
              numbers and trap execution.
       BASH_VERSINFO
              A readonly array variable whose members hold version information for this instance of bash.  The values assigned to the array members are as follows:
              BASH_VERSINFO[0]        The major version number (the release).
              BASH_VERSINFO[1]        The minor version number (the version).
              BASH_VERSINFO[2]        The patch level.
              BASH_VERSINFO[3]        The build version.
              BASH_VERSINFO[4]        The release status (e.g., beta).
              BASH_VERSINFO[5]        The value of MACHTYPE.
       BASH_VERSION
              Expands to a string describing the version of this instance of bash (e.g., 5.2.37(3)-release).
       COMP_CWORD
              An index into ${COMP_WORDS} of the word containing the current cursor position.  This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable  completion  facilities  (see
              Programmable Completion below).
       COMP_KEY
              The  key (or final key of a key sequence) used to invoke the current completion function.  This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programma‐
              ble completion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).
       COMP_LINE
              The current command line.  This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).
       COMP_POINT
              The index of the current cursor position relative to the beginning of the current command.  If the current cursor position is at the end of the current command, the value of  this  variable
              is equal to ${#COMP_LINE}.  This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).
       COMP_TYPE
              Set  to  an integer value corresponding to the type of attempted completion that caused a completion function to be called: TAB, for normal completion, ?, for listing completions after suc‐
              cessive tabs, !, for listing alternatives on partial word completion, @, to list completions if the word is not unmodified, or %, for menu completion.  This variable is  available  only  in
              shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).
       COMP_WORDBREAKS
              The  set of characters that the readline library treats as word separators when performing word completion.  If COMP_WORDBREAKS is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is sub‐
              sequently reset.
       COMP_WORDS
              An array variable (see Arrays below) consisting of the individual words in the current command line.  The line is split into words as readline would split it, using COMP_WORDBREAKS  as  de‐
              scribed above.  This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).
       COPROC An array variable (see Arrays below) created to hold the file descriptors for output from and input to an unnamed coprocess (see Coprocesses above).
       DIRSTACK
              An array variable (see Arrays below) containing the current contents of the directory stack.  Directories appear in the stack in the order they are displayed by the dirs builtin.  Assigning
              to  members  of  this  array  variable may be used to modify directories already in the stack, but the pushd and popd builtins must be used to add and remove directories.  Assigning to this
              variable does not change the current directory.  If DIRSTACK is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       EPOCHREALTIME
              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see time(3)) as a floating-point  value  with  micro-second  granularity.   Assignments  to
              EPOCHREALTIME are ignored.  If EPOCHREALTIME is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       EPOCHSECONDS
              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see time(3)).  Assignments to EPOCHSECONDS are ignored.  If EPOCHSECONDS is unset, it loses
              its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       EUID   Expands to the effective user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup.  This variable is readonly.
       FUNCNAME
              An  array  variable  containing the names of all shell functions currently in the execution call stack.  The element with index 0 is the name of any currently-executing shell function.  The
              bottom-most element (the one with the highest index) is “main”.  This variable exists only when a shell function is executing.  Assignments to FUNCNAME have no effect.  If FUNCNAME  is  un‐
              set, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

              This  variable  can  be used with BASH_LINENO and BASH_SOURCE.  Each element of FUNCNAME has corresponding elements in BASH_LINENO and BASH_SOURCE to describe the call stack.  For instance,
              ${FUNCNAME[$i]} was called from the file ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]} at line number ${BASH_LINENO[$i]}.  The caller builtin displays the current call stack using this information.
       GROUPS An array variable containing the list of groups of which the current user is a member.  Assignments to GROUPS have no effect.  If GROUPS is unset, it loses its special properties,  even  if
              it is subsequently reset.
       HISTCMD
              The history number, or index in the history list, of the current command.  Assignments to HISTCMD have no effect.  If HISTCMD is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subse‐
              quently reset.
       HOSTNAME
              Automatically set to the name of the current host.
       HOSTTYPE
              Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes the type of machine on which bash is executing.  The default is system-dependent.
       LINENO Each  time this parameter is referenced, the shell substitutes a decimal number representing the current sequential line number (starting with 1) within a script or function.  When not in a
              script or function, the value substituted is not guaranteed to be meaningful.  If LINENO is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       MACHTYPE
              Automatically set to a string that fully describes the system type on which bash is executing, in the standard GNU cpu-company-system format.  The default is system-dependent.
       MAPFILE
              An array variable (see Arrays below) created to hold the text read by the mapfile builtin when no variable name is supplied.
       OLDPWD The previous working directory as set by the cd command.
       OPTARG The value of the last option argument processed by the getopts builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       OPTIND The index of the next argument to be processed by the getopts builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       OSTYPE Automatically set to a string that describes the operating system on which bash is executing.  The default is system-dependent.
       PIPESTATUS
              An array variable (see Arrays below) containing a list of exit status values from the commands in the most-recently-executed foreground pipeline, which may consist of only a simple  command
              (see  SHELL GRAMMAR above).  Bash sets PIPESTATUS after executing multi-element pipelines, timed and negated pipelines, simple commands, subshells created with the ( operator, the [[ and ((
              compound commands, and after error conditions that result in the shell aborting command execution.
       PPID   The process ID of the shell's parent.  This variable is readonly.
       PWD    The current working directory as set by the cd command.
       RANDOM Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to a random integer between 0 and 32767.  Assigning a value to RANDOM initializes (seeds) the sequence of  random  numbers.   Seeding  the
              random number generator with the same constant value produces the same sequence of values.  If RANDOM is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       READLINE_ARGUMENT
              Any numeric argument given to a readline command that was defined using “bind -x” (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) when it was invoked.
       READLINE_LINE
              The contents of the readline line buffer, for use with “bind -x” (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       READLINE_MARK
              The  position of the mark (saved insertion point) in the readline line buffer, for use with “bind -x” (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The characters between the insertion point and the
              mark are often called the region.
       READLINE_POINT
              The position of the insertion point in the readline line buffer, for use with “bind -x” (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
       REPLY  Set to the line of input read by the read builtin command when no arguments are supplied.
       SECONDS
              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number of seconds since shell invocation.  If a value is assigned to SECONDS, the value returned upon subsequent references is  the
              number  of  seconds  since the assignment plus the value assigned.  The number of seconds at shell invocation and the current time are always determined by querying the system clock at one-
              second resolution.  If SECONDS is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       SHELLOPTS
              A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in the list is a valid argument for the -o option to the set builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The options ap‐
              pearing in SHELLOPTS are those reported as on by set -o.  If this variable is in the environment when bash starts up, the shell enables each option in the list before  reading  any  startup
              files.  If this variable is exported, child shells will enable each option in the list.  This variable is read-only.
       SHLVL  Incremented by one each time an instance of bash is started.
       SRANDOM
              Each time it is referenced, this variable expands to a 32-bit pseudo-random number.  The random number generator is not linear on systems that support /dev/urandom or arc4random(3), so each
              returned  number  has  no  relationship  to the numbers preceding it.  The random number generator cannot be seeded, so assignments to this variable have no effect.  If SRANDOM is unset, it
              loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       UID    Expands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup.  This variable is readonly.

       The shell uses the following variables. In some cases, bash assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted below.

       BASH_COMPAT
              The value is used to set the shell's compatibility level.  See SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE below for a description of the various compatibility levels and their effects.  The value  may  be  a
              decimal  number (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding to the desired compatibility level.  If BASH_COMPAT is unset or set to the empty string, the compatibility level is set to
              the default for the current version.  If BASH_COMPAT is set to a value that is not one of the valid compatibility levels, the shell prints an error message and sets the compatibility  level
              to  the  default  for  the current version.  A subset of the valid values correspond to the compatibility levels described below under SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE.  For example, 4.2 and 42 are
              valid values that correspond to the compat42 shopt option and set the compatibility level to 42.  The current version is also a valid value.
       BASH_ENV
              If this parameter is set when bash is executing a shell script, its expanded value is interpreted as a filename containing commands to initialize the shell before it reads and executes com‐
              mands from the script.  The value of BASH_ENV is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a filename.  PATH is  not  used
              to search for the resultant filename.
       BASH_XTRACEFD
              If  set  to an integer corresponding to a valid file descriptor, bash writes the trace output generated when “set -x” is enabled to that file descriptor, instead of the standard error.  The
              file descriptor is closed when BASH_XTRACEFD is unset or assigned a new value.  Unsetting BASH_XTRACEFD or assigning it the empty string causes the trace output to be sent to  the  standard
              error.  Note that setting BASH_XTRACEFD to 2 (the standard error file descriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the standard error being closed.
       CDPATH The  search  path  for  the  cd  command.   This  is a colon-separated list of directories where the shell looks for directories specified as arguments to the cd command.  A sample value is
              “.:~:/usr”.
       CHILD_MAX
              Set the number of exited child status values for the shell to remember.  Bash will not allow this value to be decreased below a POSIX-mandated minimum, and there is a  maximum  value  (cur‐
              rently 8192) that this may not exceed.  The minimum value is system-dependent.
       COLUMNS
              Used  by  the select compound command to determine the terminal width when printing selection lists.  Automatically set if the checkwinsize option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon
              receipt of a SIGWINCH.
       COMPREPLY
              An array variable from which bash reads the possible completions generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable completion facility (see Programmable Completion below).  Each ar‐
              ray element contains one possible completion.
       EMACS  If bash finds this variable in the environment when the shell starts with value “t”, it assumes that the shell is running in an Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.
       ENV    Expanded and executed similarly to BASH_ENV (see INVOCATION above) when an interactive shell is invoked in posix mode.
       EXECIGNORE
              A colon-separated list of shell patterns (see Pattern Matching) defining the set of filenames to be ignored by command search using PATH.  Files whose full pathnames match one of these pat‐
              terns are not considered executable files for the purposes of completion and command execution via PATH lookup.  This does not affect the behavior of the [, test,  and  [[  commands.   Full
              pathnames  in  the  command  hash table are not subject to EXECIGNORE.  Use this variable to ignore shared library files that have the executable bit set, but are not executable files.  The
              pattern matching honors the setting of the extglob shell option.
       FCEDIT The default editor for the fc builtin command.
       FIGNORE
              A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see READLINE below).  A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in FIGNORE is  excluded  from  the
              list of matched filenames.  A sample value is “.o:~” (Quoting is needed when assigning a value to this variable, which contains tildes).
       FUNCNEST
              If set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed this nesting level cause the current command to abort.
       GLOBIGNORE
              A  colon-separated  list of patterns defining the set of file names to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a file name matched by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the pat‐
              terns in GLOBIGNORE, it is removed from the list of matches.  The pattern matching honors the setting of the extglob shell option.
       GLOBSORT
              Controls how the results of pathname expansion are sorted.  The value of this variable specifies the sort criteria and sort order for the results of pathname expansion.  If this variable is
              unset or set to the null string, pathname expansion uses the historical behavior of sorting by name, in ascending lexicographic order as determined by the LC_COLLATE shell variable.

              If set, a valid value begins with an optional +, which is ignored, or -, which reverses the sort order from ascending to descending, followed by a sort specifier.  The valid sort specifiers
              are name, numeric, size, mtime, atime, ctime, and blocks, which sort the files on name, names in numeric rather than lexicographic order, file size, modification time,  access  time,  inode
              change time, and number of blocks, respectively.  If any of the non-name keys compare as equal (e.g., if two files are the same size), sorting uses the name as a secondary sort key.

              For example, a value of -mtime sorts the results in descending order by modification time (newest first).

              The  numeric  specifier treats names consisting solely of digits as numbers and sorts them using their numeric value (so “2” sorts before “10”, for example).  When using numeric, names con‐
              taining non-digits sort after all the all-digit names and are sorted by name using the traditional behavior.

              A sort specifier of nosort disables sorting completely; bash returns the results in the order they are read from the file system, ignoring any leading -.

              If the sort specifier is missing, it defaults to name, so a value of + is equivalent to the null string, and a value of - sorts by name in descending order.  Any invalid value restores  the
              historical sorting behavior.
       HISTCONTROL
              A  colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list.  If the list of values includes ignorespace, lines which begin with a space character are not saved
              in the history list.  A value of ignoredups causes lines matching the previous history entry not to be saved.  A value of ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups.  A value of
              erasedups causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved.  Any value not in the above list is ignored.  If HISTCONTROL  is
              unset,  or does not include a valid value, bash saves all lines read by the shell parser on the history list, subject to the value of HISTIGNORE.  If the first line of a multi-line compound
              command was saved, the second and subsequent lines are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of HISTCONTROL.  If the first line was not saved, the second and sub‐
              sequent lines of the command are not saved either.
       HISTFILE
              The name of the file in which command history is saved (see HISTORY below).  Bash assigns a default value of ~/.bash_history.  If HISTFILE is unset or null, the shell does not save the com‐
              mand history when it exits.
       HISTFILESIZE
              The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number  of  his‐
              tory entries that total no more than that number of lines by removing the oldest entries.  If the history list contains multi-line entries, the history file may contain more lines than this
              maximum  to  avoid  leaving  partial history entries.  The history file is also truncated to this size after writing it when a shell exits or by the history builtin.  If the value is 0, the
              history file is truncated to zero size.  Non-numeric values and numeric values less than zero inhibit truncation.  The shell sets the default value to the value of  HISTSIZE  after  reading
              any startup files.
       HISTIGNORE
              A  colon-separated  list of patterns used to decide which command lines should be saved on the history list.  If a command line matches one of the patterns in the value of HISTIGNORE, it is
              not saved on the history list.  Each pattern is anchored at the beginning of the line and must match the complete line (bash does not  implicitly append a  “*”).   Each  pattern  is  tested
              against the line after the checks specified by HISTCONTROL are applied.  In addition to the normal shell pattern matching characters, “&” matches the previous history line.  A backslash es‐
              capes  the  “&”;  the  backslash is removed before attempting a match.  If the first line of a multi-line compound command was saved, the second and subsequent lines are not tested, and are
              added to the history regardless of the value of HISTIGNORE.  If the first line was not saved, the second and subsequent lines of the command are not saved either.  The pattern matching hon‐
              ors the setting of the extglob shell option.
              HISTIGNORE subsumes some of the function of HISTCONTROL.  A pattern of “&” is identical to “ignoredups”, and a pattern of “[ ]*” is identical to “ignorespace”.   Combining  these  two  pat‐
              terns, separating them with a colon, provides the functionality of “ignoreboth”.
       HISTSIZE
              The number of commands to remember in the command history (see HISTORY below).  If the value is 0, commands are not saved in the history list.  Numeric values less than zero result in every
              command being saved on the history list (there is no limit).  The shell sets the default value to 500 after reading any startup files.
       HISTTIMEFORMAT
              If  this  variable is set and not null, its value is used as a format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated with each history entry displayed by the history builtin.  If
              this variable is set, the shell writes time stamps to the history file so they may be preserved across shell sessions.  This uses the history comment  character  to  distinguish  timestamps
              from other history lines.
       HOME   The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the cd builtin command.  The value of this variable is also used when performing tilde expansion.
       HOSTFILE
              Contains the name of a file in the same format as /etc/hosts that should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname.  The list of possible hostname completions may be changed while
              the shell is running; the next time hostname completion is attempted after the value is changed, bash adds the contents of the new file to the existing list.  If HOSTFILE is set, but has no
              value, or does not name a readable file, bash attempts to read /etc/hosts to obtain the list of possible hostname completions.  When HOSTFILE is unset, bash clears the hostname list.
       IFS    The Internal Field Separator that is used for word splitting after expansion and to split lines into words with the read builtin command.  Word splitting is described below under EXPANSION.
              The default value is “<space><tab><newline>”.
       IGNOREEOF
              Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an EOF character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number of consecutive EOF characters which must be typed as the first
              characters  on  an input line before bash exits.  If the variable is set but does not have a numeric value, or the value is null, the default value is 10.  If it is unset, EOF signifies the
              end of input to the shell.
       INPUTRC
              The filename for the readline startup file, overriding the default of ~/.inputrc (see READLINE below).
       INSIDE_EMACS
              If this variable appears in the environment when the shell starts, bash assumes that it is running inside an Emacs shell buffer and may disable line editing, depending on the value of TERM.
       LANG   Used to determine the locale category for any category not specifically selected with a variable starting with LC_.
       LC_ALL This variable overrides the value of LANG and any other LC_ variable specifying a locale category.
       LC_COLLATE
              This variable determines the collation order used when sorting the results of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior of range expressions, equivalence classes,  and  collating  se‐
              quences within pathname expansion and pattern matching.
       LC_CTYPE
              This variable determines the interpretation of characters and the behavior of character classes within pathname expansion and pattern matching.
       LC_MESSAGES
              This variable determines the locale used to translate double-quoted strings preceded by a $.
       LC_NUMERIC
              This variable determines the locale category used for number formatting.
       LC_TIME
              This variable determines the locale category used for data and time formatting.
       LINES  Used by the select compound command to determine the column length for printing selection lists.  Automatically set if the checkwinsize option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon re‐
              ceipt of a SIGWINCH.
       MAIL   If the value is set to a file or directory name and the MAILPATH variable is not set, bash informs the user of the arrival of mail in the specified file or Maildir-format directory.
       MAILCHECK
              Specifies how often (in seconds) bash checks for mail.  The default is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail, the shell does so before displaying the primary prompt.  If this vari‐
              able is unset, or set to a value that is not a number greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.
       MAILPATH
              A  colon-separated  list  of filenames to be checked for mail.  The message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file may be specified by separating the filename from the message
              with a “?”.  When used in the text of the message, $_ expands to the name of the current mailfile.  For example:
              MAILPATH='/var/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"'
              Bash can be configured to supply a default value for this variable (there is no value by default), but the location of  the  user  mail  files  that  it  uses  is  system  dependent  (e.g.,
              /var/mail/$USER).
       OPTERR If  set  to the value 1, bash displays error messages generated by the getopts builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  OPTERR is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked
              or a shell script is executed.
       PATH   The search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND EXECUTION below).  A zero-length (null) directory name  in  the
              value  of  PATH  indicates the current directory.  A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon.  The default path is system-dependent, and is
              set by the administrator who installs bash.  A common value is
                   /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              If this variable is in the environment when bash starts, the shell enters posix mode before reading the startup files, as if the --posix invocation option had been supplied.  If it  is  set
              while the shell is running, bash enables posix mode, as if the command “set -o posix” had been executed.  When the shell enters posix mode, it sets this variable if it was not already set.
       PROMPT_COMMAND
              If  this  variable is set, and is an array, the value of each set element is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt.  If this is set but not an array variable, its value
              is used as a command to execute instead.
       PROMPT_DIRTRIM
              If set to a number greater than zero, the value is used as the number of trailing directory components to retain when expanding the \w and \W prompt string escapes  (see  PROMPTING  below).
              Characters removed are replaced with an ellipsis.
       PS0    The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and displayed by interactive shells after reading a command and before the command is executed.
       PS1    The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and used as the primary prompt string.  The default value is “\s-\v\$ ”.
       PS2    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and used as the secondary prompt string.  The default is “> ”.
       PS3    The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the select command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above).
       PS4    The  value  of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and the value is printed before each command bash displays during an execution trace.  The first character of the expanded value of PS4
              is replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of indirection.  The default is “+ ”.
       SHELL  This variable expands to the full pathname to the shell.  If it is not set when the shell starts, bash assigns to it the full pathname of the current user's login shell.
       TIMEFORMAT
              The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the time reserved word should be displayed.  The % character  intro‐
              duces an escape sequence that is expanded to a time value or other information.  The escape sequences and their meanings are as follows; the brackets denote optional portions.
              %%        A literal %.
              %[p][l]R  The elapsed time in seconds.
              %[p][l]U  The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
              %[p][l]S  The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
              %P        The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.

              The  optional  p  is a digit specifying the precision, the number of fractional digits after a decimal point.  A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output.  time prints at
              most six digits after the decimal point; values of p greater than 6 are changed to 6.  If p is not specified, time prints three digits after the decimal point.

              The optional l specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the form MMmSS.FFs.  The value of p determines whether or not the fraction is included.

              If this variable is not set, bash acts as if it had the value $'\nreal\t%3lR\nuser\t%3lU\nsys\t%3lS'.  If the value is null, bash does not display any timing information.  A  trailing  new‐
              line is added when the format string is displayed.
       TMOUT  If set to a value greater than zero, the read builtin uses the value as its default timeout.  The select command terminates if input does not arrive after TMOUT seconds when input is coming
              from a terminal.  In an interactive shell, the value is interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for a line of input after issuing the primary prompt.  Bash terminates after waiting for
              that number of seconds if a complete line of input does not arrive.
       TMPDIR If set, bash uses its value as the name of a directory in which bash creates temporary files for the shell's use.
       auto_resume
              This  variable  controls how the shell interacts with the user and job control.  If this variable is set, simple commands consisting of only a single word, without redirections, are treated
              as candidates for resumption of an existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is more than one job beginning with or containing the word, this selects the most  recently
              accessed  job.  The name of a stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to start it, as displayed by jobs.  If set to the value exact, the word must match the name of a stopped
              job exactly; if set to substring, the word needs to match a substring of the name of a stopped job.  The substring value provides functionality analogous to the %?  job identifier (see  JOB
              CONTROL below).  If set to any other value (e.g., prefix), the word must be a prefix of a stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to the %string job identifier.
       histchars
              The two or three characters which control history expansion, quick substitution, and tokenization (see HISTORY EXPANSION below).  The first character is the history expansion character, the
              character  which begins a history expansion, normally “!”.  The second character is the quick substitution character, normally “^”.  When it appears as the first character on the line, his‐
              tory substitution repeats the previous command, replacing one string with another.  The optional third character is the history comment character,  normally “#”, which  indicates  that  the
              remainder  of  the  line is a comment when it appears as the first character of a word.  The history comment character disables history substitution for the remaining words on the line.  It
              does not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.

   Arrays
       Bash provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array variables.  Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the declare builtin explicitly declares an array.  There is no  maximum  limit
       on  the  size  of  an  array,  nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously.  Indexed arrays are referenced using arithmetic expressions that must expand to an integer (see
       ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below) and are zero-based; associative arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings.  Unless otherwise noted, indexed array indices must be non-negative integers.

       The shell performs parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, and quote removal on indexed array subscripts.  Since this can potentially result in empty strings,
       subscript indexing treats those as expressions that evaluate to 0.

       The shell performs tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, and quote removal on associative array subscripts.  Empty strings cannot  be  used
       as associative array keys.

       Bash automatically creates an indexed array if any variable is assigned to using the syntax
              name[subscript]=value .
       The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number greater than or equal to zero.  To explicitly declare an indexed array, use
              declare -a name
       (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
              declare -a name[subscript]
       is also accepted; the subscript is ignored.

       Associative arrays are created using
              declare -A name
       .

       Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the declare and readonly builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.

       Arrays  are assigned using compound assignments of the form name=(value1 ... valuen), where each value may be of the form [subscript]=string.  Indexed array assignments do not require anything but
       string.  Each value in the list is expanded using the shell expansions described below under EXPANSION, but values that are valid variable assignments including the brackets and subscript  do  not
       undergo brace expansion and word splitting, as with individual variable assignments.

       When  assigning  to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the
       statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.

       When assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound assignment may be either assignment statements, for which the subscript is required, or a list of words that is interpreted as a se‐
       quence of alternating keys and values: name=( key1 value1 key2 value2 ...).  These are treated identically to name=( [key1]=value1 [key2]=value2 ...).  The first word in the  list  determines  how
       the  remaining  words  are interpreted; all assignments in a list must be of the same type.  When using key/value pairs, the keys may not be missing or empty; a final missing value is treated like
       the empty string.

       This syntax is also accepted by the declare builtin.  Individual array elements may be assigned to using the name[subscript]=value syntax introduced above.

       When assigning to an indexed array, if name is subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of name,  so  negative  indices  count
       back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

       The “+=” operator appends to an array variable when assigning using the compound assignment syntax; see PARAMETERS above.

       An  array element is referenced using ${name[subscript]}.  The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If subscript is @ or *, the word expands to all members of name, un‐
       less noted in the description of a builtin or word expansion.  These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes.  If the word is double-quoted, ${name[*]} expands to a  sin‐
       gle  word with the value of each array member separated by the first character of the IFS special variable, and ${name[@]} expands each element of name to a separate word.  When there are no array
       members, ${name[@]} expands to nothing.  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the expansion of the  origi‐
       nal  word,  and  the  expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the expansion of the original word.  This is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters * and @ (see
       Special Parameters above).

       ${#name[subscript]} expands to the length of ${name[subscript]}.  If subscript is * or @, the expansion is the number of elements in the array.

       If the subscript used to reference an element of an indexed array evaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of the array,  so  nega‐
       tive indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

       Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with a subscript of 0.  Any reference to a variable using a valid subscript is valid; bash creates an array
       if necessary.

       An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.

       It  is  possible  to  obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the values.  ${!name[@]} and ${!name[*]} expand to the indices assigned in array variable name.  The treatment when in double
       quotes is similar to the expansion of the special parameters @ and * within double quotes.

       The unset builtin is used to destroy arrays.  unset name[subscript] unsets the array element at index subscript, for both indexed and associative arrays.  Negative subscripts to indexed arrays are
       interpreted as described above.  Unsetting the last element of an array variable does not unset the variable.  unset name, where name is an array, removes the entire array.  unset  name[subscript]
       behaves differently depending on whether name is an indexed or associative array when subscript is * or @.  If name is an associative array, this unsets the element with subscript * or @.  If name
       is an indexed array, unset removes all of the elements but does not remove the array itself.

       When using a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a command, such as with unset, without using the word expansion syntax described above, (e.g., unset a[4]), the argument is subject to
       pathname expansion.  Quote the argument if pathname expansion is not desired (e.g., unset 'a[4]').

       The  declare,  local, and readonly builtins each accept a -a option to specify an indexed array and a -A option to specify an associative array.  If both options are supplied, -A takes precedence.
       The read builtin accepts a -a option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an array.  The set and declare builtins display array values in a way that allows them to  be  reused
       as  assignments.   Other  builtins accept array name arguments as well (e.g., mapfile); see the descriptions of individual builtins below for details.  The shell provides a number of builtin array
       variables.

EXPANSION
       Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into words.  The shell performs these expansions: brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter  and  variable  expansion,  command
       substitution, arithmetic expansion, word splitting, pathname expansion, and quote removal.

       The  order  of  expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting;
       pathname expansion; and quote removal.

       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: process substitution.  This is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter, variable, and  arithmetic  expansion  and
       command substitution.

       Quote removal is always performed last.  It removes quote characters present in the original word, not ones resulting from one of the other expansions, unless they have been quoted themselves.

       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can increase the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word.  The only exceptions to this
       are the expansions of "$@" and "${name[@]}", and, in most cases, $* and ${name[*]} as explained above (see PARAMETERS).

   Brace Expansion
       Brace  expansion  is a mechanism to generate arbitrary strings sharing a common prefix and suffix, either of which can be empty.  This mechanism is similar to pathname expansion, but the filenames
       generated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded are formed from an optional preamble, followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression  between  a  pair  of
       braces,  followed  by  an optional postscript.  The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to
       right.

       Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; brace expansion preserves left to right order.  For example, a{d,c,b}e expands into “ade ace abe”.

       A sequence expression takes the form x..y[..incr], where x and y are either integers or single letters, and incr, an optional increment, is an integer.  When integers are supplied, the  expression
       expands to each number between x and y, inclusive.  If either x or y begins with a zero, each generated term will contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When letters are
       supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicographically between x and y, inclusive, using the C locale.  Note that both x and y must be of the same type (integer or letter).  When the
       increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.

       Brace  expansion  is  performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual.  Bash does not apply any syntactic
       interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.

       A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression.  Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left
       unchanged.

       A “{” or Q , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string “${” is not considered eligible for
       brace expansion, and inhibits brace expansion until the closing “}”.

       This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:

              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
       or
              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

       Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical versions of sh.  sh does not treat opening or closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in
       the output.  Bash removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For example, a word entered to sh as “file{1,2}” appears identically in the output.  Bash  outputs  that  word  as
       “file1 file2” after brace expansion.  Start bash with the +B option or disable brace expansion with the +B option to the set command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) for strict sh compatibility.

   Tilde Expansion
       If  a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (“~”), all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a tilde-prefix.
       If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible login name.  If this login name is the null  string,  the
       tilde  is  replaced  with the value of the shell parameter HOME.  If HOME is unset, the tilde expands to the home directory of the user executing the shell instead.  Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is
       replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.

       If the tilde-prefix is a “~+”, the value of the shell variable PWD replaces the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a “~-”, the shell substitutes the value of the shell variable OLDPWD, if it is
       set.  If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number N, optionally prefixed by a “+” or a “-”, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element  from  the
       directory  stack,  as  it  would  be displayed by the dirs builtin invoked with the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix as an argument.  If the characters following the tilde in the
       tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading “+” or “-”, tilde expansion assumes “+”.

       The results of tilde expansion are treated as if they were quoted, so the replacement is not subject to word splitting and pathname expansion.

       If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the tilde-prefix is unchanged.

       Bash checks each variable assignment for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately following a : or the first =, and performs tilde expansion in these cases.  Consequently, one may  use  filenames  with
       tildes in assignments to PATH, MAILPATH, and CDPATH, and the shell assigns the expanded value.

       Bash also performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the conditions of variable assignments (as described above under PARAMETERS) when they appear as arguments to simple commands.  Bash does not
       do this, except for the declaration commands listed above, when in posix mode.

   Parameter Expansion
       The  “$”  character  introduces  parameter  expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but
       serve to protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which could be interpreted as part of the name.

       When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first “}” not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or pa‐
       rameter expansion.

       The basic form of parameter expansion is

       ${parameter}

       which substitutes the value of parameter.  The braces are required when parameter is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when parameter is followed by a character which is  not  to
       be interpreted as part of its name.  The parameter is a shell parameter as described above PARAMETERS) or an array reference (Arrays).

       If  the first character of parameter is an exclamation point (!), and parameter is not a nameref, it introduces a level of indirection.  Bash uses the value formed by expanding the rest of parame‐
       ter as the new parameter; this new parameter is then expanded and that value is used in the rest of the expansion, rather than the expansion of the original parameter.  This is known  as  indirect
       expansion.  The value is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.  If parameter is a nameref, this expands to the name of the parameter ref‐
       erenced  by  parameter instead of performing the complete indirect expansion, for compatibility.  The exceptions to this are the expansions of ${!prefix*} and ${!name[@]} described below.  The ex‐
       clamation point must immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce indirection.

       In each of the cases below, word is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

       When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented below (e.g., :-), bash tests for a parameter that is unset or null.  Omitting the colon tests only for a parameter that  is  un‐
       set.

       ${parameter:-word}
              Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is substituted.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.

       ${parameter:=word}
              Assign  Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is assigned to parameter, and the expansion is the final value of parameter.  Positional parameters and special
              parameters may not be assigned in this way.

       ${parameter:?word}
              Display Error if Null or Unset.  If parameter is null or unset, the shell writes the expansion of word (or a message to that effect if word is not present) to the standard error and, if  it
              is  not interactive, exits with a non-zero status.  An interactive shell does not exit, but does not execute the command associated with the expansion.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is
              substituted.

       ${parameter:+word}
              Use Alternate Value.  If parameter is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of word is substituted.  The value of parameter is not used.

       ${parameter:offset}
       ${parameter:offset:length}
              Substring Expansion.  Expands to up to length characters of the value of parameter starting at the character specified by offset.  If parameter is @ or *, an indexed array subscripted by  @
              or *, or an associative array name, the results differ as described below.  If :length is omitted (the first form above), this expands to the substring of the value of parameter starting at
              the  character  specified  by  offset  and  extending to the end of the value.  If offset is omitted, it is treated as 0.  If length is omitted, but the colon after offset is present, it is
              treated as 0.  length and offset are arithmetic expressions (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below).

              If offset evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as an offset in characters from the end of the value of parameter.  If length evaluates to a number less than zero,  it  is
              interpreted  as  an offset in characters from the end of the value of parameter rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is the characters between offset and that result.  Note
              that a negative offset must be separated from the colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the :- expansion.

              If parameter is @ or *, the result is length positional parameters beginning at offset.  A negative offset is taken relative to one greater than the greatest  positional  parameter,  so  an
              offset of -1 evaluates to the last positional parameter (or 0 if there are no positional parameters).  It is an expansion error if length evaluates to a number less than zero.

              If  parameter  is an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *, the result is the length members of the array beginning with ${parameter[offset]}.  A negative offset is taken relative to one
              greater than the maximum index of the specified array.  It is an expansion error if length evaluates to a number less than zero.

              Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined results.

              Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters are used, in which case the indexing starts at 1 by default.  If offset is 0, and the positional parameters are used, $0 is
              prefixed to the list.

       ${!prefix*}
       ${!prefix@}
              Names matching prefix.  Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with prefix, separated by the first character of the IFS special variable.  When @ is used and the expansion  ap‐
              pears within double quotes, each variable name expands to a separate word.

       ${!name[@]}
       ${!name[*]}
              List  of  array  keys.  If name is an array variable, expands to the list of array indices (keys) assigned in name.  If name is not an array, expands to 0 if name is set and null otherwise.
              When @ is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each key expands to a separate word.

       ${#parameter}
              Parameter length.  Substitutes the length in characters of the expanded value of parameter.  If parameter is * or @, the value substituted is the number of positional parameters.  If  para‐
              meter  is  an  array  name subscripted by * or @, the value substituted is the number of elements in the array.  If parameter is an indexed array name subscripted by a negative number, that
              number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of parameter, so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the  last  ele‐
              ment.

       ${parameter#word}
       ${parameter##word}
              Remove matching prefix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, and matched against the expanded value of parameter using the rules described under
              Pattern  Matching below.  If the pattern matches the beginning of the value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with the shortest matching pat‐
              tern (the “#” case) or the longest matching pattern (the “##” case) deleted.  If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and  the
              expansion  is the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion
              is the resultant list.

       ${parameter%word}
       ${parameter%%word}
              Remove matching suffix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, and matched against the expanded value of parameter using the rules described under
              Pattern Matching below.  If the pattern matches a trailing portion of the expanded value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with the  shortest
              matching  pattern  (the  “%” case) or the longest matching pattern (the “%%” case) deleted.  If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in
              turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in turn,  and
              the expansion is the resultant list.

       ${parameter/pattern/string}
       ${parameter//pattern/string}
       ${parameter/#pattern/string}
       ${parameter/%pattern/string}
              Pattern substitution.  The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern and matched against the expanded value of parameter as described under Pattern Matching below.  The longest match of pat‐
              tern  in  the  expanded value is replaced with string.  string undergoes tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command and process substitution, and quote
              removal.

              In the first form above, only the first match is replaced.  If there are two slashes separating parameter and pattern (the second form above), all  matches  of  pattern  are  replaced  with
              string.  If pattern is preceded by # (the third form above), it must match at the beginning of the expanded value of parameter.  If pattern is preceded by % (the fourth form above), it must
              match at the end of the expanded value of parameter.

              If the expansion of string is null, matches of pattern are deleted and the / following pattern may be omitted.

              If the patsub_replacement shell option is enabled using shopt, any unquoted instances of & in string are replaced with the matching portion of pattern.

              Quoting  any  part  of string inhibits replacement in the expansion of the quoted portion, including replacement strings stored in shell variables.  Backslash escapes & in string; the back‐
              slash is removed in order to permit a literal & in the replacement string.  Backslash can also be used to escape a backslash; \\ results in a literal backslash in  the  replacement.   Users
              should  take care if string is double-quoted to avoid unwanted interactions between the backslash and double-quoting, since backslash has special meaning within double quotes.  Pattern sub‐
              stitution performs the check for unquoted & after expanding string; shell programmers should quote any occurrences of & they want to be taken literally in the replacement and ensure any in‐
              stances of & they want to be replaced are unquoted.

              Like the pattern removal operators, double quotes surrounding the replacement string quote the expanded characters, while double quotes enclosing the entire parameter substitution  do  not,
              since the expansion is performed in a context that doesn't take any enclosing double quotes into account.

              If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.

              If  parameter  is @ or *, the substitution operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted
              with @ or *, the substitution operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

       ${parameter^pattern}
       ${parameter^^pattern}
       ${parameter,pattern}
       ${parameter,,pattern}
              Case modification.  This expansion modifies the case of alphabetic characters in parameter.  First, the pattern is expanded to produce a pattern as described below under  Pattern  Matching.
              Bash  then examines characters in the expanded value of parameter against pattern as described below.  If a character matches the pattern, its case is converted.  The pattern should not at‐
              tempt to match more than one character.

              Using “^” converts lowercase letters matching pattern to uppercase; “,” converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase.  The ^ and , variants examine the first character in  the  expanded
              value  and  convert its case if it matches pattern; the ^^ and ,, variants examine all characters in the expanded value and convert each one that matches pattern.  If pattern is omitted, it
              is treated like a ?, which matches every character.

              If parameter is @ or *, the case modification operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is  an  array  variable  sub‐
              scripted with @ or *, the case modification operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

       ${parameter@operator}
              Parameter  transformation.  The expansion is either a transformation of the value of parameter or information about parameter itself, depending on the value of operator.  Each operator is a
              single letter:
              U      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with lowercase alphabetic characters converted to uppercase.
              u      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with the first character converted to uppercase, if it is alphabetic.
              L      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with uppercase alphabetic characters converted to lowercase.
              Q      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter quoted in a format that can be reused as input.
              E      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with backslash escape sequences expanded as with the $'...' quoting mechanism.
              P      The expansion is a string that is the result of expanding the value of parameter as if it were a prompt string (see PROMPTING below).
              A      The expansion is a string in the form of an assignment statement or declare command that, if evaluated, recreates parameter with its attributes and value.
              K      Produces a possibly-quoted version of the value of parameter, except that it prints the values of indexed and associative arrays as a sequence of quoted key-value pairs  (see  Arrays
                     above).  The keys and values are quoted in a format that can be reused as input.
              a      The expansion is a string consisting of flag values representing parameter's attributes.
              k      Like the K transformation, but expands the keys and values of indexed and associative arrays to separate words after word splitting.

              If  parameter  is @ or *, the operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *,
              the operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

              The result of the expansion is subject to word splitting and pathname expansion as described below.

   Command Substitution
       Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself.  There are two standard forms:

              $(command)
       or (deprecated)
              `command`.

       Bash performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.   Em‐
       bedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.  The command substitution $(cat file) can be replaced by the equivalent but faster $(< file).

       With the old-style backquote form of substitution, backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed by $, `, or \.  The first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command
       substitution.  When using the $(command) form, all characters between the parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.

       There is an alternate form of command substitution:

              ${c command;}

       which executes command in the current execution environment and captures its output, again with trailing newlines removed.

       The  character  c  following  the open brace must be a space, tab, newline, or |, and the close brace must be in a position where a reserved word may appear (i.e., preceded by a command terminator
       such as semicolon).  Bash allows the close brace to be joined to the remaining characters in the word without being followed by a shell metacharacter as a reserved word would usually require.

       Any side effects of command take effect immediately in the current execution environment and persist in the current environment after the command  completes  (e.g.,  the  exit  builtin  exits  the
       shell).

       This type of command substitution superficially resembles executing an unnamed shell function: local variables are created as when a shell function is executing, and the return builtin forces com‐
       mand to complete; however, the rest of the execution environment, including the positional parameters, is shared with the caller.

       If the first character following the open brace is a |, the construct expands to the value of the REPLY shell variable after command executes, without removing any trailing newlines, and the stan‐
       dard  output  of command remains the same as in the calling shell.  Bash creates REPLY as an initially-unset local variable when command executes, and restores REPLY to the value it had before the
       command substitution after command completes, as with any local variable.

       Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the backquoted form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.

       If the substitution appears within double quotes, bash does not perform word splitting and pathname expansion on the results.

   Arithmetic Expansion
       Arithmetic expansion evaluates an arithmetic expression and substitutes the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:

              $((expression))

       The old format $[expression] is deprecated and will be removed in upcoming versions of bash.

       The expression undergoes the same expansions as if it were within double quotes, but unescaped double quote characters in expression are not treated specially and are removed.  All tokens  in  the
       expression  undergo parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.  The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be evaluated.  Since the way Bash handles dou‐
       ble quotes can potentially result in empty strings, arithmetic expansion treats those as expressions that evaluate to 0.  Arithmetic expansions may be nested.

       The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  If expression is invalid, bash prints a message to standard error indicating failure, does not perform
       the substitution, and does not execute the command associated with the expansion.

   Process Substitution
       Process substitution allows a process's input or output to be referred to using a filename.  It takes the form of <(list) or >(list).  The process list is run asynchronously, and its input or out‐
       put appears as a filename.  This filename is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion.

       If the >(list) form is used, writing to the file provides input for list.  If the <(list) form is used, reading the file obtains the output of list.  No space may appear between the < or > and the
       left parenthesis, otherwise the construct would be interpreted as a redirection.

       Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (FIFOs) or the /dev/fd method of naming open files.

       When available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

   Word Splitting
       The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for word splitting.  Words that were not expanded are not
       split.

       The shell treats each character of IFS as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions into words using these characters as field terminators.

       An IFS whitespace character is whitespace as defined above (see Definitions) that appears in the value of IFS.  Space, tab, and newline are always considered IFS whitespace, even if they don't ap‐
       pear in the locale's space category.

       If IFS is unset, field splitting acts as if its value were <space><tab><newline>, and treats these characters as IFS whitespace.  If the value of IFS is null, no word  splitting  occurs,  but  im‐
       plicit null arguments (see below) are still removed.

       Word splitting begins by removing sequences of IFS whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions, then splits the remaining words.

       If  the value of IFS consists solely of IFS whitespace, any sequence of IFS whitespace characters delimits a field, so a field consists of characters that are not unquoted IFS whitespace, and null
       fields result only from quoting.

       If IFS contains a non-whitespace character, then any character in the value of IFS that is not IFS whitespace, along with any adjacent IFS whitespace characters, delimits a field.  This means that
       adjacent non-IFS-whitespace delimiters produce a null field.  A sequence of IFS whitespace characters also delimits a field.

       Explicit null arguments ("" or '') are retained and passed to commands as empty strings.  Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion of parameters that have no values, are  re‐
       moved.  Expanding a parameter with no value within double quotes produces a null field, which is retained and passed to a command as an empty string.

       When  a  quoted null argument appears as part of a word whose expansion is non-null, word splitting removes the null argument portion, leaving the non-null expansion.  That is, the word “-d''” be‐
       comes “-d” after word splitting and null argument removal.

   Pathname Expansion
       After word splitting, unless the -f option has been set, bash scans each word for the characters *, ?, and [.  If one of these characters appears, and is not quoted, then the word is regarded as a
       pattern, and replaced with a sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see Pattern Matching below) subject to the value of the GLOBSORT shell variable.

       If no matching filenames are found, and the shell option nullglob is not enabled, the word is left unchanged.  If the nullglob option is set, and no matches are found, the word is removed.  If the
       failglob shell option is set, and no matches are found, bash prints an error message and does not execute the command.  If the shell option nocaseglob is enabled, the match  is  performed  without
       regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  Note that when using range expressions like [a-z] (see below), letters of the other case may be included, depending on the setting of LC_COLLATE.

       When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character “.” at the start of a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option dotglob is set.  In or‐
       der  to match the filenames . and .., the pattern must begin with “.” (for example, “.?”), even if dotglob is set.  If the globskipdots shell option is enabled, the filenames . and .. never match,
       even if the pattern begins with a “.”.  When not matching pathnames, the “.” character is not treated specially.

       When matching a pathname, the slash character must always be matched explicitly by a slash in the pattern, but in other matching contexts it can be matched by a special pattern  character  as  de‐
       scribed below under Pattern Matching.

       See the description of shopt below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS for a description of the nocaseglob, nullglob, globskipdots, failglob, and dotglob shell options.

       The  GLOBIGNORE  shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file names matching a pattern.  If GLOBIGNORE is set, each matching file name that also matches one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE
       is removed from the list of matches.  If the nocaseglob option is set, the matching against the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is performed without regard to case.  The filenames . and .. are  always  ig‐
       nored  when GLOBIGNORE is set and not null.  However, setting GLOBIGNORE to a non-null value has the effect of enabling the dotglob shell option, so all other filenames beginning with a “.” match.
       To get the old behavior of ignoring filenames beginning with a “.”, make “.*”  one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE.  The dotglob option is disabled when GLOBIGNORE is unset.  The GLOBIGNORE  pattern
       matching honors the setting of the extglob shell option.

       The value of the GLOBSORT shell variable controls how the results of pathname expansion are sorted, as described above under Shell Variables.

       Pattern Matching

       Any  character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character may not occur in a pattern.  A backslash escapes the follow‐
       ing character; the escaping backslash is discarded when matching.  The special pattern characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.

       The special pattern characters have the following meanings:

              *      Matches any string, including the null string.  When the globstar shell option is enabled, and * is used in a pathname expansion context, two adjacent *s used  as  a  single  pattern
                     match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.  If followed by a /, two adjacent *s match only directories and subdirectories.
              ?      Matches any single character.
              [...]  Matches  any  one  of the characters enclosed between the brackets.  This is known as a bracket expression and matches a single character.  A pair of characters separated by a hyphen
                     denotes a range expression; any character that falls between those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale's collating sequence and character set, matches.  If the  first
                     character  following the [ is a !  or a ^ then any character not within the range matches.  To match a -, include it as the first or last character in the set.  To match a ], include
                     it as the first character in the set.

                     The sorting order of characters in range expressions, and the characters included in the range, are determined by the current locale and the values of the LC_COLLATE or LC_ALL  shell
                     variables,  if  set.  To obtain the traditional interpretation of range expressions, where [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd], set the value of the LC_COLLATE or LC_ALL shell variables to
                     C, or enable the globasciiranges shell option.

                     Within a bracket expression, character classes can be specified using the syntax [:class:], where class is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX standard:

                     alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower print punct space upper word xdigit

                     A character class matches any character belonging to that class.  The word character class matches letters, digits, and the character _.

                     Within a bracket expression, an equivalence class can be specified using the syntax [=c=], which matches all characters with the same collation weight (as defined by the current  lo‐
                     cale) as the character c.

                     Within a bracket expression, the syntax [.symbol.] matches the collating symbol symbol.

       If  the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin, the shell recognizes several extended pattern matching operators.  In the following description, a pattern-list is a list of one or
       more patterns separated by a |.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of the following sub-patterns:

              ?(pattern-list)
                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns.
              *(pattern-list)
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns.
              +(pattern-list)
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns.
              @(pattern-list)
                     Matches one of the given patterns.
              !(pattern-list)
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns.

       The extglob option changes the behavior of the parser, since the parentheses are normally treated as operators with syntactic meaning.  To ensure that extended matching patterns  are  parsed  cor‐
       rectly, make sure that extglob is enabled before parsing constructs containing the patterns, including shell functions and command substitutions.

       When matching filenames, the dotglob shell option determines the set of filenames that are tested: when dotglob is enabled, the set of filenames includes all files beginning with “.”, but . and ..
       must  be  matched by a pattern or sub-pattern that begins with a dot; when it is disabled, the set does not include any filenames beginning with “.” unless the pattern or sub-pattern begins with a
       “.”.  If the globskipdots shell option is enabled, the filenames . and .. never appear in the set.  As above, “.” only has a special meaning when matching filenames.

       Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is slow, especially when the patterns contain alternations and the strings contain multiple  matches.   Using  separate  matches  against
       shorter strings, or using arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may be faster.

   Quote Removal
       After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters \, ', and " that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed.

REDIRECTION
       Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using a special notation interpreted by the shell.  Redirection allows commands' file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed,
       made  to  refer to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and writes to.  When used with the exec builtin, redirections modify file handles in the current shell execution
       environment.  The following redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a simple command or may follow a command.  Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from left to
       right.

       Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may instead be preceded by a word of the form {varname}.  In this case, for each redirection operator  except  >&-  and  <&-,  the
       shell allocates a file descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and assigns it to varname.  If {varname} precedes >&- or <&-, the value of varname defines the file descriptor to close.  If {varname}
       is  supplied,  the  redirection  persists  beyond the scope of the command, which allows the shell programmer to manage the file descriptor's lifetime manually without using the exec builtin.  The
       varredir_close shell option manages this behavior.

       In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is “<”, the redirection refers to the standard input  (file  descriptor
       0).  If the first character of the redirection operator is “>”, the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).

       The  word following the redirection operator in the following descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command sub‐
       stitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting.  If it expands to more than one word, bash reports an error.

       The order of redirections is significant.  For example, the command

              ls > dirlist 2>&1

       directs both standard output and standard error to the file dirlist, while the command

              ls 2>&1 > dirlist

       directs only the standard output to file dirlist, because the standard error was directed to the standard output before the standard output was redirected to dirlist.

       Bash handles several filenames specially when they are used in redirections, as described in the following table.  If the operating system on which bash is running provides  these  special  files,
       bash uses them; otherwise it emulates them internally with the behavior described below.

              /dev/fd/fd
                     If fd is a valid integer, duplicate file descriptor fd.
              /dev/stdin
                     File descriptor 0 is duplicated.
              /dev/stdout
                     File descriptor 1 is duplicated.
              /dev/stderr
                     File descriptor 2 is duplicated.
              /dev/tcp/host/port
                     If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port number or service name, bash attempts to open the corresponding TCP socket.
              /dev/udp/host/port
                     If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port number or service name, bash attempts to open the corresponding UDP socket.

       A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.

       Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with care, as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses internally.

       Note that the exec builtin command can make redirections take effect in the current shell.

   Redirecting Input
       Redirecting input opens the file whose name results from the expansion of word for reading on file descriptor n, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if n is not specified.

       The general format for redirecting input is:

              [n]<word

   Redirecting Output
       Redirecting  output  opens  the  file whose name results from the expansion of word for writing on file descriptor n, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.  If the file
       does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.

       The general format for redirecting output is:

              [n]>word

       If the redirection operator is >, and the noclobber option to the set builtin command has been enabled, the redirection fails if the file whose name results from the expansion of word  exists  and
       is  a  regular file.  If the redirection operator is >|, or the redirection operator is > and the noclobber option to the set builtin is not enabled, bash attempts the redirection even if the file
       named by word exists.

   Appending Redirected Output
       Redirecting output in this fashion opens the file whose name results from the expansion of word for appending on file descriptor n, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if n  is  not  speci‐
       fied.  If the file does not exist it is created.

       The general format for appending output is:

              [n]>>word

   Redirecting Standard Output and Standard Error
       This construct redirects both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to the file whose name is the expansion of word.

       There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:

              &>word
       and
              >&word

       Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically equivalent to

              >word 2>&1

       When using the second form, word may not expand to a number or -.  If it does, other redirection operators apply (see Duplicating File Descriptors below) for compatibility reasons.

   Appending Standard Output and Standard Error
       This construct appends both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to the file whose name is the expansion of word.

       The format for appending standard output and standard error is:

              &>>word

       This is semantically equivalent to

              >>word 2>&1

       (see Duplicating File Descriptors below).

   Here Documents
       This  type  of  redirection  instructs  the shell to read input from the current source until it reads a line containing only delimiter (with no trailing blanks).  All of the lines read up to that
       point then become the standard input (or file descriptor n if n is specified) for a command.

       The format of here-documents is:

              [n]<<[-]word
                      here-document
              delimiter

       The shell does not perform parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion on word.

       If any part of word is quoted, the delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded.  If word is unquoted, the delimiter is  word  itself,  and
       the  here-document  text  is  treated  similarly to a double-quoted string: all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, the
       character sequence \<newline> is treated literally, and \ must be used to quote the characters \, $, and `; however, double quote characters have no special meaning.

       If the redirection operator is <<-, then the shell strips all leading tab characters from input lines and the line containing delimiter.  This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be  in‐
       dented in a natural fashion.

       If the delimiter is not quoted, the \<newline> sequence is treated as a line continuation: the two lines are joined and the backslash-newline is removed.  This happens while reading the here-docu‐
       ment, before the check for the ending delimiter, so joined lines can form the end delimiter.

   Here Strings
       A variant of here documents, the format is:

              [n]<<<word

       The  word undergoes tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal.  Pathname expansion and word splitting are not performed.  The
       result is supplied as a single string, with a newline appended, to the command on its standard input (or file descriptor n if n is specified).

   Duplicating File Descriptors
       The redirection operator

              [n]<&word

       is used to duplicate input file descriptors.  If word expands to one or more digits, file descriptor n is made to be a copy of that file descriptor.  It is a redirection error  if  the  digits  in
       word do not specify a file descriptor open for input.  If word evaluates to -, file descriptor n is closed.  If n is not specified, this uses the standard input (file descriptor 0).

       The operator

              [n]>&word

       is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If n is not specified, this uses the standard output (file descriptor 1).  It is a redirection error if the digits in word do not specify a
       file  descriptor open for output.  If word evaluates to -, file descriptor n is closed.  As a special case, if n is omitted, and word does not expand to one or more digits or -, this redirects the
       standard output and standard error as described previously.

   Moving File Descriptors
       The redirection operator

              [n]<&digit-

       moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if n is not specified.  digit is closed after being duplicated to n.

       Similarly, the redirection operator

              [n]>&digit-

       moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.

   Opening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing
       The redirection operator

              [n]<>word

       opens the file whose name is the expansion of word for both reading and writing on file descriptor n, or on file descriptor 0 if n is not specified.  If the file does not exist, it is created.

ALIASES
       Aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word that is in a position in the input where it can be the first word of a simple command.  Aliases have names and corresponding values that are set
       and unset using the alias and unalias builtin commands (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       If the shell reads an unquoted word in the right position, it checks the word to see if it matches an alias name.  If it matches, the shell replaces the word with the alias value, and  reads  that
       value as if it had been read instead of the word.  The shell doesn't look at any characters following the word before attempting alias substitution.

       The  characters  /, $, `, and = and any of the shell metacharacters or quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replacement text may contain any valid shell input, in‐
       cluding shell metacharacters.  The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time.  This means that
       one may alias ls to ls -F, for instance, and bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.

       If the last character of the alias value is a blank, the shell checks the next command word following the alias for alias expansion.

       Aliases are created and listed with the alias command, and removed with the unalias command.

       There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If arguments are needed, use a shell function (see FUNCTIONS below) instead.

       Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing.  Bash always reads at least one complete line of input, and all lines that make up a compound command, before execut‐
       ing any of the commands on that line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same  line  as
       another command does not take effect until the shell reads the next line of input, and an alias definition in a compound command does not take effect until the shell parses and executes the entire
       compound command.  The commands following the alias definition on that line, or in the rest of a compound command, are not affected by the new alias.  This behavior is also an issue when functions
       are  executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in
       a function are not available until after that function is executed.  To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use alias in compound commands.

       For almost every purpose, shell functions are preferable to aliases.

FUNCTIONS
       A shell function, defined as described above under SHELL GRAMMAR, stores a series of commands for later execution.  When the name of a shell function is used as a simple command  name,  the  shell
       executes the list of commands associated with that function name.  Functions are executed in the context of the calling shell; there is no new process created to interpret them (contrast this with
       the execution of a shell script).

       When  a  function  is  executed,  the arguments to the function become the positional parameters during its execution.  The special parameter # is updated to reflect the new positional parameters.
       Special parameter 0 is unchanged.  The first element of the FUNCNAME variable is set to the name of the function while the function is executing.

       All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a function and its caller with these exceptions: the DEBUG and RETURN traps (see the description of the trap builtin  un‐
       der  SHELL  BUILTIN COMMANDS below) are not inherited unless the function has been given the trace attribute (see the description of the declare builtin below) or the -o functrace shell option has
       been enabled with the set builtin (in which case all functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps), and the ERR trap is not inherited unless the -o errtrace shell option has been enabled.

       Variables local to the function are declared with the local builtin command (local variables).  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the function and its caller.  If  a  vari‐
       able is declared local, the variable's visible scope is restricted to that function and its children (including the functions it calls).

       In the following description, the current scope is a currently- executing function.  Previous scopes consist of that function's caller and so on, back to the “global” scope, where the shell is not
       executing any shell function.  A local variable at the current scope is a variable declared using the local or declare builtins in the function that is currently executing.

       Local  variables  “shadow”  variables with the same name declared at previous scopes.  For instance, a local variable declared in a function hides variables with the same name declared at previous
       scopes, including global variables: references and assignments refer to the local variable, leaving the variables at previous scopes unmodified.  When the function returns, the global variable  is
       once again visible.

       The  shell  uses  dynamic scoping to control a variable's visibility within functions.  With dynamic scoping, visible variables and their values are a result of the sequence of function calls that
       caused execution to reach the current function.  The value of a variable that a function sees depends on its value within its caller, if any, whether that caller is the  global  scope  or  another
       shell function.  This is also the value that a local variable declaration shadows, and the value that is restored when the function returns.

       For  example,  if  a  variable  var  is declared as local in function func1, and func1 calls another function func2, references to var made from within func2 resolve to the local variable var from
       func1, shadowing any global variable named var.

       The unset builtin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a variable is local to the current scope, unset unsets it; otherwise the unset will refer to the variable found in any calling scope as
       described above.  If a variable at the current local scope is unset, it remains so (appearing as unset) until it is reset in that scope or until the function returns.  Once the  function  returns,
       any  instance  of  the  variable at a previous scope becomes visible.  If the unset acts on a variable at a previous scope, any instance of a variable with that name that had been shadowed becomes
       visible (see below how the localvar_unset shell option changes this behavior).

       The FUNCNEST variable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.

       If the builtin command return is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call.  If return is supplied a numeric argument, that
       is the function's return status; otherwise the function's return status is the exit status of the last command executed before the return.  Any command associated with the RETURN trap is  executed
       before execution resumes.  When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter # are restored to the values they had prior to the function's execution.

       The  -f  option  to the declare or typeset builtin commands lists function names and definitions.  The -F option to declare or typeset lists the function names only (and optionally the source file
       and line number, if the extdebug shell option is enabled).  Functions may be exported so that child shell processes (those created when executing a separate shell  invocation)  automatically  have
       them defined with the -f option to the export builtin.  The -f option to the unset builtin deletes a function definition.

       Functions  may be recursive.  The FUNCNEST variable may be used to limit the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number of function invocations.  By default, bash imposes no limit on
       the number of recursive calls.

ARITHMETIC EVALUATION
       The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain circumstances (see the let and declare builtin commands, the (( compound command, the arithmetic for command, the  [[  condi‐
       tional command, and Arithmetic Expansion).

       Evaluation is done in the largest fixed-width integers available, with no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error.  The operators and their precedence, associa‐
       tivity,  and  values  are the same as in the C language.  The following list of operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are listed in order of decreasing prece‐
       dence.

       id++ id--
              variable post-increment and post-decrement
       ++id --id
              variable pre-increment and pre-decrement
       - +    unary minus and plus
       ! ~    logical and bitwise negation
       **     exponentiation
       * / %  multiplication, division, remainder
       + -    addition, subtraction
       << >>  left and right bitwise shifts
       <= >= < >
              comparison
       == !=  equality and inequality
       &      bitwise AND
       ^      bitwise exclusive OR
       |      bitwise OR
       &&     logical AND
       ||     logical OR
       expr?expr:expr
              conditional operator
       = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=
              assignment
       expr1 , expr2
              comma

       Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression, shell variables may also be referenced by  name  without  using
       the  parameter  expansion syntax.  This means you can use "x", where x is a shell variable name, in an arithmetic expression, and the shell will evaluate its value as an expression and use the re‐
       sult.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name in an expression.

       The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the integer attribute using declare -i is assigned a value.  A  null
       value evaluates to 0.  A shell variable need not have its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression.

       Integer  constants follow the C language definition, without suffixes or character constants.  Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.
       Otherwise, numbers take the form [base#]n, where the optional base is a decimal number between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and n is a number in that base.  If base# is omitted, then
       base 10 is used.  When specifying n, if a non-digit is required, the digits greater than 9 are represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that  order.   If  base  is
       less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.

       Operators are evaluated in precedence order.  Sub-expressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.

CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS
       Conditional  expressions are used by the [[ compound command and the test and [ builtin commands to test file attributes and perform string and arithmetic comparisons.  The test and [ commands de‐
       termine their behavior based on the number of arguments; see the descriptions of those commands for any other command-specific actions.

       Expressions are formed from the unary or binary primaries listed below.  Unary expressions are often used to examine the status of a file or shell variable.  Binary operators are used for  string,
       numeric, and file attribute comparisons.

       Bash  handles  several  filenames specially when they are used in expressions.  If the operating system on which bash is running provides these special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will
       emulate them internally with this behavior: If any file argument to one of the primaries is of the form /dev/fd/n, then bash checks file descriptor n.  If the file argument to one of the primaries
       is one of /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, or /dev/stderr, bash checks file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively.

       Unless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow symbolic links and operate on the target of the link, rather than the link itself.

       When used with [[, or when the shell is in posix mode, the < and > operators sort lexicographically using the current locale.  When the shell is not in posix mode, the  test  command  sorts  using
       ASCII ordering.

       -a file
              True if file exists.
       -b file
              True if file exists and is a block special file.
       -c file
              True if file exists and is a character special file.
       -d file
              True if file exists and is a directory.
       -e file
              True if file exists.
       -f file
              True if file exists and is a regular file.
       -g file
              True if file exists and is set-group-id.
       -h file
              True if file exists and is a symbolic link.
       -k file
              True if file exists and its “sticky” bit is set.
       -p file
              True if file exists and is a named pipe (FIFO).
       -r file
              True if file exists and is readable.
       -s file
              True if file exists and has a size greater than zero.
       -t fd  True if file descriptor fd is open and refers to a terminal.
       -u file
              True if file exists and its set-user-id bit is set.
       -w file
              True if file exists and is writable.
       -x file
              True if file exists and is executable.
       -G file
              True if file exists and is owned by the effective group id.
       -L file
              True if file exists and is a symbolic link.
       -N file
              True if file exists and has been modified since it was last accessed.
       -O file
              True if file exists and is owned by the effective user id.
       -S file
              True if file exists and is a socket.
       -o optname
              True if the shell option optname is enabled.  See the list of options under the description of the -o option to the set builtin below.
       -v varname
              True  if  the shell variable varname is set (has been assigned a value).  If varname is an indexed array variable name subscripted by @ or *, this returns true if the array has any set ele‐
              ments.  If varname is an associative array variable name subscripted by @ or *, this returns true if an element with that key is set.
       -R varname
              True if the shell variable varname is set and is a name reference.
       -z string
              True if the length of string is zero.
       string
       -n string
              True if the length of string is non-zero.

       string1 == string2
       string1 = string2
              True if the strings are equal.  = should be used with the test command for POSIX conformance.  When used with the [[ command, this performs pattern matching  as  described  above  (Compound
              Commands).
       string1 != string2
              True if the strings are not equal.
       string1 < string2
              True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically.
       string1 > string2
              True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.

       file1 -ef file2
              True if file1 and file2 refer to the same device and inode numbers.
       file1 -nt file2
              True if file1 is newer (according to modification date) than file2, or if file1 exists and file2 does not.
       file1 -ot file2
              True if file1 is older than file2, or if file2 exists and file1 does not.

       arg1 OP arg2
              OP  is  one  of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge.  These arithmetic binary operators return true if arg1 is equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater
              than or equal to arg2, respectively.  arg1 and arg2 may be positive or negative integers.  When used with the [[ command, arg1 and arg2 are evaluated as arithmetic expressions  (see  ARITH‐
              METIC EVALUATION above).  Since the expansions the [[ command performs on arg1 and arg2 can potentially result in empty strings, arithmetic expression evaluation treats those as expressions
              that evaluate to 0.

SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION
       When the shell executes a simple command, it performs the following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right, in the following order.

       1.     The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later processing.

       2.     The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded.  If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words
              are the arguments.

       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under REDIRECTION.

       4.     The  text  after the = in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the
              variable.

       If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current shell environment.  In the case of such a command (one that consists only of assignment statements  and  redirections),  as‐
       signment  statements  are  performed before redirections.  Otherwise, the variables are added to the environment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell environment.  If any of
       the assignments attempts to assign a value to a readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero status.

       If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not affect the current shell environment.  A redirection error causes the command to exit with a non-zero status.

       If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.  If one of the expansions contained a command substitution, the  exit  status
       of the command is the exit status of the last command substitution performed.  If there were no command substitutions, the command exits with a zero status.

COMMAND EXECUTION
       After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the shell performs the following actions.

       If  the  command  name  contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked as described above in FUNCTIONS.  If the name
       does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.

       If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, bash searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name.  Bash uses a hash
       table to remember the full pathnames of executable files (see hash under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  Bash performs a full search of the directories in PATH only if the command is not found  in
       the  hash table.  If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell function named command_not_found_handle.  If that function exists, it is invoked in a separate execution en‐
       vironment with the original command and the original command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit status becomes the exit status of that subshell.  If that  function  is  not  de‐
       fined, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit status of 127.

       If  the  search  is successful, or if the command name contains one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given,
       and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.

       If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script, a file containing shell commands, and the shell creates a
       new instance of itself to execute it.  Bash tries to determine whether the file is a text file or a binary, and will not execute files it determines to be binaries.   This  subshell  reinitializes
       itself,  so  that  the  effect  is  as  if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see hash below under SHELL
       BUILTIN COMMANDS are retained by the child.

       If the program is a file beginning with #!, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not
       handle this executable format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed  by  the
       name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if any.

COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
       The shell has an execution environment, which consists of the following:

       •      Open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by redirections supplied to the exec builtin.

       •      The current working directory as set by cd, pushd, or popd, or inherited by the shell at invocation.

       •      The file creation mode mask as set by umask or inherited from the shell's parent.

       •      Current traps set by trap.

       •      Shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with set or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment.

       •      Shell functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment.

       •      Options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line arguments) or by set.

       •      Options enabled by shopt.

       •      Shell aliases defined with alias.

       •      Various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of $$, and the value of PPID.

       When  a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists of the following.  Unless otherwise noted, the val‐
       ues are inherited from the shell.

       •      The shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by redirections to the command.

       •      The current working directory.

       •      The file creation mode mask.

       •      Shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables exported for the command, passed in the environment.

       •      Traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored.

       A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.

       A subshell is a copy of the shell process.

       Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps  caught  by
       the shell are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent at invocation.  Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline, except possibly in the last element depending on
       the value of the lastpipe shell option, are also executed in a subshell environment.  Changes made to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.

       When  the  shell is in posix mode, subshells spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of the -e option from their parent shell.  When not in posix mode, bash clears the -e option
       in such subshells.  See the description of the inherit_errexit shell option below for how to control this behavior when not in posix mode.

       If a command is followed by a & and job control is not active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file /dev/null.  Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file descriptors
       of the calling shell as modified by redirections.

ENVIRONMENT
       When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the environment.  This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.

       The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment.  On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking it for  export
       to child processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment.  The export, declare -x, and unset commands modify the environment by adding and deleting parameters and functions.  If the value of
       a  parameter  in  the  environment  is  modified, the new value automatically becomes part of the environment, replacing the old.  The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the
       shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the unset or export -n commands, plus any additions via the export and declare -x commands.

       If any parameter assignments, as described above in PARAMETERS, appear before a simple command, the variable assignments are part of that command's environment for as long as it  executes.   These
       assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command.  If these assignments precede a call to a shell function, the variables are local to the function and exported to that func‐
       tion's children.

       If the -k option is set (see the set builtin command below), then all parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.

       When bash invokes an external command, the variable _ is set to the full pathname of the command and passed to that command in its environment.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the waitpid system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may use
       values  above  125  specially.   Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited to this range.  Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate
       specific failure modes.

       For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded.  So while an exit status of zero indicates success, a non-zero exit status indicates failure.

       When a command terminates on a fatal signal N, bash uses the value of 128+N as the exit status.

       If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.

       If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.

       Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (true) if successful, and non-zero (false) if an error occurs while they execute.  All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect  usage,
       generally invalid options or missing arguments.

       The exit status of the last command is available in the special parameter $?.

       Bash itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.  See also the exit builtin command below.

SIGNALS
       When  bash  is  interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores SIGTERM (so that kill 0 does not kill an interactive shell), and catches and handles SIGINT (so that the wait builtin is inter‐
       ruptible).  When bash receives SIGINT, it breaks out of any executing loops.  In all cases, bash ignores SIGQUIT.  If job control is in effect, bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.

       The trap builtin modifies the shell's signal handling, as described below.

       Non-builtin commands bash executes have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent, unless trap sets them to be ignored, in which case the child process  will  ignore
       them  as well.  When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT in addition to these inherited handlers.  Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore
       the keyboard-generated job control signals SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.

       The shell exits by default upon receipt of a SIGHUP.  Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the SIGHUP to all jobs, running or stopped.  The shell sends SIGCONT to stopped  jobs  to  ensure
       that they receive the SIGHUP (see JOB CONTROL below for more information about running and stopped jobs).  To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, remove it from the jobs
       table with the disown builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) or mark it not to receive SIGHUP using disown -h.

       If the huponexit shell option has been set using shopt, bash sends a SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

       If  bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, it will not execute the trap until the command completes.  If bash is waiting for an asynchronous
       command via the wait builtin, and it receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the wait builtin will return immediately with an exit status greater than 128,  immediately  after  which  the
       shell executes the trap.

       When  job  control  is not enabled, and bash is waiting for a foreground command to complete, the shell receives keyboard-generated signals such as SIGINT (usually generated by ^C) that users com‐
       monly intend to send to that command.  This happens because the shell and the command are in the same process group as the terminal, and ^C sends SIGINT to all processes  in  that  process  group.
       Since bash does not enable job control by default when the shell is not interactive, this scenario is most common in non-interactive shells.

       When  job  control  is  enabled, and bash is waiting for a foreground command to complete, the shell does not receive keyboard-generated signals, because it is not in the same process group as the
       terminal.  This scenario is most common in interactive shells, where bash attempts to enable job control by default.  See JOB CONTROL below for more information about process groups.

       When job control is not enabled, and bash receives SIGINT while waiting for a foreground command, it waits until that foreground command terminates and then decides what to do about the SIGINT:

       1.     If the command terminates due to the SIGINT, bash concludes that the user meant to send the SIGINT to the shell as well, and acts on the SIGINT (e.g., by running a SIGINT  trap,  exiting  a
              non-interactive shell, or returning to the top level to read a new command).

       2.     If  the  command does not terminate due to SIGINT, the program handled the SIGINT itself and did not treat it as a fatal signal.  In that case, bash does not treat SIGINT as a fatal signal,
              either, instead assuming that the SIGINT was used as part of the program's normal operation (e.g., emacs uses it to abort editing commands) or deliberately discarded.   However,  bash  will
              run any trap set on SIGINT, as it does with any other trapped signal it receives while it is waiting for the foreground command to complete, for compatibility.

       When  job control is enabled, bash does not receive keyboard-generated signals such as SIGINT while it is waiting for a foreground command.  An interactive shell does not pay attention to the SIG‐
       INT, even if the foreground command terminates as a result, other than noting its exit status.  If the shell is not interactive, and the foreground command terminates due to the SIGINT, bash  pre‐
       tends it received the SIGINT itself (scenario 1 above), for compatibility.

JOB CONTROL
       Job  control  refers  to the ability to selectively stop (suspend) the execution of processes and continue (resume) their execution at a later point.  A user typically employs this facility via an
       interactive interface supplied jointly by the operating system kernel's terminal driver and bash.

       The shell associates a job with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of currently executing jobs, which the jobs command will display.  Each job has a job number, which jobs displays between brackets.
       Job numbers start at 1.  When bash starts a job asynchronously (in the background), it prints a line that looks like:

              [1] 25647

       indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.  All of the processes in a single pipeline  are  members  of
       the same job.  Bash uses the job abstraction as the basis for job control.

       To  facilitate  the  implementation of the user interface to job control, each process has a process group ID, and the operating system maintains the notion of a current terminal process group ID.
       This terminal process group ID is associated with the controlling terminal.

       Processes that have the same process group ID are said to be part of the same process group.  Members of the foreground process group (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current ter‐
       minal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as SIGINT.  Processes in the foreground process group are said to be foreground processes.  Background  processes  are  those  whose
       process  group ID differs from the controlling terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals.  Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so specifies
       with “stty tostop”, write to the controlling terminal.  The system sends a SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU) signal to background processes which attempt to read from (write to when “tostop”  is  in  effect)  the
       terminal, which, unless caught, suspends the process.

       If  the operating system on which bash is running supports job control, bash contains facilities to use it.  Typing the suspend character (typically ^Z, Control-Z) while a process is running stops
       that process and returns control to bash.  Typing the delayed suspend character (typically ^Y, Control-Y) causes the process stop when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and returns con‐
       trol to bash.  The user then manipulates the state of this job, using the bg command to continue it in the background, the fg command to continue it in the foreground, or the kill command to  kill
       it.   The  suspend  character takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of discarding any pending output and typeahead.  To force a background process to stop, or stop a process
       that's not associated with the current terminal session, send it the SIGSTOP signal using kill.

       There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The % character introduces a job specification (jobspec).

       Job number n may be referred to as %n.  A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line.  For example,  %ce  refers
       to  a  job whose command name begins with ce.  Using %?ce, on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string ce in its command line.  If the prefix or substring matches more than one job,
       bash reports an error.

       The symbols %% and %+ refer to the shell's notion of the current job.  A single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job.  %- refers to the previous job.   When  a
       job  starts  in  the background, a job stops while in the foreground, or a job is resumed in the background, it becomes the current job.  The job that was the current job becomes the previous job.
       When the current job terminates, the previous job becomes the current job.  If there is only a single job, %+ and %- can both be used to refer to that job.  In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the
       output of the jobs command), the current job is always marked with a +, and the previous job with a -.

       Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: %1 is a synonym for “fg %1”, bringing job 1 from the background into the foreground.  Similarly, “%1 &” resumes job 1 in the  back‐
       ground, equivalent to “bg %1”.

       The  shell  learns immediately whenever a job changes state.  Normally, bash waits until it is about to print a prompt before notifying the user about changes in a job's status so as to not inter‐
       rupt any other output, though it will notify of changes in a job's status after a foreground command in a list completes, before executing the next command in the list.  If the -b  option  to  the
       set builtin command is enabled, bash reports status changes immediately.  Bash executes any trap on SIGCHLD for each child that terminates.

       When  a  job terminates and bash notifies the user about it, bash removes the job from the table.  It will not appear in jobs output, but wait will report its exit status, as long as it's supplied
       the process ID associated with the job as an argument.  When the table is empty, job numbers start over at 1.

       If a user attempts to exit bash while jobs are stopped (or, if the checkjobs shell option has been enabled using the shopt builtin, running), the shell prints a warning message, and, if the check‐
       jobs option is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses.  The jobs command may then be used to inspect their status.  If the user immediately attempts to exit again, without an intervening  com‐
       mand, bash does not print another warning, and terminates any stopped jobs.

       When  the shell is waiting for a job or process using the wait builtin, and job control is enabled, wait will return when the job changes state.  The -f option causes wait to wait until the job or
       process terminates before returning.

PROMPTING
       When executing interactively, bash displays the primary prompt PS1 when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt PS2 when it needs more input to complete a command.

       Bash examines the value of the array variable PROMPT_COMMAND just before printing each primary prompt.  If any elements in PROMPT_COMMAND are set and non-null, Bash executes each value, in numeric
       order, just as if it had been typed on the command line.  Bash displays PS0 after it reads a command but before executing it.

       Bash displays PS4 as described above before tracing each command when the -x option is enabled.

       Bash allows the prompt strings PS0, PS1, PS2, and PS4, to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows:

              \a     An ASCII bell character (07).
              \d     The date in “Weekday Month Date” format (e.g., “Tue May 26”).
              \D{format}
                     The format is passed to strftime(3) and the result is inserted into the prompt string; an empty format results in a locale-specific time representation.  The braces are required.
              \e     An ASCII escape character (033).
              \h     The hostname up to the first “.”.
              \H     The hostname.
              \j     The number of jobs currently managed by the shell.
              \l     The basename of the shell's terminal device name (e.g., “ttys0”).
              \n     A newline.
              \r     A carriage return.
              \s     The name of the shell: the basename of $0 (the portion following the final slash).
              \t     The current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format.
              \T     The current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format.
              \@     The current time in 12-hour am/pm format.
              \A     The current time in 24-hour HH:MM format.
              \u     The username of the current user.
              \v     The bash version (e.g., 2.00).
              \V     The bash release, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
              \w     The value of the PWD shell variable ($PWD), with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde (uses the value of the PROMPT_DIRTRIM variable).
              \W     The basename of $PWD, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde.
              \!     The history number of this command.
              \#     The command number of this command.
              \$     If the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $.
              \nnn   The character corresponding to the octal number nnn.
              \\     A backslash.
              \[     Begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt.
              \]     End a sequence of non-printing characters.

       The command number and the history number are usually different: the history number of a command is its position in the history list, which may include commands restored from the history file (see
       HISTORY below), while the command number is the position in the sequence of commands executed during the current shell session.  After the string is decoded, it is expanded  via  parameter  expan‐
       sion,  command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the promptvars shell option (see the description of the shopt command under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS be‐
       low).  This can have unwanted side effects if escaped portions of the string appear within command substitution or contain characters special to word expansion.

READLINE
       This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive shell, unless the --noediting option is supplied at shell invocation.  Line editing is also used when using the  -e  option
       to  the  read builtin.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of emacs; a vi-style line editing interface is also available.  Line editing can be enabled at any time using the
       -o emacs or -o vi options to the set builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  To turn off line editing after the shell is running, use the +o emacs or +o vi options to the set builtin.

   Readline Notation
       This section uses Emacs-style editing concepts and uses its notation for keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C-key, e.g., C-n means Control-N.  Similarly, meta keys are denoted by  M-key,  so
       M-x means Meta-X.  The Meta key is often labeled “Alt” or “Option”.

       On  keyboards  without  a  Meta key, M-x means ESC x, i.e., press and release the Escape key, then press and release the x key, in sequence.  This makes ESC the meta prefix.  The combination M-C-x
       means ESC Control-x: press and release the Escape key, then press and hold the Control key while pressing the x key, then release both.

       On some keyboards, the Meta key modifier produces characters with the eighth bit (0200) set.  You can use the enable-meta-key variable to control whether or not it does this, if the  keyboard  al‐
       lows it.  On many others, the terminal or terminal emulator converts the metafied key to a key sequence beginning with ESC as described in the preceding paragraph.

       If  your Meta key produces a key sequence with the ESC meta prefix, you can make M-key key bindings you specify (see Readline Key Bindings below) do the same thing by setting the force-meta-prefix
       variable.

       Readline commands may be given numeric arguments, which normally act as a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that is significant.  Passing a negative argument  to  a
       command that acts in the forward direction (e.g., kill-line) makes that command act in a backward direction.  Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted below.

       The  point is the current cursor position, and mark refers to a saved cursor position.  The text between the point and mark is referred to as the region.  Readline has the concept of an active re‐
       gion: when the region is active, readline redisplay highlights the region using the value of the active-region-start-color variable.  The enable-active-region variable turns this on and off.  Sev‐
       eral commands set the region to active; those are noted below.

       When a command is described as killing text, the text deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (yanking).  The killed text is saved in a kill ring.  Consecutive kills accumulate the  deleted
       text into one unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.

   Readline Initialization
       Readline  is  customized by putting commands in an initialization file (the inputrc file).  The name of this file is taken from the value of the INPUTRC shell variable.  If that variable is unset,
       the default is ~/.inputrc.  If that file  does not exist or cannot be read, readline looks for /etc/inputrc.  When a program that uses the readline library starts up, readline reads  the  initial‐
       ization file and sets the key bindings and variables found there, before reading any user input.

       There  are  only  a  few  basic constructs allowed in the inputrc file.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with a # are comments.  Lines beginning with a $ indicate conditional constructs.
       Other lines denote key bindings and variable settings.

       The default key-bindings in this section may be changed using key binding commands in the inputrc file.  Programs that use the readline library, including bash, may  add  their  own  commands  and
       bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument

       into the inputrc would make M-C-u execute the readline command universal-argument.

       Key bindings may contain the following symbolic character names: DEL, ESC, ESCAPE, LFD, NEWLINE, RET, RETURN, RUBOUT (a destructive backspace), SPACE, SPC, and TAB.

       In  addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a macro).  The difference between a macro and a command is that a macro is en‐
       closed in single or double quotes.

   Readline Key Bindings
       The syntax for controlling key bindings in the inputrc file is simple.  All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound.   The
       key  sequence  may  be  specified  in  one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with Meta- or Control- prefixes, or as a key sequence composed of one or more characters enclosed in double
       quotes.  The key sequence and name are separated by a colon.  There can be no whitespace between the name and the colon.

       When using the form keyname:function-name or macro, keyname is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "> output"

       In the above example, C-u is bound to the function universal-argument, M-DEL is bound to the function backward-kill-word, and C-o is bound to run the macro expressed on the right hand  side  (that
       is, to insert the text “> output” into the line).

       In  the  second  form,  "keyseq":function-name  or  macro,  keyseq differs from keyname above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the sequence within double
       quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but none of the symbolic character names are recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In this example, C-u is again bound to the function universal-argument.  C-x C-r is bound to the function re-read-init-file, and ESC [ 1 1 ~ is bound to insert the text “Function Key 1”.

       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences available when specifying key sequences is
              \C-    A control prefix.
              \M-    Adding the meta prefix or converting the following character to a meta character, as described below under force-meta-prefix.
              \e     An escape character.
              \\     Backslash.
              \"     Literal ", a double quote.
              \'     Literal ', a single quote.

       In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of backslash escapes is available:
              \a     alert (bell)
              \b     backspace
              \d     delete
              \f     form feed
              \n     newline
              \r     carriage return
              \t     horizontal tab
              \v     vertical tab
              \nnn   The eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three digits).
              \xHH   The eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits).

       When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name.  The backslash escapes described above  are
       expanded in the macro body.  Backslash quotes any other character in the macro text, including " and '.

       Bash will display or modify the current readline key bindings with the bind builtin command.  The -o emacs or -o vi options to the set builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) change the editing
       mode during interactive use.

   Readline Variables
       Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.  A variable may be set in the inputrc file with a statement of the form

              set variable-name value
       or using the bind builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       Except  where  noted, readline variables can take the values On or Off (without regard to case).  Unrecognized variable names are ignored.  When readline reads a variable value, empty or null val‐
       ues, “on” (case-insensitive), and “1” are equivalent to On.  All other values are equivalent to Off.

       The bind -V command lists the current readline variable names and values (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       The variables and their default values are:

       active-region-start-color
              A string variable that controls the text color and background when displaying the text in the active region (see the description of enable-active-region below).  This string must  not  take
              up  any  physical  character positions on the display, so it should consist only of terminal escape sequences.  It is output to the terminal before displaying the text in the active region.
              This variable is reset to the default value whenever the terminal type changes.  The default value is the string that puts the terminal in standout mode, as  obtained  from  the  terminal's
              terminfo description.  A sample value might be “\e[01;33m”.
       active-region-end-color
              A  string variable that “undoes” the effects of active-region-start-color and restores “normal” terminal display appearance after displaying text in the active region.  This string must not
              take up any physical character positions on the display, so it should consist only of terminal escape sequences.  It is output to the terminal after displaying the text in  the  active  re‐
              gion.   This  variable is reset to the default value whenever the terminal type changes.  The default value is the string that restores the terminal from standout mode, as obtained from the
              terminal's terminfo description.  A sample value might be “\e[0m”.
       bell-style (audible)
              Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell.  If set to none, readline never rings the bell.  If set to visible, readline uses a visible bell if  one  is  available.
              If set to audible, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
       bind-tty-special-chars (On)
              If set to On, readline attempts to bind the control characters that are treated specially by the kernel's terminal driver to their readline equivalents.  These override the default readline
              bindings described here.  Type “stty -a” at a bash prompt to see your current terminal settings, including the special control characters (usually cchars).
       blink-matching-paren (Off)
              If set to On, readline attempts to briefly move the cursor to an opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted.
       colored-completion-prefix (Off)
              If  set  to  On, when listing completions, readline displays the common prefix of the set of possible completions using a different color.  The color definitions are taken from the value of
              the LS_COLORS environment variable.  If there is a color definition in $LS_COLORS for the custom suffix “.readline-colored-completion-prefix”, readline uses this color for the common prefix
              instead of its default.
       colored-stats (Off)
              If set to On, readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type.  The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS  environment  vari‐
              able.
       comment-begin (“#”)
              The string that the readline insert-comment command inserts.  This command is bound to M-# in emacs mode and to # in vi command mode.
       completion-display-width (-1)
              The number of screen columns used to display possible matches when performing completion.  The value is ignored if it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width.  A value of 0
              causes matches to be displayed one per line.  The default value is -1.
       completion-ignore-case (Off)
              If set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion.
       completion-map-case (Off)
              If set to On, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, readline treats hyphens (-) and underscores (_) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
       completion-prefix-display-length (0)
              The  maximum  length  in  characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed without modification.  When set to a value greater than zero, readline replaces
              common prefixes longer than this value with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.  If a completion begins with a period, and eadline is completing filenames, it uses  three  un‐
              derscores instead of an ellipsis.
       completion-query-items (100)
              This  determines when the user is queried about viewing the number of possible completions generated by the possible-completions command.  It may be set to any integer value greater than or
              equal to zero.  If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to the value of this variable, readline asks whether or not the user wishes to view them;  otherwise  readline
              simply lists them on the terminal.  A zero value means readline should never ask; negative values are treated as zero.
       convert-meta (On)
              If  set  to  On, readline converts characters it reads that have the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by clearing the eighth bit and prefixing it with an escape character (converting
              the character to have the meta prefix).  The default is On, but readline sets it to Off if the locale contains characters whose encodings may include bytes with the eighth  bit  set.   This
              variable is dependent on the LC_CTYPE locale category, and may change if the locale changes.  This variable also affects key bindings; see the description of force-meta-prefix below.
       disable-completion (Off)
              If set to On, readline inhibits word completion.  Completion characters are inserted into the line as if they had been mapped to self-insert.
       echo-control-characters (On)
              When set to On, on operating systems that indicate they support it, readline echoes a character corresponding to a signal generated from the keyboard.
       editing-mode (emacs)
              Controls whether readline uses a set of key bindings similar to Emacs or vi.  editing-mode can be set to either emacs or vi.
       emacs-mode-string (@)
              If  the  show-mode-in-prompt  variable  is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when emacs editing mode is active.  The value is expanded
              like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control- prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  The \1 and \2 escapes begin and end sequences  of  non-printing  charac‐
              ters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
       enable-active-region (On)
              When  this  variable is set to On, readline allows certain commands to designate the region as active.  When the region is active, readline highlights the text in the region using the value
              of the active-region-start-color variable, which defaults to the string that enables the terminal's standout mode.  The active region shows the text  inserted  by  bracketed-paste  and  any
              matching text found by incremental and non-incremental history searches.
       enable-bracketed-paste (On)
              When  set  to  On,  readline configures the terminal to insert each paste into the editing buffer as a single string of characters, instead of treating each character as if it had been read
              from the keyboard.  This is called bracketed-paste mode; it prevents readline from executing any editing commands bound to key sequences appearing in the pasted text.
       enable-keypad (Off)
              When set to On, readline tries  to enable the application keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys.
       enable-meta-key (On)
              When set to On, readline tries to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support.  On many terminals, the Meta key is used to send eight-bit characters;  this  variable  checks
              for the terminal capability that indicates the terminal can enable and disable a mode that sets the eighth bit of a character (0200) if the Meta key is held down when the character is typed
              (a meta character).
       expand-tilde (Off)
              If set to On, readline performs tilde expansion when it attempts word completion.
       force-meta-prefix (Off)
              If  set to On, readline modifies its behavior when binding key sequences containing \M- or Meta- (see Key Bindings above) by converting a key sequence of the form \M-C or Meta-C to the two-
              character sequence ESC C (adding the meta prefix).  If force-meta-prefix is set to Off (the default), readline uses the value of the convert-meta variable to determine  whether  to  perform
              this conversion: if convert-meta is On, readline performs the conversion described above; if it is Off, readline converts C to a meta character by setting the eighth bit (0200).
       history-preserve-point (Off)
              If set to On, the history code attempts to place point at the same location on each history line retrieved with previous-history or next-history.
       history-size (unset)
              Set  the  maximum  number  of history entries saved in the history list.  If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted and no new entries are saved.  If set to a value less than
              zero, the number of history entries is not limited.  By default, bash sets the maximum number of history entries to the value of the HISTSIZE shell variable.  Setting history-size to a non-
              numeric value will set the maximum number of history entries to 500.
       horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)
              Setting this variable to On makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width  rather  than
              wrapping to a new line.  This setting is automatically enabled for terminals of height 1.
       input-meta (Off)
              If set to On, readline enables eight-bit input (that is, it does not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The default is
              Off, but readline sets it to On if the locale contains characters whose encodings may include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This variable is dependent on the LC_CTYPE locale category, and
              its value may change if the locale changes.  The name meta-flag is a synonym for input-meta.
       isearch-terminators (“C-[C-j”)
              The  string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without subsequently executing the character as a command.  If this variable has not been given a value, the characters
              ESC and C-j terminate an incremental search.
       keymap (emacs)
              Set the current readline keymap.  The set of valid keymap names is emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-command, and vi-insert.  vi is equivalent to  vi-command;  emacs  is
              equivalent to emacs-standard.  The default value is emacs; the value of editing-mode also affects the default keymap.
       keyseq-timeout (500)
              Specifies  the  duration  readline will wait for a character when reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete key sequence using the input read so far, or can take addi‐
              tional input to complete a longer key sequence).  If readline does not receive any input within the timeout, it uses the shorter but complete key sequence.  The value is specified  in  mil‐
              liseconds, so a value of 1000 means that readline will wait one second for additional input.  If this variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value, read‐
              line waits until another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete.
       mark-directories (On)
              If set to On, completed directory names have a slash appended.
       mark-modified-lines (Off)
              If set to On, readline displays history lines that have been modified with a preceding asterisk (*).
       mark-symlinked-directories (Off)
              If set to On, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended, subject to the value of mark-directories.
       match-hidden-files (On)
              This  variable,  when  set  to On, forces readline to match files whose names begin with a “.”  (hidden files) when performing filename completion.  If set to Off, the user must include the
              leading “.”  in the filename to be completed.
       menu-complete-display-prefix (Off)
              If set to On, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through the list.
       output-meta (Off)
              If set to On, readline displays characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.  The default is Off, but readline sets it to  On  if  the  locale
              contains characters whose encodings may include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This variable is dependent on the LC_CTYPE locale category, and its value may change if the locale changes.
       page-completions (On)
              If set to On, readline uses an internal pager resembling more(1) to display a screenful of possible completions at a time.
       prefer-visible-bell
              See bell-style.
       print-completions-horizontally (Off)
              If set to On, readline displays completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.
       revert-all-at-newline (Off)
              If set to On, readline will undo all changes to history lines before returning when executing accept-line.  By default, history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across
              calls to readline.
       search-ignore-case (Off)
              If set to On, readline performs incremental and non-incremental history list searches in a case-insensitive fashion.
       show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)
              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If set to On, words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing
              the bell.
       show-all-if-unmodified (Off)
              This  alters  the  default  behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to show-all-if-ambiguous.  If set to On, words which have more than one possible completion without any
              possible partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
       show-mode-in-prompt (Off)
              If set to On, add a string to the beginning of the prompt indicating the editing mode: emacs, vi command, or vi insertion.  The mode strings are user-settable (e.g., emacs-mode-string).
       skip-completed-text (Off)
              If set to On, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line.  It's only active when performing completion in the middle of  a  word.   If  enabled,
              readline does not insert characters from the completion that match characters after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.
       vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))
              If  the  show-mode-in-prompt  variable  is  enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in command mode.  The
              value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control- prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  The \1 and \2 escapes begin and end sequences of  non-
              printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
       vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))
              If  the  show-mode-in-prompt  variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in insertion mode.  The
              value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control- prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  The \1 and \2 escapes begin and end sequences of  non-
              printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
       visible-stats (Off)
              If set to On, a character denoting a file's type as reported by stat(2) is appended to the filename when listing possible completions.

   Readline Conditional Constructs
       Readline  implements  a  facility  similar  in spirit to the conditional compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result of
       tests.  There are four parser directives available.

       $if    The $if construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using readline.  The text of the test, after any comparison operator, ex‐
              tends to the end of the line; unless otherwise noted, no characters are required to isolate it.

              mode   The mode= form of the $if directive is used to test whether readline is in emacs or vi mode.  This may be used in conjunction with the set keymap command, for instance, to set  bind‐
                     ings in the emacs-standard and emacs-ctlx keymaps only if readline is starting out in emacs mode.

              term   The  term=  form may be used to include terminal-specific key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the =
                     is tested against both the full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal name before the first -.  This allows xterm to match both xterm and xterm-256color, for instance.

              version
                     The version test may be used to perform comparisons against specific readline versions.  The version expands to the current readline version.  The set  of  comparison  operators  in‐
                     cludes  =,  (and  ==),  !=, <=, >=, <, and >.  The version number supplied on the right side of the operator consists of a major version number, an optional decimal point, and an op‐
                     tional minor version (e.g., 7.1).  If the minor version is omitted, it defaults to 0.  The operator may be separated from the string version and from the version number  argument  by
                     whitespace.

              application
                     The  application  construct  is used to include application-specific settings.  Each program using the readline library sets the application name, and an initialization file can test
                     for a particular value.  This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a key sequence that quotes the
                     current or previous word in bash:

                     $if Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     $endif

              variable
                     The variable construct provides simple equality tests for readline variables and values.  The permitted comparison operators are =, ==, and !=.  The variable name must  be  separated
                     from  the  comparison operator by whitespace; the operator may be separated from the value on the right hand side by whitespace.  String and boolean variables may be tested.  Boolean
                     variables must be tested against the values on and off.

       $else  Commands in this branch of the $if directive are executed if the test fails.

       $endif This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an $if command.

       $include
              This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands and key bindings from that file.  For example, the following directive would read /etc/inputrc:

              $include  /etc/inputrc

   Searching
       Readline provides commands for searching through the command history (see HISTORY below) for lines containing a specified string.  There are two search modes: incremental and non-incremental.

       Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the search string.  As each character of the search string is typed, readline displays the next entry from the history  matching  the
       string typed so far.  An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find the desired history entry.  When using emacs editing mode, type C-r to search backward in the history
       for a particular string.  Typing C-s searches forward through the history.  The characters present in the value of the isearch-terminators variable are used to terminate an incremental search.  If
       that variable has not been assigned a value, ESC and C-j terminate an incremental search.  C-g aborts an incremental search and restores the original line.  When the search is terminated, the his‐
       tory entry containing the search string becomes the current line.

       To  find  other  matching entries in the history list, type C-r or C-s as appropriate.  This searches backward or forward in the history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far.
       Any other key sequence bound to a readline command terminates the search and executes that command.  For instance, a newline terminates the search and accepts the line, thereby executing the  com‐
       mand from the history list.  A movement command will terminate the search, make the last line found the current line, and begin editing.

       Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two C-rs are typed without any intervening characters defining a new search string, readline uses any remembered search string.

       Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting to search for matching history entries.  The search string may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current
       line.

   Readline Command Names
       The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default key sequences to which they are bound.  Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default.

       In  the following descriptions, point refers to the current cursor position, and mark refers to a cursor position saved by the set-mark command.  The text between the point and mark is referred to
       as the region.  Readline has the concept of an active region: when the region is active, readline redisplay highlights the region using the value of the  active-region-start-color  variable.   The
       enable-active-region readline variable turns this on and off.  Several commands set the region to active; those are noted below.

   Commands for Moving
       beginning-of-line (C-a)
              Move to the start of the current line.  This may also be bound to the Home key on some keyboards.
       end-of-line (C-e)
              Move to the end of the line.  This may also be bound to the End key on some keyboards.
       forward-char (C-f)
              Move forward a character.  This may also be bound to the right arrow key on some keyboards.
       backward-char (C-b)
              Move back a character.  This may also be bound to the left arrow key on some keyboards.
       forward-word (M-f)
              Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).
       backward-word (M-b)
              Move back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).
       shell-forward-word (M-C-f)
              Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are delimited by non-quoted shell metacharacters.
       shell-backward-word (M-C-b)
              Move back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are delimited by non-quoted shell metacharacters.
       previous-screen-line
              Attempt to move point to the same physical screen column on the previous physical screen line.  This will not have the desired effect if the current readline line does not take up more than
              one physical line or if point is not greater than the length of the prompt plus the screen width.
       next-screen-line
              Attempt to move point to the same physical screen column on the next physical screen line.  This will not have the desired effect if the current readline line does not take up more than one
              physical line or if the length of the current readline line is not greater than the length of the prompt plus the screen width.
       clear-display (M-C-l)
              Clear the screen and, if possible, the terminal's scrollback buffer, then redraw the current line, leaving the current line at the top of the screen.
       clear-screen (C-l)
              Clear the screen, then redraw the current line, leaving the current line at the top of the screen.  With a numeric argument, refresh the current line without clearing the screen.
       redraw-current-line
              Refresh the current line.

   Commands for Manipulating the History
       accept-line (Newline, Return)
              Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is non-empty, add it to the history list according to the state of the HISTCONTROL and HISTIGNORE variables.  If the line is
              a modified history line, restore the history line to its original state.
       previous-history (C-p)
              Fetch the previous command from the history list, moving back in the list.  This may also be bound to the up arrow key on some keyboards.
       next-history (C-n)
              Fetch the next command from the history list, moving forward in the list.  This may also be bound to the down arrow key on some keyboards.
       beginning-of-history (M-<)
              Move to the first line in the history.
       end-of-history (M->)
              Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently being entered.
       operate-and-get-next (C-o)
              Accept  the current line for execution as if a newline had been entered, and fetch the next line relative to the current line from the history for editing.  A numeric argument, if supplied,
              specifies the history entry to use instead of the current line.
       fetch-history
              With a numeric argument, fetch that entry from the history list and make it the current line.  Without an argument, move back to the first entry in the history list.
       reverse-search-history (C-r)
              Search backward starting at the current line and moving “up” through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.  This command sets the region to the matched  text  and  acti‐
              vates the region.
       forward-search-history (C-s)
              Search  forward  starting at the current line and moving “down” through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.  This command sets the region to the matched text and acti‐
              vates the region.
       non-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p)
              Search backward through the history starting at the current line using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user.  The search string may match anywhere in a history line.
       non-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)
              Search forward through the history using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user.  The search string may match anywhere in a history line.
       history-search-backward
              Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point.  The search string must match at the beginning of a history line.  This
              is a non-incremental search.  This may be bound to the Page Up key on some keyboards.
       history-search-forward
              Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point.  The search string must match at the beginning of a history line.   This
              is a non-incremental search.  This may be bound to the Page Down key on some keyboards.
       history-substring-search-backward
              Search  backward  through  the  history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point.  The search string may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a
              non-incremental search.
       history-substring-search-forward
              Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point.  The search string may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-
              incremental search.
       yank-nth-arg (M-C-y)
              Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument n, insert the nth word from the previous command (the  words  in
              the  previous  command  begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts the nth word from the end of the previous command.  Once the argument n is computed, this uses the history expansion
              facilities to extract the nth word, as if the “!n” history expansion had been specified.
       yank-last-arg (M-., M-_)
              Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last word of the previous  history  entry).   With  a  numeric  argument,  behave  exactly  like  yank-nth-arg.   Successive  calls  to
              yank-last-arg  move  back through the history list, inserting the last word (or the word specified by the argument to the first call) of each line in turn.  Any numeric argument supplied to
              these successive calls determines the direction to move through the history.  A negative argument switches the direction through the history (back or forward).  This uses the history expan‐
              sion facilities to extract the last word, as if the “!$” history expansion had been specified.
       shell-expand-line (M-C-e)
              Expand the line by performing shell word expansions.  This performs alias and history expansion, $'string' and $"string" quoting, tilde expansion, parameter and variable  expansion,  arith‐
              metic  expansion,  command and process substitution, word splitting, and quote removal.  An explicit argument suppresses command and process substitution.  See HISTORY EXPANSION below for a
              description of history expansion.
       history-expand-line (M-^)
              Perform history expansion on the current line.  See HISTORY EXPANSION below for a description of history expansion.
       magic-space
              Perform history expansion on the current line and insert a space.  See HISTORY EXPANSION below for a description of history expansion.
       alias-expand-line
              Perform alias expansion on the current line.  See ALIASES above for a description of alias expansion.
       history-and-alias-expand-line
              Perform history and alias expansion on the current line.
       insert-last-argument (M-., M-_)
              A synonym for yank-last-arg.
       edit-and-execute-command (C-x C-e)
              Invoke an editor on the current command line, and execute the result as shell commands.  Bash attempts to invoke $VISUAL, $EDITOR, and emacs as the editor, in that order.

   Commands for Changing Text
       end-of-file (usually C-d)
              The character indicating end-of-file as set, for example, by stty(1).  If this character is read when there are no characters on the line, and point is at the beginning of the  line,  read‐
              line interprets it as the end of input and returns EOF.
       delete-char (C-d)
              Delete  the  character  at  point.   If  this function is bound to the same character as the tty EOF character, as C-d commonly is, see above for the effects.  This may also be bound to the
              Delete key on some keyboards.
       backward-delete-char (Rubout)
              Delete the character behind the cursor.  When given a numeric argument, save the deleted text on the kill ring.
       forward-backward-delete-char
              Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at the end of the line, in which case the character behind the cursor is deleted.
       quoted-insert (C-q, C-v)
              Add the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how to insert characters like C-q, for example.
       tab-insert (C-v TAB)
              Insert a tab character.
       self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)
              Insert the character typed.
       bracketed-paste-begin
              This function is intended to be bound to the “bracketed paste” escape sequence sent by some terminals, and such a binding is assigned by default.  It allows readline to  insert  the  pasted
              text  as  a single unit without treating each character as if it had been read from the keyboard.  The pasted characters are inserted as if each one was bound to self-insert instead of exe‐
              cuting any editing commands.
              Bracketed paste sets the region to the inserted text and activates the region.
       transpose-chars (C-t)
              Drag the character before point forward over the character at point, moving point forward as well.  If point is at the end of the line, then this transposes the two characters before point.
              Negative arguments have no effect.
       transpose-words (M-t)
              Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point past that word as well.  If point is at the end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
       shell-transpose-words (M-C-t)
              Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point past that word as well.  If the insertion point is at the end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
              Word boundaries are the same as shell-forward-word and shell-backward-word.
       upcase-word (M-u)
              Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       downcase-word (M-l)
              Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       capitalize-word (M-c)
              Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.
       overwrite-mode
              Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric argument, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This  command  af‐
              fects only emacs mode; vi mode does overwrite differently.  Each call to readline() starts in insert mode.
              In  overwrite  mode, characters bound to self-insert replace the text at point rather than pushing the text to the right.  Characters bound to backward-delete-char replace the character be‐
              fore point with a space.  By default, this command is unbound, but may be bound to the Insert key on some keyboards.

   Killing and Yanking
       kill-line (C-k)
              Kill the text from point to the end of the current line.  With a negative numeric argument, kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
       backward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)
              Kill backward to the beginning of the current line.  With a negative numeric argument, kill forward from the cursor to the end of the line.
       unix-line-discard (C-u)
              Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line, saving the killed text on the kill-ring.
       kill-whole-line
              Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point is.
       kill-word (M-d)
              Kill from point to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by forward-word.
       backward-kill-word (M-Rubout)
              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by backward-word.
       shell-kill-word (M-C-d)
              Kill from point to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by shell-forward-word.
       shell-backward-kill-word
              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by shell-backward-word.
       unix-word-rubout (C-w)
              Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary, saving the killed text on the kill-ring.
       unix-filename-rubout
              Kill the word behind point, using white space and the slash character as the word boundaries, saving the killed text on the kill-ring.
       delete-horizontal-space (M-\)
              Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
       kill-region
              Kill the text in the current region.
       copy-region-as-kill
              Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer, so it can be yanked immediately.
       copy-backward-word
              Copy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries are the same as backward-word.
       copy-forward-word
              Copy the word following point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries are the same as forward-word.
       yank (C-y)
              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
       yank-pop (M-y)
              Rotate the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works following yank or yank-pop.

   Numeric Arguments
       digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ..., M--)
              Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.
       universal-argument
              This is another way to specify an argument.  If this command is followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading minus sign, those digits define the argument.  If  the  command  is
              followed  by  digits, executing universal-argument again ends the numeric argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if this command is immediately followed by a character that
              is neither a digit nor minus sign, the argument count for the next command is multiplied by four.  The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the first time  makes  the
              argument count four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.

   Completing
       complete (TAB)
              Attempt  to  perform  completion on the text before point.  Bash attempts completion by first checking for any programmable completions for the command word (see Programmable Completion be‐
              low), otherwise treating the text as a variable (if the text begins with $), username (if the text begins with ~), hostname (if the text begins with @), or command (including aliases, func‐
              tions, and builtins) in turn.  If none of these produces a match, it falls back to filename completion.
       possible-completions (M-?)
              List the possible completions of the text before point.  When displaying completions, readline sets the number of columns used for display to  the  value  of  completion-display-width,  the
              value of the shell variable COLUMNS, or the screen width, in that order.
       insert-completions (M-*)
              Insert all completions of the text before point that would have been generated by possible-completions, separated by a space.
       menu-complete
              Similar  to complete, but replaces the word to be completed with a single match from the list of possible completions.  Repeatedly executing menu-complete steps through the list of possible
              completions, inserting each match in turn.  At the end of the list of completions, menu-complete rings the bell (subject to the setting of bell-style) and restores the  original  text.   An
              argument of n moves n positions forward in the list of matches; a negative argument moves backward through the list.  This command is intended to be bound to TAB, but is unbound by default.
       menu-complete-backward
              Identical to menu-complete, but moves backward through the list of possible completions, as if menu-complete had been given a negative argument.  This command is unbound by default.
       export-completions
              Perform completion on the word before point as described above and write the list of possible completions to readline's output stream using the following format, writing information on sep‐
              arate lines:

              •      the number of matches N;
              •      the word being completed;
              •      S:E, where S and E are the start and end offsets of the word in the readline line buffer; then
              •      each match, one per line

              If there are no matches, the first line will be “0”, and this command does not print any output after the S:E.  If there is only a single match, this prints a single line containing it.  If
              there  is more than one match, this prints the common prefix of the matches, which may be empty, on the first line after the S:E, then the matches on subsequent lines.  In this case, N will
              include the first line with the common prefix.

              The user or application should be able to accommodate the possibility of a blank line.  The intent is that the user or application reads N lines after the line containing S:E to obtain  the
              match list.  This command is unbound by default.

       delete-char-or-list
              Deletes  the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or end of the line (like delete-char).  At the end of the line, it behaves identically to possible-completions.  This command
              is unbound by default.

       complete-filename (M-/)
              Attempt filename completion on the text before point.

       possible-filename-completions (C-x /)
              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a filename.

       complete-username (M-~)
              Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a username.

       possible-username-completions (C-x ~)
              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a username.

       complete-variable (M-$)
              Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a shell variable.

       possible-variable-completions (C-x $)
              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a shell variable.

       complete-hostname (M-@)
              Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a hostname.

       possible-hostname-completions (C-x @)
              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a hostname.

       complete-command (M-!)
              Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a command name.  Command completion attempts to match the text against aliases, reserved words, shell functions, shell  builtins,
              and finally executable filenames, in that order.

       possible-command-completions (C-x !)
              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a command name.

       dynamic-complete-history (M-TAB)
              Attempt completion on the text before point, comparing the text against history list entries for possible completion matches.

       dabbrev-expand
              Attempt menu completion on the text before point, comparing the text against lines from the history list for possible completion matches.

       complete-into-braces (M-{)
              Perform filename completion and insert the list of possible completions enclosed within braces so the list is available to the shell (see Brace Expansion above).

   Keyboard Macros
       start-kbd-macro (C-x ()
              Begin saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro.
       end-kbd-macro (C-x ))
              Stop saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro and store the definition.
       call-last-kbd-macro (C-x e)
              Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined, by making the characters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard.
       print-last-kbd-macro ()
              Print the last keyboard macro defined in a format suitable for the inputrc file.

   Miscellaneous
       re-read-init-file (C-x C-r)
              Read in the contents of the inputrc file, and incorporate any bindings or variable assignments found there.
       abort (C-g)
              Abort the current editing command and ring the terminal's bell (subject to the setting of bell-style).
       do-lowercase-version (M-A, M-B, M-x, ...)
              If the metafied character x is uppercase, run the command that is bound to the corresponding metafied lowercase character.  The behavior is undefined if x is already lowercase.
       prefix-meta (ESC)
              Metafy the next character typed.  ESC f is equivalent to Meta-f.
       undo (C-_, C-x C-u)
              Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.
       revert-line (M-r)
              Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like executing the undo command enough times to return the line to its initial state.
       tilde-expand (M-&)
              Perform tilde expansion on the current word.
       set-mark (C-@, M-<space>)
              Set the mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied, set the mark to that position.
       exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)
              Swap the point with the mark.  Set the current cursor position to the saved position, then set the mark to the old cursor position.
       character-search (C-])
              Read a character and move point to the next occurrence of that character.  A negative argument searches for previous occurrences.
       character-search-backward (M-C-])
              Read a character and move point to the previous occurrence of that character.  A negative argument searches for subsequent occurrences.
       skip-csi-sequence
              Read  enough  characters  to  consume a multi-key sequence such as those defined for keys like Home and End.  CSI sequences begin with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC [.  If
              this sequence is bound to “\e[”, keys producing CSI sequences have no effect unless explicitly bound to a readline command, instead of inserting stray characters into  the  editing  buffer.
              This is unbound by default, but usually bound to ESC [.
       insert-comment (M-#)
              Without  a numeric argument, insert the value of the readline comment-begin variable at the beginning of the current line.  If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle:
              if the characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value of comment-begin, insert the value; otherwise delete the characters in comment-begin from the beginning  of  the  line.
              In either case, the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed.  The default value of comment-begin causes this command to make the current line a shell comment.  If a numeric argument
              causes the comment character to be removed, the line will be executed by the shell.
       spell-correct-word (C-x s)
              Perform  spelling  correction  on  the  current  word,  treating  it  as a directory or filename, in the same way as the cdspell shell option.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by
              shell-forward-word.
       glob-complete-word (M-g)
              Treat the word before point as a pattern for pathname expansion, with an asterisk implicitly appended, then use the pattern to generate a list of matching file names  for  possible  comple‐
              tions.
       glob-expand-word (C-x *)
              Treat  the word before point as a pattern for pathname expansion, and insert the list of matching file names, replacing the word.  If a numeric argument is supplied, append a * before path‐
              name expansion.
       glob-list-expansions (C-x g)
              Display the list of expansions that would have been generated by glob-expand-word and redisplay the line.  If a numeric argument is supplied, append a * before pathname expansion.
       dump-functions
              Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an in‐
              putrc file.
       dump-variables
              Print all of the settable readline variables and their values to the readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it  can  be  made
              part of an inputrc file.
       dump-macros
              Print  all of the readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output to the readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way
              that it can be made part of an inputrc file.
       execute-named-command (M-x)
              Read a bindable readline command name from the input and execute the function to which it's bound, as if the key sequence to which it was bound appeared in the input.  If this  function  is
              supplied with a numeric argument, it passes that argument to the function it executes.
       display-shell-version (C-x C-v)
              Display version information about the current instance of bash.

   Programmable Completion
       When a user attempts word completion for a command or an argument to a command for which a completion specification (a compspec) has been defined using the complete builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COM‐
       MANDS below), readline invokes the programmable completion facilities.

       First,  bash  identifies the command name.  If a compspec has been defined for that command, the compspec is used to generate the list of possible completions for the word.  If the command word is
       the empty string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), bash uses any compspec defined with the -E option to complete.  The -I option to complete indicates that the command word
       is the first non-assignment word on the line, or after a command delimiter such as ; or |.  This usually indicates command name completion.

       If the command word is a full pathname, bash searches for a compspec for the full pathname first.  If there is no compspec for the full pathname, bash attempts to find a compspec for  the  portion
       following the final slash.  If those searches do not result in a compspec, or if there is no compspec for the command word, bash uses any compspec defined with the -D option to complete as the de‐
       fault.  If there is no default compspec, bash performs alias expansion on the command word as a final resort, and attempts to find a compspec for the command word resulting from any successful ex‐
       pansion.

       If  a  compspec  is  not  found, bash performs its default completion as described above under Completing.  Otherwise, once a compspec has been found, bash uses it to generate the list of matching
       words.

       First, bash performs the actions specified by the compspec.  This only returns matches which are prefixes of the word being completed.  When the -f or -d option is used for filename  or  directory
       name completion, bash uses the shell variable FIGNORE to filter the matches.

       Next,  programmable completion generates matches specified by a pathname expansion pattern supplied as an argument to the -G option.  The words generated by the pattern need not match the word be‐
       ing completed.  Bash uses the FIGNORE variable to filter the matches, but does not use the GLOBIGNORE shell variable.

       Next, completion considers the string specified as the argument to the -W option.  The string is first split using the characters in the IFS special variable  as  delimiters.   This  honors  shell
       quoting within the string, in order to provide a mechanism for the words to contain shell metacharacters or characters in the value of IFS.  Each word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde
       expansion,  parameter  and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, as described above under EXPANSION.  The results are split using the rules described above under Word
       Splitting.  The results of the expansion are prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the matching words become possible completions.

       After these matches have been generated, bash executes any shell function or command specified with the -F and -C options.  When the command or function is invoked,  bash  assigns  values  to  the
       COMP_LINE,  COMP_POINT,  COMP_KEY,  and COMP_TYPE variables as described above under Shell Variables.  If a shell function is being invoked, bash also sets the COMP_WORDS and COMP_CWORD variables.
       When the function or command is invoked, the first argument ($1) is the name of the command whose arguments are being completed, the second argument ($2) is the word being completed, and the third
       argument ($3) is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command line.  There is no filtering of the generated completions against the word being completed; the function or com‐
       mand has complete freedom in generating the matches and they do not need to match a prefix of the word.

       Any function specified with -F is invoked first.  The function may use any of the shell facilities, including the compgen and compopt builtins described below, to generate the  matches.   It  must
       put the possible completions in the COMPREPLY array variable, one per array element.

       Next, any command specified with the -C option is invoked in an environment equivalent to command substitution.  It should print a list of completions, one per line, to the standard output.  Back‐
       slash will escape a newline, if necessary.  These are added to the set of possible completions.

       After  generating all of the possible completions, bash applies any filter specified with the -X option to the completions in the list.  The filter is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a &
       in the pattern is replaced with the text of the word being completed.  A literal & may be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match.  Any completion that matches
       the pattern is removed from the list.  A leading ! negates the pattern; in this case bash removes any completion that does not match the pattern.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled,  bash
       performs the match without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.

       Finally,  programmable completion adds any prefix and suffix specified with the -P and -S options, respectively, to each completion, and returns the result to readline as the list of possible com‐
       pletions.

       If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and the -o dirnames option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, bash attempts directory name completion.

       If the -o plusdirs option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, bash attempts directory name completion and adds any matches to the set of possible completions.

       By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to the completion code as the full set of possible completions.  The default bash completions  and  the  readline  default  of
       filename  completion  are  disabled.   If the -o bashdefault option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, and the compspec generates no matches, bash attempts its default comple‐
       tions.  If the compspec and, if attempted, the default bash completions generate no matches, and the -o default option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, programmable  comple‐
       tion performs readline's default completion.

       The  options supplied to complete and compopt can control how readline treats the completions.  For instance, the -o fullquote option tells readline to quote the matches as if they were filenames.
       See the description of complete below for details.

       When a compspec indicates that it wants directory name completion, the programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash to completed names which are symbolic  links  to  directo‐
       ries, subject to the value of the mark-directories readline variable, regardless of the setting of the mark-symlinked-directories readline variable.

       There  is some support for dynamically modifying completions.  This is most useful when used in combination with a default completion specified with complete -D.  It's possible for shell functions
       executed as completion functions to indicate that completion should be retried by returning an exit status of 124.  If a shell function returns 124, and changes the compspec  associated  with  the
       command  on  which  completion is being attempted (supplied as the first argument when the function is executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an attempt to find a new
       compspec for that command.  This can be used to build a set of completions dynamically as completion is attempted, rather than loading them all at once.

       For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each kept in a file corresponding to the name of the command, the following default completion function would load completions  dynami‐
       cally:
              _completion_loader()
              {
                . "/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh" >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124
              }
              complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default

HISTORY
       When  the  -o  history option to the set builtin is enabled, the shell provides access to the command history, the list of commands previously typed.  The value of the HISTSIZE variable is used as
       the number of commands to save in a history list: the shell saves the text of the last HISTSIZE commands (default 500).  The shell stores each command in the history list prior  to  parameter  and
       variable expansion (see EXPANSION above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell variables HISTIGNORE and HISTCONTROL.

       On startup, bash initializes the history list by reading history entries from the file named by the HISTFILE variable (default ~/.bash_history).  That file is referred to as the history file.  The
       history  file  is  truncated,  if necessary, to contain no more than the number of history entries specified by the value of the HISTFILESIZE variable.  If HISTFILESIZE is unset, or set to null, a
       non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history file is not truncated.

       When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the following history  line.   These  timestamps
       are optionally displayed depending on the value of the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable.  When present, history timestamps delimit history entries, making multi-line entries possible.

       When  a  shell with history enabled exits, bash copies the last $HISTSIZE entries from the history list to $HISTFILE.  If the histappend shell option is enabled (see the description of shopt under
       SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below), bash appends the entries to the history file, otherwise it overwrites the history file.  If HISTFILE is unset or null, or if the history file is unwritable, the his‐
       tory is not saved.  After saving the history, bash truncates the history file to contain no more than HISTFILESIZE lines as described above.

       If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set, the shell writes the timestamp information associated with each history entry to the history file, marked with the history comment character,  so  timestamps
       are  preserved  across  shell  sessions.   This  uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines.  As above, when using HISTTIMEFORMAT, the timestamps delimit
       multi-line history entries.

       The fc builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) will list or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list.  The history builtin can display or modify the history list and manipulate
       the history file.  When using command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing mode that provide access to the history list.

       The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history list.  The HISTCONTROL and HISTIGNORE variables are used to save only a subset of the commands entered.  If the cmdhist  shell
       option  is  enabled, the shell attempts to save each line of a multi-line command in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to preserve syntactic correctness.  The lithist shell
       option modifies cmdhist by saving the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons.  See the description of the shopt builtin below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS for information on  setting
       and unsetting shell options.

HISTORY EXPANSION
       The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the history expansion in csh.  This section describes what syntax features are available.

       History  expansion  is  enabled by default for interactive shells, and can be disabled using the +H option to the set builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  Non-interactive shells do
       not perform history expansion by default, but it can be enabled with “set -H”.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a previous command into the current input  line,  or  fix
       errors in previous commands quickly.

       History  expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read, before the shell breaks it into words, and is performed on each line individually.  The shell attempts to inform the his‐
       tory expansion functions about quoting still in effect from previous lines.

       It takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine which history list entry to use during substitution.  The second is to select portions of that entry to include into the current one.

       The entry selected from the history is the event, and the portions of that entry that are acted upon are words.  Various modifiers are available to manipulate the selected  words.   The  entry  is
       split into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several metacharacter-separated words surrounded by quotes are considered one word.  The event designator selects the event, the
       optional word designator selects words from the event, and various optional modifiers are available to manipulate the selected words.

       History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is ! by default.  History expansions may appear anywhere in the input, but do not nest.

       Only backslash (\) and single quotes can quote the history expansion character, but the history expansion character is also treated as quoted if it immediately precedes the closing double quote in
       a double-quoted string.

       Several  characters  inhibit  history expansion if found immediately following the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space, tab, newline, carriage return, =, and the other shell
       metacharacters defined above.

       There is a special abbreviation for substitution, active when the quick substitution character (described above under histchars) is the first character on the line.  It selects the  previous  his‐
       tory  list entry, using an event designator equivalent to !!, and substitutes one string for another in that entry.  It is described below under Event Designators.  This is the only history expan‐
       sion that does not begin with the history expansion character.

       Several shell options settable with the shopt builtin will modify history expansion behavior (see the description of the shopt builtin below).and If the histverify shell  option  is  enabled,  and
       readline is being used, history substitutions are not immediately passed to the shell parser.  Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into the readline editing buffer for further modification.  If
       readline is being used, and the histreedit shell option is enabled, a failed history substitution is reloaded into the readline editing buffer for correction.

       The  -p option to the history builtin command shows what a history expansion will do before using it.  The -s option to the history builtin will add commands to the end of the history list without
       actually executing them, so that they are available for subsequent recall.

       The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history expansion mechanism (see the description of histchars above under Shell Variables).  The shell uses the history comment char‐
       acter to mark history timestamps when writing the history file.

   Event Designators
       An event designator is a reference to an entry in the history list.  The event designator consists of the portion of the word beginning with the history expansion character  and  ending  with  the
       word designator if present, or the end of the word.  Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative to the current position in the history list.

       !      Start a history substitution, except when followed by a blank, newline, carriage return, =, or, when the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin, (.
       !n     Refer to history list entry n.
       !-n    Refer to the current entry minus n.
       !!     Refer to the previous entry.  This is a synonym for “!-1”.
       !string
              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list starting with string.
       !?string[?]
              Refer  to  the  most  recent command preceding the current position in the history list containing string.  The trailing ? may be omitted if string is followed immediately by a newline.  If
              string is missing, this uses the string from the most recent search; it is an error if there is no previous search string.
       ^string1^string2^
              Quick substitution.  Repeat the previous command, replacing string1 with string2.  Equivalent to “!!:s^string1^string2^” (see Modifiers below).
       !#     The entire command line typed so far.

   Word Designators
       Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.  They are optional; if the word designator isn't supplied, the history expansion uses the entire event.  A : separates  the  event
       specification  from the word designator.  It may be omitted if the word designator begins with a ^, $, *, -, or %.  Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being de‐
       noted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the current line separated by single spaces.

       0 (zero)
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
       n      The nth word.
       ^      The first argument: word 1.
       $      The last word.  This is usually the last argument, but will expand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.
       %      The first word matched by the most recent “?string?”  search, if the search string begins with a character that is part of a word.  By default, searches begin at the end of  each  line  and
              proceed to the beginning, so the first word matched is the one closest to the end of the line.
       x-y    A range of words; “-y” abbreviates “0-y”.
       *      All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for “1-$”.  It is not an error to use * if there is just one word in the event; it expands to the empty string in that case.
       x*     Abbreviates x-$.
       x-     Abbreviates x-$ like x*, but omits the last word.  If x is missing, it defaults to 0.

       If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the previous command is used as the event, equivalent to !!.

   Modifiers
       After  the optional word designator, the expansion may include a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a “:”.  These modify, or edit, the word or words selected from
       the history event.

       h      Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head.
       t      Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.
       r      Remove a trailing suffix of the form .xxx, leaving the basename.
       e      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
       p      Print the new command but do not execute it.
       q      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
       x      Quote the substituted words as with q, but break into words at blanks and newlines.  The q and x modifiers are mutually exclusive; expansion uses the last one supplied.
       s/old/new/
              Substitute new for the first occurrence of old in the event line.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of /.  The final delimiter is optional if it is the last character  of
              the  event  line.  A single backslash quotes the delimiter in old and new.  If & appears in new, it is replaced with old.  A single backslash quotes the &.  If old is null, it is set to the
              last old substituted, or, if no previous history substitutions took place, the last string in a !?string[?]  search.  If new is null, each matching old is deleted.
       &      Repeat the previous substitution.
       g      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is used in conjunction with “:s” (e.g., “:gs/old/new/”) or “:&”.  If used with “:s”, any delimiter can be used in place  of  /,
              and the final delimiter is optional if it is the last character of the event line.  An a may be used as a synonym for g.
       G      Apply the following “s” or “&” modifier once to each word in the event line.

SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by - accepts -- to signify the end of the options.  The :, true, false, and test/[ builtins do
       not  accept  options  and  do not treat -- specially.  The exit, logout, return, break, continue, let, and shift builtins accept and process arguments beginning with - without requiring --.  Other
       builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with - as invalid options and require -- to prevent this interpretation.

       : [arguments]
              No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments and performing any specified redirections.  The return status is zero.

       . [-p path] filename [arguments]
       source [-p path] filename [arguments]
              The . command (source) reads and execute commands from filename in the current shell environment and returns the exit status of the last command executed from filename.

              If filename does not contain a slash, . searches for it.  If the -p option is supplied, . treats path as a colon-separated list of directories in which to find filename; otherwise,  .  uses
              the  entries  in  PATH to find the directory containing filename.  filename does not need to be executable.  When bash is not in posix mode, it searches the current directory if filename is
              not found in PATH, but does not search the current directory if -p is supplied.  If the sourcepath option to the shopt builtin command is turned off, . does not search PATH.

              If any arguments are supplied, they become the positional parameters when filename is executed.  Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged.

              If the -T option is enabled, . inherits any trap on DEBUG; if it is not, any DEBUG trap string is saved and restored around the call to ., and . unsets the DEBUG trap while it executes.  If
              -T is not set, and the sourced file changes the DEBUG trap, the new value persists after . completes.  The return status is the status of the last command executed from filename  (0  if  no
              commands are executed), and non-zero if filename is not found or cannot be read.

       alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]
              With  no arguments or with the -p option, alias prints the list of aliases in the form alias name=value on standard output.  When arguments are supplied, define an alias for each name whose
              value is given.  A trailing space in value causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded during command parsing.  For each name in the  argument  list
              for which no value is supplied, print the name and value of the alias name.  alias returns true unless a name is given (without a corresponding =value) for which no alias has been defined.

       bg [jobspec ...]
              Resume each suspended job jobspec in the background, as if it had been started with &.  If jobspec is not present, the shell uses its notion of the current job.  bg jobspec returns 0 unless
              run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, any specified jobspec was not found or was started without job control.

       bind [-m keymap] [-lsvSVX]
       bind [-m keymap] [-q function] [-u function] [-r keyseq]
       bind [-m keymap] -f filename
       bind [-m keymap] -x keyseq[:] shell-command
       bind [-m keymap] keyseq:function-name
       bind [-m keymap] -p|-P [readline-command]
       bind [-m keymap] keyseq:readline-command
       bind readline-command-line
              Display current readline key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a readline function or macro or to a shell command, or set a readline variable.  Each non-option argument is a key
              binding  or  command  as  it  would  appear  in  a  readline  initialization  file  such  as  .inputrc, but each binding or command must be passed as a separate argument; e.g., '"\C-x\C-r":
              re-read-init-file'.  In the following descriptions, output available to be re-read is formatted as commands that would appear in a readline initialization file or that would be supplied  as
              individual arguments to a bind command.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -m keymap
                     Use  keymap  as  the keymap to be affected by the subsequent bindings.  Acceptable keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and vi-in‐
                     sert.  vi is equivalent to vi-command (vi-move is also a synonym); emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.
              -l     List the names of all readline functions.
              -p     Display readline function names and bindings in such a way that they can be used as an argument to a subsequent bind command or in a readline initialization file.  If  arguments  re‐
                     main after option processing, bind treats them as readline command names and restricts output to those names.
              -P     List current readline function names and bindings.  If arguments remain after option processing, bind treats them as readline command names and restricts output to those names.
              -s     Display  readline  key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output in such a way that they can be used as an argument to a subsequent bind command or in a readline initial‐
                     ization file.
              -S     Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.
              -v     Display readline variable names and values in such a way that they can be used as an argument to a subsequent bind command or in a readline initialization file.
              -V     List current readline variable names and values.
              -f filename
                     Read key bindings from filename.
              -q function
                     Display key sequences that invoke the named readline function.
              -u function
                     Unbind all key sequences bound to the named readline function.
              -r keyseq
                     Remove any current binding for keyseq.
              -x keyseq[: ]shell-command
                     Cause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is entered.  The separator between keyseq and shell-command is either whitespace or a colon optionally followed by whitespace.   If
                     the separator is whitespace, shell-command must be enclosed in double quotes and readline expands any of its special backslash-escapes in shell-command before saving it.  If the sep‐
                     arator is a colon, any enclosing double quotes are optional, and readline does not expand the command string before saving it.  Since the entire key binding expression must be a sin‐
                     gle  argument,  it should be enclosed in single quotes.  When shell-command is executed, the shell sets the READLINE_LINE variable to the contents of the readline line buffer and the
                     READLINE_POINT and READLINE_MARK variables to the current location of the insertion point and the saved insertion point (the mark), respectively.  The shell assigns any numeric argu‐
                     ment the user supplied to the READLINE_ARGUMENT variable.  If there was no argument, that variable is not set.  If the executed command changes the value  of  any  of  READLINE_LINE,
                     READLINE_POINT, or READLINE_MARK, those new values will be reflected in the editing state.
              -X     List all key sequences bound to shell commands and the associated commands in a format that can be reused as an argument to a subsequent bind command.

              The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is supplied or an error occurred.

       break [n]
              Exit  from  within a for, while, until, or select loop.  If n is specified, break exits n enclosing loops.  n must be ≥ 1.  If n is greater than the number of enclosing loops, all enclosing
              loops are exited.  The return value is 0 unless n is not greater than or equal to 1.

       builtin shell-builtin [arguments]
              Execute the specified shell builtin shell-builtin, passing it arguments, and return its exit status.  This is useful when defining a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin,  re‐
              taining the functionality of the builtin within the function.  The cd builtin is commonly redefined this way.  The return status is false if shell-builtin is not a shell builtin command.

       caller [expr]
              Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function or a script executed with the . or source builtins).

              Without expr, caller displays the line number and source filename of the current subroutine call.  If a non-negative integer is supplied as expr, caller displays the line number, subroutine
              name,  and  source  file  corresponding to that position in the current execution call stack.  This extra information may be used, for example, to print a stack trace.  The current frame is
              frame 0.

              The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a subroutine call or expr does not correspond to a valid position in the call stack.

       cd [-L] [-@] [dir]
       cd -P [-e] [-@] [dir]
              Change the current directory to dir.  if dir is not supplied, the value of the HOME shell variable is used as dir.  The variable CDPATH exists, and dir does not begin with a slash  (/),  cd
              uses  it as a search path: the shell searches each directory name in CDPATH for dir.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in CDPATH is
              the same as the current directory, i.e., “.”.

              The -P option causes cd to use the physical directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing dir and before processing instances of .. in dir (see also the -P option to  the
              set builtin command).

              The  -L  option forces cd to follow symbolic links by resolving the link after processing instances of .. in dir.  If .. appears in dir, cd processes it by removing the immediately previous
              pathname component from dir, back to a slash or the beginning of dir, and verifying that the portion of dir it has processed to that point is still a valid directory name after removing the
              pathname component.  If it is not a valid directory name, cd returns a non-zero status.  If neither -L nor -P is supplied, cd behaves as if -L had been supplied.

              If the -e option is supplied with -P, and cd cannot successfully determine the current working directory after a successful directory change, it returns a non-zero status.

              On systems that support it, the -@ option presents the extended attributes associated with a file as a directory.

              An argument of - is converted to $OLDPWD before attempting the directory change.

              If cd uses a non-empty directory name from CDPATH, or if - is the first argument, and the directory change is successful, cd writes the absolute pathname of the new working directory to the
              standard output.

              If the directory change is successful, cd sets the value of the PWD environment variable to the new directory name, and sets the OLDPWD environment variable to  the  value  of  the  current
              working directory before the change.

              The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.

       command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
              The command builtin runs command with args suppressing the normal shell function lookup for command.  Only builtin commands or commands found in the PATH named command are executed.  If the
              -p option is supplied, the search for command is performed using a default value for PATH that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities.

              If  either  the -V or -v option is supplied, command prints a description of command.  The -v option displays a single word indicating the command or filename used to invoke command; the -V
              option produces a more verbose description.

              If the -V or -v option is supplied, the exit status is zero if command was found, and non-zero if not.  If neither option is supplied and an error occurred or command cannot be  found,  the
              exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit status of the command builtin is the exit status of command.

       compgen [-V varname] [option] [word]
              Generate possible completion matches for word according to the options, which may be any option accepted by the complete builtin with the exceptions of -p, -r, -D, -E, and -I, and write the
              matches to the standard output.

              If the -V option is supplied, compgen stores the generated completions into the indexed array variable varname instead of writing them to the standard output.

              When using the -F or -C options, the various shell variables set by the programmable completion facilities, while available, will not have useful values.

              The  matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had generated them directly from a completion specification with the same flags.  If word is specified,
              only those completions matching word will be displayed or stored.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no matches were generated.

       complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-o comp-option] [-DEI] [-A action]
              [-G globpat] [-W wordlist] [-F function] [-C command]
              [-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] name [name ...]
       complete -pr [-DEI] [name ...]
              Specify how arguments to each name should be completed.

              If the -p option is supplied, or if no options or names are supplied, print existing completion specifications in a way that allows them to be reused as input.  The -r option removes a com‐
              pletion specification for each name, or, if no names are supplied, all completion specifications.

              The -D option indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to the “default” command completion; that is, completion attempted on a command for which no completion has pre‐
              viously been defined.  The -E option indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to “empty” command completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank line.  The -I op‐
              tion indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to completion on the initial non-assignment word on the line, or after a command delimiter such as ; or |, which is  usu‐
              ally  command  name completion.  If multiple options are supplied, the -D option takes precedence over -E, and both take precedence over -I.  If any of -D, -E, or -I are supplied, any other
              name arguments are ignored; these completions only apply to the case specified by the option.

              The process of applying these completion specifications when attempting word completion  is described above under Programmable Completion.

              Other options, if specified, have the following meanings.  The arguments to the -G, -W, and -X options (and, if necessary, the -P and -S options) should be quoted to protect them  from  ex‐
              pansion before the complete builtin is invoked.

              -o comp-option
                      The comp-option controls several aspects of the compspec's behavior beyond the simple generation of completions.  comp-option may be one of:
                      bashdefault
                              Perform the rest of the default bash completions if the compspec generates no matches.
                      default Use readline's default filename completion if the compspec generates no matches.
                      dirnames
                              Perform directory name completion if the compspec generates no matches.
                      filenames
                              Tell  readline  that the compspec generates filenames, so it can perform any filename-specific processing (such as adding a slash to directory names, quoting special charac‐
                              ters, or suppressing trailing spaces).  This is intended to be used with shell functions.
                      fullquote
                              Tell readline to quote all the completed words even if they are not filenames.
                      noquote Tell readline not to quote the completed words if they are filenames (quoting filenames is the default).
                      nosort  Tell readline not to sort the list of possible completions alphabetically.
                      nospace Tell readline not to append a space (the default) to words completed at the end of the line.
                      plusdirs
                              After generating any matches defined by the compspec, attempt directory name completion and add any matches to the results of the other actions.
              -A action
                      The action may be one of the following to generate a list of possible completions:
                      alias   Alias names.  May also be specified as -a.
                      arrayvar
                              Array variable names.
                      binding Readline key binding names.
                      builtin Names of shell builtin commands.  May also be specified as -b.
                      command Command names.  May also be specified as -c.
                      directory
                              Directory names.  May also be specified as -d.
                      disabled
                              Names of disabled shell builtins.
                      enabled Names of enabled shell builtins.
                      export  Names of exported shell variables.  May also be specified as -e.
                      file    File and directory names, similar to readline's filename completion.  May also be specified as -f.
                      function
                              Names of shell functions.
                      group   Group names.  May also be specified as -g.
                      helptopic
                              Help topics as accepted by the help builtin.
                      hostname
                              Hostnames, as taken from the file specified by the HOSTFILE shell variable.
                      job     Job names, if job control is active.  May also be specified as -j.
                      keyword Shell reserved words.  May also be specified as -k.
                      running Names of running jobs, if job control is active.
                      service Service names.  May also be specified as -s.
                      setopt  Valid arguments for the -o option to the set builtin.
                      shopt   Shell option names as accepted by the shopt builtin.
                      signal  Signal names.
                      stopped Names of stopped jobs, if job control is active.
                      user    User names.  May also be specified as -u.
                      variable
                              Names of all shell variables.  May also be specified as -v.
              -C command
                      command is executed in a subshell environment, and its output is used as the possible completions.  Arguments are passed as with the -F option.
              -F function
                      The shell function function is executed in the current shell environment.  When the function is executed, the first argument ($1) is the name of the command whose arguments are  be‐
                      ing  completed,  the  second argument ($2) is the word being completed, and the third argument ($3) is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command line.  When
                      function finishes, programmable completion retrieves the possible completions from the value of the COMPREPLY array variable.
              -G globpat
                      Expand the pathname expansion pattern globpat to generate the possible completions.
              -P prefix
                      Add prefix to the beginning of each possible completion after all other options have been applied.
              -S suffix
                      Append suffix to each possible completion after all other options have been applied.
              -W wordlist
                      Split the wordlist using the characters in the IFS special variable as delimiters, and expand each resulting word.  Shell quoting is honored within wordlist, in order to  provide  a
                      mechanism  for  the  words to contain shell metacharacters or characters in the value of IFS.  The possible completions are the members of the resultant list which match a prefix of
                      the word being completed.
              -X filterpat
                      filterpat is a pattern as used for pathname expansion.  It is applied to the list of possible completions generated by the preceding  options  and  arguments,  and  each  completion
                      matching filterpat is removed from the list.  A leading ! in filterpat negates the pattern; in this case, any completion not matching filterpat is removed.

              The  return  value  is  true  unless an invalid option is supplied, an option other than -p, -r, -D, -E, or -I is supplied without a name argument, an attempt is made to remove a completion
              specification for a name for which no specification exists, or an error occurs adding a completion specification.

       compopt [-o option] [-DEI] [+o option] [name]
              Modify completion options for each name according to the options, or for the currently-executing completion if no names are supplied.  If no options are supplied, display the completion op‐
              tions for each name or the current completion.  The possible values of option are those valid for the complete builtin described above.

              The -D option indicates that other supplied options should apply to the “default” command completion; the -E option indicates that other supplied options should  apply  to  “empty”  command
              completion;  and  the  -I  option  indicates  that  other  supplied options should apply to completion on the initial word on the line.  These are determined in the same way as the complete
              builtin.

              If multiple options are supplied, the -D option takes precedence over -E, and both take precedence over -I.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an attempt is made to modify the options for a name for which no completion specification exists, or an output error occurs.

       continue [n]
              continue resumes the next iteration of the enclosing for, while, until, or select loop.  If n is specified, bash resumes the nth enclosing loop.  n must be ≥ 1.  If n is  greater  than  the
              number of enclosing loops, the shell resumes the last enclosing loop (the “top-level” loop).  The return value is 0 unless n is not greater than or equal to 1.

       declare [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...]
       typeset [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...]
              Declare  variables and/or give them attributes.  If no names are given then display the values of variables or functions.  The -p option will display the attributes and values of each name.
              When -p is used with name arguments, additional options, other than -f and -F, are ignored.

              When -p is supplied without name arguments, declare will display the attributes and values of all variables having the attributes specified by the additional options.  If no  other  options
              are supplied with -p, declare will display the attributes and values of all shell variables.  The -f option restricts the display to shell functions.

              The -F option inhibits the display of function definitions; only the function name and attributes are printed.  If the extdebug shell option is enabled using shopt, the source file name and
              line number where each name is defined are displayed as well.  The -F option implies -f.

              The -g option forces variables to be created or modified at the global scope, even when declare is executed in a shell function.  It is ignored when declare is not executed in a shell func‐
              tion.

              The  -I  option causes local variables to inherit the attributes (except the nameref attribute) and value of any existing variable with the same name at a surrounding scope.  If there is no
              existing variable, the local variable is initially unset.

              The following options can be used to restrict output to variables with the specified attribute or to give variables attributes:
              -a     Each name is an indexed array variable (see Arrays above).
              -A     Each name is an associative array variable (see Arrays above).
              -f     Each name refers to a shell function.
              -i     The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above) is performed when the variable is assigned a value.
              -l     When the variable is assigned a value, all upper-case characters are converted to lower-case.  The upper-case attribute is disabled.
              -n     Give each name the nameref attribute, making it a name reference to another variable.  That other variable is defined by the value of name.   All  references,  assignments,  and  at‐
                     tribute  modifications to name, except those using or changing the -n attribute itself, are performed on the variable referenced by name's value.  The nameref attribute cannot be ap‐
                     plied to array variables.
              -r     Make names readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned values by subsequent assignment statements or unset.
              -t     Give each name the trace attribute.  Traced functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps from the calling shell.  The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.
              -u     When the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case characters are converted to upper-case.  The lower-case attribute is disabled.
              -x     Mark each name for export to subsequent commands via the environment.

              Using “+” instead of “-” turns off the specified attribute instead, with the exceptions that +a and +A may not be used to destroy array variables and +r will not  remove  the  readonly  at‐
              tribute.

              When  used  in a function, declare and typeset make each name local, as with the local command, unless the -g option is supplied.  If a variable name is followed by =value, the value of the
              variable is set to value.  When using -a or -A and the compound assignment syntax to create array variables, additional attributes do not take effect until subsequent assignments.

              The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an attempt is made to define a function using “-f foo=bar”, an attempt is made to assign a value to a  readonly  variable,  an
              attempt  is  made  to assign a value to an array variable without using the compound assignment syntax (see Arrays above), one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, an attempt is
              made to turn off readonly status for a readonly variable, an attempt is made to turn off array status for an array variable, or an attempt is made to display a  non-existent  function  with
              -f.

       dirs [-clpv] [+n] [-n]
              Without  options, display the list of currently remembered directories.  The default display is on a single line with directory names separated by spaces.  Directories are added to the list
              with the pushd command; the popd command removes entries from the list.  The current directory is always the first directory in the stack.

              Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -c     Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the entries.
              -l     Produces a listing using full pathnames; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote the home directory.
              -p     Print the directory stack with one entry per line.
              -v     Print the directory stack with one entry per line, prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.
              +n     Displays the nth entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting with zero.
              -n     Displays the nth entry counting from the right of the list shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting with zero.

              The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is supplied or n indexes beyond the end of the directory stack.

       disown [-ar] [-h] [id ...]
              Without options, remove each id from the table of active jobs.  Each id may be a job specification jobspec or a process ID pid; if id is a pid, disown uses the job containing  pid  as  job‐
              spec.

              If  the  -h option is supplied, disown does not remove the jobs corresponding to each id from the jobs table, but rather marks them so the shell does not send SIGHUP to the job if the shell
              receives a SIGHUP.

              If no id is supplied, the -a option means to remove or mark all jobs; the -r option without an id argument removes or marks running jobs.  If no id is supplied, and neither the -a  nor  the
              -r option is supplied, disown removes or marks the current job.

              The return value is 0 unless an id does not specify a valid job.

       echo [-neE] [arg ...]
              Output the args, separated by spaces, followed by a newline.  The return status is 0 unless a write error occurs.  If -n is specified, the trailing newline is not printed.

              If  the -e option is given, echo interprets the following backslash-escaped characters.  The -E option disables interpretation of these escape characters, even on systems where they are in‐
              terpreted by default.  The xpg_echo shell option determines whether or not echo interprets any options and expands these escape characters.  echo does not interpret -- to mean  the  end  of
              options.

              echo interprets the following escape sequences:
              \a     alert (bell)
              \b     backspace
              \c     suppress further output
              \e
              \E     an escape character
              \f     form feed
              \n     new line
              \r     carriage return
              \t     horizontal tab
              \v     vertical tab
              \\     backslash
              \0nnn  The eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (zero to three octal digits).
              \xHH   The eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits).
              \uHHHH The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits).
              \UHHHHHHHH
                     The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits).

              echo writes any unrecognized backslash-escaped characters unchanged.

       enable [-a] [-dnps] [-f filename] [name ...]
              Enable  and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin allows an executable file which has the same name as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even
              though the shell normally searches for builtins before files.

              If -n is supplied, each name is disabled; otherwise, names are enabled.  For example, to use the test binary found using PATH instead of the shell builtin version, run “enable -n test”.

              If no name arguments are supplied, or if the -p option is supplied, print a list of shell builtins.  With no other option arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins.  If  -n
              is supplied, print only disabled builtins.  If -a is supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is enabled.  The -s option means to restrict
              the output to the POSIX special builtins.

              The -f option means to load the new builtin command name from shared object filename, on systems that support dynamic loading.  If filename does not contain a slash, Bash will use the value
              of  the  BASH_LOADABLES_PATH variable as a colon-separated list of directories in which to search for filename.  The default for BASH_LOADABLES_PATH is system-dependent, and may include “.”
              to force a search of the current directory.  The -d option will delete a builtin previously loaded with -f.  If -s is used with -f, the new builtin becomes a POSIX special builtin.

              If no options are supplied and a name is not a shell builtin, enable will attempt to load name from a shared object named name, as if the command were “enable -f name name”.

              The return value is 0 unless a name is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object.

       eval [arg ...]
              Concatenate the args together into a single command, separating them with spaces.  Bash then reads and execute this command, and returns its exit status as the return status  of  eval.   If
              there are no args, or only null arguments, eval returns 0.

       exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]]
              If command is specified, it replaces the shell without creating a new process.  command cannot be a shell builtin or function.  The arguments become the arguments to command.  If the -l op‐
              tion  is supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth argument passed to command.  This is what login(1) does.  The -c option causes command to be executed with an empty
              environment.  If -a is supplied, the shell passes name as the zeroth argument to the executed command.

              If command cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits, unless the execfail shell option is enabled.  In that case, it returns a non-zero status.  An interactive shell
              returns a non-zero status if the file cannot be executed.  A subshell exits unconditionally if exec fails.

              If command is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.

       exit [n]
              Cause the shell to exit with a status of n.  If n is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed.  Any trap on EXIT is executed before the shell terminates.

       export [-fn] [name[=value]] ...
       export -p [-f]
              The supplied names are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands.  If the -f option is given, the names refer to functions.

              The -n option unexports, or removes the export attribute, from each name.  If no names are given, or if only the -p option is supplied, export displays a list of names of all exported vari‐
              ables on the standard output.  Using -p and -f together displays exported functions.  The -p option displays output in a form that may be reused as input.

              export allows the value of a variable to be set when it is exported or unexported by following the variable name with =value.  This sets the value of the variable to value  while  modifying
              the export attribute.  export returns an exit status of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is supplied with a name that is
              not a function.

       false  Does nothing; returns a non-zero status.

       fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first] [last]
       fc -s [pat=rep] [cmd]
              The  first  form selects a range of commands from first to last from the history list and displays or edits and re-executes them.  First and last may be specified as a string (to locate the
              last command beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current command number).

              When listing, a first or last of 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is equivalent to the current command (usually the fc command); otherwise 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid.  If  last  is
              not  specified,  it is set to the current command for listing (so that “fc -l -10” prints the last 10 commands) and to first otherwise.  If first is not specified, it is set to the previous
              command for editing and -16 for listing.

              If the -l option is supplied, the commands are listed on the standard output.  The -n option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The -r option reverses the order of the commands.

              Otherwise, fc invokes the editor named by ename on a file containing those commands.  If ename is not supplied, fc uses the value of the FCEDIT variable, and the value of EDITOR  if  FCEDIT
              is not set.  If neither variable is set, fc uses vi. When editing is complete, fc reads the file containing the edited commands and echoes and executes them.

              In the second form, fc re-executes command after replacing each instance of pat with rep.  Command is interpreted the same as first above.

              A useful alias to use with fc is “r="fc -s"”, so that typing “r cc” runs the last command beginning with “cc” and typing “r” re-executes the last command.

              If  the  first  form  is used, the return value is zero unless an invalid option is encountered or first or last specify history lines out of range.  When editing and re-executing a file of
              commands, the return value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file.  If the second form is used, the return status is that of the re-
              executed command, unless cmd does not specify a valid history entry, in which case fc returns a non-zero status.

       fg [jobspec]
              Resume jobspec in the foreground, and make it the current job.  If jobspec is not present, fg uses the shell's notion of the current job.  The return value is that  of  the  command  placed
              into  the  foreground,  or  failure  if  run  when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if jobspec does not specify a valid job or jobspec specifies a job that was
              started without job control.

       getopts optstring name [arg ...]
              getopts is used by shell scripts and functions to parse positional parameters and obtain options and their arguments.  optstring contains the option characters to be recognized; if a  char‐
              acter is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space.  The colon and question mark characters may not be used as option
              characters.

              Each time it is invoked, getopts places the next option in the shell variable name, initializing name if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the vari‐
              able OPTIND.  OPTIND is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an argument, getopts places that argument into the variable OPTARG.

              The shell does not reset OPTIND automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls to getopts within the same shell invocation to use a new set of parameters.

              When it reaches the end of options, getopts exits with a return value greater than zero.  OPTIND is set to the index of the first non-option argument, and name is set to ?.

              getopts normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are supplied as arg values, getopts parses those instead.

              getopts can report errors in two ways.  If the first character of optstring is a colon, getopts uses silent error reporting.  In normal operation, getopts prints diagnostic messages when it
              encounters  invalid  options or missing option arguments.  If the variable OPTERR is set to 0, getopts does not display any error messages, even if the first character of optstring is not a
              colon.

              If getopts detects an invalid option, it places ? into name and, if not silent, prints an error message and unsets OPTARG.  If getopts is silent, it assigns the option  character  found  to
              OPTARG and does not print a diagnostic message.

              If  a  required argument is not found, and getopts is not silent, it sets the value of name to a question mark (?), unsets OPTARG, and prints a diagnostic message.  If getopts is silent, it
              sets the value of name to a colon (:) and sets OPTARG to the option character found.

              getopts returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.  It returns false if the end of options is encountered or an error occurs.

       hash [-lr] [-p filename] [-dt] [name]
              Each time hash is invoked, it remembers the full pathname of the command name as determined by searching the directories in $PATH.  Any previously-remembered pathname associated  with  name
              is discarded.  If the -p option is supplied, hash uses filename as the full pathname of the command.

              The -r option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.  Assigning to the PATH variable also clears all hashed filenames.  The -d option causes the shell to forget the remembered
              location of each name.

              If  the  -t  option  is  supplied,  hash prints the full pathname corresponding to each name.  If multiple name arguments are supplied with -t, hash prints the name before the corresponding
              hashed full pathname.  The -l option displays output in a format that may be reused as input.

              If no arguments are given, or if only -l is supplied, hash prints information about remembered commands.  The -t, -d, and -p options (the options that act on the name arguments)  are  mutu‐
              ally exclusive.  Only one will be active.  If more than one is supplied, -t has higher priority than -p, and both have higher priority than -d.

              The return status is zero unless a name is not found or an invalid option is supplied.

       help [-dms] [pattern]
              Display  helpful  information about builtin commands.  If pattern is specified, help gives detailed help on all commands matching pattern as described below; otherwise it displays a list of
              all the builtins and shell compound commands.

              Options, if supplied, have the follow meanings:

              -d     Display a short description of each pattern
              -m     Display the description of each pattern in a manpage-like format
              -s     Display only a short usage synopsis for each pattern

              If pattern contains pattern matching characters (see Pattern Matching above) it's treated as a shell pattern and help prints the description of each help topic matching pattern.

              If not, and pattern exactly matches the name of a help topic, help prints the description associated with that topic.  Otherwise, help performs prefix matching and prints  the  descriptions
              of all matching help topics.

              The return status is 0 unless no command matches pattern.

       history [n]
       history -c
       history -d offset
       history -d start-end
       history -anrw [filename]
       history -p arg [arg ...]
       history -s arg [arg ...]
              With  no options, display the command history list with numbers.  Entries prefixed with a * have been modified.  An argument of n lists only the last n entries.  If the shell variable HIST‐
              TIMEFORMAT is set and not null, it is used as a format string for strftime(3) to display the time stamp associated with each displayed history entry.  If  history  uses  HISTTIMEFORMAT,  it
              does not print an intervening space between the formatted time stamp and the history entry.

              If  filename is supplied, history uses it as the name of the history file; if not, it uses the value of HISTFILE.  If filename is not supplied and HISTFILE is unset or null, the -a, -n, -r,
              and -w options have no effect.

              Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -c     Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.  This can be used with the other options to replace the history list.
              -d offset
                     Delete the history entry at position offset.  If offset is negative, it is interpreted as relative to one greater than the last history position, so negative indices count back  from
                     the end of the history, and an index of -1 refers to the current history -d command.
              -d start-end
                     Delete the range of history entries between positions start and end, inclusive.  Positive and negative values for start and end are interpreted as described above.
              -a     Append the “new” history lines to the history file.  These are history lines entered since the beginning of the current bash session, but not already appended to the history file.
              -n     Read  the history lines not already read from the history file and add them to the current history list.  These are lines appended to the history file since the beginning of the cur‐
                     rent bash session.
              -r     Read the history file and append its contents to the current history list.
              -w     Write the current history list to the history file, overwriting the history file.
              -p     Perform history substitution on the following args and display the result on the standard output, without storing the results in the history list.  Each arg must be quoted to disable
                     normal history expansion.
              -s     Store the args in the history list as a single entry.  The last command in the history list is removed before adding the args.

              If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set, history writes the time stamp information associated with each history entry to the history file, marked with the history  comment  character  as  de‐
              scribed above.  When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the following history en‐
              try.

              The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an error occurs while reading or writing the history file, an invalid offset or range is supplied as an argument to -d, or the
              history expansion supplied as an argument to -p fails.

       jobs [-lnprs] [ jobspec ... ]
       jobs -x command [ args ... ]
              The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the following meanings:
              -l     List process IDs in addition to the normal information.
              -n     Display information only about jobs that have changed status since the user was last notified of their status.
              -p     List only the process ID of the job's process group leader.
              -r     Display only running jobs.
              -s     Display only stopped jobs.

              If jobspec is supplied, jobs restricts output to information about that job.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or an invalid jobspec is supplied.

              If the -x option is supplied, jobs replaces any jobspec found in command or args with the corresponding process group ID, and executes command, passing it args, returning its exit status.

       kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] id [ ... ]
       kill -l|-L [sigspec | exit_status]
              Send the signal specified by sigspec or signum to the processes named by each id.  Each id may be a job specification jobspec or a process ID pid.  sigspec is either a case-insensitive sig‐
              nal name such as SIGKILL (with or without the SIG prefix) or a signal number; signum is a signal number.  If sigspec is not supplied, then kill sends SIGTERM.

              The  -l  option lists the signal names.  If any arguments are supplied when -l is given, kill lists the names of the signals corresponding to the arguments, and the return status is 0.  The
              exit_status argument to -l is a number specifying either a signal number or the exit status of a process terminated by a signal; if it is supplied, kill prints the name of the  signal  that
              caused the process to terminate.  kill assumes that process exit statuses are greater than 128; anything less than that is a signal number.  The -L option is equivalent to -l.

              kill returns true if at least one signal was successfully sent, or false if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.

       let arg [arg ...]
              Each arg is evaluated as an arithmetic expression (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above).  If the last arg evaluates to 0, let returns 1; otherwise let returns 0.

       local [option] [name[=value] ... | - ]
              For  each  argument,  create a local variable named name and assign it value.  The option can be any of the options accepted by declare.  When local is used within a function, it causes the
              variable name to have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children.  It is an error to use local when not within a function.

              If name is -, it makes the set of shell options local to the function in which local is invoked: any shell options changed using the set builtin inside the function after the call to  local
              are  restored  to their original values when the function returns.  The restore is performed as if a series of set commands were executed to restore the values that were in place before the
              function.

              With no operands, local writes a list of local variables to the standard output.

              The return status is 0 unless local is used outside a function, an invalid name is supplied, or name is a readonly variable.

       logout [n]
              Exit a login shell, returning a status of n to the shell's parent.

       mapfile [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
       readarray [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
              Read lines from the standard input, or from file descriptor fd if the -u option is supplied, into the indexed array variable array.  The variable MAPFILE is the default array.  Options,  if
              supplied, have the following meanings:
              -d     Use the first character of delim to terminate each input line, rather than newline.  If delim is the empty string, mapfile will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
              -n     Copy at most count lines.  If count is 0, copy all lines.
              -O     Begin assigning to array at index origin.  The default index is 0.
              -s     Discard the first count lines read.
              -t     Remove a trailing delim (default newline) from each line read.
              -u     Read lines from file descriptor fd instead of the standard input.
              -C     Evaluate callback each time quantum lines are read.  The -c option specifies quantum.
              -c     Specify the number of lines read between each call to callback.

              If  -C  is  specified  without -c, the default quantum is 5000.  When callback is evaluated, it is supplied the index of the next array element to be assigned and the line to be assigned to
              that element as additional arguments.  callback is evaluated after the line is read but before the array element is assigned.

              If not supplied with an explicit origin, mapfile will clear array before assigning to it.

              mapfile returns zero unless an invalid option or option argument is supplied, array is invalid or unassignable, or if array is not an indexed array.

       popd [-n] [+n] [-n]
              Remove entries from the directory stack.  The elements are numbered from 0 starting at the first directory listed by dirs, so popd is equivalent to “popd +0.”  With no arguments,  popd  re‐
              moves the top directory from the stack, and changes to the new top directory.  Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -n     Suppress the normal change of directory when removing directories from the stack, only manipulate the stack.
              +n     Remove the nth entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero, from the stack.  For example: “popd +0” removes the first directory, “popd +1” the second.
              -n     Remove the nth entry counting from the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero.  For example: “popd -0” removes the last directory, “popd -1” the next to last.

              If  the  top  element  of the directory stack is modified, and the -n option was not supplied, popd uses the cd builtin to change to the directory at the top of the stack.  If the cd fails,
              popd returns a non-zero value.

              Otherwise, popd returns false if an invalid option is supplied, the directory stack is empty, or n specifies a non-existent directory stack entry.

              If the popd command is successful, bash runs dirs to show the final contents of the directory stack, and the return status is 0.

       printf [-v var] format [arguments]
              Write the formatted arguments to the standard output under the control of the format.  The -v option assigns the output to the variable var rather than printing it to the standard output.

              The format is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply copied to standard output, character escape sequences,  which  are  converted  and
              copied  to  the  standard  output,  and  format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive argument.  In addition to the standard printf(3) format characters cCsS‐
              ndiouxXeEfFgGaA, printf interprets the following additional format specifiers:
              %b     causes printf to expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding argument in the same way as echo -e.
              %q     causes printf to output the corresponding argument in a format that can be reused as shell input.  %q and %Q use the $'' quoting style if any characters in the  argument  string  re‐
                     quire it, and backslash quoting otherwise.  If the format string uses the printf alternate form, these two formats quote the argument string using single quotes.
              %Q     like %q, but applies any supplied precision to the argument before quoting it.
              %(datefmt)T
                     causes  printf  to  output  the date-time string resulting from using datefmt as a format string for strftime(3).  The corresponding argument is an integer representing the number of
                     seconds since the epoch.  This format specifier recognizes two special argument values: -1 represents the current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was invoked.  If no argu‐
                     ment is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had been supplied.  This is an exception to the usual printf behavior.

              The %b, %q, and %T format specifiers all use the field width and precision arguments from the format specification and write that many bytes from (or use that wide a field for) the expanded
              argument, which usually contains more characters than the original.

              The %n format specifier accepts a corresponding argument that is treated as a shell variable name.

              The %s and %c format specifiers accept an l (long) modifier, which forces them to convert the argument string to a wide-character string and apply any supplied field width and precision  in
              terms of characters, not bytes.  The %S and %C format specifiers are equivalent to %ls and %lc, respectively.

              Arguments  to  non-string  format  specifiers  are treated as C constants, except that a leading plus or minus sign is allowed, and if the leading character is a single or double quote, the
              value is the numeric value of the following character, using the current locale.

              The format is reused as necessary to consume all of the arguments.  If the format requires more arguments than are supplied, the extra format specifications behave as if  a  zero  value  or
              null string, as appropriate, had been supplied.  The return value is zero on success, non-zero if an invalid option is supplied or a write or assignment error occurs.

       pushd [-n] [+n] [-n]
       pushd [-n] [dir]
              Add  a  directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotate the stack, making the new top of the stack the current working directory.  With no arguments, pushd exchanges the top two ele‐
              ments of the directory stack.  Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -n     Suppress the normal change of directory when rotating or adding directories to the stack, only manipulate the stack.
              +n     Rotate the stack so that the nth directory (counting from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero) is at the top.
              -n     Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting from the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero) is at the top.
              dir    Adds dir to the directory stack at the top.

              After the stack has been modified, if the -n option was not supplied, pushd uses the cd builtin to change to the directory at the top of the stack.  If the cd fails, pushd  returns  a  non-
              zero value.

              Otherwise,  if  no arguments are supplied, pushd returns zero unless the directory stack is empty.  When rotating the directory stack, pushd returns zero unless the directory stack is empty
              or n specifies a non-existent directory stack element.

              If the pushd command is successful, bash runs dirs to show the final contents of the directory stack.

       pwd [-LP]
              Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.  The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the -P option is supplied or the -o physical option to the set builtin com‐
              mand is enabled.  If the -L option is used, the pathname printed may contain symbolic links.  The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the name of the  current  directory
              or an invalid option is supplied.

       read [-Eers] [-a aname] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]
              Read  one  line from the standard input, or from the file descriptor fd supplied as an argument to the -u option, split it into words as described above under Word Splitting, and assign the
              first word to the first name, the second word to the second name, and so on.  If there are more words than names, the remaining words and their intervening delimiters are  assigned  to  the
              last name.  If there are fewer words read from the input stream than names, the remaining names are assigned empty values.  The characters in the value of the IFS variable are used to split
              the line into words using the same rules the shell uses for expansion (described above under Word Splitting).  The backslash character (\) removes any special meaning for the next character
              read and is used for line continuation.

              Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -a aname
                     The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable aname, starting at 0.  aname is unset before any new values are assigned.  Other name arguments are ignored.
              -d delim
                     The first character of delim terminates the input line, rather than newline.  If delim is the empty string, read will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
              -e     If  the  standard  input is coming from a terminal, read uses readline (see READLINE above) to obtain the line.  Readline uses the current (or default, if line editing was not previ‐
                     ously active) editing settings, but uses readline's default filename completion.
              -E     If the standard input is coming from a terminal, read uses readline (see READLINE above) to obtain the line.  Readline uses the current (or default, if line editing  was  not  previ‐
                     ously active) editing settings, but uses bash's default completion, including programmable completion.
              -i text
                     If readline is being used to read the line, read places text into the editing buffer before editing begins.
              -n nchars
                     read  returns  after  reading nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input, unless it encounters EOF or read times out, but honors a delimiter if it reads fewer
                     than nchars characters before the delimiter.
              -N nchars
                     read returns after reading exactly nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input, unless it encounters EOF or read times out.  Any delimiter  characters  in  the
                     input  are  not treated specially and do not cause read to return until it has read nchars characters.  The result is not split on the characters in IFS; the intent is that the vari‐
                     able is assigned exactly the characters read (with the exception of backslash; see the -r option below).
              -p prompt
                     Display prompt on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any input, but only if input is coming from a terminal.
              -r     Backslash does not act as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be part of the line.  In particular, a backslash-newline pair may not then be used as a line  continua‐
                     tion.
              -s     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
              -t timeout
                     Cause  read to time out and return failure if it does not read a complete line of input (or a specified number of characters) within timeout seconds.  timeout may be a decimal number
                     with a fractional portion following the decimal point.  This option is only effective if read is reading input from a terminal, pipe, or other special file; it  has  no  effect  when
                     reading  from regular files.  If read times out, it saves any partial input read into the specified variable name, and the exit status is greater than 128.  If timeout is 0, read re‐
                     turns immediately, without trying to read any data.  In this case, the exit status is 0 if input is available on the specified file descriptor, or the read will return EOF,  non-zero
                     otherwise.
              -u fd  Read input from file descriptor fd instead of the standard input.

              Other than the case where delim is the empty string, read ignores any NUL characters in the input.

              If no names are supplied, read assigns the line read, without the ending delimiter but otherwise unmodified, to the variable REPLY.

              The exit status is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out (in which case the status is greater than 128), a variable assignment error (such as assigning to a readonly vari‐
              able) occurs, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.

       readonly [-aAf] [-p] [name[=word] ...]
              The  given  names  are  marked readonly; the values of these names may not be changed by subsequent assignment or unset.  If the -f option is supplied, each name refers to a shell function.
              The -a option restricts the variables to indexed arrays; the -A option restricts the variables to associative arrays.  If both options are supplied, -A takes precedence.  If no  name  argu‐
              ments are supplied, or if the -p option is supplied, print a list of all readonly names.  The other options may be used to restrict the output to a subset of the set of readonly names.  The
              -p option displays output in a format that may be reused as input.

              readonly  allows  the value of a variable to be set at the same time the readonly attribute is changed by following the variable name with =value.  This sets the value of the variable is to
              value while modifying the readonly attribute.

              The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is supplied with a name that is not a function.

       return [n]
              Stop executing a shell function or sourced file and return the value specified by n to its caller.  If n is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed.   If  return  is
              executed  by a trap handler, the last command used to determine the status is the last command executed before the trap handler.  If return is executed during a DEBUG trap, the last command
              used to determine the status is the last command executed by the trap handler before return was invoked.

              When return is used to terminate execution of a script being executed by the .  (source) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return either n or the exit status of
              the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script.  If n is supplied, the return value is its least significant 8 bits.

              Any command associated with the RETURN trap is executed before execution resumes after the function or script.

              The return status is non-zero if return is supplied a non-numeric argument, or is used outside a function and not during execution of a script by . or source.

       set [-abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [-o option-name] [--] [-] [arg ...]
       set [+abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [+o option-name] [--] [-] [arg ...]
       set -o
       set +o Without options, display the name and value of each shell variable in a format that can be reused as input for setting or resetting the currently-set variables.  Read-only variables  cannot
              be reset.  In posix mode, only shell variables are listed.  The output is sorted according to the current locale.  When options are specified, they set or unset shell attributes.  Any argu‐
              ments  remaining after option processing are treated as values for the positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to $1, $2, ..., $n.  Options, if specified, have the following mean‐
              ings:
              -a      Each variable or function that is created or modified is given the export attribute and marked for export to the environment of subsequent commands.
              -b      Report the status of terminated background jobs immediately, rather than before the next primary prompt or after a foreground command terminates.  This is effective  only  when  job
                      control is enabled.
              -e      Exit immediately if a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above), exits with a non-zero status.  The shell does
                      not  exit  if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a while or until reserved word, part of the test following the if or elif reserved words, part
                      of any command executed in a && or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last (subject to the state of the  pipefail  shell  op‐
                      tion),  or if the command's return value is being inverted with !.  If a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero status because a command failed while -e was being
                      ignored, the shell does not exit.  A trap on ERR, if set, is executed before the shell exits.  This option applies to the shell environment and each subshell environment  separately
                      (see COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT above), and may cause subshells to exit before executing all the commands in the subshell.

                      If  a compound command or shell function executes in a context where -e is being ignored, none of the commands executed within the compound command or function body will be affected
                      by the -e setting, even if -e is set and a command returns a failure status.  If a compound command or shell function sets -e while executing in a context where -e is ignored,  that
                      setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command containing the function call completes.
              -f      Disable pathname expansion.
              -h      Remember the location of commands as they are looked up for execution.  This is enabled by default.
              -k      All arguments in the form of assignment statements are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.
              -m      Monitor  mode.   Job  control  is  enabled.  This option is on by default for interactive shells on systems that support it (see JOB CONTROL above).  All processes run in a separate
                      process group.  When a background job completes, the shell prints a line containing its exit status.
              -n      Read commands but do not execute them.  This may be used to check a shell script for syntax errors.  This is ignored by interactive shells.
              -o option-name
                      The option-name can be one of the following:
                      allexport
                              Same as -a.
                      braceexpand
                              Same as -B.
                      emacs   Use an emacs-style command line editing interface.  This is enabled by default when the shell is interactive, unless the shell is started with the --noediting option.   This
                              also affects the editing interface used for read -e.
                      errexit Same as -e.
                      errtrace
                              Same as -E.
                      functrace
                              Same as -T.
                      hashall Same as -h.
                      histexpand
                              Same as -H.
                      history Enable command history, as described above under HISTORY.  This option is on by default in interactive shells.
                      ignoreeof
                              The effect is as if the shell command “IGNOREEOF=10” had been executed (see Shell Variables above).
                      keyword Same as -k.
                      monitor Same as -m.
                      noclobber
                              Same as -C.
                      noexec  Same as -n.
                      noglob  Same as -f.
                      nolog   Currently ignored.
                      notify  Same as -b.
                      nounset Same as -u.
                      onecmd  Same as -t.
                      physical
                              Same as -P.
                      pipefail
                              If  set,  the  return  value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit success‐
                              fully.  This option is disabled by default.
                      posix   Enable posix mode; change the behavior of bash where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard.  See SEE ALSO below for a  reference  to  a
                              document that details how posix mode affects bash's behavior.
                      privileged
                              Same as -p.
                      verbose Same as -v.
                      vi      Use a vi-style command line editing interface.  This also affects the editing interface used for read -e.
                      xtrace  Same as -x.
                      If -o is supplied with no option-name, set prints the current shell option settings.  If +o is supplied with no option-name, set prints a series of set commands to recreate the cur‐
                      rent option settings on the standard output.
              -p      Turn  on  privileged  mode.  In this mode, the shell does not read the $ENV and $BASH_ENV files, shell functions are not inherited from the environment, and the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS,
                      CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored.  If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group)  id,
                      and  the  -p option is not supplied, these actions are taken and the effective user id is set to the real user id.  If the -p option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is
                      not reset.  Turning this option off causes the effective user and group ids to be set to the real user and group ids.
              -r      Enable restricted shell mode.  This option cannot be unset once it has been set.
              -t      Exit after reading and executing one command.
              -u      Treat unset variables and parameters other than the special parameters “@” and “*”, or array variables subscripted with “@” or “*”, as an error when performing parameter  expansion.
                      If expansion is attempted on an unset variable or parameter, the shell prints an error message, and, if not interactive, exits with a non-zero status.
              -v      Print shell input lines as they are read.
              -x      After  expanding  each  simple  command, for command, case command, select command, or arithmetic for command, display the expanded value of PS4, followed by the command and its ex‐
                      panded arguments or associated word list, to the standard error.
              -B      The shell performs brace expansion (see Brace Expansion above).  This is on by default.
              -C      If set, bash does not overwrite an existing file with the >, >&, and <> redirection operators.  Using the redirection operator >| instead of > will override this and force the  cre‐
                      ation of an output file.
              -E      If  set,  any  trap  on  ERR is inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment.  The ERR trap is normally not inherited in such
                      cases.
              -H      Enable !  style history substitution.  This option is on by default when the shell is interactive.
              -P      If set, the shell does not resolve symbolic links when executing commands such as cd that change the current working directory.  It uses the physical  directory  structure  instead.
                      By default, bash follows the logical chain of directories when performing commands which change the current directory.
              -T      If  set, any traps on DEBUG and RETURN are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment.  The DEBUG and RETURN traps are nor‐
                      mally not inherited in such cases.
              --      If no arguments follow this option, unset the positional parameters.  Otherwise, set the positional parameters to the args, even if some of them begin with a -.
              -       Signal the end of options, and assign all remaining args to the positional parameters.  The -x and -v options are turned off.  If there are no args, the positional parameters remain
                      unchanged.

              The options are off by default unless otherwise noted.  Using + rather than - causes these options to be turned off.  The options can also be specified as arguments to an invocation of  the
              shell.  The current set of options may be found in $-.  The return status is always zero unless an invalid option is encountered.

       shift [n]
              Rename  positional parameters from n+1 ... to $1 ....  Parameters represented by the numbers $# down to $#-n+1 are unset.  n must be a non-negative number less than or equal to $#.  If n is
              0, no parameters are changed.  If n is not given, it is assumed to be 1.  If n is greater than $#, the positional parameters are not changed.  The return status is greater than zero if n is
              greater than $# or less than zero; otherwise 0.

       shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]
              Toggle the values of settings controlling optional shell behavior.  The settings can be either those listed below, or, if the -o option is used, those available with the -o  option  to  the
              set builtin command.

              With  no  options, or with the -p option, display a list of all settable options, with an indication of whether or not each is set; if any optnames are supplied, the output is restricted to
              those options.  The -p option displays output in a form that may be reused as input.

              Other options have the following meanings:
              -s     Enable (set) each optname.
              -u     Disable (unset) each optname.
              -q     Suppresses normal output (quiet mode); the return status indicates whether the optname is set or unset.  If multiple optname arguments are supplied with -q, the return status is zero
                     if all optnames are enabled; non-zero otherwise.
              -o     Restricts the values of optname to be those defined for the -o option to the set builtin.

              If either -s or -u is used with no optname arguments, shopt shows only those options which are set or unset, respectively.  Unless otherwise noted, the shopt options are disabled (unset) by
              default.

              The return status when listing options is zero if all optnames are enabled, non-zero otherwise.  When setting or unsetting options, the return status is zero unless  an  optname  is  not  a
              valid shell option.

              The list of shopt options is:

              array_expand_once
                      If set, the shell suppresses multiple evaluation of associative and indexed array subscripts during arithmetic expression evaluation, while executing builtins that can perform vari‐
                      able assignments, and while executing builtins that perform array dereferencing.
              assoc_expand_once
                      Deprecated; a synonym for array_expand_once.
              autocd  If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were the argument to the cd command.  This option is only used by interactive shells.
              bash_source_fullpath
                      If set, filenames added to the BASH_SOURCE array variable are converted to full pathnames (see Shell Variables above).
              cdable_vars
                      If set, an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.
              cdspell If  set,  the  cd  command attempts to correct minor errors in the spelling of a directory component.  Minor errors include transposed characters, a missing character, and one extra
                      character.  If cd corrects the directory name, it prints the corrected filename, and the command proceeds.  This option is only used by interactive shells.
              checkhash
                      If set, bash checks that a command found in the hash table exists before trying to execute it.  If a hashed command no longer exists, bash performs a normal path search.
              checkjobs
                      If set, bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting an interactive shell.  If any jobs are running, bash defers the exit until a second  exit  is  attempted
                      without an intervening command (see JOB CONTROL above).  The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped.
              checkwinsize
                      If  set,  bash checks the window size after each external (non-builtin) command and, if necessary, updates the values of LINES and COLUMNS, using the file descriptor associated with
                      the standard error if it is a terminal.  This option is enabled by default.
              cmdhist If set, bash attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history entry.  This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.  This option  is  enabled  by  de‐
                      fault, but only has an effect if command history is enabled, as described above under HISTORY.
              compat31
              compat32
              compat40
              compat41
              compat42
              compat43
              compat44
                      These control aspects of the shell's compatibility mode (see SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE below).
              complete_fullquote
                      If  set,  bash quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names when performing completion.  If not set, bash removes metacharacters such as the dollar sign from the
                      set of characters that will be quoted in completed filenames when these metacharacters appear in shell variable references in words to be completed.  This means that dollar signs in
                      variable names that expand to directories will not be quoted; however, any dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be quoted, either.  This is active only when  bash  is  using
                      backslashes to quote completed filenames.  This variable is set by default, which is the default bash behavior in versions through 4.2.
              direxpand
                      If set, bash replaces directory names with the results of word expansion when performing filename completion.  This changes the contents of the readline editing buffer.  If not set,
                      bash attempts to preserve what the user typed.
              dirspell
                      If set, bash attempts spelling correction on directory names during word completion if the directory name initially supplied does not exist.
              dotglob If set, bash includes filenames beginning with a “.” in the results of pathname expansion.  The filenames . and .. must always be matched explicitly, even if dotglob is set.
              execfail
                      If set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified as an argument to the exec builtin.  An interactive shell does not exit if exec fails.
              expand_aliases
                      If set, aliases are expanded as described above under ALIASES.  This option is enabled by default for interactive shells.
              extdebug
                      If  set  at  shell invocation, or in a shell startup file, arrange to execute the debugger profile before the shell starts, identical to the --debugger option.  If set after invoca‐
                      tion, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
                      1.     The -F option to the declare builtin displays the source file name and line number corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.
                      2.     If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero value, the next command is skipped and not executed.
                      3.     If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a value of 2, and the shell is executing in a subroutine (a shell function or  a  shell  script  executed  by  the  .  or  source
                             builtins), the shell simulates a call to return.
                      4.     BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV are updated as described in their descriptions above).
                      5.     Function tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps.
                      6.     Error tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the ERR trap.
              extglob If set, enable the extended pattern matching features described above under Pathname Expansion.
              extquote
                      If set, $'string' and $"string" quoting is performed within ${parameter} expansions enclosed in double quotes.  This option is enabled by default.
              failglob
                      If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during pathname expansion result in an expansion error.
              force_fignore
                      If  set,  the suffixes specified by the FIGNORE shell variable cause words to be ignored when performing word completion even if the ignored words are the only possible completions.
                      See Shell Variables above for a description of FIGNORE.  This option is enabled by default.
              globasciiranges
                      If set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket expressions (see Pattern Matching above) behave as if in the traditional C locale when performing comparisons.   That  is,
                      pattern  matching does not take the current locale's collating sequence into account, so b will not collate between A and B, and upper-case and lower-case ASCII characters will col‐
                      late together.
              globskipdots
                      If set, pathname expansion will never match the filenames . and .., even if the pattern begins with a “.”.  This option is enabled by default.
              globstar
                      If set, the pattern ** used in a pathname expansion context will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.  If the pattern is followed by a /,  only  directo‐
                      ries and subdirectories match.
              gnu_errfmt
                      If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.
              histappend
                      If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the HISTFILE variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.
              histreedit
                      If set, and readline is being used, the user is given the opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution.
              histverify
                      If  set,  and  readline  is  being used, the results of history substitution are not immediately passed to the shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the readline
                      editing buffer, allowing further modification.
              hostcomplete
                      If set, and readline is being used, bash will attempt to perform hostname completion when a word containing a @ is being completed (see Completing under READLINE  above).   This  is
                      enabled by default.
              huponexit
                      If set, bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.
              inherit_errexit
                      If set, command substitution inherits the value of the errexit option, instead of unsetting it in the subshell environment.  This option is enabled when posix mode is enabled.
              interactive_comments
                      In  an interactive shell, a word beginning with # causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored, as in a non-interactive shell (see COMMENTS above).  This
                      option is enabled by default.
              lastpipe
                      If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline not executed in the background in the current shell environment.
              lithist If set, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.
              localvar_inherit
                      If set, local variables inherit the value and attributes of a variable of the same name that exists at a previous scope before any new value is assigned.  The nameref  attribute  is
                      not inherited.
              localvar_unset
                      If set, calling unset on local variables in previous function scopes marks them so subsequent lookups find them unset until that function returns.  This is identical to the behavior
                      of unsetting local variables at the current function scope.
              login_shell
                      The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see INVOCATION above).  The value may not be changed.
              mailwarn
                      If set, and a file that bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the last time it was checked, bash displays the message “The mail in mailfile has been read”.
              no_empty_cmd_completion
                      If set, and readline is being used, bash does not search PATH for possible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.
              nocaseglob
                      If set, bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname expansion (see Pathname Expansion above).
              nocasematch
                      If  set,  bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing matching while executing case or [[ conditional commands, when performing pattern substitution word ex‐
                      pansions, or when filtering possible completions as part of programmable completion.
              noexpand_translation
                      If set, bash encloses the translated results of $"..." quoting in single quotes instead of double quotes.  If the string is not translated, this has no effect.
              nullglob
                      If set, pathname expansion patterns which match no files (see Pathname Expansion above) expand to nothing and are removed, rather than expanding to themselves.
              patsub_replacement
                      If set, bash expands occurrences of & in the replacement string of pattern substitution to the text matched by the pattern, as described under Parameter Expansion above.   This  op‐
                      tion is enabled by default.
              progcomp
                      If set, enable the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion above).  This option is enabled by default.
              progcomp_alias
                      If  set,  and programmable completion is enabled, bash treats a command name that doesn't have any completions as a possible alias and attempts alias expansion.  If it has an alias,
                      bash attempts programmable completion using the command word resulting from the expanded alias.
              promptvars
                      If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as described in PROMPTING above.  This  option
                      is enabled by default.
              restricted_shell
                      The  shell  sets this option if it is started in restricted mode (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).  The value may not be changed.  This is not reset when the startup files are executed,
                      allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted.
              shift_verbose
                      If set, the shift builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.
              sourcepath
                      If set, the . (source) builtin uses the value of PATH to find the directory containing the file supplied as an argument when the -p option is not supplied.  This option  is  enabled
                      by default.
              varredir_close
                      If  set,  the  shell automatically closes file descriptors assigned using the {varname} redirection syntax (see REDIRECTION above) instead of leaving them open when the command com‐
                      pletes.
              xpg_echo
                      If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.  If the posix shell option is also enabled, echo does not interpret any options.

       suspend [-f]
              Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a SIGCONT signal.  A login shell, or a shell without job control enabled, cannot be suspended; the -f option  will  override  this  and
              force the suspension.  The return status is 0 unless the shell is a login shell or job control is not enabled and -f is not supplied.

       test expr
       [ expr ]
              Return a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression expr.  Each operator and operand must be a separate argument.  Expressions are composed of
              the primaries described above under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS.  test does not accept any options, nor does it accept and ignore an argument of -- as signifying the end of options.

              Expressions  may  be  combined  using  the  following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence.  The evaluation depends on the number of arguments; see below.  test uses operator
              precedence when there are five or more arguments.
              ! expr True if expr is false.
              ( expr )
                     Returns the value of expr.  This may be used to override normal operator precedence.
              expr1 -a expr2
                     True if both expr1 and expr2 are true.
              expr1 -o expr2
                     True if either expr1 or expr2 is true.

              test and [ evaluate conditional expressions using a set of rules based on the number of arguments.

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.
              2 arguments
                     If the first argument is !, the expression is true if and only if the second argument is null.  If the first argument is one of the unary conditional  operators  listed  above  under
                     CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the expression is true if the unary test is true.  If the first argument is not a valid unary conditional operator, the expression is false.
              3 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.  If the second argument is one of the binary conditional operators listed above under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the result of
                     the  expression  is the result of the binary test using the first and third arguments as operands.  The -a and -o operators are considered binary operators when there are three argu‐
                     ments.  If the first argument is !, the value is the negation of the two-argument test using the second and third arguments.  If the first argument is exactly ( and the  third  argu‐
                     ment is exactly ), the result is the one-argument test of the second argument.  Otherwise, the expression is false.
              4 arguments
                     The  following  conditions  are  applied in the order listed.  If the first argument is !, the result is the negation of the three-argument expression composed of the remaining argu‐
                     ments.  If the first argument is exactly ( and the fourth argument is exactly ), the result is the two-argument test of the second and third arguments.  Otherwise, the expression  is
                     parsed and evaluated according to precedence using the rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence using the rules listed above.

              When the shell is in posix mode, or if the expression is part of the [[ command, the < and > operators sort using the current locale.  If the shell is not in posix mode, the test and [ com‐
              mands sort lexicographically using ASCII ordering.

              The  historical  operator-precedence  parsing with 4 or more arguments can lead to ambiguities when it encounters strings that look like primaries.  The POSIX standard has deprecated the -a
              and -o primaries and enclosing expressions within parentheses.  Scripts should no longer use them.  It's much more reliable to restrict test invocations to a single primary, and to  replace
              uses of -a and -o with the shell's && and || list operators.

       times  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and for processes run from the shell.  The return status is 0.

       trap [-lpP] [[action] sigspec ...]
              The  action  is  a command that is read and executed when the shell receives any of the signals sigspec.  If action is absent (and there is a single sigspec) or -, each specified sigspec is
              reset to the value it had when the shell was started.  If action is the null string the signal specified by each sigspec is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.

              If no arguments are supplied, trap displays the actions associated with each trapped signal as a set of trap commands that can be reused as shell input to restore the current signal  dispo‐
              sitions.  If -p is given, and action is not present, then trap displays the actions associated with each sigspec or, if none are supplied, for all trapped signals, as a set of trap commands
              that  can be reused as shell input to restore the current signal dispositions.  The -P option behaves similarly, but displays only the actions associated with each sigspec argument.  -P re‐
              quires at least one sigspec argument.  The -P or -p options may be used in a subshell environment (e.g., command substitution) and, as long as they are used before trap is used to change  a
              signal's handling, will display the state of its parent's traps.

              The -l option prints a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers.  Each sigspec is either a signal name defined in <signal.h>, or a signal number.  Signal names are case insensi‐
              tive and the SIG prefix is optional.  If -l is supplied with no sigspec arguments, it prints a list of valid signal names.

              If  a  sigspec  is EXIT (0), action is executed on exit from the shell.  If a sigspec is DEBUG, action is executed before every simple command, for command, case command, select command, ((
              arithmetic command, [[ conditional command, arithmetic for command, and before the first command executes in a shell function (see SHELL GRAMMAR above).  Refer to  the  description  of  the
              extdebug  shell  option (see shopt above) for details of its effect on the DEBUG trap.  If a sigspec is RETURN, action is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the .
              or source builtins finishes executing.

              If a sigspec is ERR, action is executed whenever a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the fol‐
              lowing conditions.  The ERR trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately following a while or until reserved word, part of the test in an if statement,
              part of a command executed in a && or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last (subject to the state of the pipefail shell option), or
              if the command's return value is being inverted using !.  These are the same conditions obeyed by the errexit (-e) option.

              When the shell is not interactive, signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset.  Interactive shells permit trapping signals ignored on entry.   Trapped  signals  that
              are not being ignored are reset to their original values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is created.  The return status is false if any sigspec is invalid; otherwise trap re‐
              turns true.

       true   Does nothing, returns a 0 status.

       type [-aftpP] name [name ...]
              Indicate how each name would be interpreted if used as a command name.

              If  the  -t  option is used, type prints a string which is one of alias, keyword, function, builtin, or file if name is an alias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or executable file,
              respectively.  If the name is not found, type prints nothing and returns a non-zero exit status.

              If the -p option is used, type either returns the pathname of the executable file that would be found by searching $PATH for name or nothing if “type -t name” would not return file.  The -P
              option forces a PATH search for each name, even if “type -t name” would not return file.  If name is present in the table of hashed commands, -p and -P print the hashed value, which is  not
              necessarily the file that appears first in PATH.

              If  the  -a option is used, type prints all of the places that contain a command named name.  This includes aliases, reserved words, functions, and builtins, but the path search options (-p
              and -P) can be supplied to restrict the output to executable files.  type does not consult the table of hashed commands when using -a with -p, and only performs a PATH search for name.

              The -f option suppresses shell function lookup, as with the command builtin.  type returns true if all of the arguments are found, false if any are not found.

       ulimit [-HS] -a
       ulimit [-HS] [-bcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPRT [limit]]
              Provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes it starts, on systems that allow such control.

              The -H and -S options specify whether the hard or soft limit is set for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased by a non-root user once it is set; a  soft  limit  may  be  in‐
              creased up to the value of the hard limit.  If neither -H nor -S is specified, ulimit sets both the soft and hard limits.

              The  value  of  limit  can be a number in the unit specified for the resource or one of the special values hard, soft, or unlimited, which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft
              limit, and no limit, respectively.  If limit is omitted, ulimit prints the current value of the soft limit of the resource, unless the -H option is given.  When more than  one  resource  is
              specified, the limit name and unit, if appropriate, are printed before the value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:
              -a     Report all current limits; no limits are set.
              -b     The maximum socket buffer size.
              -c     The maximum size of core files created.
              -d     The maximum size of a process's data segment.
              -e     The maximum scheduling priority (“nice”).
              -f     The maximum size of files written by the shell and its children.
              -i     The maximum number of pending signals.
              -k     The maximum number of kqueues that may be allocated.
              -l     The maximum size that may be locked into memory.
              -m     The maximum resident set size (many systems do not honor this limit).
              -n     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not allow this value to be set).
              -p     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set).
              -q     The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues.
              -r     The maximum real-time scheduling priority.
              -s     The maximum stack size.
              -t     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds.
              -u     The maximum number of processes available to a single user.
              -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell and, on some systems, to its children.
              -x     The maximum number of file locks.
              -P     The maximum number of pseudoterminals.
              -R     The maximum time a real-time process can run before blocking, in microseconds.
              -T     The maximum number of threads.

              If limit is supplied, and the -a option is not used, limit is the new value of the specified resource.  If no option is supplied, then -f is assumed.

              Values  are  in  1024-byte  increments, except for -t, which is in seconds; -R, which is in microseconds; -p, which is in units of 512-byte blocks; -P, -T, -b, -k, -n, and -u, which are un‐
              scaled values; and, when in posix mode, -c and -f, which are in 512-byte increments.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or argument is supplied, or an error occurs while  set‐
              ting a new limit.

       umask [-p] [-S] [mode]
              Set  the user file-creation mask to mode.  If mode begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by
              chmod(1).  If mode is omitted, umask prints the current value of the mask.  The -S option without a mode argument prints the mask in a symbolic format; the default output is an  octal  num‐
              ber.   If  the -p option is supplied, and mode is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as input.  The return status is zero if the mode was successfully changed or if no mode
              argument was supplied, and non-zero otherwise.

       unalias [-a] [name ...]
              Remove each name from the list of defined aliases.  If -a is supplied, remove all alias definitions.  The return value is true unless a supplied name is not a defined alias.

       unset [-fv] [-n] [name ...]
              For each name, remove the corresponding variable or function.  If the -v option is given, each name refers to a shell variable, and that variable is removed.  If -f is specified, each  name
              refers  to  a  shell  function,  and the function definition is removed.  If the -n option is supplied, and name is a variable with the nameref attribute, name will be unset rather than the
              variable it references.  -n has no effect if the -f option is supplied.  Read-only variables and functions may not be unset.  When variables or functions are removed, they are also  removed
              from  the environment passed to subsequent commands.  If no options are supplied, each name refers to a variable; if there is no variable by that name, a function with that name, if any, is
              unset.  Some shell variables may not be unset.  If any of BASH_ALIASES, BASH_ARGV0, BASH_CMDS, BASH_COMMAND, BASH_SUBSHELL, BASHPID, COMP_WORDBREAKS, DIRSTACK, EPOCHREALTIME,  EPOCHSECONDS,
              FUNCNAME,  GROUPS, HISTCMD, LINENO, RANDOM, SECONDS, or SRANDOM are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are subsequently reset.  The exit status is true unless a name is
              readonly or may not be unset.

       wait [-fn] [-p varname] [id ...]
              Wait for each specified child process id and return the termination status of the last id.  Each id may be a process ID pid or a job specification jobspec; if a jobspec  is  supplied,  wait
              waits for all processes in the job.

              If no options or ids are supplied, wait waits for all running background jobs and the last-executed process substitution, if its process id is the same as $!, and the return status is zero.

              If  the  -n option is supplied, wait waits for any one of the given ids or, if no ids are supplied, any job or process substitution, to complete and returns its exit status.  If none of the
              supplied ids is a child of the shell, or if no ids are supplied and the shell has no unwaited-for children, the exit status is 127.

              If the -p option is supplied, wait assigns the process or job identifier of the job for which the exit status is returned to the variable varname named by the option  argument.   The  vari‐
              able, which cannot be readonly, will be unset initially, before any assignment.  This is useful only when used with the -n option.

              Supplying the -f option, when job control is enabled, forces wait to wait for each id to terminate before returning its status, instead of returning when it changes status.

              If  none  of  the  ids specify one of the shell's active child processes, the return status is 127.  If wait is interrupted by a signal, any varname will remain unset, and the return status
              will be greater than 128, as described under SIGNALS above.  Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last id.

SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE
       Bash-4.0 introduced the concept of a shell compatibility level, specified as a set of options to the shopt builtin (compat31, compat32, compat40, compat41, and so on).  There is only  one  current
       compatibility  level  —  each  option  is mutually exclusive.  The compatibility level is intended to allow users to select behavior from previous versions that is incompatible with newer versions
       while they migrate scripts to use current features and behavior.  It's intended to be a temporary solution.

       This section does not mention behavior that is standard for a particular version (e.g., setting compat32 means that quoting the right hand side of the regexp matching operator quotes special  reg‐
       exp characters in the word, which is default behavior in bash-3.2 and subsequent versions).

       If  a user enables, say, compat32, it may affect the behavior of other compatibility levels up to and including the current compatibility level.  The idea is that each compatibility level controls
       behavior that changed in that version of bash, but that behavior may have been present in earlier versions.  For instance, the change to use locale-based comparisons with the [[  command  came  in
       bash-4.1, and earlier versions used ASCII-based comparisons, so enabling compat32 will enable ASCII-based comparisons as well.  That granularity may not be sufficient for all uses, and as a result
       users should employ compatibility levels carefully.  Read the documentation for a particular feature to find out the current behavior.

       Bash-4.3  introduced a new shell variable: BASH_COMPAT.  The value assigned to this variable (a decimal version number like 4.2, or an integer corresponding to the compatNN option, like 42) deter‐
       mines the compatibility level.

       Starting with bash-4.4, bash began deprecating older compatibility levels.  Eventually, the options will be removed in favor of BASH_COMPAT.

       Bash-5.0 was the final version for which there was an individual shopt option for the previous version.  BASH_COMPAT is the only mechanism to control the compatibility level in versions newer than
       bash-5.0.

       The following table describes the behavior changes controlled by each compatibility level setting.  The compatNN tag is used as shorthand for setting the compatibility level to NN using one of the
       following mechanisms.  For versions prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility level may be set using the corresponding compatNN shopt option.  For bash-4.3 and later versions, the BASH_COMPAT  variable
       is preferred, and it is required for bash-5.1 and later versions.

       compat31
              •      Quoting the rhs of the [[ command's regexp matching operator (=~) has no special effect.

       compat32
              •      The < and > operators to the [[ command do not consider the current locale when comparing strings; they use ASCII ordering.

       compat40
              •      The  <  and > operators to the [[ command do not consider the current locale when comparing strings; they use ASCII ordering.  Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation and
                     strcmp(3); bash-4.1 and later use the current locale's collation sequence and strcoll(3).

       compat41
              •      In posix mode, time may be followed by options and still be recognized as a reserved word (this is POSIX interpretation 267).
              •      In posix mode, the parser requires that an even number of single quotes occur in the word portion of a double-quoted parameter expansion and treats them specially, so that characters
                     within the single quotes are considered quoted (this is POSIX interpretation 221).

       compat42
              •      The replacement string in double-quoted pattern substitution does not undergo quote removal, as it does in versions after bash-4.2.
              •      In posix mode, single quotes are considered special when expanding the word portion of a double-quoted parameter expansion and can be used to quote a closing brace or  other  special
                     character (this is part of POSIX interpretation 221); in later versions, single quotes are not special within double-quoted word expansions.

       compat43
              •      Word  expansion  errors  are  considered non-fatal errors that cause the current command to fail, even in posix mode (the default behavior is to make them fatal errors that cause the
                     shell to exit).
              •      When executing a shell function, the loop state (while/until/etc.)  is not reset, so break or continue in that function will break or continue loops in the calling context.  Bash-4.4
                     and later reset the loop state to prevent this.

       compat44
              •      The shell sets up the values used by BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC so they can expand to the shell's positional parameters even if extended debugging mode is not enabled.
              •      A subshell inherits loops from its parent context, so break or continue will cause the subshell to exit.  Bash-5.0 and later reset the loop state to prevent the exit
              •      Variable assignments preceding builtins like export and readonly that set attributes continue to affect variables with the same name in the calling environment even if the  shell  is
                     not in posix mode.

       compat50
              •      Bash-5.1  changed  the way $RANDOM is generated to introduce slightly more randomness.  If the shell compatibility level is set to 50 or lower, it reverts to the method from bash-5.0
                     and previous versions, so seeding the random number generator by assigning a value to RANDOM will produce the same sequence as in bash-5.0.
              •      If the command hash table is empty, bash versions prior to bash-5.1 printed an informational message to that effect, even when producing output that can be reused as input.  Bash-5.1
                     suppresses that message when the -l option is supplied.

       compat51
              •      The unset builtin treats attempts to unset array subscripts @ and * differently depending on whether the array is indexed or associative, and differently than in previous versions.
              •      Arithmetic commands ( ((...)) ) and the expressions in an arithmetic for statement can be expanded more than once.
              •      Expressions used as arguments to arithmetic operators in the [[ conditional command can be expanded more than once.
              •      The expressions in substring parameter brace expansion can be expanded more than once.
              •      The expressions in the $((...)) word expansion can be expanded more than once.
              •      Arithmetic expressions used as indexed array subscripts can be expanded more than once.
              •      test -v, when given an argument of A[@], where A is an existing associative array, will return true if the array has any set elements.  Bash-5.2 will look for and  report  on  a  key
                     named @.
              •      The  ${parameter[:]=value}  word  expansion will return value, before any variable-specific transformations have been performed (e.g., converting to lowercase).  Bash-5.2 will return
                     the final value assigned to the variable.
              •      Parsing command substitutions will behave as if extended globbing (see the description of the shopt builtin above) is enabled, so that parsing a command  substitution  containing  an
                     extglob  pattern (say, as part of a shell function) will not fail.  This assumes the intent is to enable extglob before the command is executed and word expansions are performed.  It
                     will fail at word expansion time if extglob hasn't been enabled by the time the command is executed.

       compat52
              •      The test builtin uses its historical algorithm to parse parenthesized subexpressions when given five or more arguments.
              •      If the -p or -P option is supplied to the bind builtin, bind treats any arguments remaining after option processing as bindable command names, and displays any key sequences bound to
                     those commands, instead of treating the arguments as key sequences to bind.

RESTRICTED SHELL
       If bash is started with the name rbash, or the -r option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes restricted.  A restricted shell is used to set up an  environment  more  controlled  than  the
       standard shell.  It behaves identically to bash with the exception that the following are disallowed or not performed:

       •      Changing directories with cd.

       •      Setting or unsetting the values of SHELL, PATH, HISTFILE, ENV, or BASH_ENV.

       •      Specifying command names containing /.

       •      Specifying a filename containing a / as an argument to the .  builtin command.

       •      Using the -p option to the .  builtin command to specify a search path.

       •      Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to the history builtin command.

       •      Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to the -p option to the hash builtin command.

       •      Importing function definitions from the shell environment at startup.

       •      Parsing the values of BASHOPTS and SHELLOPTS from the shell environment at startup.

       •      Redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >> redirection operators.

       •      Using the exec builtin command to replace the shell with another command.

       •      Adding or deleting builtin commands with the -f and -d options to the enable builtin command.

       •      Using the enable builtin command to enable disabled shell builtins.

       •      Specifying the -p option to the command builtin command.

       •      Turning off restricted mode with set +r or shopt -u restricted_shell.

       These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.

       When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see COMMAND EXECUTION above), rbash turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.

BUG REPORTS
       If  you  find a bug in bash, you should report it.  But first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of bash.  The latest version is always avail‐
       able from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/ and http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/snapshot/bash-master.tar.gz.

       Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the bashbug command to submit a bug report.  If you have a fix, you are encouraged to mail that as well!   You  may  send  suggestions  and
       “philosophical” bug reports to bug-bash@gnu.org or post them to the Usenet newsgroup gnu.bash.bug.

       ALL bug reports should include:

       The version number of bash
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used to compile
       A description of the bug behavior
       A short script or “recipe” which exercises the bug

       bashbug inserts the first three items automatically into the template it provides for filing a bug report.

       Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to chet.ramey@case.edu.

BUGS
       It's too big and too slow.

       There are some subtle differences between bash and traditional versions of sh, mostly because of the POSIX specification.

       Aliases are confusing in some uses.

       Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.

       Compound  commands  and  command lists of the form “a ; b ; c” are not handled gracefully when combined with process suspension.  When a process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next
       command in the list or breaks out of any existing loops.  It suffices to enclose the command in parentheses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit, or to start the command  in
       the background and immediately bring it into the foreground.

       Array variables may not (yet) be exported.

GNU Bash 5.3                                                                                    2025 April 7                                                                                        BASH(1)
