NAME
       dbfdump - dumps the content of a xBase file to the terminal

       ##SYNOPSIS dbfdump [-h] [-r] [-m] xbase_file

       ##DESCRIPTION  Dumps  the contents of xbase_file to standard output. The first line contains the field names appearing in xbase_file, and each of the following lines contains the field values of a
       record. Field names and values are padded by spaces to their field widths. Empty fields are printed as the string "(NULL)".

       ##OPTIONS

       -h     output header info (field descriptions).

              Prints the column field definitions before other output. Each field definition consists of a line of the form

              Field: index, Type=type, Title=`name', Width=width, Decimals=precision

              where index is the zero offset column number of the field; the type indicates the datatype of the field value and is either "Integer", "Real" or "String"; name is the field's name; width is
              the number of bytes reserved for the field's value; and precision is the number of decimal places of precision for "Real" type fields, and is zero for "Integer" and "String" type fields.

       -r     output raw field info, numeric values not reformatted.

              Prints the exact bytes occurring in xbase_file for field values and suppresses printing "(NULL)" for empty values.

       -m     output one line per field.

              Prints each record in multiline format separated by empty lines. The first line of a record gives the number of the record in the form

              Records: record_index

              where record_index is the zero offset number of the record in the file, and then each field of the record appears on its own line in the format

              name: value

       xbase_file
              the name of an existing xBase file.

       ##EXAMPLE dbfdump -h testbase.dbf

       assuming that testbase.dbf has 1 record (inserted by other example using dbfadd), this command line will produce the following output:

           Field 0: Type=String, Title='NAME', Width=20, Decimals=0
           Field 1: Type=Double, Title='AREA', Width=9, Decimals=3
           Field 2: Type=Double, Title='VALUE', Width=9, Decimals=2
           NAME AREA VALUE REGION1 25.656 150.22

       ##EXIT STATUS

       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Missing xbase_file argument.

       2      Failed to open xbase_file.

       3      There are no fields in xbase_file.

       ##DIAGNOSTICS The following diagnostics may be issued on stdout:

       DBFOpen(xbase_file,"r") failed.

       There are no fields in this table!

       ##BUGS Unless the -r option is given, values in numeric fields that overflow the int or double types of the C language are printed as plus or minus a huge number. For integer fields the huge value
       is HUGE_VALL from
