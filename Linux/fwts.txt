NAME
       fwts-collect - collect logs for fwts bug reporting.

SYNOPSIS
       fwts-collect [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the fwts-collect firmware test suite log collecting tool.  The tool fwts-collect collects logs and various system and firmware dumps into the gzip'd tar
       ball fwts-logs.tar.gz which can then be added to bug reports.  It collects data from /proc/iomem, /proc/mtrr, /proc/interrupts, IRQ counts from /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts and kernel  logs.
       It also invokes fwts and gathers ACPI tables, memorymaps, MultiProcessor table dumps, CMOS data, UEFI variables, kernel version and ACPI version information.  fwts using sudo is required.
       Running fwts with no options will collect logs automatically. However, one can also specify the names of addition files to be added to the gzip'd tar ball.

EXAMPLES
       Gather up logs into fwts-logs.tar.gz
               sudo fwts-collect

       Gather up logs and also /var/log/pm-powersave.log
               sudo fwts-collect /var/log/pm-powersave.log
