NAME
       pmemkv-python - pmemkv-python 1.0

PMEMKV PACKAGE
       Python bindings for pmemkv

       pmemkv is a local/embedded key-value datastore optimized for persistent memory.  For more information, see https://pmem.io/pmemkv.

   Submodules
   pmemkv.pmemkv module
       Python bindings for pmemkv.

       class pmemkv.pmemkv.Database(engine, config)
              Bases: object

              Main Python pmemkv class, it provides functions to operate on data in database.

              This  class  can  be  used  dict-like,  i.a. accessing and assigning data using ‘[]’.  If an error/exception is thrown from any method it will contain
              pmemkv’s     status     and     error     message.     Currently     returned     statuses     are      described      in      libpmemkv      manpage:
              https://pmem.io/pmemkv/master/manpages/libpmemkv.3.html#errors

              Possible exceptions to be thrown in Python binding are as follows: - Error, - UnknownError, - NotSupported, - InvalidArgument, - ConfigParsingError, -
              ConfigTypeError, - StoppedByCallback, - WrongEngineName, - TransactionScopeError.

              __init__(engine, config)
