NAME
       mp3report - Neon Goat MP3 Report Generator

DESCRIPTION
        A customizable program to scan a list of (sub)directories, creating a report
        from an HTML template. Also calculates various statistics and each song's
        playing time. Supports ID3 and ID3v2 tags. Should work on any perl-ized OS;
        see homepage for demo - http://mp3report.sourceforge.net

CONFIGURING
        All options can be configured through the command line, see mp3report --help
        for more info. You may also want to modify the hard coded defaults at the
        top of the program file.

        See documentation.html for information on customizing your own template file.

USAGE
        Usage: mp3report [options] [directory...]
         --help                 shows this help screen
         --printmode            uses a smaller font for printing
         --title=TITLE          sets the title used in the report
         --outfile=OUTFILE      file to write report to, '-' for STDOUT
         --template=FILE        file to use as report template
         --stdgenres            use standard genres instead of winamp genres
         --id3v2                enable id3v2 support (experimental)
         directory...           dirs to scan (subdirs included)

INSTALLATION
        You should be able to run mp3report directly after decompressing it:

        tar xfzv mp3report-1.0.2.tar.gz
        cd mp3report-1.0.2
        ./mp3report.pl --help

        If your perl interpreter isn't in /usr/bin/perl, you'll need to change the first line
        of mp3report.pl

        If you'd like to install the MP3::Info perl module so that other programs can
        use it, it is available at http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=MP3-Info.

CUSTOMIZATION AND TEMPLATES
       By creating your own HTML file or modifying one of the provided templates, you can customize the output of MP3 Report Generator. These are the various identifiers that MP3 Report Generator can
       look for in a report:

   General Information
       $t_fontsize
           This is either 1 or 2, depending on the "--printmode" flag. If printing mode is on, the idea is that the font size should be a little bit smaller so that it looks better on paper. To make sure
           this field does something, use "<FONT SIZE="$t_fontsize""> in your HTML code.

       $t_title
           Used for the HTML "<TITLE"> tag as well as the first line of the report, and is set by specifying "--title=SOMETHING" on the command line.

       $t_datetime
           The local date and time when the report was generated.

       $t_dirs
           The list of parent directories that was scanned in the report. Each directory is separated by "<BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;" so that they are on separate lines and indented.

       $t_numdirs
           The total number of directories and subdirectories scanned in the report.

       $t_numfiles
           The total number of MP3 files included in the report.

       $t_size
           The total size of all MP3 files included in the report combined. This is formatted into "x.xx GB (y.yy MB)".

       $t_playtime
           The total playing time of all songs combined. This is formatted into an English sentence (4 days, 3 hours, 2 minutes, 1 second).

       $t_exectime
           The total time it took to generate the report. This is formatted into an English sentence (4 days, 3 hours, 2 minutes, 1 second).

       $t_avgsize
           The average size of the MP3s in this report. This is formatted into "x.xx MB".

       $t_avgplaytime
           The average playing time of a single song in the report. This is formatted into an English sentence (3 hours, 2 minutes, 1 second).

   Report Settings
       $t_filename
           The filename that the report is being written to.

       $t_template_filename
           The filename of the template that is being used.

       $t_printmode
           Either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether the "--printmode" flag was specified.

       $t_customdirs
           Either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether user specified custom directories to scan on the command line.

       $t_genretype
           Either "Standard" or "WinAMP" depending on whether or not the user specified "--stdgenres".

       $t_id3v2
           Either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether the "--id3v2" flag was specified.

   Item Information
       $item_dir
           The current directory that is being scanned.

       $item_num
           The current sequential number of the item found.

       $item_filename
           The filename of the item found. NOTE: This in versions older than 1.0.2, this variable was called $item_name.

       $item_size
           The size of the item found. This is formatted into "x.xx MB".

       $item_bgcolor
           This  will either be "#FFFFFF" or "#EEEEEE" (white or light gray) depending on whether or not the current item number is even or odd. This is used to make the cell color in tables alternate to
           make the report easier to read. In order for this to work, your HTML code must look something like "<TD BGCOLOR="$item_bgcolor">""...</TD>".

       $item_len
           The playing time of the song found, formatted into "XX:YY" (minutes:seconds).
