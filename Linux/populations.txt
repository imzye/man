NAME
       populations - population genetic software

SYNOPSIS

       populations

       populations [name_of_input_file] [option]

       You can use populations as a command line program (very useful for batch treatment) to infer phylogenetic trees.

DESCRIPTION
       populations is a population genetic software. It computes genetic distances between populations or individuals. It builds phylogenetic trees (NJ or UPGMA) with bootstrap values.

FEATURES
       •   haploids, diploids or polyploids genotypes (see input formats)

       •   structured populations (see input files structured populations

       •   No limit of populations, loci, alleles per loci (see input formats)

       •   Distances between individuals (15 different methods)

       •   Distances between populations (15 methods)

       •   Bootstraps on loci OR individuals

       •   Phylogenetic trees (individuals or populations), using Neighbor Joining or UPGMA (PHYLIP tree format)

       •   Allelic diversity

       •   Converts data files from Genepop to different formats (Genepop, Genetix, Msat, Populations...)

OPTIONS
       -phylogeny ind|pop
           (default) for phylogenetic trees based on individuals or populations

       dist method
           (default: Nei standard, Ds) you can choose among: DAS, Dm, Ds, Dc, Da, dmu2, Fst, Cp, Dr, ASD, Dsw, Dr, Dru, Drw, Drl. see distances for details.

       -construct method
           (default: upgma) possibilities upgma or nj (Neighbor Joining)

       -bootstrap_ind n
           number to indicate the number of bootstraps to perform on individuals

       -bootstrap_locus n

           number to indicate the number of bootstraps to perform on loci
                 .RE

           -output name_of_treeview_file
               to indicate the name of the tree file (phylip tree format)

           -level n
               structured populations number, allows choosing the structuration factor (in the example: town level is 1, building level is 2...).

EXAMPLE
       populations toutc2.txt -phylogeny pop -dist Dm -bootstrap_locus 10000 -output toutc2_10000_Dm.tre

       Commands can be write in a .bat file (for DOS) or a script file (for UNIX)
