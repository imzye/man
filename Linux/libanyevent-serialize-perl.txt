NAME
       AnyEvent::Serialize - async serialize/deserialize function

SYNOPSIS
         use AnyEvent::Serialize ':all';
         use AnyEvent::Serialize 'serialize';
         use AnyEvent::Serialize 'deserialize';
         use AnyEvent::Serialize ... block_size => 666;

         serialize $object, sub { ($str, $recursion_detected) = @_ };
         deserialize $string, sub { my ($object, $error, $tail) = @_ }

DESCRIPTION
       Sometimes You need to serialize/deserialize a lot of data. If You do it using Data::Dumper or eval it can take You too much time.  This module splits (de)serialization process into fixed-size
       parts and does this work in non-blocking mode.

       This module uses Data::StreamSerializer and Data::StreamDeserializer to serialize or deserialize Your data.

EXPORT
   serialize($object, $result_callback)
       Serializes Your object. When serialization is done it will call $result_callback. This callback receives two arguments:

       result string
       flag if recursion is detected

   deserialize($str, $result_callback)
       Deserializes Your string. When deserialization is done or an error is detected it will call $result_callback. This callback receives three arguments:

       deserialized object
       error string (if an error was occured)
       undeserialized string tail

BREAKING
       You can break serialization/deserialization process if You save value that is returned by functions serialize/deserialize. They return guards if they are called in non-void context.

SEE ALSO
       Data::StreamSerializer, Data::StreamDeserializer.
