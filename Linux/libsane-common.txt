NAME
       sane - Scanner Access Now Easy: API for accessing scanners

DESCRIPTION
       SANE is an application programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster image scanner hardware. The standardized interface makes it possible to write just one driver for
       each scanner device instead of one driver for each scanner and application.

       While SANE is primarily targeted at a UNIX environment, the standard has been carefully designed to make it possible to implement the API on virtually any hardware or operating system.

       This manual page provides a summary of the information available about SANE.

       If you have trouble getting your scanner detected, read the PROBLEMS section.

TERMINOLOGY
       An  application  that uses the SANE interface is called a SANE frontend.  A driver that implements the SANE interface is called a SANE backend.  A meta backend provides some means to manage one or
       more other backends.

SOFTWARE PACKAGES
       The package sane-backends contains backends, documentation, networking support, and the command line frontend scanimage(1).  The frontends xscanimage(1), xcam(1), and scanadf(1)  are  included  in
       the  package  sane-frontends.   Both packages can be downloaded from the SANE homepage (http://www.sane-project.org/).  Information about other frontends and backends can also be found on the SANE
       homepage.

GENERAL INFORMATION
       The following sections provide short descriptions and links to more information about several aspects of SANE.  A name with a number in parenthesis (e.g.  sane-dll(5)) points to a manual page.  In
       this  case  man 5 sane-dll  will display the page. Entries like /usr/share/doc/libsane/README are references to text files that were copied to the SANE documentation directory (/usr/share/doc/lib‐
       sane/) during installation. Everything else is a URL to a resource on the web.

       SANE homepage
         Information on all aspects of SANE including a tutorial and a link to the SANE FAQ can be found on the SANE homepage: http://www.sane-project.org/.

       SANE device lists
         The SANE device lists contain information about the status of SANE support for a specific device. If your scanner is not listed there (either supported or unsupported), please  contact  us.  See
         section  HOW CAN YOU HELP SANE for details. There are lists for specific releases of SANE, for the current development version and a search engine: http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-de‐
         vices.html.  The lists are also installed on your system at /usr/share/doc/libsane/.

       SANE mailing list
         There is a mailing list for the purpose of discussing the SANE standard and its implementations: sane-devel.  Despite its name, the list is not only intended for developers, but also for  users.
         There are also some more lists for special topics. However, for users, sane-devel is the right list. How to subscribe and unsubscribe: http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html.

       SANE IRC channel
         The  IRC  (Internet  Relay Chat) channel #sane can be found on the Freenode network (irc.libera.chat). It's for discussing SANE problems, talking about development and general SANE related chat‐
         ting. Before asking for help, please read the other documentation mentioned in this manual page. The channel's topic is also used for announcements of problems with SANE infrastructure  (mailing
         lists, web server, etc.).

       Compiling and installing SANE
         Look at /usr/share/doc/libsane/README and the os-dependent README files for information about compiling and installing SANE.

MISCELLANEOUS BACKENDS
       dll
         Implements a SANE backend that provides access to an arbitrary number of other SANE backends by dynamic loading. See sane-dll(5).

       net
         The SANE network daemon saned(8) provides access to scanners located on different computers in connection with the sane-net(5) backend. See saned(8).

       pnm
         PNM image reader pseudo-backend. The purpose of this backend is primarily to aid in debugging of SANE frontends. See sane-pnm(5).

       pint
         Supports  scanners that use the PINT (Pint Is Not Twain) device driver.  The PINT driver is being actively developed on the OpenBSD platform, and has been ported to a few other *NIX-like operat‐
         ing systems. See sane-pint(5).

       test
         Tests frontends and the SANE installation.  It provides test pictures and various test options. See sane-test(5).

       v4l
         Provides generic access to video cameras and similar equipment using the V4L (Video for Linux) API. See sane-v4l(5).

       Also, have a look at the backend information page at http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html and the list of projects in /usr/share/doc/libsane/PROJECTS.

CHANGING THE TOP-LEVEL BACKEND
       By default, all SANE backends (drivers) are loaded dynamically by the sane-dll meta backend. If you have any questions about the dynamic loading, read sane-dll(5).   SANE  frontends  can  also  be
       linked to other backends directly by copying or linking a backend to libsane.so in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane.

DEVELOPER'S DOCUMENTATION
       It's  not  hard  to  write  a SANE backend. It can take some time, however. You should have basic knowledge of C and enough patience to work through the documentation and find out how your scanner
       works. Appended is a list of some documents that help to write backends and frontends.

       The SANE standard defines the application programming interface (API) that is used to communicate between frontends and backends. It can be found at http://sane-project.gitlab.io/standard/ .

       There  is  some  more  information  for  programmers  in  /usr/share/doc/libsane/backend-writing.txt.   Most   of   the   internal   SANE   routines   (sanei)   are   documented   using   doxygen:
       http://www.sane-project.org/sanei/.   Before a new backend or frontend project is started, have a look at /usr/share/doc/libsane/PROJECTS for projects that are planned or not yet included into the
       SANE distribution and at our bug-tracking system: http://www.http://www.sane-project.org/bugs.html.

       There are some links on how to find out about the protocol of a scanner: http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/misc/develop.html.

       If you start writing a backend or frontend or any other part of SANE, please contact the sane-devel mailing list for coordination so that work is not duplicated.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/*.conf
              The backend configuration files.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-*.a
              The static libraries implementing the backends.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-*.so
              The shared libraries implementing the backends (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

       /usr/share/doc/libsane/*
              SANE documentation: The READMEs, text files for backends etc.

PROBLEMS
       If your device isn't found but you know that it is supported, make sure that it is detected by your operating system. For SCSI and USB scanners, use the sane-find-scanner(1)  utility.   It  prints
       one  line  for each scanner it has detected and some comments (#).  If sane-find-scanner(1) finds your scanner only as root but not as normal user, the permissions for the device files are not ad‐
       justed correctly. If the scanner isn't found at all, the operating system hasn't detected it and may need some help. Depending on the type of your scanner, read sane-usb(5)  or  sane-scsi(5).   If
       your scanner (or other device) is not connected over the SCSI bus or USB, read the backend's manual page for details on how to set it up.

       Is  your  scanner detected by the operating system but not by SANE?  Try scanimage -L.  If the scanner is not found, check that the backend's name is mentioned in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.  Some back‐
       ends are commented out by default. Remove the comment sign for your backend in this case. Also some backends aren't compiled at all if one of their  prerequisites  are  missing.  Examples  include
       dc210,  dc240,  canon_pp, hpsj5s, gphoto2, pint, qcam, v4l, net, sm3600, snapscan, pnm. If you need one of these backends and it isn't available, read the build instructions in the README file and
       the individual manual pages of the backends.

       Another reason for not being detected by scanimage -L may be a missing or incorrect configuration in the backend's configuration file. While SANE tries to automatically find  most  scanners,  some
       can't be setup correctly without the intervention of the administrator. Also on some operating systems auto-detection may not work. Check the backend's manual page for details.

       If your scanner is still not found, try setting the various environment variables that are available to assist in debugging.  The environment variables are documented in the relevant manual pages.
       For  example,  to  get the maximum amount of debug information when testing a Mustek SCSI scanner, set environment variables SANE_DEBUG_DLL, SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK, and SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 and
       then invoke scanimage -L.  The SANE_DEBUG_DLL messages tell if the sane-mustek(5) backend was found and loaded at all. The SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK messages explain what the backend is  doing  while  the
       SANE_DEBUG_SCSI  debugging  shows the low level handling. If you can't find out what's going on by checking the messages carefully, contact the sane-devel mailing list for help (see REPORTING BUGS
       below).

       Now that your scanner is found by scanimage -L, try to do a scan: scanimage >image.pnm.  This command starts a scan for the default scanner with default settings. All  the  available  options  are
       listed  by  running  scanimage --help.   If scanning aborts with an error message, turn on debugging as mentioned above. Maybe the configuration file needs some tuning, e.g. to setup the path to a
       firmware that is needed by some scanners. See the backend's manual page for details. If you can't find out what's wrong, contact sane-devel.

       To check that the SANE libraries are installed correctly you can use the test backend, even if you don't have a scanner or other SANE device:

              scanimage -d test -T

       You should get a list of PASSed tests. You can do the same with your backend by changing "test" to your backend's name.

       So now scanning with scanimage (1) works and you want to use one of the graphical frontends like xsane(1), xscanimage(1), or quiteinsane(1) but those frontends don't detect your scanner? One  rea‐
       son  may  be  that  you installed two versions of SANE.  E.g. the version that was installed by your distribution in /usr and one you installed from source in /usr/local/.  Make sure that only one
       version is installed. Another possible reason is, that your system's dynamic loader can't find the SANE libraries. For Linux, make sure that /etc/ld.so.conf contains /usr/local/lib  and  does  not
       contain /usr/local/lib/sane.  See also the documentation of the frontends.

HOW CAN YOU HELP SANE
       We appreciate any help we can get. Please have a look at our web page about contributing to SANE: http://www.sane-project.org/contrib.html

CONTACT
       For  reporting  bugs  or  requesting new features, please use our bug-tracking system: http://www.sane-project.org/bugs.html.  You can also contact the author of your backend directly. Usually the
       email address can be found in the /usr/share/doc/libsane/AUTHORS file  or  the  backend's  manpage.  For  general  discussion  about  SANE,  please  use  the  SANE  mailing  list  sane-devel  (see
       http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for details).

AUTHOR
       David Mosberger-Tang and many many more (see /usr/share/doc/libsane/AUTHORS for details).  This man page was written by Henning Meier-Geinitz. Quite a lot of text was taken from the SANE standard,
       several man pages, and README files.
