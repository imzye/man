NAME
       mungekey - MUNGE key management utility

SYNOPSIS
       mungekey [-c] [-b bits] [-f] [-k keyfile] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       The mungekey executable is the key management utility for MUNGE.  It should be run by the same user that starts the munged daemon.

       If no options are specified, mungekey will attempt to create a new key using the default settings; this will fail if the keyfile already exists.

       All munged daemons within a security realm must use the same key.  In other words, all hosts within an administrative group (or cluster) using MUNGE for authentication must use the same key; this key‐
       file can be created on one host and then securely copied to all other hosts.

OPTIONS
       -b, --bits integer
              Specify the number of bits in the key being created [256-8192].

       -c, --create
              Create a new keyfile.

       -f, --force
              Force the keyfile to be overwritten if it already exists.

       -h, --help
              Display a summary of the command-line options.

       -k, --keyfile path
              Specify the keyfile pathname.

       -L, --license
              Display license information.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

FILES
       /etc/munge/munge.key
              Contains the shared cryptographic key for hosts within the security realm.
