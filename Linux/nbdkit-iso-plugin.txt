NAME
       nbdkit-iso-plugin - create virtual ISO (CD-ROM) from directory

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit iso [dir=]DIRECTORY [[dir=]DIRECTORY ...]
                   [prog=mkisofs] [params='-JrT']

DESCRIPTION
       "nbdkit-iso-plugin" is a plugin for nbdkit(1) which creates a virtual ISO (CD-ROM) image from a directory on the fly.  The files from DIRECTORY are added to a virtual ISO image which is served read-
       only over the NBD protocol.

       This plugin uses xorriso(1), genisoimage(1) or mkisofs(1) to create the ISO content.

       To create a FAT-formatted virtual floppy disk instead of a CD, see nbdkit-floppy-plugin(1).  To create a Linux compatible virtual disk, see nbdkit-linuxdisk-plugin(1).

EXAMPLE
       Create a virtual ISO which supports Joliet, Rock Ridge and TRANS.TBL extensions, from files in a directory:

        nbdkit iso /path/to/directory params='-JrT'

       "params" adds -JrT to the xorriso(1), genisoimage(1) or mkisofs(1) command line, specifying the required extensions.  Note that unless you use at least one of these extensions, filenames inside the
       ISO will be truncated because of limitations of the basic ISO 9660 format.

PARAMETERS
       [dir=]DIRECTORY
           Specify the directory containing files and subdirectories which will be added to the virtual ISO.  Files inside this directory will appear in the root directory of the ISO.

           This parameter is required and may be specified one or more times.  If multiple directories are specified, they are merged together.

           "dir=" is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.  See "Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).

       params='parameters ...'
           Any other parameters may be passed through to xorriso(1), genisoimage(1) or mkisofs(1) by specifying this option.

           For example:

            params='-JrT -V "My Disk Image"'

           would specify Joliet (-J), Rock Ridge (-r) and TRANS.TBL (-T) extensions, and specify the volume ID (-V) as "My Disk Image".

           Take care when quoting this parameter; nbdkit passes the resulting string through another layer of shell interpretation without any sanity checks for unquoted shell metacharacters.

       prog=mkisofs
           Choose which program to use to create the ISO content.  The default is xorriso(1), genisoimage(1) or mkisofs(1) and is picked when nbdkit is compiled.  You only need to use this parameter if you
           want to override it at run time.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       "PATH"
           xorriso(1), genisoimage(1), mkisofs(1) or whatever you supply to the optional "prog" parameter must be available on the $PATH.

       "TMPDIR"
           A temporary copy of the ISO is created in "TMPDIR".  If this environment variable is not set then /var/tmp is used instead.  There must be enough free space here to store the ISO, which might be
           quite large.

FILES
       $plugindir/nbdkit-iso-plugin.so
           The plugin.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $plugindir.

VERSION
       "nbdkit-iso-plugin" first appeared in nbdkit 1.8.
