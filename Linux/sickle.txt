NAME
       sickle - windowed adaptive trimming tool for FASTQ files using quality

SYNOPSIS
       sickle <command> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ## Usage

       Sickle has two modes to work with both paired-end and single-end reads: `sickle se` and `sickle pe`.

       Running sickle by itself will print the help:

           sickle

       Running sickle with either the "se" or "pe" commands will give help specific to those commands:

           sickle se
           sickle pe

       ### Sickle Single End (`sickle se`)

       `sickle  se`  takes  an input fastq file and outputs a trimmed version of that file.  It also has options to change the length and quality thresholds for trimming, as well as disabling 5'-trimming
       and enabling truncation of sequences with Ns.

       #### Examples

           sickle se -f input_file.fastq -t illumina -o trimmed_output_file.fastq
           sickle se -f input_file.fastq -t illumina -o trimmed_output_file.fastq -q 33 -l 40
           sickle se -f input_file.fastq -t illumina -o trimmed_output_file.fastq -x -n
           sickle se -t sanger -g -f input_file.fastq -o trimmed_output_file.fastq.gz
           sickle se --fastq-file input_file.fastq --qual-type sanger --output-file trimmed_output_file.fastq

       ### Sickle Paired End (`sickle pe`)

       `sickle pe` can operate with two types of input.  First, it can take two paired-end files as input and outputs two trimmed paired-end files as well as a "singles" file.   The  second  form  starts
       with  a  single  combined input file of reads where you have already interleaved the reads from the sequencer.  In this form, you also supply a single output file name as well as a "singles" file.
       The "singles" file contains reads that passed filter in either the forward or reverse direction, but not the other.  Finally, there is an option (-M) to only produce one  interleaved  output  file
       where any reads that did not pass filter will be output as a FastQ record with a single "N" (whose quality value is the lowest possible based upon the quality type), thus preserving the paired na‐
       ture of the data.  You can also change the length and quality thresholds for trimming, as well as disable 5'-trimming and enable truncation of sequences with Ns.

       #### Examples

           sickle pe -f input_file1.fastq -r input_file2.fastq -t sanger     -o trimmed_output_file1.fastq -p trimmed_output_file2.fastq     -s trimmed_singles_file.fastq

           sickle pe -f input_file1.fastq -r input_file2.fastq -t sanger     -o trimmed_output_file1.fastq -p trimmed_output_file2.fastq     -s trimmed_singles_file.fastq -q 12 -l 15

           sickle pe -f input_file1.fastq -r input_file2.fastq -t sanger     -o trimmed_output_file1.fastq -p trimmed_output_file2.fastq     -s trimmed_singles_file.fastq -n

           sickle pe -c combo.fastq -t sanger -m combo_trimmed.fastq     -s trimmed_singles_file.fastq -n

           sickle pe -t sanger -g -f input_file1.fastq -r input_file2.fastq     -o trimmed_output_file1.fastq.gz -p trimmed_output_file2.fastq.gz     -s trimmed_singles_file.fastq.gz

           sickle pe -c combo.fastq -t sanger -M combo_trimmed_all.fastq

           sickle  pe  --pe-file1 input_file1.fastq --pe-file2 input_file2.fastq --qual-type sanger     --output-pe1 trimmed_output_file1.fastq --output-pe2 trimmed_output_file2.fastq     --output-single
       trimmed_singles_file.fastq
