NAME
       multi-push - push a source tree to multiple source repositories

SYNOPSIS
       multi-push $@

       multi-push-init

DESCRIPTION
       multi-push is a script that will first push a bzr(1) source tree up to Launchpad.net, then export that tree to git(1), and push that tree up to Github.com.

       It is often useful to have a backup copy of your source tree, and it enables wider sharing of your source code across other development communities.

CAVEATS
       Currently, the bzr(1) on Launchpad.net is assumed to be the master and the git(1) tree on Github.com is assumed to be the slave.

SEE ALSO
       bzr(1), git(1)
