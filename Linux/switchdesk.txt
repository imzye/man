NAME
       switchdesk - graphical and text mode interface for choosing desktop environment

SYNOPSIS
       switchdesk [desktop name]

DESCRIPTION
       switchdesk provides a simple method of choosing between the various desktop environments available under Red Hat Linux, including GNOME, KDE, and FVWM2.  If X Windows is running, switchdesk will bring
       up a dialog box which allows the user to choose between the available desktops installed on the system.  This dialog follows the appearance of the user's current desktop as closely as possible.  If  a
       desktop name (KDE, GNOME, XFce4, FVWM, WINDOWMAKER) is supplied as an argument, or X is not running, switchdesk can be used from the command line.

RETURN CODES
       switchdesk returns 0 on success, 1 on error.

FILES
       ~/.Xclients, ~/.Xclients-default
                           Stores the currently selected desktop.
