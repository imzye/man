NAME
       resalloc-openstack-new - atomically allocate VM with additional resources in openstack

SYNOPSIS
       resalloc-openstack-new  [-h]  [--name  NAME]  --image  IMAGE  [--floating-ip-from  FLOATING_IP_NETWORK]  --flavor  FLAVOR  [--alloc-volume VOLUMES] [--post-command COMMAND] [--print-ip] [--key-pair-id
       KEY_PAIR_ID] [--nic NICS]

DESCRIPTION
       Start a new VM in openstack, with some dependant resources (swap volumes or
       floating IPs ATM). The important thing is that the script aims to behave as
       atomically as possible, in a sense that either everything is allocated as
       requested, or the script fails (without any leftovers).

OPTIONS
       --name NAME
              Choose the name for the resulting VM

       --image IMAGE

       --floating-ip-from FLOATING_IP_NETWORK
              allocate floating ip from network, check 'neutron net-list'

       --flavor FLAVOR
              openstack flavor, see 'nova flavor-list'

       --alloc-volume VOLUMES
              allocate volumes by cinder

       --post-command COMMAND
              run COMMAND after VM is started, and fail if the script fails too. The
              variables RESALLOC_OS_NAME and RESALLOC_OS_IP are exported into environment of
              those scripts.

       --print-ip
              after successful allocation, print IP on standard output

       --key-pair-id KEY_PAIR_ID
              use specific key, see ids (== names) in `nova keypair-list`

       --nic NICS
              comma-separated, key=value,foo=baz arguments (see
              nova.servers.create(nics=...) help
