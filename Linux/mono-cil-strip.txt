NAME
       Mono CIL strip

SYNOPSIS
       mono-cil-strip [options] assembly [output-assembly]

       already  been compiled using Mono's Ahead Of Time compiler (AOT), where
       the CIL code is no longer necessary, but the metadata still is.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -q     Only output errors.
