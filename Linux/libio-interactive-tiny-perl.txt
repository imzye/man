NAME
       IO::Interactive::Tiny - is_interactive() without large deps

VERSION
       This document describes IO::Interactive::Tiny version 0.2

SYNOPSIS
           use IO::Interactive::Tiny;

           if ( IO::Interactive::Tiny::is_interactive() ) {
               print "I probably want text output.";
           }
           else {
               print "I probably want HTML output.";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Provides the useful subset of IO::InteractiveXs functionality in the form of only having is_interactive().

       Also gains ::Tiny-ness by not using version, Carp, or Scalar::Util

INTERFACE
       Nothing in exported or exportable, that helps keep it '::Tiny'.

   IO::Interactive::Tiny::is_interactive()
       Same functionality as "is_interactive()" in IO::Interactive:.

DIAGNOSTICS
       IO::Interactive::Tiny throws no warnings or errors of its own.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

DEPENDENCIES
       None.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       No bugs have been reported.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-io-interactive-tiny@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org>.

About the '::Tiny' status
       All info below is relative to IO::Interactive (v0.0.6).

       See Acme::Tiny for information on the ::Tiny suffix.

       #3 is really really close:

           [ -- RSS Memory -- ]
             Baseline perl 1204
             IO::Interactive 2464 (+1260)
             IO::Interactive::Tiny 1332 (+128)

       Even though "time" isn't really a ::Tiny factor, it does improve loading a bit:

          [ -- time -- ]
           Baseline perl
             real  0m0.014s
             user  0m0.004s
             sys   0m0.008s

           IO::Interactive
             real  0m0.023s
             user  0m0.013s
             sys   0m0.009s

           IO::Interactive::Tiny
             real  0m0.013s
             user  0m0.004s
             sys   0m0.008s

       Regarding tests: t/01.is_interactive.t i the same as t/is_interactive.t in IO::Interactive
