NAME
       Apache::Htpasswd - Manage Unix crypt-style password file.

SYNOPSIS
           use Apache::Htpasswd;

           $foo = new Apache::Htpasswd("path-to-file");

           $foo = new Apache::Htpasswd({passwdFile => "path-to-file",
                                        ReadOnly   => 1}
                                       );

           # Add an entry
           $foo->htpasswd("zog", "password");

           # Change a password
           $foo->htpasswd("zog", "new-password", "old-password");

           # Change a password without checking against old password

           $foo->htpasswd("zog", "new-password", {'overwrite' => 1});

           # Check that a password is correct
           $foo->htCheckPassword("zog", "password");

           # Fetch an encrypted password
           $foo->fetchPass("foo");

           # Delete entry
           $foo->htDelete("foo");

           # If something fails, check error
           $foo->error;

           # Write in the extra info field
           $foo->writeInfo("login", "info");

           # Get extra info field for a user
           $foo->fetchInfo("login");

DESCRIPTION
       This module comes with a set of methods to use with htaccess password files. These files (and htaccess) are used to do Basic Authentication on a web server.

       The passwords file is a flat-file with login name and their associated crypted password. You can use this for non-Apache files if you wish, but it was written specifically for .htaccess style
       files.

   FUNCTIONS
       Apache::Htpasswd->new(...);
           As of version 1.5.4 named params have been added, and it is suggested that you use them from here on out.

                   Apache::Htpasswd->new("path-to-file");

           "path-to-file" should be the path and name of the file containing the login/password information.

                   Apache::Htpasswd->new({passwdFile => "path-to-file",
                                          ReadOnly   => 1,
                                          UseMD5     => 1,
                                        });

           This  is  the  perferred  way  to  instantiate  an  object. The 'ReadOnly' param is optional, and will open the file in read-only mode if used. The 'UseMD5' is also optional: it will force MD5
           password under Unix.

           If you want to support plain un-encrypted passwords, then you need to set the UsePlain option (this is NOT recommended, but might be necessary in some situations)

       error;
           If a method returns an error, or a method fails, the error can be retrieved by calling error()

       htCheckPassword("login", "password");
           Finds if the password is valid for the given login.

           Returns 1 if passes.  Returns 0 if fails.

       htpasswd("login", "password");
           This will add a new user to the password file.  Returns 1 if succeeds.  Returns undef on failure.

       htDelete("login")
           Delete users entry in password file.

           Returns 1 on success Returns undef on failure.

       htpasswd("login", "new-password", "old-password");
           If the old-password matches the login's password, then it will replace it with new-password. If the old-password is not correct, will return 0.

       htpasswd("login", "new-password", {'overwrite' => 1});
           Will replace the password for the login. This will force the password to be changed. It does no verification of old-passwords.

           Returns 1 if succeeds Returns undef if fails

       fetchPass("login");
           Returns encrypted password if succeeds.  Returns 0 if login is invalid.  Returns undef otherwise.

       fetchInfo("login");
           Returns additional information if succeeds.  Returns 0 if login is invalid.  Returns undef otherwise.

       fetchUsers();
           Will return either a list of all the user names, or a count of all the users.

           The following will return a list: my @users = $Htpasswd->fetchUsers();

           The following will return the count: my $user_count = $Htpasswd->fetchUsers();

       writeInfo("login", "info");
           Will replace the additional information for the login.  Returns 0 if login is invalid.  Returns undef otherwise.

       CryptPasswd("password", "salt");
           Will return an encrypted password using 'crypt'. If salt is omitted, a salt will be created.

INSTALLATION
       You install Apache::Htpasswd, as you would install any perl module library, by running these commands:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install
          make clean

       If you are going to use MD5 encrypted passwords, you need to install Crypt::PasswdMD5.

       If you need to support SHA1 encrypted passwords, you need to install Digest::SHA and MIME::Base64.

DOCUMENTATION
       POD style documentation is included in the module.  These are normally converted to manual pages and installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should also be able to use the  'perldoc'
       utility to extract and read documentation from the module files directly.
