NAME
       krop - a tool to crop PDF files

SYNOPSIS
       krop [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the krop command.

       krop  is a simple graphical tool to crop the pages of PDF files. It is written in Python and relies on PyQt and PyMuPDF (or a suitable subset of pypdf/pikepdf/ python-poppler-qt) for its function‐
       ality.  A unique feature of krop is its ability to automatically split pages into subpages to fit the limited screen size of devices such as eReaders. This is particularly useful, if your  eReader
       does not support convenient scrolling.
