NAME
       firejail.users - Firejail user access database

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/firejail/firejail.users lists the users allowed to run firejail SUID executable.  root user is allowed by default, user nobody is never allowed.

       If the user is not allowed to start the sandbox, Firejail will attempt to run the program without sandboxing it.

       If the file is not present in the system, all users are allowed to use the sandbox.

       Example:

            $ cat /etc/firejail/firejail.users
            dustin
            lucas
            mike
            eleven

       Use a text editor to add or remove users from the list. You can also use firecfg --add-users command. Example:

            $ sudo firecfg --add-users dustin lucas mike eleven

       By default, running firecfg creates the file and adds the current user to the list. Example:

            $ sudo firecfg

       See man 1 firecfg for details.

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION
       An alternative way of restricting user access to firejail executable is to create a special firejail user group and allow only users in this group to run the sandbox:

            # addgroup --system firejail
            # chown root:firejail /usr/bin/firejail
            # chmod 4750 /usr/bin/firejail
