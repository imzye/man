DESCRIPTION
       synaptics  is  an  Xorg  input driver for touchpads.  Even though touchpads can be handled by the normal evdev or mouse drivers, this driver allows more advanced features of the touchpad to become
       available. Some benefits would be:

       •   Movement with adjustable, non-linear acceleration and speed.

       •   Button events through short touching of the touchpad.

       •   Double-Button events through double short touching of the touchpad.

       •   Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on the touchpad (tap-and-drag gesture).

       •   Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the touchpad.

       •   Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger on the right side of the touchpad.

       •   The up/down button sends button four/five events.

       •   Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven events) through moving the finger on the lower side of the touchpad.

       •   The multi-buttons send button four/five events for vertical scrolling and button six/seven events for horizontal scrolling.

       •   Adjustable finger detection.

       •   Multifinger taps: two finger for right button and three finger for middle button events.  (Needs hardware support.  Not all models implement this feature.)

       •   Pressure-dependent motion speed.

       Note that depending on the touchpad firmware, some of these features might be available even without using the synaptics driver. Note also that some functions are not  available  on  all  touchpad
       models, because they need support from the touchpad hardware/firmware. (Multifinger taps for example.)

       The  name  "synaptics"  is  historical and the driver still provides the synaptics protocol parsing code. Under Linux however, the hardware-specifics are handled by the kernel and this driver will
       work for any touchpad that has a working kernel driver. If your device is recognized as "PS/2 Mouse" or similar, the kernel driver does not support your device and this driver  will  only  provide
       limited functionality.

       Option "UpDownScrollRepeat" "boolean"
              If  on, and the up/down buttons are used for scrolling (UpDownScrolling), these buttons will send auto-repeating 4/5 events, with the delay between repeats determined by ScrollButtonRepeat.
              This option is only available for touchpads with physical scroll buttons.  Property: "Synaptics Button Scrolling Repeat"

       Option "LeftRightScrollRepeat" "boolean"
              If on, and the left/right buttons are used for scrolling (LeftRightScrolling), these buttons will send auto-repeating 6/7 events, with the delay between repeats determined by  ScrollButton‐
              Repeat.  This option is only available for touchpads with physical scroll buttons.  Property: "Synaptics Button Scrolling Repeat"

       Option "ScrollButtonRepeat" "integer"

       Option "EmulateTwoFingerMinZ" "integer"
              For touchpads not capable of detecting multiple fingers but are capable of detecting finger pressure and width, this sets the Z pressure threshold.  When both Z pressure and W width thresh‐
              olds are crossed, a two finger press will be emulated. This defaults to a value that disables emulation on touchpads with real two-finger detection and defaults to a value that enables emu‐
              lation on remaining touchpads that support pressure and width support.  Property: "Synaptics Two-Finger Pressure"

       Option "EmulateTwoFingerMinW" "integer"
              For touchpads not capable of detecting multiple fingers but are capable of detecting finger width and pressure, this sets the W width threshold.  When both W width and Z pressure thresholds
              are crossed, a two finger press will be emulated. This feature works best with (PalmDetect) off. Property: "Synaptics Two-Finger Width"

       Option "TouchpadOff" "integer"
              Switch off the touchpad.  Valid values are:
              0   Touchpad is enabled
              1   Touchpad is switched off (physical clicks still work)
              2   Only tapping and scrolling is switched off
              When  the touchpad is switched off, button events caused by a physical button press are still interpreted. On a ClickPad, this includes software-emulated middle and right buttons as defined
              by the SoftButtonAreas setting.

       Property: "Synaptics Off"

       Option "LockedDrags" "boolean"

       Option "CoastingSpeed" "float"
              Your finger needs to produce this many scrolls per second in order to start coasting.  The default is 20 which should prevent you from starting coasting unintentionally.  0 disables  coast‐
              ing. Property: "Synaptics Coasting Speed"

       Option "CoastingFriction" "float"
              Number of scrolls/second² to decrease the coasting speed.  Default is 50.  Property: "Synaptics Coasting Speed"

       Option "SingleTapTimeout" "integer"

       Option "GrabEventDevice" "boolean"
              If  GrabEventDevice  is true, the driver will grab the event device for exclusive use when using the linux 2.6 event protocol.  When using other protocols, this option has no effect.  Grab‐
              bing the event device means that no other user space or kernel space program sees the touchpad events.  This is desirable if the X config file includes /dev/input/mice as an  input  device,
              but is undesirable if you want to monitor the device from user space.  When changing this parameter with the synclient program, the change will not take effect until the synaptics driver is
              disabled and re-enabled.  This can be achieved by switching to a text console and then switching back to X.

       Option "TapAndDragGesture" "boolean"
              Switch  on/off the tap-and-drag gesture.  This gesture is an alternative way of dragging.  It is performed by tapping (touching and releasing the finger), then touching again and moving the
              finger on the touchpad.  The gesture is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the TapAndDragGesture option to false. Property: "Synaptics Gestures"

       Option "VertResolution" "integer"
              Resolution of X coordinates in units/millimeter. The value is used together with HorizResolution to compensate unequal  vertical  and  horizontal  sensitivity.  Setting  VertResolution  and
              HorizResolution equal values means no compensation. Default value is read from the touchpad or set to 1 if value could not be read.  Property: "Synaptics Pad Resolution"

       Option "HorizResolution" "integer"
              Resolution  of  Y  coordinates  in  units/millimeter.  The  value  is used together with VertResolution to compensate unequal vertical and horizontal sensitivity. Setting VertResolution and
              HorizResolution equal values means no compensation. Default value is read from the touchpad or set to 1 if value could not be read.  Property: "Synaptics Pad Resolution"

       Option "AreaLeftEdge" "integer"
              Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which start left of this edge.  The option is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the AreaLeftEdge option to any  integer  value  other
              than zero. If supported by the server (version 1.9 and later), the edge may be specified in percent of the total width of the touchpad. Property: "Synaptics Area"

       Option "AreaRightEdge" "integer"
              Ignore  movements, scrolling and tapping which start right of this edge.  The option is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the AreaRightEdge option to any integer value other
              than zero. If supported by the server (version 1.9 and later), the edge may be specified in percent of the total width of the touchpad. Property: "Synaptics Area"

       Option "AreaTopEdge" "integer"
              Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which start above this edge.  The option is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the AreaTopEdge option to any integer value other  than
              zero. If supported by the server (version 1.9 and later), the edge may be specified in percent of the total height of the touchpad. Property: "Synaptics Area"

       Option "AreaBottomEdge" "integer"
              Ignore  movements,  scrolling  and tapping which start below this edge.  The option is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the AreaBottomEdge option to any integer value other
              than zero. If supported by the server (version 1.9 and later), the edge may be specified in percent of the total height of the touchpad. Property: "Synaptics Area"

       Option "SoftButtonAreas" "RBL RBR RBT RBB MBL MBR MBT MBB"
              This option is only available on ClickPad devices.  Enable soft button click area support on ClickPad devices.  The first four parameters are the left, right, top, bottom edge of the  right
              button, respectively, the second four parameters are the left, right, top, bottom edge of the middle button, respectively. Any of the values may be given as percentage of the touchpad width
              or  height,  whichever  applies.  If any edge is set to 0 (not 0%), the button is assumed to extend to infinity in the given direction. Setting all values to 0 (not 0%) disables soft button
              areas. Button areas may not overlap, however it is permitted for two buttons to share an edge value.  Property: "Synaptics Soft Button Areas"

       Option "HasSecondarySoftButtons" "boolean"
              This option is only available on ClickPad devices.  Enable the secondary software button area support. The exact area must be set in option "SecondarySoftButtonAreas".  See ClickPad support
              for more details.

       Option "SecondarySoftButtonAreas" "RBL RBR RBT RBB MBL MBR MBT MBB"
              This option is only available on ClickPad devices and only if Option "HasSecondarySoftButtons" is enabled.  Define the secondary soft button click areas on ClickPad devices (usually on  top
              of  the device).  For the allowed values for this option, see Option "SoftButtonAreas".  Primary and secondary soft button areas must not overlap each other. If they do, the behavior of the
              driver is undefined.  Property: "Synaptics Secondary Soft Button Areas". This property is only initialized if Option "HasSecondarySoftButtons" is enabled and  this  option  is  set  in  the
              xorg.conf(5).

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
   Area handling
       The LeftEdge, RightEdge, TopEdge and BottomEdge parameters are used to define the edge and corner areas of the touchpad.  The parameters split the touchpad area in 9 pieces, like this:
              │             │
              │ LeftEdge    │ RightEdge
       ┌──────└─────────────└───┐ Physical top edge
       │  1   │      2      │ 3 │
       └──────└─────────────└───┘ TopEdge
       │      │             │   │
       │  4   │      5      │ 6 │
       │      │             │   │
       └──────└─────────────└───┘ BottomEdge
       │  7   │      8      │ 9 │
       └──────└─────────────└───┘ Physical bottom edge
       │ Physical left edge     │ Physical right edge

       Coordinates to the left of LeftEdge are part of the left edge (areas 1, 4 and 7), coordinates to the left of LeftEdge and above TopEdge (area 1) are part of the upper left corner, etc.

       A good way to find appropriate edge parameters is to use evtest(1) on the device to see the x/y coordinates corresponding to different positions on the touchpad.

       The  perceived physical edges may be adjusted with the AreaLeftEdge, AreaRightEdge, AreaTopEdge, and AreaBottomEdge options. If these values are set to something other than the physical edges, in‐
       put that starts in the space between the area edge and the respective physical edge is ignored.  Note that this reduces the available space on the touchpad to start motions in.

   Tapping
       A tap event happens when the finger is touched and released in a time interval shorter than MaxTapTime, and the touch and release coordinates are less than MaxTapMove units apart.  A "touch" event
       happens when the Z value goes above FingerHigh, and an "untouch" event happens when the Z value goes below FingerLow.

       The MaxDoubleTapTime parameter has the same function as the MaxTapTime parameter, but for the second, third, etc tap in a tap sequence.  If you can't perform double clicks fast enough  (for  exam‐
       ple,  xmms  depends on fast double clicks), try reducing this parameter.  If you can't get word selection to work in xterm (ie button down, button up, button down, move mouse), try increasing this
       parameter.

       The ClickTime parameter controls the delay between the button down and button up X events generated in response to a tap event.  A too long value can cause undesirable autorepeat  in  scroll  bars
       and a too small value means that visual feedback from the gui application you are interacting with is harder to see.

   Acceleration
       The  MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters control the pointer motion speed.  The speed value defines the scaling between touchpad coordinates and screen coordinates.  When moving the fin‐
       ger very slowly, the MinSpeed value is used, when moving very fast the MaxSpeed value is used.  When moving the finger at moderate speed, you get a pointer motion speed somewhere between  MinSpeed
       and MaxSpeed.  If you don't want any acceleration, set MinSpeed and MaxSpeed to the same value.

       The  MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters don't have any effect on scrolling speed.  Scrolling speed is determined solely from the VertScrollDelta and HorizScrollDelta parameters.  To in‐
       vert the direction of vertical or horizontal scrolling, set VertScrollDelta or HorizScrollDelta to a negative value.

       Acceleration is mostly handled outside the driver, thus the driver will translate MinSpeed into constant deceleration and adapt MaxSpeed at startup time. This ensures you can user the other accel‐
       eration profiles, albeit without pressure motion. However the numbers at runtime will likely be different from any options you may have set.

   Pressure motion
       When pressure motion is activated, the cursor motion speed depends on the pressure exerted on the touchpad (the more pressure exerted on the touchpad, the faster the pointer).  More precisely  the
       speed is first calculated according to MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor, and then is multiplied by a sensitivity factor.

       The sensitivity factor can be adjusted using the PressureMotion parameters.  If the pressure is below PressureMotionMinZ, PressureMotionMinFactor is used, and if the pressure is greater than Pres‐
       sureMotionMaxZ, PressureMotionMaxFactor is used.  For a pressure value between PressureMotionMinZ and PressureMotionMaxZ, the factor is increased linearly.

   Middle button emulation
       Since  most synaptics touchpad models don't have a button that corresponds to the middle button on a mouse, the driver can emulate middle mouse button events.  If you press both the left and right
       mouse buttons at almost the same time (no more than EmulateMidButtonTime milliseconds apart) the driver generates a middle mouse button event.

   Circular scrolling
       Circular scrolling acts like a scrolling wheel on the touchpad.  Scrolling is engaged when a drag starts in the given CircScrollTrigger region, which can be all edges, a particular side, or a par‐
       ticular corner.  Once scrolling is engaged, moving your finger in clockwise circles around the center of the touchpad will generate scroll down events and counter clockwise  motion  will  generate
       scroll up events.  Lifting your finger will disengage circular scrolling.  Use tight circles near the center of the pad for fast scrolling and large circles for better control.  When used together
       with vertical scrolling, hitting the upper or lower right corner will seamlessly switch over from vertical to circular scrolling.

   Coasting
       Coasting is enabled by setting the CoastingSpeed parameter to a non-zero value.  Coasting comes in two flavors: conventional (finger off) coasting, and corner (finger on) coasting.

       Conventional  coasting  is enabled when coasting is enabled, and CornerCoasting is set to false.  When conventional coasting is enabled, horizontal/vertical scrolling can continue after the finger
       is released from the lower/right edge of the touchpad.  The driver computes the scrolling speed corresponding to the finger speed immediately before  the  finger  leaves  the  touchpad.   If  this
       scrolling  speed  is  larger than the CoastingSpeed parameter (measured in scroll events per second), the scrolling will continue with the same speed in the same direction until the finger touches
       the touchpad again.

       Corner coasting is enabled when coasting is enabled, and CornerCoasting is set to true.  When corner coasting is enabled, edge scrolling can continue as long as  the  finger  stays  in  a  corner.
       Coasting  begins  when  the  finger  enters  the corner, and continues until the finger leaves the corner.  CornerCoasting takes precedence over the seamless switch from edge scrolling to circular
       scrolling.  That is, if CornerCoasting is active, scrolling will stop, and circular scrolling will not start, when the finger leaves the corner.

   Noise cancellation
       The synaptics has a built-in noise cancellation based on hysteresis. This means that incoming coordinates actually shift a box of predefined dimensions such that it covers the incoming coordinate,
       and only the boxes own center is used as input. Obviously, the smaller the box the better, but the likelihood of noise motion coming through also increases.

   ClickPad support
       A click pad device has button(s) integrated into the touchpad surface. The user must press downward on the touchpad in order to generated a button press. ClickPad support is enabled if the  option
       ClickPad  is  set  or  the  property  is  set  at  runtime. On some platforms, this option will be set automatically if the kernel detects a matching device. On Linux, the device must have the IN‐
       PUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD property set.

       ClickPads do not support middle mouse button emulation. If enabling ClickPad support at runime, the user must also set the middle mouse button timeout to 0. If auto-detected, middle  mouse  button
       emulation is disabled by the driver.

       ClickPads provide software emulated buttons through Option "SoftButtonAreas".  These buttons enable areas on the touchpad to perform as right or middle mouse button. When the user performs a click
       within a defined soft button area, a right or middle click is performed.

       Some  laptops,  most  notably  the  Lenovo T440, T540 and x240 series, provide a pointing stick without physical buttons. On those laptops, the top of the touchpad acts as software-emulated button
       area. This area can be enabled with Option "HasSecondarySoftButtons" and configured with Option "SecondarySoftButtonAreas".  On some platforms, this option will be set automatically if the  kernel
       detects a matching device. On Linux, the device must have the INPUT_PROP_TOPBUTTONPAD property set.

NOTES
       Configuration through InputClass sections is recommended in X servers 1.8 and later. See xorg.conf.d(5) for more details. An example xorg.conf.d snippet is provided in ${sourcecode}/conf/70-synap‐
       tics.conf

       Configuration through hal fdi files is recommended in X servers 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7. An example hal policy file is provided in ${sourcecode}/conf/11-x11-synaptics.fdi

       If either of Protocol "auto-dev" (default) or Protocol "event" is used, the driver initializes defaults based on the capabilities reported by the kernel driver. Acceleration, edges and  resolution
       are  based  on  the  dimensions reported by the kernel. If the kernel reports multi-finger detection, two-finger vertical scrolling is enabled, horizontal two-finger scrolling is disabled and edge
       scrolling is disabled. If no multi-finger capabilities are reported, edge scrolling is enabled for both horizontal and vertical scrolling.  Tapping is disabled by default for touchpads with one or
       more physical buttons.  To enable it you need to map tap actions to buttons. See the "TapButton1", "TapButton2" and "TapButton3" options.

       Button mapping for physical buttons is handled in the server.  If the device is switched to left-handed (an in-server mapping of physical buttons 1, 2, 3 to the logical buttons 3,  2,  1,  respec‐
       tively), both physical and TapButtons are affected. To counteract this, the TapButtons need to be set up in reverse order (TapButton1=3, TapButton2=1).

REMOVED OPTIONS
       The following options are no longer part of the driver configuration:

       Option "Repeater" "string"

       Option "HistorySize" "integer"

       Option "SpecialScrollAreaRight" "boolean"

       Option "GuestMouseOff" "boolean"

       Option "SHMConfig" "boolean"

       Option "FingerPress" "integer"

       Option "TrackstickSpeed" "float"

       Option "EdgeMotionMinZ" "integer"

       Option "EdgeMotionMaxZ" "integer"

       Option "EdgeMotionMinSpeed" "integer"

       Option "EdgeMotionMaxSpeed" "integer"

       Option "EdgeMotionUseAlways" "boolean"
