NAME
       floatbg - slowly modify the color of the X root window

SYNTAX
       floatbg [-display display] [-help] [-gnome] [-xfce] [-value float] [-satmid float] [-satvar float] [-fase float] [-time float]

DESCRIPTION
       Floatbg is an X11 program that modifies the color of the root window in such a manner that you won't see the color change, but after a while you'll notice that it did change, however.

       Floatbg  starts  with a random color and changes it deterministically by moving through an hsv-model of colors.  In the hsv-model, colors are described by three parameters: Hue stands for the tint
       of a color (0 degrees is red, 60 = yellow, 120 = green, 180 = aquamarine, etc), saturations stands for the brightness of the color (0 = white, 1 = bright), and value stands for  the  intensity  of
       the color (0 = black, 1 = normal).

       Every 10 seconds the hue (tint) is increased by one degree and the saturation (brightness) is changed by a sinus over the hue.  (The frequency of this change can be adjusted with the -time parame‐
       ter.)   The  shape of this sinus can be adapted with the options -satmid, -satvar and -fase.  The value (blackness) is fixed and can be set with the option -value.  The default values are: floatbg
       -value .87 -satmid .375 -satvar .125 -fase .25, and are such that all pastel tints are visited.

       Extremely simplistic Gnome and Xfce support can be enabled with the -gnome and -xfce flags.

BUGS
       Floatbg doesn't use any window, button or menu, and it can only be stopped by killing it.
