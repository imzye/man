NAME
       pilot-read-expenses - Export Palm Expense application data in a text format.

SECTION
       pilot-link: Userland conduits

SYNOPSIS
        pilot-read-expenses [-p|--port <port>] [-q|--quiet] [--version] [-?|--help] [--usage] [-w|--write]

DESCRIPTION
        pilot-read-expenses is used to output the Expense data in a simple text format, which can be used to import into any other application you wish, such as Excel or other application.

       If  you  have  expense entries saved on your Palm in the ExpenseDB.pdb file, you can export them to a simple text format, and redirect that to a file/pipe, or STDOUT (the default) using pilot-read-ex‐
       penses.

       The output data will resemble something like the following:

                   Category: Unfiled Type:   5 Payment:   7 Currency:  23 Amount: 400.00 Vendor: Super Salads City: Westerly
