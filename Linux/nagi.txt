NAME
       nagi - Sierra Online (tm) AGI game interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       nagi

DESCRIPTION
       AGI, or the Adventure Game Interpreter, was developed and used by Sierra Online for their games, most notably the famous "Quest-series" in the late 1980's. Nagi is an open source interpreter for play‐
       ing AGI games.

       To start playing an AGI game, change to the directory where the AGI resources are and execute nagi without any parameters.

       Nagi supports a wide range of old Sierra games (you need the original files) as well as new AGI resources developed with tools like the Linux AGI Studio.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program is bundled with neither a manual page nor much documentation in other formats. For more  information,  visit  Nagi
       website <URL:http://www.agidev.com/projects/nagi/>.
