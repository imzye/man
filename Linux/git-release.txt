NAME
       git-release - Commit, tag and push changes to the repository

SYNOPSIS
       git-release  [<tagname>  |  --semver  <name>] [-r <remote>] [-m <commit
       info>] [--no-empty-commit] [-c] [-s] [-u <key-id>]  [[--]  <hook  argu‐
       ments...>]

DESCRIPTION
       Commits  changes  with  message  "Release  <tagname>"  or custom commit
       information, tags with the given <tagname>  and  pushes  the  branch  /
       tags.

       This  command  always creates a release commit, which could be empty if
       nothing changed. It works like git merge --no-ff. If you don´t like the
       behavior, you could add --no-empty-commit to skip it.

       Optionally  it  generates  a changelog (see git-changelog) and a remote
       can be defined. The order of first -c or -r does not matter.

       If .git/hook/pre-release or .git/hook/post-release exist, they will  be
       triggered  with  tagname  and  extra  hook  arguments  before/after the
       release.

OPTIONS
       --semver <name>

       If the latest tag in your repo matches the semver  format  requirement,
       you  could increase part of it as the new release tag with this option.
       The name must be one of the major, minor, patch. For  example,  assumed
       the  latest tag is 4.4.0, with git release --semver minor you will make
       a new release with tag 4.5.0.

       <tagname>

       The name of the newly created tag. Also used in tag comment.

       -r <remote>

       The "remote" repository that is destination of a push operation: it  is
       passed to git push.

       -m <commit info>

       use  the  custom  commit  information  instead  of  the default message
       "Release <tagname>" .

       --no-empty-commit

       Avoid creating empty commit if nothing could be committed.

       -c

       Generates or populates the changelog with all commit message since  the
       last tag. For more info see git-changelog..

       -s

       Create a signed and annotated tag.

       -u <key ID>

       Create a tag, annotated and signed with the given key.

       [--] hook arguments...

       The   arguments   listed   after  "--"  separator  will  be  passed  to
       pre/post-release hook following the tagname.
