       PKCS#11 objects

       pkcs11-destroy [-m module] [-s slot] [-i ID] [-l label]  [-p  PIN]  [-w
       seconds]

       pkcs11-destroy  destroys keys stored in a PKCS#11 device, identified by
       their ID or label.

       Matching keys are displayed before being destroyed. By  default,  there
       is  a  five-second delay to allow the user to interrupt the process be‐
       fore the destruction takes place.

       -m module
              This option specifies the PKCS#11 provider module. This must  be
              the  full  path  to  a  shared  library  object implementing the
              PKCS#11 API for the device.

       -s slot
              This option opens the session with the given PKCS#11  slot.  The
              default is slot 0.

       -i ID  This option destroys keys with the given object ID.

       -l label
              This option destroys keys with the given label.

       -p PIN This  option specifies the PIN for the device. If no PIN is pro‐
              vided on the command line, pkcs11-destroy prompts for it.

       -w seconds
              This option specifies how long, in seconds, to pause before car‐
              rying  out  key destruction. The default is 5 seconds. If set to
              0, destruction is immediate.
