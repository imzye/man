NAME
       psresize - rescales and centers a document for new output paper size

SYNOPSIS
       psresize [-wwidth] [-hheight] [-ppaper] [-Wwidth] [-Hheight] [-Ppaper] [-q] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
       Psresize rescales and centres a document on a different size of paper.  The input PostScript file should follow the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions.

       The  -w  option gives the output paper width, and the -h option gives the output paper height, normally specified in cm or in to convert PostScript's points (1/72 of an inch) to centimeters or inches.
       The -p option can be used instead, to set the paper size; otherwise a default value is used.  See paper(1).

       The -W option gives the input paper width, and the -H option gives the input paper height.  The -P option can be used instead, to set the paper size; otherwise a default value is used.  See paper(1).

       Psresize normally prints the page numbers of the pages output; the -q option suppresses this.

EXAMPLES
       The following command can be used to convert a document on A4 size paper to letter size paper:

       psresize -PA4 -pletter in.ps out.ps
