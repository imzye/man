NAME
     pwait — wait for processes to terminate

SYNOPSIS
     pwait [-v] [-c] pid ...

DESCRIPTION
     pwait waits until each of the given processes has terminated.

     The options are as follows:

     -v      Print the exit status when each process terminates.

     -c      Return 111 if any process exited non-successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     The pwait utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     Invalid pids elicit a warning message but are otherwise ignored.

ERRORS

     pwait requires special permissions to run, either root or the Linux CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
