NAME
       gpg-mailkeys - sends emails containing keys to their owners

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-mailkeys id...

DESCRIPTION
       gpg-mailkeys sends the owners of the keys listed on the command line a mail each, containing their public key. After signing, you can use this tool to send everyone the new signatures they just got.

       If you're interested in encrypting the signature before it's sent, in order to verify that the associated address actually belongs to the key owner, you should check out caff

OPTIONS
       None

ENVIRONMENT
       NAME         Set the name to use when sending messages

       EMAIL        Set the email address to use when sending messages

       SUBJECT      Set the subject of the messages you send

       TEXT         Set the body text of the messages

       SENDMAIL     Set the path to sendmail. Default: /usr/sbin/sendmail

       SENDMAIL_ARGS
                    Set arguments to pass to $SENDMAIL. This can be useful to set credentials in order to authenticate to an smtp server when using ssmtp for example.

       HOME         Set the default home directory.

       GNUPGBIN     Set the gpg binary.  Default: "gpg".

       GNUPGHOME    Set the default working directory for gpg.  Default: "~/.gnupg".

FILES
       The behavior of gpg-mailkeys can be updated through some files available in the user home directory.

       Thus, ~/.gpg-mailkeysrc allows the user to overwrite the default value for the above environment variables, and any text in ~/.signature will be appended to the end of the body text of the message.
