NAME
       apt-offline - Offline APT Package manager

SYNOPSIS
       apt-offline [ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       apt-offline  brings  offline  package  management functionality to Debian based system.  It can be used to download packages and its dependencies to be installed later on (or required to update) a
       disconnected machine.  Packages can be downloaded from a different connected machine.

       It can also fetch bug reports for the packages that are downloaded.

       Unless the -h/-v or --help/--version options are given, one of the get, set or install commands must be provided.

   set FILENAME [-h] [--install-packages PKG...PKG_N] [--install-src-packages PKG...PKG_N] --src-build-dep [--release release_name] [--update] [--upgrade] [--upgrade-type upgrade]
       set generates a signature file with the data required to install on or update the disconnected machine.

       FILENAME {apt-offline.sig} is the signature file generated on the machine. This file will contain all the information necessary for apt.

       --simulate
              Developer only. Used for testing.

       --install-packages [PKG...PKG_N]
                 Packages that need to be installed

       --install-src-packages [PKG...PKG_N]
                 Source packages that need to be installed

       --src-build-dep
                 Download Build Dependency packages for the source packages requested

       --release release_name
                 Release target to install packages from

       --apt-backend apt-get
                 APT backend to use. One of: apt, apt-get, python-apt

       --generate-changelog
                 Generate changelog of the version to be downloaded

       --update  Generate APT Database signature for an update. This is the equivalent of using apt-get update

       --upgrade Generate APT Database signature for package upgrade. This is the equivalent of using apt-get upgrade

       --upgrade-type {upgrade_type}
                 Type of upgrade you would like to perform. Default is upgrade .  Other valid types are dist-upgrade and dselect-upgrade

   get FILENAME [-h] [--socket-timeout ] [-d / --download-dir] [-s / --cache-dir] [--no-checksum] [-t / --threads ] [--bundle] [--bug-reports] [--proxy-host]  [--proxy-port]  [--https-cert-file  --https-
       key-file] [--http-basicauth] [--disable-cert-check]
       get downloads APT data as per a signature file.

       FILENAME {apt-offline.sig} is the signature file required for details about data to be downloaded. This file should have been generated by the above set command.

       -d, --download-dir DIR_NAME
                 Download data to the specified DIR_NAME folder. If no folder name is specified, data is downloaded to a folder in the TEMPDIR path in the format apt-offline-download-$PID

       -s, --cache-dir DIR_NAME
                 Look  for  data  in the cache before downloading it from the internet. If you are on a Debian box, you would want to specify /var/cache/apt/archives here. If the data is not available in
                 the cache, the downloaded data is also copied to the cache.

       --no-checksum
                 Enabling this option will bypass the checksum verification of each downloaded file thus losing integrity of the package. Usage of this option is highly discouraged

       -t, --threads NUM_OF_THREADS
                 Number of threads to spawn for downloads. Default is 1. Using too many threads can overload the servers, hence it is advisable to keep the number low

       --bundle FILENAME
                 Create an archive file FILENAME. The file is archived in zip format

       --bug-reports
                 Download bug reports for packages that are being downloaded. Currently only the Debian BTS is supported.

       --proxy-host
                 Specify the Proxy Host to be used.

       --proxy-port
                 Specify the Proxy port number to be used.

       --https-cert-file FILENAME
                 The Certificate-file to use if https-client-authentication is required on one or multiple hosts.

       --https-key-file FILENAME
                 The Certificate-key-file to use if https-client-authentication is required on one or multiple hosts.

       --disable-cert-check
                 Disable the check of https certificates on servers

       --http-basicauth URL
                 A username/password encoded in the URL. Note Passwords with special characters should be percent encoded as per RFC-3986 section 2.1

   install FILE/FOLDER [-h] [--skip-bug-reports ] [--install-src-path PATH] [--allow-unauthenticated]
       install installs APT data to the APT package database and updates it.

       FILE {archive_bundle_file} Install data from the archive (bundle) file.

       FOLDER {/folder/path} Install data from the folder path.

       Either FILE or FOLDER argument can be provided to the install command.

       --simulate
              Developer only. Used for testing.

       --skip-bug-reports
                 Skip listing of downloaded bug reports, if any.

       --skip-changelog
                 Skip display of changelog, if any.

       --allow-unauthenticated
                 Don't verify GPG signatures for the data to be installed to APT. Usage of this option is highly discouraged.

       --strict-deb-check
                 With this option enabled, apt-offline delegate's .deb package checksum validation to apt. While the .debs are already available, they are stored in the temporary  apt  cache,  where  apt
                 validates  its  checksum,  before  considering it for further processing.  Note: This does have the caveat that apt may need network availability even though it doesn't download anything
                 over the network. But it does invoke the download routines and realizes that the payload is already available. It then further proceeds with checksum validation

                 The default behavior is to not do strict checksum validation for .deb files. Instead, apt-offline copies the .deb files to apt's download location. apt still does size validation of  the
                 available .deb files and discards them in case there is a mismatch.

       --install-src-path PATH
                 Path to filesystem where we want the source packages to be installed to. Default will be a folder in your TEMPDIR.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help message

       --verbose
              Run in verbose mode

       -v, --version
              Display the version of the program

EXAMPLES
       NOTE: argument/option handling
              apt-offline relies on argparse for argument/option parsing. To explicitly instruct apt-offline about an argument, you can pass it with the -- delimiter.

              Ex. apt-offline set --update --upgrade --install-packages wm2 -- foo.sig

              By specifying the -- delimiter, we instruct apt-offline that foo.sig is an argument to the apt-offline command and not to the --install-packages option.

              Otherwise, you could also use it positionally next to the set command

              Ex. apt-offline set foo.sig --update --upgrade --install-packages wm2

       apt-offline set FILENAME
              This  command  will  generate  a  signature file FILENAME for APT Package Database.  To generate only the signature for updates, use the --update option.  To generate only the signature for
              package upgrades, use the --upgrade option.

       apt-offline get FILENAME
              This command will fetch the data required for APT Package Database as per the signature file FILENAME generated by apt-offline get.  To download bug reports also use the  --bug-reports  op‐
              tion.  Currently supported bug tracker is Debian BTS only.  By default, if neither of -d or --bundle options are specified, apt-offline downloads data into a folder inside the TEMPDIR envi‐
              ronment  folder  in the format apt-offline-downloads-PID, where PID is the PID of the running apt-offline process. Example on a Linux machine would be something like: /tmp/apt-offline-down‐
              loads-23242/

       apt-offline install FILE|FOLDER
              This command will sync the data downloaded by apt-offline get to the APT Package Database and update it.  Depending on where the data was downloaded to or packed into, either  the  absolute
              FOLDER path or the archive FILE path can be specified.

              NOTE1: On a freshly installed box, that was installed without the network, the package database is null. In that case, you first need to run apt-offline with just the --update option to en‐
              sure you have a meaningful package database

              Example: apt-offline set set.uris --update

              NOTE2:  On a fresh setup installed through CD/DVD, the default APT setting lists only the install media URLs. In such case, you need to add the default APT network repositories to the list.
              For example, for a fresh (DVD) installed Debian box, add the relevant repository to

              /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-offline.list or /etc/apt/sources.list

              deb https://deb.debian.org/debian stable main contrib

              (For Debian Stable)

              deb https://deb.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib

              (For Debian Unstable/Sid)

              deb https://deb.debian.org/debian stretch main contrib

              (For Debian Stretch)

              deb http://security.debian.org stable/updates main contrib

              (Security Updates for Debian Stable)

              deb http://security.debian.org testing-security/updates main contrib

              (Security Updates for Debian Testing)

       Sequence 1: The following set of commands, when run in sequence, will update a disconnected machine.

              apt-offline set update.sig --update

              (Generate the required data needed to update the APT database. Should be run on the disconnected machine)

              apt-offline get update.sig --bundle update.zip

              (Download the required data needed to update the APT database. Should be run on a machine with internet connectivity)

              apt-offline install update.zip

              (Installs the data needed to update the APT database. Should be run on the disconnected machine)

       Sequence 2: With successful completion of Sequence 1, the APT database on the disconnected machine will be up-to-date. Now, the following set of commands, when run in sequence, will upgrade a dis‐
       connected machine.

              apt-offline set upgrade.sig --upgrade

              (Generate the required data needed to upgrade the upgradable packages. Should be run on the disconnected machine)

              apt-offline get upgrade.sig --bundle upgrade.zip

              (Download the required data needed to upgrade the upgradable packages. Should be run on a machine with internet connectivity)

              apt-offline install upgrade.zip

              (Installs the data needed to upgrade the upgradable packages. Should be run on the disconnected machine)

       After successful completion of
              Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 in order, further running apt-get upgrade will result in 0 bytes of additional download.
