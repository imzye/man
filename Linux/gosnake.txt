NAME
       GoSnake - The Console Snake Game

SYNOPSIS
       gosnake [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       GoSnake is a simple yet nice implementation of the well known snake game.  It is designed to run under the GNU/Linux console (including terminal emulators). The aim of the game is simple: control your
       snake and move it around to eat food without hitting walls, or colliding with itself.  The game includes 10 levels with an option to play levels randomly, and a highscore board.

       The snake is controlled by using the arrows keys, or the "awsd" keys as shown below.

           +---+                 +----+
           | w |                 | UP |
           +---+                 +----+
       +---+---+---+        +----+----+----+
       | a | s | d |        | LT | DN | RT |
       +---+---+---+        +----+----+----+

       Controlling game speed is easy. Press '9' repeatedly to decrease game speed, thus making the snake go slower. Press '0' repeatedly to do the opposite, i.e.  make the snake go faster.
