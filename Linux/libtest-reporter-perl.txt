Test::Reporter::Transport(3pm)                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                      Test::Reporter::Transport(3pm)

NAME
       Test::Reporter::Transport - base class for Test::Reporter transports

VERSION
       version 1.62

SYNOPSIS
           # Defines API that must be implemented by subclasses

           my $sender = Test::Reporter::Transport::Subclass->new( @args );

           $sender->send( $report )

DESCRIPTION
       Transport subclasses provide the means by which CPAN Testers reports are transmitted to the CPAN Testers mailing list.

       This module is an abstract base class that define an API for Test::Reporter::Transport subclasses.  Individual subclasses MUST implement the methods described below.

USAGE
       A transport method is specified to Test::Reporter using the "transport" option.  The "transport" option expects just the module "suffix" that follows "Test::Reporter::Transport".  For example:

           # use Test::Reporter::Transport::Null for transport
           my $report = Test::Reporter->new(
               transport => 'Null'
           );

       Configuration of the transport is specified with the "transport_args" option:

           my $report = Test::Reporter->new(
               transport => 'File',
               transport_args => [ dir => '/tmp' ],
           );

       These may also be specified with the "transport" or "transport_args" methods:

           $report->transport_args( dir => '/tmp' );

       These may also be combined in the "transport" method itself:

           $report->transport( 'File', dir => '/tmp' );

METHODS
       The terms 'may', 'must', 'should', etc. used below have their usual RFC meanings.

   new
           my $sender = $subclass->new( @args );

       The "new" method is the object constructor.  It MAY take a list of any necessary configuration options.  It MUST return a transport object if one is successfully created or undef if the object can
       not be created.

   send
           $sender->send( $report );

       The "send" method MUST take a Test::Reporter object as its only argument.  It MUST return true if the report is successfully sent.  It SHOULD die with a message describing the failure if a report
       cannot be sent.  It MUST NOT return a true value if the report cannot be sent.
