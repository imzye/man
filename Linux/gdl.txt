       gdl [--help] [-h] [--version] [-v] [-V] [[-]-quiet] [-q] [ -arg value ]

DESCRIPTION
       gdl is an incremental compiler for the GNU Data Language (GDL).  GDL is
       being developed with the aim of providing an  open-source  drop-in  re‐
       placement for Interactive Data Language (IDL) (RSI then ITTVIS then Ex‐
       elis and now Harris Geospatial Solutions, Inc.). It is  also  partially
       compatible  with Visual Numerics (VN) PV-WAVE. IDL and PV-WAVE are reg‐
       istered trademarks of L3Harris and VN, respectively.  GDL and  its  li‐
       brary  routines  are designed as a tool for numerical data analysis and
       visualisation.  GDL  is  dynamically  typed,  vectorized  and  has  ob‐
       ject-oriented  programming  capabilities.   The library routines handle
       numerical calculations, data  visualisation,  signal/image  processing,
       file  input/output (incl. graphical and scientific data formats such as
       TIFF, PNG, netCDF, HDF etc) and interaction with host OS.

       Information on GDL/IDL/PV-WAVE syntax and library routines can be found
       in e.g.:

       A  vast  part  of GDL library routines is implemented using open-source
       libraries  including  GSL,  plPlot,  and  optionally:  readline,  FFTW,
       Eigen3,  ImageMagick,  netCDF,  HDF4,  HDF5, PROJ, UDUNITS-2, libps and
       others.

OPTIONS
       --help (or -h)
              Show summary of options

       --version (or -v, -V)
              Show version of program

       --quiet (or -quiet, -q)
              Suppress welcome messages

       -arg value
              Tells COMMAND_LINE_ARGS() to report the following argument  (may
              be specified more than once)

       -args ...
              Tells COMMAND_LINE_ARGS() to report all following arguments

       -e statement
              Execute given statement and exit (last occurrence taken into ac‐
              count only, executed after startup file, may  not  be  specified
              together with batch files)

       -pref=/path/to/PreferenceFile
              (only  partially  working  now) setting using external text file
              few variables including default preferences  (e.g.  X11  Windows
              Size)

       --fakerelease version
              setting  !VERSION.RELASE to that value. !VERSION.RELASE is often
              tested by procedures to decide whether some function  or  option
              should  be  used. It is sometimes possible to use this option to
              fool a procedure that request a specific value  of  !VERSION.RE‐
              LEASE (e.g. atv.pro)

       --fussy
              signals  that  all  used procedures will adhere with modern IDL,
              where "()" are for functions and  "[]"  are  for  arrays.   This
              speeds  up  (sometimes  terribly) compilation but choke on every
              use of "()" with arrays.  Conversion of procedures to modern IDL
              can be done with D. Landsman's idlv4_to_v5 procedure.  Use envi‐
              romnment variable "GDL_IS_FUSSY" to set up permanently this fea‐
              ture.

              Incidentally  "being fussy" can help find all places in a proce‐
              dure that need to be corrected to have it in the modern IDL for‐
              mat.

       --sloppy
              inverse  of fussy above.  Sets the traditional (default) compil‐
              ing option where "()"  can be used both with functions  and  ar‐
              rays.   Needed to counteract temporarily the effect of the envi‐
              romnment variable "GDL_IS_FUSSY".

       --use-wx
              Tells GDL to use WxWidgets graphics instead of X11  or  Windows.
              (nicer plots).  Also enabled by setting the environment variable
              GDL_USE_WX to a non-null value.

       --no-use-wx
              Tells GDL no to  use  WxWidgets  graphics,  even  if  env.  var.
              "GDL_USE_WX" is set.

       --no-dSFMT
              Tells  GDL  not  to  use  double  precision  SIMD  oriented Fast
              Mersenne Twister(dSFMT) for random  values.   Also  disabled  by
              setting  the  environment  variable  GDL_NO_DSFMT  to a non-null
              value.

              With dSFMT, although the Mersenne Twister algorithm is the  same
              as  in  modern IDL, the values are computed in parallel (hence a
              speed gain) but the output order is not the same as  IDL.  Also,
              the seed is different.  Theses differences should not be a prob‐
              lem as it is discouraged to interfere with seed values.

              The -demo, -em, -novm, -queue, -rt, -ulicense  and  -vm  options
              are ignored for compatibility with IDL.

       A list of batch files to be executed before entering the interactive
              mode  (but  after executing a startup file, if specified) may be
              given when not using the -e option.

FILES
       $DATADIR/gnudatalanguage/lib/*.pro
              Library routines implemented in GDL. $DATADIR is specified  dur‐
              ing  compilation  and usually translates to /usr/share, /usr/lo‐
              cal/share or alike. GDL includes this directory  in  its  search
              path unless GDL_PATH or IDL_PATH env. variables are set (see be‐
              low).

       $HOME/.gdl/history
              A file used for storing the history of commands  issued  in  the
              interactive mode (if GDL compiled within ReadLine)

ENVIRONMENT
       The  following  environment variables have special meaning to gdl.  The
       GDL_* variant, if defined,  takes  precedence  over  any  corresponding
       IDL_* variant.

       GDL_PATH, IDL_PATH
              The GDL command (script) search path.

       GDL_STARTUP, IDL_STARTUP
              A file of commands to be executed on startup.

       GDL_TMPDIR, IDL_TMPDIR
              A directory in which temporary files may be created.

       HOME, SHELL
              Variables  influencing  shell invocations from within GDL (SPAWN
              procedure and the $ interpreter command).  Value of HOME  deter‐
              mines as well the location of the GDL history-file.

       PATH   Determines  search  path when spawning child processes using the
              SPAWN procedure with the /NOSHELL keyword set.

       PYTHONPATH
              Influences behaviour of PYTHON procedure and  PYTHON()  function
              (available  if  GDL  is compiled with support for calling Python
              code)

       GDL_MPI
              A message to be sent out using MPI_Send before initialization of
              the  interpreter  (available if GDL is compiled with support for
              MPI)

       DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT
              Tell GDL how to connect to the X server

       PLPLOT_DRV_DIR
              Override the default location of PLplot dynamic drivers.

       LC_*   The locale-related settings accessible via LOCALE_GET() (GDL al‐
              ways uses the C locale internally)

       GDL_GR_WIN_HEIGHT
              Sets  the  preference  for  the  default height of a Windows(tm)
              graphic window

       GDL_GR_WIN_QSCREEN
              if  set  to  true  (1)  this  will  prevent  the  use   of   the
              GDL_GR_WIN_HEIGHT  and  GDL_GR_WIN_WIDTH preferences and the de‐
              fault dimensions of graphic windows will be 1/4  of  the  screen
              dimensions

       GDL_GR_WIN_WIDTH
              Sets  the  preference  for  the  default  width of a Windows(tm)
              graphic window

       GDL_GR_X_HEIGHT
              Sets the preference for the default height  of  an  X11  graphic
              window

       GDL_GR_X_QSCREEN
              if   set   to  true  (1)  this  will  prevent  the  use  of  the
              GDL_GR_X_HEIGHT and GDL_GR_X_WIDTH preferences and  the  default
              dimensions  of  graphic windows will be 1/4 of the screen dimen‐
              sions

       GDL_GR_X_WIDTH
              Sets the preference for the default width of an X11 graphic win‐
              dow

       GDL_WX_BACKEND
              can be set to [0,1,2] which will select, respectively, the back‐
              ends 0,1 or 2 of plplot's old wxWidgets driver (plplot  versions
              < 5.10). Backend 2 has antialiasing enabled.

       GDL_MAPS_DIR
              If  not  automatically  found,  tells  GDL  where the maps files
              (coasts rivers,  etc,  used  by  MAPS_CONTINENTS)  are  located.
              These are in Shapefile format and newer versions can possibly be
              present on naturalearthdata.com
