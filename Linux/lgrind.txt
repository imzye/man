NAME
       lgrindef - LGrind's language definition data base

NOTE
       This man page is not yet much outdated, but might be soon except somebody asks me to work on it. Consider the LaTeX docs the real docs.

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/TeX/texmf/tex/latex/lgrind/lgrindef

DESCRIPTION
       lgrindef  contains all language definitions for lgrind(1).  The data base is very similar to vgrind(5) and termcap(5), and it is upward-compatible with that of vgrind(5).  Capabilities in lgrindef
       are of two types: Boolean capabilities which indicate that the language has some particular feature and string capabilities which give a regular expression or keyword list.  Entries  may  continue
       onto multiple lines by giving a \ as the last character of a line.  Lines starting with # are comments.

   Capabilities
       The following table names and describes each capability.

       Name  Type  Description
       ab    str   Regular expression for the start of an alternate form comment
       ae    str   Regular expression for the end of an alternate form comment
       bb    str   Regular expression for the start of a block
       be    str   Regular expression for the end of a lexical block
       cb    str   Regular expression for the start of a comment
       ce    str   Regular expression for the end of a comment
       cf    bool  (Boolean) Use specialized C function detection
       id    str   String giving characters other than letters and digits that may legally occur in identifiers (default `_')
       kw    str   A list of keywords separated by spaces
       lb    str   Regular expression for the start of a character constant
       le    str   Regular expression for the end of a character constant
       mb    str   Regular expression for the start of TeX math within a comment
       me    str   Regular expression for the end of TeX math within a comment
       np    str   Regular expression for a line not containing the start of a procedure
       oc    bool  Present means upper and lower case are equivalent
       pb    str   Regular expression for start of a procedure
       pl    bool  Procedure definitions are constrained to the lexical level matched by the `px' capability
       px    str   A  match  for  this regular expression indicates that procedure definitions may occur at the next lexical level.  Useful for lisp-like languages in which procedure definitions occur as
                   subexpressions of defuns.
       rb    str   Regular expression for the start of a block outside the actual code
       sb    str   Regular expression for the start of a string
       se    str   Regular expression for the end of a string
       rb    str   Regular expression for the end of a block outside a function (e. g. records in Pascal and Modula-2)
       tb    str   Regular expression for the start of TeX text within a comment
       tc    str   Use the named entry as a continuation of this one
       te    str   Regular expression for the end of TeX text within a comment
       tl    bool  Present means procedures are only defined at the top lexical level
       vb    str   Regular expression for the start of typewriter text within a comment
       ve    str   Regular expression for the end of typewriter text within a comment
       zb    str   Regular expression for the start of program text within a comment
       ze    str   Regular expression for the end of program text within a comment

   Regular Expressions
       lgrindef uses regular expressions similar to those of ex(1) and lex(1).  The characters `^', `$', `|', `:', and `\' are reserved characters and must be `quoted' with a preceding \ if they  are  to
       be included as normal characters.  The metasymbols and their meanings are:

       $      The end of a line
       ^      The beginning of a line
       \d     A delimiter (space, tab, newline, start of line)
       \a     Matches any string of symbols (like `.*' in lex)
       \p     Matches any identifier.  In a procedure definition (the `pb' capability) the string that matches this symbol is used as the procedure name.
       ()     Grouping
       |      Alternation
       ?      Last item is optional
       \e     Preceding any string means that the string will not match an input string if the input string is preceded by an escape character (\).  This is typically used for languages (like C) that can
              include the string delimiter in a string by escaping it.

       Unlike  other  regular  expressions  in  the system, these match words and not characters.  Hence something like `(tramp|steamer)flies?'  would match `tramp', `steamer', `trampflies', or `steamer‐
       flies'.  Contrary to some forms of regular expressions, lgrindef alternation binds very tightly.  Grouping parentheses are likely to be necessary in expressions involving alternation.

   Keyword List
       The keyword list is just a list of keywords in the language separated by spaces.  If the `oc' boolean is specified, indicating that upper and lower case  are  equivalent,  then  all  the  keywords
       should be specified in lower case.

EXAMPLE
       The following entry, which describes the C language, is typical of a language entry.

              C|the C programming language:\
                   :pb=^\d?*?\d?\p\d?a?:bb={:be=}:cb=/*:ce=*/:\
                   :sb=":se=\e":lb=':le=\e':tl:\
                   :zb=@:ze=@:tb=%%:te=%%:mb=%\$:me=\$%:vb=%\|:ve=\|%:\
                   :kw=asm auto break case char continue default do double\
                   else enum extern float for fortran goto if int long\
                   register return short sizeof static struct switch typedef\
                   union unsigned while #define #else #endif #if #ifdef\
                   #ifndef #include #undef # define else endif if ifdef\
                   ifndef include undef:

       Note that the first field is just the language name (and any variants of it).  Thus the C language could be specified to lgrind(1) as `c' or `C', since case is not significant here.
