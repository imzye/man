NAME
       fmemcmpi - fuzzy comparison of two memory areas

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fstrcmp.h>
       #define FSTRCMPI_IDENTICAL
       #define FSTRCMPI_THRESHOLD
       #define FSTRCMPI_ERROR
       int fmemcmpi(const void *data1, size_t size1, const void *data2, size_t size2);

DESCRIPTION
       The fmemcmpi() function compares the two memory areas, the size1 bytes pointed to by data1 and the size2 bytes pointed to by data2.

RETURN VALUE
       The  fmemcmpi  function  returns an int value between 0 and FSTRCMPI_IDENTICAL.  A value of 0 means the memory areas are utterly un‐alike.  A value of FSTRCMPI_IDENTICAL means the memory areas are
       identical.  A value of more than FSTRCMPI_THRESHOLD (it lies between 0.0 and FSTRCMP_IDENTICAL) would be considered "similar" by most people.

       A value of FSTRCMPI_ERROR (always negative) indicates a malloc(3) failure.
