NAME
       update-menu-lst - program to generate PV-GRUB's menu.lst file

SYNOPSIS
       update-menu-lst

DESCRIPTION
       update-menu-lst  is  a program used to generate the menu.lst file used by the PV-GRUB bootloader.  It works by looking in /boot for all files which start with "vmlinuz-". They will be treated
       as kernels, and grub menu entries will be created for each. It will also create the initial menu.lst if none exists, after prompting the user.  It will also add initrd lines for  ramdisk  im‐
       ages  found with the same version as kernels found. e.g. /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.5 and /boot/initrd-2.4.5 will cause a line of "initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.5 or similar to be added for the kernel entry
       in the menu.lst.

       After update-menu-lst has been run for the first time, the user may need to edit the generated menu.lst, in particular the two options update-menu-lst uses. Then  re-run  the  update-menu-lst
       script to update the menu.lst file using the default's that have been set.

       These are the options passed to the linux kernel:
       # kopt=root=/dev/hda1 ro
       Everything after "kopt=" is passed to the kernel as parameters. See bootparam(7) for more information.

       This is the grub device from which grub loads the kernel:
       # groot=(hd0,1)
       (hd0,1) is a partition in grub notation. See grub(8) for more information.

       This option controls if grub should create the alternative boot options in the menu entries
       # alternative=true
       # alternative=false

       This option controls if grub should lock the alternative boot options see grub(8) for more information.
       # lockalternative=true
       # lockalternative=false

       This option controls if grub should lock the old kernels.
       # lockold=true
       # lockold=false

       This options controls what is used for the alternative boot options, multiple altoptions lines are allowed.
       # altoptions=(some description) some kernel command line options
       # altoptions=(recovery option) single
       The description is placed in '()' and the kernel command line options follow that.
       # updatedefault=true
       # updatedefault=false

       This option controls if grub should update the default entry to keep booting the same kernel even if a new one is installed.
