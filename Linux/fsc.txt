NAME
       fsc - Fast offline compiler for the Scala 2 language

SYNOPSIS
       fsc  [ <options> ] <source files>

PARAMETERS
       <options>
              Command line options. See OPTIONS below.

       <source files>
              One or more source files to be compiled (such as MyClass.scala).

OPTIONS
       The offline compiler supports all options of scalac plus the following:

       -reset Reset compile server caches.

       -shutdown
              Shut  down  the  compilation  daemon.   The  daemon  attempts  to restart itself as necessary, but sometimes an explicit shutdown is required. A common example is if jars on the class path have
              changed.

       -server <hostname:portnumber>
              Specify compile server host at port number.  Usually this option is not needed.  Note that the hostname must be for a host that shares the same filesystem.

       -J<flag>
              Pass <flag> directly to the Java VM for the compilation daemon.

DESCRIPTION
       The fsc tool submits Scala compilation jobs to a compilation daemon. The first time it is executed, the daemon is started automatically. On subsequent runs, the same daemon can be reused, thus result‐
       ing in a faster compilation. The tool is especially effective when repeatedly compiling with the same class paths, because the compilation daemon can reuse a compiler instance.

       The  compilation  daemon  is smart enough to flush its cached compiler when the class path changes.  However, if the contents of the class path change, for example due to upgrading a library, then the
       daemon should be explicitly shut down with -shutdown.

       Note that the scala script runner will also use the offline compiler by default, with the same advantages and caveats.

EXAMPLE
       The following session shows a typical speed up due to using the offline compiler.

       > fsc -verbose -d /tmp test.scala
       ...
       [Port number: 32834]
       [Starting new Scala compile server instance]
       [Classpath = ...]
       [loaded directory path ... in 692ms]
       ...
       [parsing test.scala]
       ...
       [total in 943ms]

       > fsc -verbose -d /tmp test.scala
       ...
       [Port number: 32834]
       [parsing test.scala]
       ...
       [total in 60ms]

       > fsc -verbose -d /tmp test.scala
       ...
       [Port number: 32834]
       [parsing test.scala]
       ...
       [total in 42ms]

       > fsc -verbose -shutdown
       [Scala compile server exited]

ENVIRONMENT
       JAVACMD
              Specify the java command to be used for running the Scala code.  Arguments may be specified as part of the environment variable; spaces, quotation marks, etc., will be passed  directly  to  the
              shell for expansion.

       JAVA_HOME
              Specify JDK/JRE home directory. This directory is used to locate the java command unless JAVACMD variable set.

       JAVA_OPTS
              Specify the options to be passed to the java command defined by JAVACMD.

              With Java 1.5 (or newer) one may for example configure the memory usage of the JVM as follows: JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx512M -Xms16M -Xss16M"

              With GNU Java one may configure the memory usage of the GIJ as follows: JAVA_OPTS="--mx512m --ms16m"

EXIT STATUS
       fsc returns a zero exit status if it succeeds to compile the specified input files. Non zero is returned in case of failure.
