SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       ts_filter is a simple filter to extract a single MPEG stream from a multiplexed MPEG Transport stream. It may be used with dvbstream and other MPEG programs to extract a single stream for display.

       ts_filter takes the PID of the stream to extract on the command line, and filters the standard input, outputting to standard output.
