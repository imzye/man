SYNOPSIS

       The program accepts following arguments:

       -h, -help
               Show usage and exit.

       -version
               Show version and exit.

       -c, -components
               List installed components.

       -f, -files
               List installed files.

       -list   List installed egg versions in a format suitable for use with chicken-install(1)'s -override or -from-list options.

       -match  Treat NAME as a glob pattern.

       -host   When cross-compiling, only show host extensions.

       -target
               When cross-compiling, only show target extensions.  “override” format.

       -cached
               List eggs that are currently cached.
