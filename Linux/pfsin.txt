NAME
       pfsin - Read an image in one of the several formats and write pfs stream to the standard output

SYNOPSIS
       pfsin <file> [<file>...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  can be used to read high- or low- dynamic range image in several recognized formats and output pfs stream on standard output. The pfs stream is usually piped to another program for fur‐
       ther processing (see examples). To get a list of recognized formats and extensions, execute:

         pfsin --help

       This command is a front-end for pfsin* programs for reading images: pfsinrgbe, pfsinexr, etc. Based on the file extension, appropriate program is executed. If two different file format  are  given  as
       parameters,  two  different  program for loading images are executed. Additional options starting with dash '-' can be passed to pfsin* programs. The following rules apply for passing the options: the
       options given before any image file name (or %d pattern) are passed to all pfsin* programs. Options given after image file name are only passed to the program executed for that file(s). Note also that
       all option that take an argument (except --frames) must given in the form --option=value, that is without a space between an option and its argument.

OPTIONS
       The following options are shared by most pfsin* commands, although some may not accept --absolute and may ignore --linear.

       --frames <range>
              Range is given in mathlab / octave format:

              startframe:step:endframe

              Frame  numbers  start with startframe (default 0), are increased by step (default 1) and stop at endframe You can skip one of those values, for example 1:100 for frames 1,2,...,100 and 0:2: for
              frames 0,2,4,... up to the last file that exists.

       --skip-missing
              Skip up to ten frames in a row if corresponding files are missing. Otherwise the program stops reading sequence at the first file that does not exists. This switch does not apply to  the  first
              frame in a sequence. This switch can be useful if there is a rendered animation where some of the frame has not been generated.

       --linear, -l
              Converts pixel values to linear luminance (XYZ), assuming the sRGB color space for the input image. The maximum pixel value (255,255,255) is mapped to Y=1. LUMINANCE tag is set to RELATIVE.

       --absolute <max_lum>, -a <max_lum>
              --absolute  converts  pixel values to an absolute linear luminance (XYZ), that is the color space, in which channel Y contains luminance given in cd/m^2. The sRGB color space is assumed for the
              input image. The maximum pixel value (255,255,255) is mapped to Y=<max_lum>. <max_lum> is typically set to 80 [cd/m^2] for a CRT monitor. LUMINANCE tag is set to  ABSOLUTE.  --absolute  process
              images almost the same as --relative, but additionally it scales all pixels by <max_lum>.

EXAMPLES
       pfsin memorial.pic | pfsview

              See a hdr image in Radiance format (RGBE).

       pfsin memorial.pic | pfstmo_drago03 | pfsout memorial.jpeg

              Tone map a hdr image and save it as JPEG.

BUGS
       For LDR formats - JPEG, PNG, PNM: If pfstools are compiled without ImageMagic support, this command currently will not handle multiple frames given with a %d pattern.
