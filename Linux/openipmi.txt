NAME
       openipmi_cmdparms - Connection parmeters for OpenIPMI

SYNOPSIS
       smi smi-num

       lan [-U username] [-P password] [-p[2] port] [-A authtype] [-L privilege] [-s] [-Ra auth alg] [-Ri integ alg] [-Rc conf algo] [-Rl] [-Rk bmc key] [-H hackname] host [ host]

DESCRIPTION
       The connection parameters for OpenIPMI vary depending on the connection type.  This document describes the standard connection types; others may be available from OEMs.

OPTIONS
       smi-num
              The SMI interface for the local connection.  There may be more than one BMC connection on a system and they are generally numbered, like /dev/ipmi0, /dev/ipmi1, etc.

       -U username
              Use the given username for the LAN connection.  If none is given, then no username is used.

       -P password
              The password to use for the connection.  If none is given, the user is assumed to have an empty password

       -p[2] port
              The  UCP  port to connect to.  This defaults to the standard 623 port, so it is not necessary unless a special port is required.  Note that since you can have two connections (hosts), -p is
              for the first host and -p2 is for the second host.

       -A authtype
              The authentication type to use, one of rmcp+, md5, md2, straight, or none.  If you don't supply this, the most secure one available is chosen, in the order given in the previous list.

       -L privilege
              The privilege to use for the connection.  Lower privileges cannot execute some commands.  Privileges are: callback, user, operator, admin, and oem.  The default is admin.

       -Ra authentication algorithm
              Set the RMCP+ authentication algorithm to use.  Options are: bmcpick, rakp_none, rakp_hmac_sha1, and rakp_hmac_md5.  The bmcpick option is used by default, which means the BMC picks the al‐
              gorithm it wants to use.

       -Ri integrity algorithm
              The RMCP+ integrity algorithm to use.  This ensures that the data has not be altered between the sender and receiver.  Valid options are: bmcpick, none, hmac_sha1, hmac_md5, and  md5.   The
              bmcpick option is used by default, which means the BMC picks the algorithm it wants to use.

       -Rc confidentiality algorithm
              The RMCP+ confidentiality (encryption) algorithm to use.  This keeps evesdroppers from seeing the data.  Valid values are: bmcpick, aes_cbc_128, xrc4_128, and xrc_40.  The bmcpick option is
              used by default, which means the BMC picks the algorithm it wants to use.

       -Rl    If this is specified, the username is looked up using the privilege level along with the username.  This allows the same name to have different passwords with different privilege levels.

       -Rk BMC Key
              If the system requires two-key lookups, this specifies the second key (the BMC key) to use.  This is ignored if two-key lookups are not enabled by the BMC.

       -H hackname
              Well,  it  always happens.  Things in the field don't work quite like they are supposed to.  There was some vagueness in the first IPMI specs and different vendors interpreted RMCP+ in dif‐
              ferent ways.  This allows different options to be supported.  Try different hacks if your RMCP+ systems don't authenticate properly.  These are:

              rakp3_wrong_rolem
                     Some systems use the incorrect Role(m) field in a specific authentication message (the RAKP3 message).  This is a common problem.

              rmcpp_integ_sik
                     The original IPMI 2.0 spec specified the incorrect key to use for the integrity key.  This forces use of the Session Initiation Key.  The default is to use K(1)

       -s     Make two connections to the BMC.  This means the BMC has two different IP addresses/ports that are equivalent.  If this is specified, a second host must be supplied.  This is not  the  same
              as two connections to two different BMCs.  This must be a connection to the same BMC.

       host   The IP address (either by name lookup or specified directly) to connect to.  If the -s is specified, two hosts must be supplied.

       The -Ra, -Ri, -Rc, -Rk and -Rl options only apply to RMCP+ connections and will be ignored if the connection does not support RMCP+ or if a non-RMCP+ authentication type is specified.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
       This is excessively complicated, but the defaults should be good.
