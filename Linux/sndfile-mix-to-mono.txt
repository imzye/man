NAME
       sndfile-mix-to-mono - mix a multi-channel sound file to mono

SYNOPSIS
       sndfile-mix-to-mono <multi-channel input file> <mono output file>

DESCRIPTION
       sndfile-mix-to-mono  reads a multi-channel input file and writes a single channel output file consisting of all of the input channels mixed together (like a audio mixing desk would do).  The input and
       output files are read/written using libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/).

       The format of the output file is determined by the filename extension of the output file.
