NAME
       chchp - modify channel-path state.

SYNOPSIS
       chchp [-v|--vary value] [-c|--configure value]
             [-a|--attribute key=value] chpid
             [-h|--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       The  chchp  command modifies the state of one or more channel-paths.  Channel-path identifiers are specified in hexadecimal notation either simply as the CH‐
       PID-number (e.g. e0) or in the form

              <cssid>.<id>

       where <cssid> is the channel-subsystem identifier and <id> is the CHPID-number (e.g. 0.7e).

       An operation can be performed on more than one channel-path by specifying multiple identifiers as a blank or comma-separated list or a range or a combination
       of both (see EXAMPLES section).

       Note  that modifying the state of channel-paths can affect the availability of I/O devices as well as trigger associated functions (e.g. channel-path verifi‐
       cation or device scanning) which in turn can result in a temporary increase in processor, memory and I/O load.

OPTIONS
       -v value
       --vary value
              Change the logical channel-path state to value.  The logical channel-path state determines whether Linux will be actively  using  a  channel-path  for
              I/O.

              A value of "0" specifies the logical offline state. A value of "1" specifies the logical online state.

              Note that setting the logical state to offline may cause a currently running I/O operation to be aborted.

       -c value
       --configure value
              Change the channel-path configuration state to value.

              A value of "0" specifies standby state. A value of "1" specifies configured state.

              Note that setting the configured state to standby may cause a currently running I/O operation to be aborted.

       -a key=value
       --attribute key=value
              Change the channel-path sysfs attribute key to value.

              key  can  be  the  name of any available channel-path sysfs attribute (e.g. "configure" or "status"), while value can take any valid value that may be
              written to the attribute (e.g. "0" or "offline").

              This is a more generic way of modifying the state of a channel-path via the sysfs interface. It is intended for cases where sysfs attributes or attri‐
              bute values are available in the kernel but not in chchp.

       -h
       --help
              Print a short help text, then exit.

       -V
       --version
              Print version number, then exit.

EXAMPLES
       chchp -c 0 19
              Put channel-path 0.19 into standby state.

       chchp -a configure=0 19
              Write value "0" into sysfs attribute "configure" of channel-path 0.19. The result is the same as when using the command chchp -c 0 19

       chchp -c 1 0.65-0.6f
              Put channel-paths 0.65 to 0.6f into configured state.

       chchp -v 0 0.12,0.7f,0.17-0.20
              Put channel-paths 0.12, 0.7f and 0.17 to 0.20 into logical offline state.
