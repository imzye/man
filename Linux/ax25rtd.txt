AX25RTD(8)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                AX25RTD(8)

NAME
       ax25rtd - AX.25 routing daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ax25rtd

DESCRIPTION
       ax25rtd is a daemon that:

       - emulates the ceased "autorouter" of Linux Kernel AX.25
       - sets up ARP entries automagically
       - may adjust IP routes and encapsulation mode
         (although I really do not recomment to use this feature...)

       The  "autorouter"  is  not really an autorouter. It just listens to the
       AX.25 traffic on your ports and uses this information  to  setup  AX.25
       routes. This can be turned on or off by altering the configuration file
       /etc/ax25/ax25rtd.conf.

       Ax25rtd provides a socket /var/ax25/ax25rtd/control which is  used  for
       runtime maintainance through ax25rtctl or to set up new routes by other
       daemons (a Flexnet router, perhaps?)

       On startup ax25rtd reads the configuration file and afterwards preloads
       the   caches   from   the   files   /var/ax25/ax25rtd/ax25_routes   and
       /var/ax25/ax25rtd/ip_routes. On SIGTERM or ax25rtctl  --save  it  saves
       the caches to those files.

FILES
       /etc/ax25/ax25rtd.conf
