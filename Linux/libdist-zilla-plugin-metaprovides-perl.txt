NAME
       Dist::Zilla::MetaProvides::ProvideRecord - Data Management Record for MetaProvider::Provides Based Class

VERSION
       version 2.002004

PUBLIC METHODS
   copy_into "( \%provides_list )"
       Populate the referenced %provides_list with data from this Provide Record object.

       This is called by the  Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider::Provider Role.

       This is very convenient if you have an array full of these objects, for you can just do

           my %discovered;
           for ( @array ) {
              $_->copy_into( \%discovered );
           }

       and %discovered will be populated with relevant data.
