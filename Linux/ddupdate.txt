NAME
       ddupdate.conf - ddupdate configuration file.

SYNOPSIS
       The ddupdate.conf file holds default values for all ddupdate(8) options. Since ddupdate normally is invoked without command line parameters, this file then represents the used option values.

BASIC FILE FORMAT
       The  file  is formatted according to the rules use by the python3 configparser module.  Basically, this is a leading [update] line followed by by  key = value lines. The key represents the command
       line option, and value the value of said option.

       The actual options available are documented in ddupdate(8).

EXTENDED FORMAT FOR MULTIPLE HOSTS
       File has experimental support for updating multiple services. This is done using multiple [hostname] sections. The hostname is an arbitrary string without whitespace. Each  section  has  the  same
       syntax as the BASIC FILE FORMAT [update] section.
