NAME
       goiardi - A Chef server written in Go

DESCRIPTION
   Usage:
              goiardi [OPTIONS]

   Application Options:
       -v, --version
              Print version info.

       -V, --verbose
              Show verbose debug information. Repeat for more verbosity.

       -c, --config=
              Specify a config file to use.

       -I, --ipaddress=
              Listen on a specific IP address.

       -H, --hostname=
              Hostname to use for this server. Defaults to hostname reported by the kernel.

       -P, --port=
              Port to listen on. If port is set to 443, SSL will be activated. (default: 4545)

       -Z, --proxy-hostname=
              Hostname to report to clients if this goiardi server is behind a proxy using a different hostname. See also --proxy-port. Can be used with --proxy-port or alone, or not at all.

       -W, --proxy-port=
              Port to report to clients if this goiardi server is behind a proxy using a different port than the port goiardi is listening on. Can be used with --proxy-hostname or alone, or not at all.

       -i, --index-file=
              File to save search index data to.

       -D, --data-file=
              File to save data store data to.

       -F, --freeze-interval=
              Interval in seconds to freeze in-memory data structures to disk if there have been any changes (requires -i/--index-file and -D/--data-file options to be set). (Default 10 seconds.)

       -L, --log-file=
              Log to file X

       -s, --syslog
              Log to syslog rather than a log file. Incompatible with -L/--log-file.

       --time-slew=
              Time difference allowed between the server's clock and the time in the X-OPS-TIMESTAMP header. Formatted like 5m, 150s, etc. Defaults to 15m.

       --conf-root=
              Root directory for configs and certificates. Default: the directory the config file is in, or the current directory if no config file is set.

       -A, --use-auth
              Use authentication. Default: false.

       --use-ssl
              Use  SSL  for  connections.  If  --port  is  set to 433, this will automatically be turned on. If it is set to 80, it will automatically be turned off. Default: off. Requires --ssl-cert and
              --ssl-key.

       --ssl-cert=
              SSL certificate file. If a relative path, will be set relative to --conf-root.

       --ssl-key=
              SSL key file. If a relative path, will be set relative to --conf-root.

       --https-urls
              Use 'https://' in URLs to server resources if goiardi is not using SSL for its connections. Useful when goiardi is sitting behind a reverse proxy that uses SSL, but  is  communicating  with
              the proxy over HTTP.

       --disable-webui
              If enabled, disables connections and logins to goiardi over the webui interface.

       --use-mysql
              Use a MySQL database for data storage. Configure database options in the config file.

       --use-postgresql
              Use a PostgreSQL database for data storage. Configure database options in the config file.

       --local-filestore-dir=
              Directory to save uploaded files in. Optional when running in in-memory mode, *mandatory* (unless using S3 uploads) for SQL mode.

       --log-events
              Log changes to chef objects.

       -K, --log-event-keep=
              Number of events to keep in the event log. If set, the event log will be checked periodically and pruned to this number of entries.

       -x, --export=
              Export all server data to the given file, exiting afterwards. Should be used with caution. Cannot be used at the same time as -m/--import.

       -m, --import=
              Import data from the given file, exiting afterwards. Cannot be used at the same time as -x/--export.

       -Q, --obj-max-size=
              Maximum object size in bytes for the file store. Default 10485760 bytes (10MB).

       -j, --json-req-max-size=
              Maximum size for a JSON request from the client. Per chef-pedant, default is 1000000.

       --use-unsafe-mem-store
              Use  the  faster, but less safe, old method of storing data in the in-memory data store with pointers, rather than encoding the data with gob and giving a new copy of the object to each re‐
              questor. If this is enabled goiardi will run faster in in-memory mode, but one goroutine could change an object while it's being used by another. Has no effect when using an SQL backend.

       --db-pool-size=
              Number of idle db connections to maintain. Only useful when using one of the SQL backends. Default is 0 - no idle connections retained

       --max-connections=
              Maximum number of connections allowed for the database. Only useful when using one of the SQL backends. Default is 0 - unlimited.

       --use-serf
              If set, have goidari use serf to send and receive events and queries from a serf cluster. Required for shovey.

       --serf-event-announce
              Announce log events and joining the serf cluster over serf, as serf events. Requires --use-serf.

       --serf-addr=
              IP address and port to use for RPC communication with a serf agent. Defaults to 127.0.0.1:7373.

       --use-shovey
              Enable using shovey for sending jobs to nodes. Requires --use-serf.

       --sign-priv-key=
              Path to RSA private key used to sign shovey requests.

       --dot-search
              If set, searches will use . to separate elements instead of _.

       --convert-search
              If set, convert _ syntax searches to . syntax. Only useful if --dot-search is set.

       --pg-search
              Use the new Postgres based search engine instead of the default ersatz Solr. Requires --use-postgresql, automatically turns on --dot-search. --convert-search is  recommended,  but  not  re‐
              quired.

       --use-statsd
              Whether or not to collect statistics about goiardi and send them to statsd.

       --statsd-addr=
              IP address and port of statsd instance to connect to. (default 'localhost:8125')

       --statsd-type=
              statsd format, can be either 'standard' or 'datadog' (default 'standard')

       --statsd-instance=
              Statsd instance name to use for this server. Defaults to the server's hostname, with '.' replaced by '_'.

       --use-s3-upload
              Store cookbook files in S3 rather than locally in memory or on disk. This or --local-filestore-dir must be set in SQL mode. Cannot be used with in-memory mode.

       --aws-region=
              AWS region to use S3 uploads.

       --s3-bucket=
              The name of the S3 bucket storing the files.

       --aws-disable-ssl
              Set to disable SSL for the endpoint. Mostly useful just for testing.

       --s3-endpoint=
              Set a different endpoint than the default s3.amazonaws.com. Mostly useful for testing with a fake S3 service, or if using an S3-compatible service.

       --s3-file-period=
              Length of time, in minutes, to allow files to be saved to or retrieved from S3 by the client. Defaults to 15 minutes.

   Help Options:
