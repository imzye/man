NAME
       enblend - combine images using a multiresolution spline

SYNOPSIS
       enblend [options] [--output=IMAGE] INPUT...

DESCRIPTION
       Blend INPUT images into a single IMAGE.

       INPUT... are image filenames or response filenames.  Response filenames start with an "@" character.

OPTIONS
   Common options:
       -l, --levels=LEVELS
              limit number of blending LEVELS to use (1 to 29); negative number of LEVELS decreases maximum; "auto" restores the default automatic maximization

       -o, --output=FILE
              write output to FILE; default: "a.tif"

       -v, --verbose[=LEVEL]
              verbosely report progress; repeat to increase verbosity or directly set to LEVEL

       --compression=COMPRESSION
              set  compression  of  output  image  to COMPRESSION, where COMPRESSION is: "deflate", "jpeg", "lzw", "none", "packbits", for TIFF files and 0 to 100, or "jpeg", "jpeg-arith" for JPEG files,
              where "jpeg" and "jpeg-arith" accept a compression level

   Advanced options:
       --blend-colorspace=COLORSPACE
              force COLORSPACE for blending operations; Enblend uses "CIELUV" for images with ICC-profile and "IDENTITY" for those without and also for all floating-point images;  other  available  blend
              color spaces are "CIELAB" and "CIECAM"

       -c, --ciecam
              use CIECAM02 to blend colors; disable with "--no-ciecam"; note that this option will be withdrawn in favor of "--blend-colorspace"

       -d, --depth=DEPTH
              set the number of bits per channel of the output image, where DEPTH is "8", "16", "32", "r32", or "r64"

       -f WIDTHxHEIGHT[+xXOFFSET+yYOFFSET]
              manually set the size and position of the output image; useful for cropped and shifted input TIFF images, such as those produced by Nona

       -g     associated-alpha hack for Gimp (before version 2) and Cinepaint

       -w, --wrap[=MODE]
              wrap around image boundary, where MODE is "none", "horizontal", "vertical", or "both"; default: none; without argument the option selects horizontal wrapping

   Mask generation options:
       --coarse-mask[=FACTOR] shrink overlap regions by FACTOR to speedup mask
              generation; this is the default; if omitted FACTOR defaults to 8

       --fine-mask
              generate mask at full image resolution; use e.g.  if overlap regions are very narrow

       --optimize
              turn on mask optimization; this is the default; disable with "--no-optimize"

       --save-masks[=TEMPLATE]
              save generated masks in TEMPLATE; default: "mask-%n.tif"; conversion chars: "%i": mask index, "%n": mask number, "%p": full path, "%d": dirname, "%b": basename, "%f": filename, "%e": exten‐
              sion; lowercase characters refer to input images uppercase to the output image

       --load-masks[=TEMPLATE]
              use existing masks in TEMPLATE instead of generating them; same template characters as "--save-masks"; default: "mask-%n.tif"

       --visualize[=TEMPLATE] save results of optimizer in TEMPLATE; same template
              characters as "--save-masks"; default: "vis-%n.tif"

   Expert options:
       -a, --pre-assemble
              pre-assemble non-overlapping images; negate with "--no-pre-assemble"

       -x     checkpoint partial results

       --fallback-profile=PROFILE-FILE
              use the ICC profile from PROFILE-FILE instead of sRGB

       --layer-selector=ALGORITHM
              set the layer selector ALGORITHM; default: "all-layers"; available algorithms are: "all-layers": select all layers in any image; "first-layer": select only first layer in each (multi-)layer
              image;  "last-layer": select only last layer in each (multi-)layer image; "largest-layer": select largest layer in each (multi-)layer image; "no-layer": do not select any layer from any im‐
              age;

       --parameter=KEY1[=VALUE1][:KEY2[=VALUE2][:...]]
              set one or more KEY-VALUE pairs

   Expert mask generation options:
       --primary-seam-generator=ALGORITHM
              use main seam finder ALGORITHM, where ALGORITHM is "nearest-feature-transform" or "graph-cut"; default: "graph-cut"

       --image-difference=ALGORITHM[:LUMINANCE-WEIGHT[:CHROMINANCE-WEIGHT]]
              use ALGORITHM for calculation of the difference image, where ALGORITHM is "max-hue-luminance" or "delta-e"; LUMINANCE-WEIGHT and CHROMINANCE-WEIGHT  define  the  weights  of  lightness  and
              color; default: delta-e:1:1

       --optimizer-weights=DISTANCE-WEIGHT[:MISMATCH-WEIGHT]
              set the optimizer's weigths for distance and mismatch; default: 8:1

       --mask-vectorize=LENGTH
              set LENGTH of single seam segment; append "%" for relative value; defaults: 4 for coarse masks and 20 for fine masks

       --anneal=TAU[:DELTAE-MAX[:DELTAE-MIN[:K-MAX]]]
              set annealing parameters of optimizer strategy 1; defaults: 0.75:7000:5:32

       --dijkstra=RADIUS
              set search RADIUS of optimizer strategy 2; default: 25 pixels

   Information options:
       -h, --help
              print this help message and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       --show-globbing-algorithms
              show all globbing algorithms

       --show-image-formats
              show all recognized image formats and their filename extensions

       --show-signature
              show who compiled the binary when and on which machine

       --show-software-components
              show the software components with which Enblend was compiled

       Enblend accepts arguments to any option in uppercase as well as in lowercase letters.

ENVIRONMENT
       OMP_NUM_THREADS
              The OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable sets the number of threads to use in OpenMP parallel regions.  If unset Enblend uses as many threads as there are CPUs.

       OMP_DYNAMIC
              The OMP_DYNAMIC environment variable controls dynamic adjustment of the number of threads to use in executing OpenMP parallel regions.
