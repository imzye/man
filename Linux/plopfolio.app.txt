NAME
       PlopFolio - Personal dashboard for GNUstep

SYNOPSIS
       PlopFolio

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the PlopFolio command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       PlopFolio  is  a free replacement of Serence's proprietary KlipFolio application.  PlopFolio supports Klips available from KlipFarm (now defunct). PlopFolio is developed using the Objective-C lan‐
       guage and works well with GNUstep (on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and more) and Cocoa on Mac OS X.

       Klip files could be downloaded from http://klipfarm.com, but this site is no longer available.  There are probably still some files floating over the Internet, and of course there's always an  op‐
       tion to write such file by hand.

SEE ALSO
       Grr(1), GNUstep(7).
