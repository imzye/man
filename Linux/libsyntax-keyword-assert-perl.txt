Syntax::Keyword::Assert(3pm)                                                        User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                        Syntax::Keyword::Assert(3pm)

NAME
       Syntax::Keyword::Assert - assert keyword for Perl with zero runtime cost

SYNOPSIS
           use Syntax::Keyword::Assert;

           my $obj = bless {}, "Foo";
           assert($obj isa "Bar");
           # => Assertion failed (Foo=HASH(0x11e022818) isa "Bar")

DESCRIPTION
       Syntax::Keyword::Assert provides a syntax extension for Perl that introduces a "assert" keyword.

       By default assertions are enabled, but can be disabled by setting $ENV{PERL_ASSERT_ENABLED} to false before this module is loaded:

           BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_ASSERT_ENABLED} = 0 }  # Disable assertions

       When assertions are disabled, the "assert" are completely ignored at compile phase, resulting in zero runtime cost. This makes Syntax::Keyword::Assert ideal for use in production environments, as
       it does not introduce any performance penalties when assertions are not needed.

KEYWORDS
   assert
           assert(EXPR)

       If EXPR is truthy in scalar context, then happens nothing. Otherwise, it dies with a user-friendly error message.

       Here are some examples:

           assert("apple" eq "banana");  # => Assertion failed ("apple" eq "banana")
           assert(123 != 123);           # => Assertion failed (123 != 123)
           assert(1 > 10);               # => Assertion failed (1 > 10)

SEE ALSO
       PerlX::Assert
           This module also uses keyword plugin, but it depends on Keyword::Simple. And this module's error message does not include the failed expression.

       Devel::Assert
           This module provides a similar functionality, but it dose not use a keyword plugin.
