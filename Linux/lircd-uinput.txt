LIRCD-UINPUT(8)             System Managers Manual             LIRCD-UINPUT(8)

NAME
       lircd-uinput - Forward lirc button presses as uinput events

SYNOPSIS
       lircd-uinput [options]... [lircd output socket]
       lircd-uinput [options]... [file]

DESCRIPTION
       lircd-uinput  reads  decoded button press events from a lircd(8) output
       socket and injects these as key events to  the  kernel  uinput  device.
       The  kernel  makes  these  events  available to other applications on a
       /dev/input/event device, just as for regular input hardware.

       lircd-uinput is designed to run as a systemd service.

       The lircd output socket argument is an optional path to the lircd  out‐
       put  socket.  It defaults to the output value in the [lircd] section of
       the lirc_options config file, falling back to /var/run/lirc/lircd.

       If a plain file is given instead of a socket it is supposed to  contain
       button press events formatted as documented in lircd(8) .  lircd-uinput
       will in this case send the codes in this file and exit.

       In order to work, release events must be sent  to  the  uinput  device.
       See REPEAT HANDLING.

       lircd-uinput  can  only  handle  button events named using the official
       namespace i. e., buttons known to the kernel. See NOTES.

       Unless the /dev/uinput  default  permissions  are  changed  lirc-uinput
       needs to run as root. See NOTES.

       The  /dev/input/event  device  created  by  the kernel can be tricky to
       locate, and is not stable.  See NOTES.

OPTIONS
       -u --uinput <device>
              uinput kernel device, defaults to /dev/uinput.

       -r --release-suffix <suffix>
              lircd-uinput generates different events depending on if the but‐
              ton name ends with the release-suffix or not.  Defaults to _EVUP
              . See REPEAT HANDLING

       -R --repeat <delay[,period] | ,period>
              Set kernel autorepeat parameters of the created /dev/input/event
              device.   delay is the time before repeating a key event, period
              is the time between repeated key events.   Both  values  are  in
              milliseconds,  separated  by a comma.  Any  value can be omitted
              or set to 0 in which case the kernel/system defaults  are  used.
              See REPEAT HANDLING.

       -a --add-release-events
              Generate  synthetic  release  events.   This option is mandatory
              unless lircd is using  the  deprecated  --release  option.   The
              timeout  used  can  be modified using the release-timeout key in
              the lircd-uinput section of the lirc_options.conf file.  Useless
              if used with a text file as input.  . See REPEAT HANDLING

       -d --disabled <disabled buttons file path>
              The  path  of  a  file which contains name of buttons to be dis‐
              abled, one per line.  By default, lircd-uinput sends all buttons
              found in input.  See NOTES.

       -O --options-file <path>
              Options    file    holding    default    values.   Defaults   to
              /etc/lircd/lirc_options.conf

       -L, --logfile <logfile path>
              Select the log file, either the string 'syslog' indicating  that
              syslog(1)  should be used or a log file path.  The default is to
              use syslog.

       -D, --loglevel [level]
              Determine the amount of logging information.   level  can  be  a
              symbolic  syslog  level:  'error','warning,  'info', 'notice' or
              ´debug'.  lircd-uinput  also  defines  three  additional  levels
              'trace',  'trace1'  and  'trace2' which gives even more messages
              ('trace2' bringing the most).  However, in the  log  these  mes‐
              sages are marked as 'debug'.

       -h --help
              Display usage summary.

       -v --version
              Display version info.

REPEAT HANDLING
       After  receiving a keypress event the kernel will start emitting repeat
       events to applications until lircd-uinput emits a corresponding release
       event.   The release events could be created by lircd(8) using the dep‐
       recated --release option.  Such events typically has  an  _EVUP  suffix
       appended to the original keypress event.

       The preferred way is that lircd-uinput creates release events using the
       --add-release-events option.  Combining both  of  these  options  might
       give unexpected results.

       Note that the linux kernel uses the suffix _UP (which was used py lircd
       prior to 0.10.0) for other purposes since 4.7.

       In any case, the repeat events generated by the kernel can  be  tweaked
       using  the  --repeat option. This can set the time between the keypress
       event and the first repeat event  and  the  time  between  each  repeat
       event.   The --repeat option should only be used if no other program or
       udev rule is automatically setting up key repeat parameters.  By design
       the repeat parameters can't be set in an atomic way during input device
       registration so this option is prone to race conditions.

       Note that the lircd-uinput repeat-event handling differs from  lircd(8)
       which   implements (emulates) hardware autorepeat in the events sent to
       uinput (event.value  ==  2).   lircd-uinput  only  sends  keypress  and
       release events, trusting the kernel autorepeat support.

NOTES
       By  default,  the  dev/uinput device is not writable for regular users.
       Thus lircd-uinput needs to run as root  unless  these  permissions  are
       changed.

       One  way  to  achieve this is an udev rule.  The lirc distribution con‐
       tains an example rule which makes the lircd-uinput device writable  for
       users  in  the  group  lirc.   Another  way is to use lircd-setup(8) to
       change the permissions. As distributed, the lirc_options.conf file con‐
       tains an commented example using setfacl(1) .

       lircd-uinput  can  only forward lircd button events with names from the
       legal namespace defined by the kernel.  A  complete  list  of  possible
       button  names   is  available in /usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h
       and also using irrecord -l .  Other button names are silently dropped.

       The event keycode depends on the name that was given a  button  in  the
       lircd config file e.g., if the button is named KEY_1 the keycode 1 will
       be generated.

       The kernel makes the events generated by lircd-uinput  available  on  a
       /dev/input  device  like  /dev/input/event12.   This device name is not
       stable and typically varies after a reboot.  The lirc distribution con‐
       tains  a  udev  rule  which  if  installed  creates a device link named
       /dev/lircd-uinput which always can be used.

       lircd-uinput is designed to replace the currently  deprecated  --uinput
       option  to  lircd(8).  However, lircd-uinput forwards all events unless
       blocked by the --disabled option.  On the other  hand,  lircd  --uinput
       does not forward all events - the heuristics used has been changed over
       versions.

BUGS
       Since the device name is fixed, only one instance of  lircd-uinput  can
       run on a system.
