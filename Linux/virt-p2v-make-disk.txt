NAME
       virt-p2v-make-disk - Build the virt-p2v disk using virt-builder

SYNOPSIS
        virt-p2v-make-disk -o /dev/sdX [os-version]

DESCRIPTION
       virt-p2v(1) converts a physical machine to run virtualized on KVM, managed by libvirt, OpenStack, oVirt, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation (RHEV), or one of the other targets supported by virt-v2v(1).

       virt-p2v-make-disk is a script which creates a bootable disk image or USB key containing virt-p2v.  It uses virt-builder(1) to do this, and is just a small shell script around virt-builder.

       The required -o parameter specifies where the output should go, for example to a USB key (eg. "-o /dev/sdX") or to a file.  If you pass a device name, then the existing contents of the device will be
       erased.

       The root user on the disk image uses "p2v" as its initial password.

   "os-version" parameter
       The optional "os-version" parameter is the base Linux distro to use for the operating system on the ISO.  If you don't set this parameter, the script tries to choose a suitable default for you.  Most
       users should not use the "os-version" parameter.

       The base OS selected for virt-p2v is not related in any way to the OS of the physical machine that you are trying to convert.

       To list possible "os-version" combinations, do:

        virt-builder -l

EXAMPLES
       Write a virt-p2v bootable USB key on /dev/sdX (any existing content on /dev/sdX is erased):

        virt-p2v-make-disk -o /dev/sdX

       Write a virt-p2v bootable virtual disk image, and boot it under qemu:

        virt-p2v-make-disk -o /var/tmp/p2v.img
        qemu-kvm -m 1024 -boot c \
          -drive file=/var/tmp/p2v.img,if=virtio,index=0 \
          -drive file=/var/tmp/guest.img,if=virtio,index=1

       where /var/tmp/guest.img would be the disk image of some guest that you want to convert (for testing only).

ADDING EXTRA PACKAGES
       You can install extra packages using the --install option.  This can be useful for making a more fully-featured virt-p2v disk with extra tools for debugging and troubleshooting.  Give a list of
       packages, separated by commas.  For example:

        virt-p2v-make-disk -o /var/tmp/p2v.img --install tcpdump,traceroute

ADDING AN SSH IDENTITY
       You can inject an SSH identity (private key) file to the image using the --inject-ssh-identity option.

       First create a key pair.  It must have an empty passphrase:

        ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f id_rsa

       This creates a private key ("id_rsa") and a public key ("id_rsa.pub") pair.  The public key should be appended to the "authorized_keys" file on the virt-v2v conversion server (usually to
       "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys").

       The private key should be injected into the disk image and then discarded:

        virt-p2v-make-disk [...] --inject-ssh-identity id_rsa
        rm id_rsa

       When booting virt-p2v, specify the URL of the injected file like this:

        │         User name: [root_____________________________] │
        │                                                        │
        │          Password: [    <leave this field blank>     ] │
        │                                                        │
        │  SSH Identity URL: [file:///var/tmp/id_rsa___________] │

       or if using the kernel command line, add:

        p2v.identity=file:///var/tmp/id_rsa

       For more information, see "SSH IDENTITIES" in virt-p2v(1).

32 BIT VIRT-P2V
       For improved compatibility with older hardware, virt-p2v-make-disk has an --arch option.  The most useful setting (on x86-64 hosts) is --arch i686, which builds a 32 bit virt-p2v environment that will
       work on older hardware.  32 bit virt-p2v can convert 64 bit physical machines and can interoperate with 64 bit virt-v2v and 64 bit hypervisors.

       This option requires that you have built virt-p2v.$arch (ie.  usually virt-p2v.i686) by some means, and that you install it next to the ordinary virt-p2v binary (eg. in $libdir/virt-p2v/ or
       $VIRT_V2V_DATA_DIR).  This is outside the scope of this manual page, but you can find some tips in "BUILDING i686 32 BIT VIRT-P2V" in p2v-building(1).

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display help.

       --arch ARCH
           Set the architecture of the virt-p2v ISO.  See "32 BIT VIRT-P2V" above.

           If this option is not supplied, then the default is to use the same architecture as the host that is running virt-p2v-make-disk.

       --inject-ssh-identity id_rsa
           Add an SSH identity (private key) file into the image.  See "ADDING AN SSH IDENTITY" above.

       --install pkg,pkg,...
           Add extra packages to the image.  See "ADDING EXTRA PACKAGES" above.

       --no-warn-if-partition
           Normally you should not write to a partition on a USB drive (ie. don’t use "-o /dev/sdX1", use "-o /dev/sdX" to make a bootable USB drive).  If you do this, virt-builder prints a warning.  This
           option suppresses that warning.

       -o OUTPUT
       --output OUTPUT
           Write output to "OUTPUT", which can be a local file or block device.  The existing contents of the device will be erased.

       -v
       --verbose
           Enable verbose output.  Use this if you need to debug problems with the script or if you are filing a bug.

       -V
       --version
           Display version number and exit.

FILES
       $libdir/virt-p2v/virt-p2v.xz
           The virt-p2v(1) binary which is copied into the bootable disk image.

           The location of the binary can be changed by setting the "VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR" environment variable.

       $datadir/virt-p2v/issue
       $datadir/virt-p2v/launch-virt-p2v.in
       $datadir/virt-p2v/p2v.service
           Various data files that are copied into the bootable disk image.

           The location of these files can be changed by setting the "VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR" environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       "VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR"
           The directory where virt-p2v-make-disk looks for data files (see "FILES" above).  If not set, a compiled-in location is used.
