NAME
       Moose::Autobox::Code - the Code role

VERSION
       version 0.16

SYNOPSIS
         use Moose::Autobox;

         my $adder = sub { $_[0] + $_[1] };
         my $add_2 = $adder->curry(2);

         $add_2->(2); # returns 4

         # create a recursive subroutine
         # using the Y combinator
         *factorial = sub {
             my $f = shift;
             sub {
                 my $n = shift;
                 return 1 if $n < 2;
                 return $n * $f->($n - 1);
             }
         }->y;

         factorial(10) # returns 3628800

DESCRIPTION
       This is a role to describe operations on the Code type.

METHODS
       "curry (@values)"
       "rcurry (@values)"
       "conjoin (\&sub)"
       "disjoin (\&sub)"
       "compose (@subs)"
           This will take a list of @subs and compose them all into a single subroutine where the output of one sub will be the input of another.

       "y" This implements the Y combinator.

       "u" This implements the U combinator.

       "meta"
