NAME
       PostScript::TextBlock - An object that may be used to construct a block of
                       text in PostScript.

SYNOPSIS
           use PostScript::TextBlock;
           my $tb = new PostScript::TextBlock;
           $tb->addText( text => "Hullaballo in Hoosick Falls.\n",
                         font => 'CenturySchL-Ital',
                         size => 24,
                         leading => 26
                        );
           $tb->addText( text => "by Charba Gaspee.\n",
                         font => 'URWGothicL-Demi',
                         size => 12,
                         leading => 14
                        );
           print 'There are '.$tb->numElements.' elements in this object.';
           open OUT, '>psoutput.ps';
           my ($code, $remainder) = $tb->Write(572, 752, 20, 772);
           print OUT $code;

DESCRIPTION
       The PostScript::TextBlock module implements four methods:

       new() - Create a New PostScript::TextBlock object
          This method instantiates a new object of class PostScript::TextBlock.

       addText( text=>$text, [ font=>$font ], [ size=>$size ], [ leading=>$leading ] )
          The  addText()  method  will add a new 'text element' to the TextBlock object. A 'text element' can be thought of as a section of text that has the same characteristics, i.e. all the characters
          are the same font, size and leading.  this representation allows you to include text rendered in multiple fonts at multiple sizes within the same  text  block  by  including  them  as  separate
          elements.

          This method takes up to four attributes (note that the '[]' brackets above indicate that a parameter is optional, not an array reference):

          text  The  text  attribute  is required, though nothing bad will happen if you leave it out. This is simply the text to be rendered in the text block. Line breaks may be inserted by including a
          newline "\n".

          font The font attribute is a string indicating the name of the font to be used to render this element. The PS package uses an internal description of the Font Metrics of various fonts  that  is
          contained in the PostScript::Metrics module. As of this writing, the PostScript::Metrics module supports the following fonts (basically, the default GhostScript fonts that have AFM files):

          NimbusSanL-ReguCond    URWGothicL-Book  CenturySchL-Bold           CharterBT-Italic  URWBookmanL-Ligh          CharterBT-BoldItalic NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal    URWBookmanL-DemiBoldItal CharterBT-
          Roman            NimbusMonL-ReguObli  NimbusSanL-ReguCondItal    CenturySchL-Ital  CenturySchL-BoldItal       URWPalladioL-Roma  URWBookmanL-LighItal        CharterBT-Bold   NimbusSanL-BoldCond
          NimbusMonL-BoldObli    NimbusSanL-BoldCondItal      URWGothicL-DemiObli    NimbusSanL-Regu              URWPalladioL-Bold   NimbusMonL-Regu             NimbusSanL-ReguItal   URWGothicL-BookObli
          URWPalladioL-Ital

          You can get a list of the currently supported fonts with the following:

              use PostScript::Metrics;
              @okfonts = PostScript::Metrics->listFonts();

          NOTE: The font must be available to the PostScript interpreter that is used to render the page described by the program. If the interpreter cannot load the font, it  will  ususally  attempt  to
          substitute a similar font. If a font is substituted with a font with different metrics, lines of text may overrun the right margin of the text block. You have been warned.

          It is very easy to create stylesheets for a document:

              # Define the styles
              #
              %body = ( font => 'URWGothicL-DemiObli', size => 12, leading => 16 );
              %head1 = ( font => 'NimbusSanL-BoldCond', size => 24, leading => 36 );
              %head2 = ( font => 'NimbusSanL-BoldCond', size => 18, leading => 30 );

              # Use them where appropriate
              #
              $tb->addText(text => "Chapter 10\n", %head1);
              $tb->addText(text => "Spokane Sam and His Spongepants\n", %head2);
              $tb->addText(text => "It was a dark and stormy night and Spokane Sam\'s
              Spongepants were thirsty...", %body);

       numElements()
          Returns the number of elements in the text block object. An 'element' is created each time the addText() method is called.

       Write( $width, $height, $xoffset, $yoffset )
          The Write() method will generate the PostScript code that will render the text on a page when passed to a PostScript interpreter such as Ghostscript. The four parameters are expressed in points
          (1/72 inch) and indicate the width and height of the box within which the text should be printed, and the x and y offset of the upper left corner of this box.

          Important: PostScript defines the origin (0,0) as the lower left corner of the page! This *will* mess you up.

          Standard page sizes in points are:

               Paper Size                      Width, Height (in points)
               .........................       .........................

          The  write()  method returns two values: a string consisting of the PostScript code (suitable for printing to a file), and a TextBlock object containing the elements (and partial elements) that
          did not fit within the specified area, if any. If the entire text block fits with the area, the remainder will be undef. The remainder can be used to layout multiple pages and columns, etc.  in
          a  similar  manner  to  most  modern  desktop  publishing  programs.  In  general,  the  write()  method  should be called as in the following, which writes the PostScript code to a file called
          'psoutput.ps':

              open OUT, '>psoutput.ps';
              my ($code, $remainder) = $tb->Write(572, 752, 20, 772);
              print OUT $code;

          To print an entire text block that spans multiple pages, you could do something like this:

          (add enough text to the text block first..)

              open OUT, '>psoutput.ps';
              my $pages = 1;

              # Create the first page
              #
              my ($code, $remainder) = $tb->Write(572, 752, 20, 772);
              print OUT "%%Page:$pages\n";      # this is required by the Adobe
                                                # Document Structuring Conventions
              print OUT $code;
              print OUT "showpage\n";

              # Print the rest of the pages, if any
              #
              while ($remainder->numElements) {
                  $pages++;
                  print OUT "%%Page:$pages\n";
                  ($code, $remainder) = $remainder->Write(572, 752, 20, 772);
                  print OUT $code;
                  print OUT "showpage\n";
              }

          However, if you use the PostScript::Document module to construct generic multi-page PostScript documents, you don't have to worry about this.

A NOTE ABOUT FONT METRICS
       The write() method uses the module PostScript::Metrics to determine the width of each character; widths vary from font to font and character to character.  If you were writing a stright PostScript
       program, you would let the PostScript interpreter do this for you, but in the case of this program, we need  to  know  the  width  of  each  character  in  a  font  within  the  Perl  script.  The
       PostScript::Metrics  module  contains  the  font  metrics  (i.e., a list containing the width of each character in the font) for a bunch of fonts that are listed above under the description of the
       addText() method. This set started with the metrics for all of the default fonts with AFM files that came with GhostScript. It is slowly growing as more fonts are mapped. To add support for a  new
       font,  you  must  create  the  array  with the metrics for that font and add it to the PostScript::Metrics module. For a font with an AFM file, the AFM file can be parsed with Gisle Aas' Font::AFM
       module, available on CPAN.

       Please send all PostScript::Metrics patches to the author at shawn@as220.org.

TODO
       * better compliance with Adobe's Document Structuring Conventions * more font metrics descriptions * make font loading code smarter and more efficient  for  the  interpreter  *  support  a  larger
       character set * it would be nice to add more functions, e.g. Clone() * how about settable defaults?
