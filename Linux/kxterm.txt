NAME
       kxterm - the CERN KUIP terminal emulator

SYNOPSIS
       kxterm [class] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       kxterm  is  a  terminal emulator combining the best features of the (now defunct) Apollo DM pads (like: input and transcript pads, automatic file backup of transcript pad, string search in pads, etc.)
       and the Korn shell emacs-style command line editing and command line recall mechanism.  For more detailed information about the program, please see the online help available from the kxterm Help menu.

       kxterm has a number of X resources which can be set by the user; these are listed in the online help and in the file /etc/X11/app-defaults/KXterm, where the default values are set.  It should be noted
       that  when kxterm is acting as a client for another application, the desired X resource should be prefixed by "Kx" plus the class name of the application.  So for application "Foo" the kxterm resource
       class would be KxFoo, and one would set KxFoo*background, etc.  One can also set the resource class of a kxterm window via the command-line with the class argument.

OPTIONS

       -geometry geom
              Specifies the preferred size and position of the kxterm window; see X(7x) for details.

       -iconic
              Specifies that the window manager should start kxterm as an icon.

       -tfont fn
