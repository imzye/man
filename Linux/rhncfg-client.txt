NAME
       rhncfg-client - a tool used for system configuration querying and deployment.

SYNOPSIS
       rhncfg-client [ mode  ]  [ options ... ]  [ arguments ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The Spacewalk Configuration Client (rhncfg-client) is used to query a system's configuration makeup and deployment status as managed by Spacewalk.

       This tool enables a Spacewalk client to list available configuration files, fetch (or get) those configuration files, view configuration channels, and finally, diff and verify current configuration of
       the system in comparison to the system's status according to Spacewalk.

       This tool utilizes a "cvs style" command syntax: command mode options

       For example: rhncfg-client diff --topdir /home/test/blah/

MODE & OPTIONS
       list   List the configuration files for the machine and the labels of the config channels containing them. Used alone.

       elist  List the configuration files for the machine and the labels of the config channels containing them which provides an ls-esque style output. Used alone.

       get CONFIG_FILEPATH
              Download/deploy the most relevant configuration file for the machine. For example: rhncfg-client get /etc/foo.conf

       channels
              View the labels and names of the config channels that apply to the system. Used alone.

       diff   Obtain a difference between the config files deployed on the system and those for it stored by Spacewalk.

              May be used with the --topdir ROOT_PATH option. E.g., rhncfg-client diff --topdir /home/test/foo/

              If a file is readable only by root then the differences are not displayed by default. The option -d or --diff-secure-files forces the differences to be displayed.

       verify Quick verification to see if files are different than those associated with it on Spacewalk.

              All files are displayed unless called with the -o or --only option, in which case only files with differences are displayed.

       -h, --help
              Display the help screen with a list of options.
