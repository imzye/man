NAME
       dupeguru - GUI tool to find duplicate files in a system

SYNOPSIS
       dupeguru

DESCRIPTION
       dupeGuru is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer.

       It can scan either filenames or contents. The filename scan features a fuzzy matching algorithm that can find duplicate filenames even when they are not exactly the same.

       dupeGuru is customizable: you can tweak its matching engine to find exactly the kind of duplicates you want to find.
