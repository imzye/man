NAME
       argbash - Argbash is an argument parser generator for Bash.

SYNOPSIS
       argbash   [--output  OUTPUT]  [--in-place]  [--type  type]  [--library]
       [--strip content] [--check-typos]  [--commented]  [--search  SEARCH]...
       [--debug DEBUG] [--help] [--version] <input>

DESCRIPTION
       Argbash  is  a  code  generator  that  typically generates a bash argu‐
       ment-parsing library tailor-made for your script.  It lets you  to  de‐
       scribe arguments your script should take and then, you can generate the
       bash parsing code.  It stays in your script by  default,  but  you  can
       have it generated to a separate file and let bash to include it in your
       script for you.  Argbash is very simple to use and the  generated  code
       is relatively nice to read.  Moreover, argument definitions stay embed‐
       ded in the script, so when you need to update the  parsing  logic,  you
       just re-run the argbash script on the already generated script.

ARGUMENTS
       -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
              Name of the output file (pass '-' for stdout).  [Default: -]

       -i, --in-place
              Update a bash script in-place.  [Default: off]

              |OPTION_IN_PLACE|

       -t     bash-script|posix-script|manpage|manpage-defs|completion|docopt,
       --type  bash-script|posix-script|manpage|manpage-defs|completion|docopt
       Output type to generate.
              [Default: bash-script]

              Check out the documentation to learn about all argbash capabili‐
              ties that are supported.

       --library
              Whether the input file if the pure parsing  library.   [Default:
              off]

              This  option  is  deprecated  and  it  is  the  same  as --strip
              user-content.

       --strip none|user-content|all Determines what to have in the output.
              [Default: none]

              You can either strip none, which is useful for scripts.  If  you
              strip  user-content,  you keep the Argbash header.  If you strip
              all, you will have only the generated content in the result.

       --check-typos
              Whether to check for possible argbash  macro  typos.   [Default:
              on]

       -c, --commented
              Commented  mode  - include explanatory comments with the parsing
              code.  [Default: off]

       -I SEARCH, --search SEARCH
              Directories to search for the wrapped scripts (directory of  the
              template will be added to the end of the list).  [Default: "."]

       --debug DEBUG
              (developer option) Tell autom4te to trace a macro.

       -h, --help
              Prints help.

       -v, --version
              Prints version.
