CONDOR_UPDATE_MACHINE_AD(1)                                                                     HTCondor Manual                                                                     CONDOR_UPDATE_MACHINE_AD(1)

NAME
       condor_update_machine_ad - HTCondor Manual

       update a machine ClassAd

SYNOPSIS
       condor_update_machine_ad [-help | -version ]

       condor_update_machine_ad [-pool centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]] [-name startdname] path/to/update-ad

DESCRIPTION
       condor_update_machine_ad modifies the specified condor_startd daemon's machine ClassAd. The ClassAd in the file given by path/to/update-ad represents the changed attributes. The changes persists until
       the condor_startd restarts. If no file is specified on the command line, condor_update_machine_ad reads the update ClassAd from stdin.

       Contents of the file or stdin must contain a complete ClassAd. Each line must be terminated by a newline character, including the last line of the file. Lines are of the form

          <attribute> = <value>

       Changes to certain ClassAd attributes will cause the condor_startd to regenerate values for other ClassAd attributes. An example of this is setting HasVM. This will cause OfflineUniverses,  VMOffline‐
       Time, and VMOfflineReason to change.

OPTIONS
          -help  Display usage information and exit

          -version
                 Display the HTCondor version and exit

          -pool centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]
                 Specify a pool by giving the central manager's host name and an optional port number

          -name startdname
                 Send the command to a machine identified by startdname

GENERAL REMARKS
       This tool is intended for the use of system administrators when dealing with offline universes.

EXAMPLES
       To re-enable matching with the VM universe jobs, place on stdin a complete ClassAd (including the ending newline character) to change the value of ClassAd attribute HasVM:

          echo "HasVM = True
          " | condor_update_machine_ad

       To prevent vm universe jobs from matching with the machine:

          echo "HasVM = False
          " | condor_update_machine_ad

       To prevent vm universe jobs from matching with the machine and specify a reason:

          echo "HasVM = False
          VMOfflineReason = \"Cosmic rays.\"
          " | condor_update_machine_ad

       Note  that  the  quotes  around the reason are required by ClassAds, and they must be escaped because of the shell. Using a file instead of stdin may be preferable in these situations, because neither
       quoting nor escape characters are needed.

EXIT STATUS
       condor_update_machine_ad will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
