SWIRC.CONF(5)                                                                                File Formats Manual                                                                              SWIRC.CONF(5)

NAME
       swirc.conf — swirc configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes swirc.conf which is a configuration file for swirc(1) (a curses based irc client).  NOTE Certain settings take effect first after program restart while others don't!

SETTING TYPES
       bool    Bools are case insensitive and can have one of the following values:
               •   on, true or yes
               •   off, false or no

       int     Integers.   swirc  implements a min/max value for each integer in order to keep its value safe.  The error log will tell if the restrictions for an integer aren't within limits and, if so,
               that a preprogrammed fallback value is being used instead.

       string  An arbitrary sequence of characters

SETTINGS
       account_notify (bool)
               Allows a client to be notified when another client’s accountname changes

       account_tag (bool)
               Turns the IRCv3 account tag extension on/off.

       alt_nick (string)
               Alternative nickname.  This nickname is used when processing a connection to a server and the default nickname is busy.

       auto_op_yourself (bool)
               Automatically op yourself on channel join when you're identified as an IRC operator

       awaymsgs_in_privconv (bool)
               Output away messages in private conversations?  Away messages are often displayed each time you message the user who's marked as being away which can be annoying if the user  isn't  really
               away, i.e. he/she just forgot to unset the status.  This setting defaults to YES.

       away_notify (bool)
               Allows a client to specify that it would like to be notified when users are marked/unmarked as away

       batch (bool)
               Enable or disable the IRCv3 batch extension.  The batch extension provides a way for servers to mark certain messages as related.  swirc(1) takes advantage of this.

       beeps (bool)
               swirc(1) alerts the user by sending a beep in certain cases.  However, with the help of this setting, beeps can be turned on/off.

       chanserv_host (string)
               ChanServ hostname

       chghost (bool)
               Allows servers to send a notification when clients change their username or host (IRCv3 feature).  Defaults to yes.

       cipher_suite (string)
               Cipher suite.  Which can have one of the following values:
               •   secure
               •   compat
               •   legacy
               •   all

       cmd_hist_size (int)
               Command history size.  No more than this number of commands will be stored in the memory.

       cmd_type_prot (bool)
               Command type protection.  Detects up to 5 leading spaces followed by a command character preventing a command to be accidentally transmitted as a chat message.

       connection_timeout (int)
               Connection timeout in seconds

       ctcp_reply (bool)
               Reply to CTCP requests?  (For example TIME and VERSION.)

       ctcp_userinfo (string)
               A string to return on a CTCP userinfo request.

       dcc (bool)
               Use  DCC  (Direct  Client-to-Client)?   swirc(1) implements its own variant of DCC meaning it's incompatible with other IRC clients.  Transport Layer Security is forced and for now the DCC
               feature isn't available in ICB mode.

       dcc_cipher_suite (string)
               DCC cipher suite.  Which can have one of the following values:
               •   secure
               •   compat
               •   legacy
               •   all

       dcc_own_ip (string)
               IPv4 address for incoming DCC connections.  If empty swirc(1) attempts to resovle the address automatically.

       dcc_port (int)
               Port number for incoming DCC connections (1024-65535), defaults to 8080.  Must not be blocked by a firewall.

       dcc_upload_dir (string)
               Where shall swirc(1) look for DCC uploads?  If empty it defaults to uploads in the home dir of Swirc.  On OpenBSD this dir is made available with read-only permissions by using  unveil(2).
               However, that is done once at startup.  Changing it while Swirc is running will not work.

       extended_join (bool)
               Turns the extended-join IRCv3 feature on/off.

       ftp_host (string)
               FTP hostname.

       ftp_port (int)
               FTP port number (1-65535).  Defaults to 21.

       ftp_user (string)
               FTP username.  Defaults to anonymous.

       ftp_pass (string)
               FTP password.

       ftp_upload_dir (string)
               FTP upload directory.

       hostname_checking (bool)
               Enable or disable TLS/SSL hostname verification

       iconv_conversion (bool)
               Perform  character  conversion  using  GNU libiconv?  If having this option set to 'on' causes troubles or if you don't need it, it can safely be switched off.  Switching it off boosts the
               performance of the printtext module significantly.

       identd (bool)
               Use the built-in ident protocol daemon/server?  It's automatically started and stopped during the connection process if this option is enabled.  During the connection  process  to  an  IRC
               server the IRC server often attempts to send an ident query to port 113 on your computer.  You might have seen something like:

                     *** Processing connection to irc.server.com
                     *** Looking up your hostname...
                     *** Checking Ident
                     *** No Ident response <---
                     *** Found your hostname

               This requires port 113 to be open, i.e. not behind a firewall.

       identd_fakenames (bool)
               Respond to ident queries with fake (randomized) names?

       identd_port (int)
               Which  port shall the ident server listen on?  In general, on Unix only root can listen on ports below 1024.  Since you neither CAN or SHOULD run swirc(1) as root you should specify a dif‐
               ferent port using this setting and configure your firewall to redirect connections to port 113 to this one.

               If you're using OpenBSD and pf(4), pose that you want use port 6500 and that the name of the target interface is vio0.  You could then add the following lines to your pf.conf(5):

                     pass in on vio0 inet  proto tcp from any to any port auth \
                         rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 6500
                     pass in on vio0 inet6 proto tcp from any to any port auth \
                         rdr-to ::1 port 6500

       invite_notify (bool)
               Allows a client to specify that it would like to be notified when users are invited to channels

       joins_parts_quits (bool)
               Show JOIN/PART/QUIT events?

       kick_close_window (bool)
               If the active user gets kicked out from a channel, should the channel window be terminated?

       max_chat_windows (int)
               Max chat windows that can be open simultaneously

       mouse (bool)
               Use the mouse?

       mouse_events (string)
               Which mouse events shall be reported?
               •   all
               •   wheel (default)

       multi_prefix (bool)
               When requested, the multi-prefix client capability will cause the IRC server to send all possible prefixes which apply to a user in NAMES, WHO and WHOIS output.

               (These prefixes are in order of ‘rank’, from highest to lowest.)

       nickname (string)
               Online nickname

       nickname_aliases (string)
               A space separated list of nickname aliases which are used, in addition to the default nickname, to highlight a message if it matches any of the aliases given by this setting.

       nickserv_host (string)
               NickServ hostname

       notifications (bool)
               Turns notifications on/off.  Takes effect at once.

       part_message (string)
               Message when leaving a channel

       qbot_host (string)
               Q bot hostname.  The Q bot is a QuakeNet: https://www.quakenet.org/ service.

       quit_message (string)
               Message when disconnecting from a server

       real_name (string)
               Specifies the real name.  But can be set to anything.

       reconnect_backoff_delay (int)
               The number of seconds that should be added to each reconnect attempt (0-99)

       reconnect_delay (int)
               Seconds to consume before the first reconnect attempt (0-999)

       reconnect_delay_max (int)
               Maximum reconnect delay in seconds (0-999).  Regardless of the other related reconnect settings.

       reconnect_retries (int)
               If the IRC connection is lost, how many attempts should be performed to get the connection working again before giving up?

       sasl (bool)
               Request SASL authentication on connection to a server?

       sasl_mechanism (string)
               SASL mechanism.  Available mechanisms are:
               •   ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE
               •   EXTERNAL
               •   PLAIN
               •   SCRAM-SHA-1
               •   SCRAM-SHA-256
               •   SCRAM-SHA-512

               Be sure to write them in all uppercase!

       sasl_password (string)
               SASL password.  (For mechanism PLAIN and SCRAM-SHA-256.)

               It is recommended to set this setting using the interactive sasl command.  However, if the initial character is a question mark (‘?’) it symbolizes that the password is in plain text/unen‐
               crypted; while a hash mark (‘#’) symbolizes that the password is encrypted.  The initial character must be either of them and is not interpreted as a part of the password.

       sasl_username (string)
               SASL username

       sasl_x509 (string)
               Filename for your certificate chain file.  The file shall be located in Swirc's home dir and be in PEM format.

               The certificate chain file is used for automatic NickServ authentication using the external SASL auth mechanism.  A file of this sort can be generated by running the following scripts:
               •   1-root-ca.sh (Create the root CA)
               •   4-client-cert.sh (Create the client certificate and sign it with the root CA)

               After running the scripts stated above in given order you can set this setting to client.pem.

       server_time (bool)
               Enable or disable IRCv3 server time extension.  The server time extension is particularly useful if you're using an IRC bouncer like ZNC: https://znc.in/

       show_ping_pong (bool)
               Show ping pong events?  The default is NO.

       skip_motd (bool)
               Skip message of the day (MOTD) on connection to a server?

       socks (bool)
               Use the SOCKS proxy client?  The SOCKS proxy client is particularly suited for use with Tor.  Examples of IRC networks that are accessible via Tor are Libera Chat and OFTC.   In  order  to
               access Libera Chat or OFTC using the previously mentioned technique you can add the following lines to your torrc(5):

                     # Libera Chat
                     MapAddress palladium.libera.chat libera75jm6of4wxpxt4aynol3xjmbtxgfyjpu34ss4d7r7q2v5zrpyd.onion

                     # OFTC
                     MapAddress irc.oftc.net oftcnet6xg6roj6d7id4y4cu6dchysacqj2ldgea73qzdagufflqxrid.onion

               After this has been done (and after restarting Tor) you should be able to connect to one of the mapped addresses inside Swirc.  The socks host setting should point to the machine where the
               Tor service is running.

       socks_atyp (int)
               SOCKS address type.  Which can have one of the following values:
               •   (0) Fully qualified domain name.  The default.
               •   (1) IPv4 address
               •   (2) IPv6 address

       socks_host (string)
               SOCKS hostname.

       socks_port (string)
               SOCKS port.  The default is 9050 which is used by Tor: https://www.torproject.org/.

       spell (bool)
               Use spelling?

       spell_lang (string)
               Spelling language.  The default is en_US.

       spell_syswide (bool)
               Where shall Swirc look for spelling dictionaries?  (System wide or in the program settings dir.)

       ssl_verify_peer (bool)
               Verify peer?  Setting it to NO decreases TLS/SSL security significantly, but is a must on servers with trusted self signed certificates.

       startup_greeting (bool)
               Enable or disable swirc startup greeting

       textbuffer_size_absolute (int)
               Max number of elements in a text buffer before head gets removed from scroll back history.  Each open window is assigned a buffer with this size, so set a sane value!

       theme (string)
               swirc theme.

       username (string)
               User identity.  Preferably to be set to the same as the nickname.
