NAME
       svxreflector.conf - Configuration file for the SvxReflector conference server audio reflector

DESCRIPTION
       The svxreflector server is used to interconnect multiple SvxLink nodes into one network.  This man-page describe the configuration file format for it.

       SvxReflector  look  for  configuration  files  in  a  number  of  places.  First  it  tries  to  find  a  user  specific configuration file. It will look for a user specific configuration file in:
       $HOME/.svxlink/svxreflector.conf.  If no user specific configuration file can be found, svxreflector will look for the system wide configuration file /etc/svxlink/svxreflector.conf.  The  --config
       command line option may also be used to specify an arbitrary configuration file.

FILE FORMAT
       The configuration file is in the famous INI-file format. A generic example of how such a file might look like is shown below.

         [SECTION1]
         VALUE1=1
         VALUE2="TWO "
         VAULE3="Multi "
                "line"

         [SECTION2]
         VALUE1=2

       This  is  a  simple  format that contain name=value pairs that belong to a section.  In written text, a specific configuration variable can be referred to as SECTION1/VALUE2 meaning "configuration
       variable VALUE2 in section SECTION1".

       The same variable name can exist in two different sections. For example VALUE1 in section SECTION1 have the value 1 and VALUE1 in section SECTION2 have the value 2. Values containing spaces at the
       beginning or end of the line must be surrounded by citation characters (see SECTION1/VALUE2). Likewise with a multi line value (see SECTION1/VALUE3).

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       Here is the description of all configuration variables that svxreflector understands. The configuration variables are described section for section.

   GLOBAL
       The GLOBAL section contains application global configuration data.

       CFG_DIR
              Specify the path to a directory that contain additional configuration files.  If a relative path is specified, the path will be relative to the directory where the main  configuration  file
              is at. All files in the specified directory will be read as additional configuration. Filenames starting with a dot are ignored.

       TIMESTAMP_FORMAT
              This  variable  specifies  the  format  of the timestamp that is written in front of each row in the log file. The format string is in the same format as specified in the strftime(3) manual
              page. The default is "%c" which is described as: "the preferred date and time representation for the current locale". The environment variables LC_TIME, LC_ALL and LANG will affect how this
              time format will look. For example, setting LC_TIME="sv_SE.UTF8" will give you Swedish timestamp representation. Other examples of format specifiers are:

              •   %d - The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31)

              •   %b - The abbreviated month name according to the current locale

              •   %Y - The year as a decimal number including the century

              •   %H - The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23)

              •   %M - The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59)

              •   %S - The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61)

              So, TIMESTAMP_FORMAT="%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S" would give a timestamp looking something like: "29 Nov 2005 22:31:59".

       LISTEN_PORT
              The TCP and UDP port number to use for network communications. The default is 5300. Make sure to open this port for incoming traffic to the server on both TCP and UDP. Clients do  not  have
              to open any ports in their firewalls.

       SQL_TIMEOUT
              Use this configuration variable to set a time in seconds after which a clients audio is blocked if he has been talking for too long. The default is 0 (disabled).

       SQL_TIMEOUT_BLOCKTIME
              If  a  client  has  been talking for longer than the time specified in the SQL_TIMEOUT configuration variable he will not be able to talk again until the time in this configuration variable
              have elapsed. If not specified, the default is one second.

       CODECS A comma separated list of allowed codecs. For the moment only one codec can be specified. Choose from the following codecs: OPUS, SPEEX, GSM, S16 (uncompressed signed 16 bit),  RAW  (uncom‐
              pressed  32  bit  floats).  The default is OPUS and you should have a very good reason for changing this since that codec provide both low bandwidth (~20kbps by default) and very good audio
              quality.

       TG_FOR_V1_CLIENTS
              Set which talk group to place protocol version 1 clients in. Without this configuration version 1 clients will not be able to use the reflector since they cannot  select  a  talk  group  by
              themselves. Talk groups should normally be configured to start with the ITU-T E.212 Mobile Country Code (MCC) for your country, e.g. 240 for Sweden.

       RANDOM_QSY_RANGE
              Specify  in  which talk group range the reflector server should select random talk groups used when using the QSY functionality. The range is specified using two colon separated values. The
              first one is the lower limit and the second value is the number of talk groups in the range. As an example, if set to 1239900:100 QSY talk groups will be selected from the range 1239900  to
              1239999.  The recommended lower range to use is <MCC>9900 where MCC is the ITU-T E.212 Mobile Country Code for your country, e.g. 240 for Sweden.

       HTTP_SRV_PORT
              Set  which port to use for the HTTP server. The HTTP server can be used to fetch reflector status. No port is set by default. Don't expose this port to the public Internet. There are multi‐
              ple reasons for that. The built in web server is very simple and could be incompatible with some clients. It has not been audited for security problems so  there  may  be  security  issues.
              There is also the risk of some client overwhelming the reflector with requests causing disturbances in the reflector operation.

              Example: HTTP_SRV_PORT=8080

       COMMAND_PTY
              Configure a path for a pseudo tty device to send runtime commands to the svxreflector. The device may be defined as COMMAND_PTY=/dev/shm/reflector_ctrl.  To change the value of a configura‐
              tion variable you may send a command to the device like this:

                echo CFG section varname value > /dev/shm/reflector_ctrl
                e.g.
                echo CFG GLOBAL SQL_TIMEOUT_BLOCKTIME 60 > /dev/shm/reflector_ctrl

              To sign a client certificate:

                echo CA SIGN callsign > /dev/shm/reflector_ctrl

       ACCEPT_CALLSIGN
              A  regular  expression  for  verifying  that  a received login callsign has the correct format. The default is to roughly match standard ham radio callsigns.  Example: ACCEPT_CALLSIGN="S[A-
              M]\d[A-Z]{1,3}(?:-[A-Z0-9]{1,3})?"

       REJECT_CALLSIGN
              A regular expression for rejecting login callsigns. This can be used to block some specific callsigns or even a whole range of callsigns. No callsigns are rejected by default.  Example: RE‐
              JECT_CALLSIGN="SM0XYZ|SM1ABC|SM2.*"

       ACCEPT_CERT_EMAIL
              A regular expression for verifying that email addresses in a received certificate signing requests are valid. If unset, which is the default, all email addresses are accepted. If an invalid
              email address is received from a node it will be disconnected and an error message will be sent to the node. The following example should accept most email addresses at the same time as de‐
              tecting most invalid ones.  Example: ACCEPT_CERT_EMAIL=""\w+(?:[-._+]\w+)*@\w+(?:\.\w+)*"

       CERT_PKI_DIR
              The path to the directory containing PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) files. If a relative path is given, the value of the build time variable  SVX_LOCAL_STATE_DIR  (e.g.  /var/lib/svxlink/)
              will be prepended.

              Default: CERT_PKI_DIR=pki/

       CERT_CA_KEYS_DIR
              The path to the directory containing private key files. If a relative path is given, the value of the CERT_PKI_DIR variable will be prepended.

              Default: CERT_CA_KEYS_DIR=private/

       CERT_CA_PENDING_CSRS_DIR
              The path to the directory containing unsigned CSR files. If a relative path is given, the value of the CERT_PKI_DIR variable will be prepended.

              Default: CERT_CA_PENDING_CSRS_DIR=pending_csrs/

       CERT_CA_CSRS_DIR
              The path to the directory containing signed CSR files. If a relative path is given, the value of the CERT_PKI_DIR variable will be prepended.

              Default: CERT_CA_CSRS_DIR=csrs/

       CERT_CA_CERTS_DIR
              The path to the directory containing signed certificate files. If a relative path is given, the value of the CERT_PKI_DIR variable will be prepended.

              Default: CERT_CA_CERTS_DIR=certs/

       CERT_CA_HOOK
              Set  to  a  path  for an external application that is run on CA events like when a CSR is received or when a certificate is signed. The following environment variables will be set up before
              running the external application.

              •   CA_OP: Set to one of the strings PENDING_CSR_CREATE, PENDING_CSR_UPDATE or CSR_SIGNED, which should be self explanatory.

              •   CA_CSR_PEM: CSR data in PEM format. This is not set for operation CSR_SIGNED.

              •   CA_CRT_PEM: Certificate data in PEM format. This is only set for operation CSR_SIGNED.

   ROOT_CA, ISSUING_CA and SERVER_CERT sections
       These configuration sections is used to customize the contents of the different certificates that is generated by the reflector server.

       KEYFILE
              The path to the certificate private key file. If a relative path is given, the value of the CERT_CA_KEYS_DIR variable will be prepended.

       CSRFILE
              The path to the certificate signing request file. If a relative path is given, the value of the CERT_CA_CSRS_DIR variable will be prepended.

       CRTFILE
              The path to the certificate file. If a relative path is given, the value of the CERT_CA_CERTS_DIR variable will be prepended.

       COMMON_NAME
              The common name (CN) used in the subject of the certificate.

       ORG_UNIT
              The organizational unit (OU) used in the subject of the certificate.

              Example: ORG_UNIT="VHF/UHF-sektionen"

       ORG    The organization name (O) used in the subject of the certificate.

              Example: ORG=SSA

       LOCALITY
              The locality name (L) used in the subject of the certificate.

              Example: LOCALITY=Boden

       STATE  The name of the state or province (ST) used in the subject of the certificate.

              Example: STATE=Norrbotten

       COUNTRY

              Example: COUNTRY=SE

       SUBJECT_ALT_NAME
              A comma separated list of subject alternative names.

              Example: SUBJECT_ALT_NAME=DNS:public-hostname.example.org,IP:172.17.1.42

       EMAIL_ADDRESS
              The email address that can be used to get in contact with the owner of the certificate.

              Example: EMAIL_ADDRESS=sysop@svxlink.example.org

   USERS and PASSWORDS sections
       Previously, all users had to be specified in the USERS section. That is not needed anymore for nodes that use a SvxLink version > 1.8.0. Usernames are totally arbitrary but typically the  callsign
       is  used. The purpose is to map each username to a password. However, the password is not given directly but instead a reference to the PASSWORDS section is given. It's done like this so that mul‐
       tiple nodes can share a single password.

       An example of how the USERS and PASSWORDS sections may look is given below.

         [USERS]
         SM0ABC-1=MyNodes
         SM0ABC-2=MyNodes
         SM1XYZ=SM1XYZ

         [PASSWORDS]
         MyNodes="A very strong password!"
         SM1XYZ="Another very good password?"

       This will set up SM0ABC-1 and SM0ABC-2 to use the same password specified by MyNodes in the PASSWORDS section. User SM1XYZ have his own password.

   Talkgroup Configuration Sections
       It is possible to set configuration parameters that are only applied to one talkgroup. Those parameters are placed in a configuration section named "TG#<talkgroup id>". Example:

         [TG#9999]
         AUTO_QSY_AFTER=300
         ALLOW=S[A-M]\\d.*|LA8PV
         SHOW_ACTIVITY=0

       The following configuration variables are valid in a talkgroup configuration section.

       AUTO_QSY_AFTER
              Set this to the number of seconds after which an automatic QSY to a random talkgroup is requested. This is typically used to keep call channels and wide area channels clear so that stations
              does not dwell there for too long.  Auto QSY is only triggered directly aftar a talker stop event.  The default is that auto QSY is disabled (AUTO_QSY_AFTER=0).

       ALLOW  A regular expression that must match the whole callsign of the nodes that try to select this talkgroup.  The regular expression standard used is the same as for ECMAScript with  the  excep‐
              tion that the backslash special patterns (e.g.  \s, \d etc) must be expressed with double backslash notation (e.g. \\s, \\d etc).

              An example that match most Swedish callsigns and a specific Norwegian one is "S[A-M]\\d.*|LA8PV". That expression will for example match LA8PV, SM0SVX, SK3W, SA7ABC etc.

       SHOW_ACTIVITY
              If set to 0, do not indicate in the http status message when the talkgroup is in use by a node. Default is 1 = show activity.
