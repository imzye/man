NAME
     otpprint — print lists of one-time passwords

SYNOPSIS
     otp [-n count] [-e] [-h] [-f algorithm] sequence-number seed

DESCRIPTION
     The otpprint program prints lists of OTPs.

     Use this to print out a series of one-time passwords.  You will have to
     supply the sequence number and the seed as arguments and then the program
     will prompt you for your pass-phrase.

     There are several different print formats.  The default is to print each
     password with six short english words.

     Options are:

     -e      Print the passwords in ``extended'' format.  In this format a
             prefix that says ``hex:'' or ``word:'' is included.

     -f      To choose a different algorithm from the default md5.  Pick any
             of: md4, md5, and sha.

     -h      Print the passwords in hex.

     -n      Print count one-time passwords, starting at sequence-number and
             going backwards. The default is 10.
