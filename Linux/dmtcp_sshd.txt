NAME
       dmtcp - Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing

SYNOPSIS
       dmtcp_coordinator [port]

       dmtcp_launch command [args...]

       dmtcp_restart ckpt_FILE1.dmtcp [ckpt_FILE2.dmtcp...]

       dmtcp_command coordinatorCommand

DESCRIPTION
       DMTCP is a tool to transparently checkpointing the state of an arbitrary group of programs spread across many machines and connected by sockets. It does not modify the user's program nor the operating
       system.  MTCP is a standalone component of DMTCP available as a checkpointing library for a single process.

OPTIONS
       For each command, the --help or -h flag will show the command-line options.  Most command line options can also be controlled through environment variables.  These can be  set  in  bash  with  "export
       NAME=value" or in tcsh with "setenv NAME value".

       DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=integer
              Time in seconds between automatic checkpoints.  Checkpoints can also be initiated manually by typing 'c' into the coordinator. (default: 0, disabled; dmtcp_coordinator only)

       DMTCP_HOST=string
              Hostname where the cluster-wide coordinator is running. (default: localhost; dmtcp_launch, dmtcp_restart only)

       DMTCP_PORT=integer
              The port the cluster-wide coordinator listens on. (default: 7779)

       DMTCP_GZIP=(1|0)
              Set to "0" to disable compression of checkpoint images.  (default: 1, compression enabled; dmtcp_launch only) WARNING:  gzip adds seconds.  Without gzip, ckpt/restart is often less than 1 s

       DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_DIR=path
              Directory to store checkpoint images in. (default: ./)

       DMTCP_SIGCKPT=integer
              Internal signal number to use for checkpointing.  Must not be used by the user program.  (default: SIGUSR2; dmtcp_launch only)

DMTCP_COORDINATOR
       Each  computation to be checkpointed must include a DMTCP coordinator process.  One can explicitly start a coordinator through dmtcp_coordinator, or allow one to be started implicitly in background by
       either dmtcp_launch or dmtcp_restart to operate.  The address of the unique coordinator should be specified by dmtcp_launch, dmtcp_restart, and dmtcp_command either through the --host and --port  com‐
       mand-line  flags or through the the DMTCP_HOST and DMTCP_PORT environment variables.  If neither is given, the host-port pair defaults to localhost-7779.  The host-port pair associated with a particu‐
       lar coordinator is given by the command-line flags used in the dmtcp_coordinator command, or the environment variables then in effect, or the default of localhost-7779.

       The coordinator is stateless and is not checkpointed.  On restart, one can use an existing or a new coordinator.  Multiple computations under DMTCP control can coexist by providing a unique  coordina‐
       tor (with a unique host-port pair) for each such computation.

       The coordinator initiates a checkpoint for all processes in its computation group.  Checkpoints can be:  performed automatically on an interval (see DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL above); or initiated man‐
       ually on the standard input of the coordinator (see next paragraph); or initiated directly under program control by the computation through the plugin API (see below).

       The coordinator accepts the following commands on its standard input.  Each command should be followed by the <return> key.  The commands are:
         l : List connected nodes
         s : Print status message
         c : Checkpoint all nodes
         f : Force a restart even if there are missing nodes (debugging)
         k : Kill all nodes
         q : Kill all nodes and quit
         ? : Show this message

       Coordinator commands can also be issued remotely using dmtcp_command.

EXAMPLE USAGE
       1. In a separate terminal window, start the dmtcp_coordinator.
              (See previous section.)

               dmtcp_coordinator

       2. In separate terminal(s), replace each command(s) with "dmtcp_launch
              [command]".  The checkpointed program will connect to the coordinator specified by DMTCP_HOST and DMTCP_PORT.  New threads will be checkpointed as part of the  process.   Child  processes  will
              automatically be checkpointed.  Remote processes started via ssh will automatically checkpointed. (Internally, DMTCP modifies the ssh command line to call dmtcp_launch on the remote host.)

               dmtcp_launch ./myprogram

       3. To manually initiate a checkpoint, either run the command below
              or  type "c" followed by <return> into the coordinator.  Checkpoint files for each process will be written to DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_DIR. The dmtcp_coordinator will write "dmtcp_restart_script.sh" to
              its working directory.  This script contains the necessary calls to dmtcp_restart to restart the entire computation, including remote processes created via ssh.

                   dmtcp_command -c
              OR:  dmtcp_command --checkpoint

       4. To restart, one should execute dmtcp_restart_script.sh, which is
              created by the dmtcp_coordinator in its working directory at the time of checkpoint. One can optionally edit this script to migrate processes to different hosts.  By default, only one restarted
              process will be restarted in the foreground and receive the standard input.  The script may be edited to choose which process will be restarted in the foreground.

               ./dmtcp_restart_script.sh

DMTCP PLUGIN
       The  source distribution includes a top-level plugin directory, with examples of how to write a plugin for DMTCP.  Plugins allow a checkpointed application to disconnect from an external resource, and
       then reconnect to it at the time of restart.  Further examples are in the test/plugin directory.  In particular, test/plugin/applic-initiated demonstrates how an application can request  a  checkpoint
       under program control.

       The  plugin  feature  adds  three  new user-programmable capabilities.  A plugin may: add wrappers around system calls; take special actions at during certain events (e.g. pre-checkpoint, resume/post-
       checkpoint, restart); and may insert key-value pairs into a database at restart time that is then available to be queried by the restarted processes of a computation.  (The  events  available  to  the
       plugin feature form a superset of the events available with the dmtcpaware interface.)  One or more plugins are invoked via a list of colon-separated absolute pathnames.

         dmtcp_launch --with-plugin PLUGIN1[:PLUGIN2]...

DMTCPAWARE API
       This  API  is  now deprecated in favor of DMTCP plugins (see above).  DMTCP provides a programming interface to allow checkpointed applications to interact with dmtcp.  In the source distribution, see
       dmtcpaware/dmtcpaware.h for the functions available.  See test/dmtcpaware[123].c for three example applications.  For an example of its usage, try:

        cd test; rm dmtcpaware1; make dmtcpaware1; ./autotest -v dmtcpaware1

       The user application should link with libdmtcpaware.so (-ldmtcpaware) and use the header file dmtcp/dmtcpaware.h.

RETURN CODE
       A target program under DMTCP control normally returns the same return code as if executed without DMTCP.  However, if DMTCP fails (as opposed to the target program failing), DMTCP returns a DMTCP-spe‐
       cific return code, rc (or rc+1, rc+2 for two special cases), where rc is the integer value of the environment variable DMTCP_FAIL_RC if set, or else the default value, 99.
