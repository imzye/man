NAME
       fips-finish-install - complete the installation of FIPS modules.

SYNOPSIS
       fips-finish-install --complete

DESCRIPTION
       fips-finish-install(8) is used by the fips-mode-setup(8) command to complete the installation of the system FIPS modules. The tool is not supposed to be called directly by the system administrator,
       but it is possible to do so.

       The completion of the installation cannot be undone. The system has to be reinstalled if the FIPS modules are not supposed to be installed anymore.

OPTIONS
       The only recognized and mandatory option is:

       --complete: The command completes the FIPS module installation and calls dracut -f to regenerate the initramfs.

FILES
       /etc/system-fips
           The presence of the file indicates that the installation of FIPS modules was completed.
