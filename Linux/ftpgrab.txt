NAME
       ftpgrab - a file mirroring utility

SYNOPSIS
       ftpgrab [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ftpgrab command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       tire version trees of software.
