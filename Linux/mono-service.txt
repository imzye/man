Mono(mono-service)                                          Mono(mono-service)

NAME
       mono-service, mono-service2 - Mono ServiceProcess host

SYNOPSIS
       mono-service [options] program.exe

DESCRIPTION
       The  mono-service  is a host to run services built with the ServicePro‐
       cess assembly.

       Use mono-service to run services that use the 1.0  assemblies  and  use
       mono-service2 to run services that use the 2.0 assemblies.

       Services  can  be  paused by sending the SIGUSR1 signal to the process,
       and execution can be resumed by sending the SIGUSR2 signal.   The  ser‐
       vice  can  be  cleanly  shutdown  by  sending the SIGTERM signal to the
       process.

       The following options can be used to control the service:

       -d:DIRECTORY
              Use this option to specify the working directory  for  the  ser‐
              vice.  The default is the current directory.

       -l:LOCKFILE
              Specifies the file to use for locking, the default is a filename
              constructed in /tmp based on the name of the program that  hosts
              the service.

       -m:MESSAGE
              Name to show in the syslog.

       -n:NAME
              Use  this  to specify the service to be launched (if the program
              contains more than one service).   The default  is  to  run  the
              first defined service.

       --debug
              Use  this  option to prevent mono-service from redirecting stdin
              and stdout and prevent the program to be sent to the background.
              Equivalent to --no-daemon

       --no-daemon
              Use  this  option to prevent mono-service from redirecting stdin
              and stdout and prevent the program to be sent to the background.
              Equivalent to --debug.

CONTROL
       You  can control the service by sending signals to the process, you can
       use the following commands:

       Pausing service:
                   kill -USR1 `cat <lock file>`

       Resuming service:
                   kill -USR2 `cat <lock file>`

       Stopping the service:
                   kill `cat <lock file>`

EXAMPLES
       Start the MyService.exe assembly, with a lock in /root/service-lock:

            mono-service -l:/root/service-lock MyService.exe

DEBUGGING
       Messages produced by the service are logged on syslog.
