Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckBin(3pm)                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                  Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckBin(3pm)

NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckBin - Require that our distribution has a particular command available

VERSION
       version 0.008

SYNOPSIS
       In your dist.ini:

           [CheckBin]
           command = ls

DESCRIPTION
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckBin is a Dist::Zilla plugin that modifies the Makefile.PL or Build.PL in your distribution to contain a Devel::CheckBin call, that asserts that a particular command is
       available.  If it is not available, the program exits with a status of zero, which on a CPAN Testers machine will result in a NA result.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
   "command"
       Identifies the name of the command that is searched for. Can be used more than once.
