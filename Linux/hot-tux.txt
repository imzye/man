HOT-BABE(1)                                                                                 General Commands Manual                                                                                 HOT-BABE(1)

NAME
       hot-babe - is a small graphical utility which displays the system activity in a very special way

SYNOPSIS
       hot-babe [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the hot-babe command.  hot-babe is a small graphical utility which displays the system activity in a very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed
       girl, and when the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the girl begins to undress, to finish totally naked when the system activity reaches 100%. Of course, if you can be  shocked  by  nu‐
       dity, don't use it!

OPTIONS
       As for now, hot-babe supports a few command-line options:

       -h, --help
              display a small help message and exit.

       -t, --threshold n
              ensure that only the first picture (totally dressed girl) as long as the system activity is below n%.

       -d, --delay
              n update the display every n milliseconds.

       -i, --incremental
              ponder  every  sample with time, the result is a somewhat smoother animation, and the cpu has to be 100% for a long time before the girl will be totally naked, and the cpu has to be at 0% for a
              long time for the girl to dress totally.

       -N, --noNice
              Don't consider reniced processes. This is usefull if you use seti@home or distributed.net, which always eat almost all the CPU.

       -n, --nice
              n Put the hot-babe process in nice n.

       --dir  Directory give the directory where hot-babe must load the pictures.

       --geometry
              Use the specified geometry (only position is supported {+|-}x{+|x}y).

       -v, --version
              Show version and exit.

       FILES

       share/hot-babe/ ./hot-babe/
              Default directory of hot-babes pictures. It can be either absolute path, relative, relative to share/hot-babe/ directory or relative to ~/.hot-babe/ directory. It contains the themes  that  can
              be used.

       Note: Each pictures subdirectory must contain a file named "descr" which gives some info to the hot-babe process. The first line gives the number of pictures to use, and then the name of the pictures,
       one per line.

       Here is an example:
              5
              hb01_4.png
              hb01_3.png
              hb01_2.png
              hb01_1.png
              hb01_0.png

       ~/.hot-babe/config
              User configuration file. Put any possible long option. Empty lines and whatever after a # are ignored.

       Here is an example:
              #threshold 30
              incremental
              #noNice
              #nice 5
              #delay 100
              #dir hb01
              #geometry +0-0
