NAME
       hdhomerun_config - A utility used for maintaining and controlling a Silicon Dust HDHomeRun

SYNOPSIS
       hdhomerun_config <id> command [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The HDHomeRun is a networked digital television receiver with two tuners.  It can tune QAM64, QAM128, QAM256, or 8VSB television streams.

       It is most useful in the United States where QAM is very commonly used for cable transmission and 8VSB (ATSC) for Over The Air television transmission.

       This utility can be used to control the HDHomeRun, update it, and query information about it.

       The  only requirement for the utility is that the HDHomeRun be hooked up on the same subnet as the computer peforming the actions.  The HDHomeRun will receive an address via DHCP, so if static ad‐
       dressing is in use on the network instead, the device will not function.

FEATURES
       1)  Multiple tuners.  For those nights that several primetime shows are on at the same time, you won't need to worry.

       2)  QAM & OTA support.  Both tuners can be set as either QAM or OTA.  This way if only a few channels are available by one variety, but you would still like those channels, each tuner can be  used
       for the different connections.

       3)  Networked.  The HDHomeRun can be accessed by any computer on the local network by using VLC, MythTV, or SageTV.

       4)  Upgradable.  Silicon Dust regularly releases firmware updates for the HDHomeRun.  These can be used to add support for upcoming recording standards, changing frequencies, or stability.
