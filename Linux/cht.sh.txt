NAME
       cht.sh - The only cheat sheet you need (command line client for cheat.sh)

SYNOPSIS
       cht.sh [OPTIONS|QUERY]

DESCRIPTION
       The cheat.sh service:

              •  Covers 56 programming languages, several DBMSes, and more than 1000 most important UNIX/Linux commands.

              •  Provides access to the best community driven cheat sheets repositories in the world, on par with StackOverflow.

       The cheat.sh service has its own command line client (cht.sh) that has several useful features compared to querying the service directly with curl:

              •  Special shell mode with a persistent queries context and readline support.

              •  Queries history.

              •  Clipboard integration.

              •  Tab completion support for shells (bash, fish, zsh).

              •  Stealth mode.

OPTIONS
       QUERY  process QUERY and exit.

       --help print help.

       --shell [LANG]
              shell mode (open LANG if specified).

       --standalone-install [DIR|help]
              install cheat.sh in the standalone mode (by default, into ~/.cheat.sh/).

       --mode [auto|lite]
              set (or display) mode of operation:

              •  auto - prefer the local installation

              •  lite - use the cheat sheet server

EXAMPLES
       Now, you can use cht.sh instead of curl, and write your queries in more natural way, with spaces instead of +:

           $ cht.sh go reverse a list
           $ cht.sh python random list elements
           $ cht.sh js parse json

       It is even more convenient to start the client in a special shell mode:

           $ cht.sh --shell
           cht.sh> go reverse a list

       If all your queries are about the same language, you can change the context and spare repeating the programming language name:

           $ cht.sh --shell
           cht.sh> cd go
           cht.sh/go> reverse a list

       or even start the client in this context:

           $ cht.sh --shell go
           cht.sh/go> reverse a list
           ...
           cht.sh/go> join a list
           ...

       If you want to change the context, you can do it with the cd command, or if you want do a single query for some other language, just prepend it with /:

           $ cht.sh --shell go
           ...
           cht.sh/go> /python dictionary comprehension
           ...

       If you want to copy the last answer into the clipboard, you can use the c (copy) command, or C (ccopy, without comments).

           cht.sh/python> append file
           #  python - How do you append to a file?

           with open("test.txt", "a") as myfile:
               myfile.write("appended text")
           cht.sh/python> C
           copy: 2 lines copied to the selection

       Type help for other internal cht.sh commands.

               cht.sh> help
               help    - show this help
               hush    - do not show the 'help' string at start anymore
               cd LANG - change the language context
               copy    - copy the last answer in the clipboard (aliases: yank, y, c)
               ccopy   - copy the last answer w/o comments (cut comments; aliases: cc, Y, C)
               exit    - exit the cheat shell (aliases: quit, ^D)
               id [ID] - set/show an unique session id ("reset" to reset, "remove" to remove)
               stealth - stealth mode (automatic queries for selected text)
               update  - self update (only if the scriptfile is writeable)
               version - show current cht.sh version
               /:help  - service help
               QUERY   - space separated query staring (examples are below)
                                         cht.sh> python zip list
                                         cht.sh/python> zip list
                                         cht.sh/go> /python zip list
