NAME
       botch-create-graph - create graph based on installation sets, strong dependency sets or dependency closures

SYNOPSIS
       botch-create-graph [options] Packages.. Sources

DESCRIPTION
       Given a repository of source packages and binary packages, create the build graph and source graph for it

OPTIONS
       --version
           show program's version and exit

       -h, --help
           show this help message and exit

       -v, --verbose
           print additional information

       --quiet
           do no print any messages

       -A, --available=FILE
           List of available packages (arch:all, crossed...) in control file format

       --custom-is=FILE
           list of files with dependencies that should not be part of the IS

       --deb-drop-b-d-indep
           Drop Build-Depends-Indep dependencies

       --deb-drop-b-d-arch
           Drop Build-Depends-Arch dependencies

       --allowsrcmismatch
           If a binary package is without a source package but there is a source package of same name but different version, match this binary package to that source package.

       --progress
           print progress bars

       --timers
           print timing information

       --strongtype
           generate a strong build graph (only strong dependencies)

       --closuretype
           generate a dependency closure build graph (all dependency relationships)

       --fg=PKGS
           Additional Packages lists that are checked and used for resolving dependencies (can be repeated)

       --bg=PKGS
           Additional Packages lists that are NOT checked but used for resolving dependencies (can be repeated)

       --deb-native-arch=ARCH
           Native architecture ARCH

       --deb-host-arch=arch
           Host architecture arch. Defaults to native architecture.

       --deb-foreign-archs=archs
           Comma-separated foreign architectures in addition to native and host architectures.

       --deb-ignore-essential
           By default, installing any binary package requires the coinstallation set of all binary packages marked as Essential:yes to be installed as well. This option drops this requirement.

       --optgraph
           Calculate a dependency graph where each installation set contains the minimal number of unavailable binary packages.

       -j, --jobs=NUM
           How many worker processes to run in parallel. Default: 1

EXAMPLE
       Calculate a self-contained repository:

        zcat packages | grep-dctrl -X \( -FPackage build-essential --or -FEssential yes \) > minimal
        dose-deb-coinstall --deb-native-arch=amd64 --bg=packages --fg=minimal > minimal-amd64
        botch-bin2src --deb-native-arch=amd64 minimal-amd64 sources > minimal-src
        grep-dctrl -FArchitecture all packages > available
        botch-create-graph --deb-ignore-essential -A available --deb-native-arch=amd64 --bg sources packages minimal-src > graph.xml
        botch-buildgraph2packages graph.xml packages > min-closure
        botch-packages-union min-closure minimal-amd64 min-closure
        botch-bin2src --deb-native-arch=amd64 min-closure sources > min-closure-src
        dose-builddebcheck --deb-native-arch=amd64 min-closure min-closure-src

       The self-contained repository will then be min-closure and min-closure-src.
