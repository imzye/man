NAME
       get-healpix - Convert RA,DEC to Which healpix

SYNOPSIS
       get-healpix [options] ra dec
       get-healpix [options] x y z

OPTIONS
       -r     RA/DEC values in radians; default is in decimal degrees or H:M:S

       -H healpix
              take healpix number as input and print center as output.

       -N n   Nside (default 1)

       -n     Print neighbours

       -R range
              print healpixes within radius range in degrees

       -p     Project position within healpix

       If your values are negative, add "--" in between "-r" (if you're using it) and "ra" or "x".
