       pmquery [-input] [all above options...]  [message...]

DESCRIPTION
       pmquery provides a command-line-option compatible implementation of the
       xconfirm and xmessage tools, using a look-and-feel that  is  consistent
       with  pmchart.  Several extensions to the functionality of the original
       tools have been made, in order to improve their  specific  utility  for
       pmchart, but wherever possible the original semantics remain.

       pmconfirm  displays  a  line of text for each -t option specified (or a
       file when the -file option is used), and a button for  each  -b  option
       specified.   When one of the buttons is pressed, the label of that but‐
       ton is written to pmquery's standard output.  This provides a means  of
       communication/feedback from within shell scripts and a means to display
       useful information to a user from an application.

       pmmessage displays a window containing a message from the command line,
       a  file, or standard input.  It additionally allows buttons to be asso‐
       ciated with an exit status, and only optionally will write the label of
       the button to standard output.

       pmquery  extends  the  above tools to additionally support limited user
       input, as free form text.  In this -input mode, any text  entered  will
       be  output  when  the default button is pressed.  A default text can be
       entered using the same mechanisms as the other tools.

       Command line options are available to specify font style, frame  style,
       modality  and  one  of several different icons to be presented for tai‐
       lored visual feedback to the user.

OPTIONS
       The available command line options are:

       -c, -center
            Center the window on the display.

       -nearmouse
            Pop up the window near the mouse cursor.

       -b button-name
            Displays a button with the label button-name.  If  button-name  is
            the  empty  string,  the button in that position is not displayed.
            If no -b options are present, the default is  a  button  with  the
            label  Continue.   The  exit status associated with button-name is
            zero.

       -B button-name
            Displays a button with the label button-name and specifies  it  as
            the button to be activated when enter is pressed.  The exit status
            associated with button-name is zero.

       -buttons button,button,...
            This option will create one button for each comma-separated button
            option.   Each button consists of a label optionally followed by a
            colon and an exit value.  The exit value will be returned if  that
            button is selected.  The default exit value is 100 plus the button
            number.  Buttons are numbered from the left starting with one.

       -default label
            Defines the button with a matching label to be  the  default.   If
            not  specified there is no default.  The corresponding resource is
            defaultButton.  Pressing Return anywhere in  the  xmessage  window
            will  activate the default button.  The default button has a wider
            border than the others.

       -t message
            Displays message.  Any number of strings can be listed on the com‐
            mand line (each must be preceded with the -t option).

       -file filename
            Displays  the  file  filename.  All -t options will be ignored.  A
            filename of `-' reads from standard input.

       -icon icontype
            Displays the icon icontype where icontype is one of: info,  error,
            question, warning, critical.  action is also accepted as a synonym
            for error for  backward  compatibility.   pmquery  introduces  the
            additional  archive  and  host  icon types as well as the original
            xconfirm types listed earlier.

       -font fontname
            Use fontname as the font.  This  option  is  only  available  when
            using the X Window System.

       -header string
            Use string as the window title.

       -print
            This  causes  the program to write the label of the button pressed
            to standard output.  It is the default behaviour for pmconfirm and
            pmquery.

       -noprint
            This  causes  the  program  to  not  write the label of the button
            pressed to standard output.   It  is  the  default  behaviour  for
            pmmessage.

       -geometry geometry-string
            This provides the tool with an X-compatible geometry string speci‐
            fication.  This option is only available when using the  X  Window
            System.

       -useslider
            When displaying a file, always use a slider instead of determining
            automatically whether a slider is necessary.

       -noslider
            Do not create a slider, and clip text to the window size,  instead
            of determining automatically whether a slider is necessary..

       -noframe
            Do not display a frame around the contents.

       -exclusive
            Grab  the  keyboard/pointer and do not allow further input until a
            button is pressed.

       -timeout secs
            Exit with status 0 after secs seconds if the user has not  clicked
            on a button yet.  The corresponding resource is timeout.

       -?, -h, -help
            Display usage message and exit.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  shell  script will display a window with an information
       icon, asking the user a yes or no question with "Yes" as the default.

        #! /bin/sh
        case `pmquery -t "Really power down?" -b No -B Yes -icon question
        in
          Yes) shutdown;;
          No) ;;
        esac

       A second example, which prompts for a hostname then starts  a  terminal
       with an ssh session connected to the requested host.

        #! /bin/sh
        host=`pmquery -input -icon host -b Cancel -B OK \
                      -header "Remote Terminal - Secure Shell"
        [ "$host" = "Cancel" -o -z "$host" ] && exit
        gnome-terminal -e "ssh $host"

ENVIRONMENT
       pmquery  is  an  excellent  choice of utility for the PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG
       Performance Co-Pilot configuration parameter (refer to pcp.conf(5)  for
       details).

       Note that PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG will be automatically set to pmquery inside
       tools like pmchart, unless PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG  is  already  set  in  the
       environment.

EXIT STATUS
       If  it detects an error, pmquery always returns 1, so this value should
       not be associated with a button.  Unless -button option  has  not  been
       used, the return code will be zero on success.
