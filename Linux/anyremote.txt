DESCRIPTION
       anyRemote is remote control software for applications using WiFi or Bluetooth.

       anyRemote was developed as thin "communication" layer between device with WiFi or Bluetooth support (which can be cell phone or tablet computer) and Linux PC.

       In theory anyRemote could be configured to manage almost any kind of software.

       anyRemote is console application, but in addition there are GUI frontends for Gnome and KDE.

   -h
       print short help and exit

   -v

   -f /path/to/configuration/file
       By default anyremote will try to find and use $HOME/.anyremote.cfg, then ./.anyremote.cfg. It is possible to specify configuration file directly with -f option.

   -s peer[,peer ...]
       where peer can be one of:

            tcp:_port_         (Server mode - TCP/IP connection)

            rfcomm:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:CC (AT mode - bluetooth connection,

                 where XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is bluetooth device address and

                 CC is channel number - integer from 1 to 32)

            /dev/ttyACM#       (AT mode - cable connection)

            /dev/ircomm#       (AT mode - IR connection)
