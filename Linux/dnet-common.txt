DESCRIPTION
       /etc/decnet.conf is an ASCII file which contains the description of the executor node and other DECnet nodes you plan to communicate with.

       There is one entry per line, and each line has the format:

              Type Address Name_tag Nodename Line_tag Device

       The field descriptions are:

              Type      the type of node. The local node uses "executor". Remote nodes use "node"

              Address   the DECnet address.

              Name_tag  the constant string "name".

              Line_tag  the constant string "line". There must be only one line specified for the executor node.

              Device    the name of the Ethernet card for DECnet operations. (Usually "eth0").
