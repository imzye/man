QDIRSTAT-CACHE-WRITER(1)                                                                    General Commands Manual                                                                    QDIRSTAT-CACHE-WRITER(1)

NAME
       qdirstat-cache-writer - script to write QDirStat cache files from cron jobs

Usage:
       qdirstat-cache-writer [-ldvh] <directory> [<cache-file-name>]

              If not specified, <cache-file-name> defaults to ".qdirstat.cache.gz" in <directory>.

              If <cache-file-name> ends with ".gz", it will be compressed with gzip.  qdirstat can read gzipped and plain text cache files.

       -l     long format - always add full path, even for plain files

       -m     scan mounted file systems (cross file system boundaries)

       -v     verbose

       -d     debug

       -h     help (this usage message)

       QDirStat  can  read  its information from cache files. This is a lot faster than reading all the directories in a directory tree and obtaining detailed information (size, type, last modification time)
       for each file and directory with the opendir() / readdir() and lstat() system calls for each individual file and directory.

       QDirStat can also write those cache files ("Write Cache File..." from the "File" menu), but the whole point of cache files is being able to do that in the background when the user  does  not  have  to
       wait  for  it  -  like in a cron job running in the middle of the night. QDirStat itself cannot be used to do that because it is a KDE program and thus an X program that needs access to an X display -
       which cron does not provide.
