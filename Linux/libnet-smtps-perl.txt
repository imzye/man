NAME
       Net::SMTPS - SSL/STARTTLS support for Net::SMTP

SYNOPSYS
           use Net::SMTPS;

           my $ssl = 'starttls';   # 'ssl' / 'starttls' / undef

           my $smtp = Net::SMTPS->new("smtp.example.com", Port => 587, doSSL => $ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a wrapper for Net::SMTP, enabling over-SSL/STARTTLS support.  This module inherits most of all the methods from Net::SMTP(2.X). You may use all the friendly options that
       came bundled with Net::SMTP.  You can control the SSL usage with the options of new() constructor method.  'doSSL' option is the switch, and, If you would like to control detailed SSL settings,
       you can set SSL_* options that are brought from IO::Socket::SSL. Please see the document of IO::Socket::SSL about these options detail.

       Just one method difference from the Net::SMTP, you can select SMTP AUTH mechanism as the third option of auth() method.

       As of Version 3.10 of Net::SMTP(libnet) includes SSL/STARTTLS capabilities, so this wrapper module's significance disappareing.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ] )
           A few options added to Net::SMTP(2.X).

           doSSL { "ssl" | "starttls" | undef } - to specify SSL connection type.  "ssl" makes connection wrapped with SSL, "starttls" uses SMTP command "STARTTLS".

METHODS
       Most of all methods of Net::SMTP are inherited as is, except auth().

       auth ( USERNAME, PASSWORD [, AUTHMETHOD])
           Attempt  SASL  authentication through Authen::SASL module. AUTHMETHOD is your required method of authentication, like 'CRAM-MD5', 'LOGIN', ... etc. If your selection does not match the server-
           offerred AUTH mechanism, authentication negotiation may fail.

       starttls ( SSLARGS )
           Upgrade existing plain connection to SSL.

BUGS
       Constructor option 'Debug => (N)' (for Net::Cmd) also sets $IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG when SSL is enabled. You can set 'Debug_SSL => {0-3}' separately.
