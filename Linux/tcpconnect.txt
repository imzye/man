NAME
       tcpconnect - general TCP/IP client

SYNOPSIS
       tcpconnect [-irv] [-l localaddr] host port

DESCRIPTION
       tcpconnect  creates a TCP/IP connection to a server running on the machine host, listening to port port.  It then reads standard input and sends to the remote server, and data received from the server
       is printed to standard output.  When end-of-file is reached on both standard input and the TCP/IP connection, tcpconnect terminates.

OPTIONS
       -i     Terminate at end-of-file on standard input; don't wait for the server to close the connection.

       -r     Terminate when the remote server closes the connection; don't wait for end-of-file on standard input.

       -v     Verbose mode.  Prints a message to standard error when the connection has been established.

       -l addr:port
              Bind the local end-point of the connection to IP address addr, TCP port port.  Either the IP address or the port, but not both, may be left out, meaning that the operating system gets to choose
              that part by itself.

SEE ALSO
       tcplisten(1), telnet(1), tcpbug(1).

BUGS
       The names of the options are not yet finalized, and may change at a future release.
