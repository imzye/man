NAME
       derivations - book: Derivations of Applied Mathematics

DESCRIPTION
       For  various  valid  reasons, open-source program sources rarely derive the mathematical formulas they use.  A user, nevertheless -- not wishing to take such formulas on faith -- might wish to see
       such formulas somewhere derived.

       Derivations of Applied Mathematics is a book that derives, and documents, many of the mathematical formulas and methods open-source programs use, and indeed many of the formulas and  methods  used
       in  science  and engineering generally.  For example, it derives and documents the Taylor series (used to calculate trigonometrics), the Newton-Raphson method (used to calculate square roots), the
       Pythagorean theorem (used to calculate distances) and many others.

READING THE BOOK
       Among other ways, you can read the book on your computer screen by opening the file /usr/share/doc/derivations/derivations.pdf with a PDF reader like (for example) evince(1).

AUTHOR
       The book and this manpage are written by Thaddeus H. Black, who also maintains the Debian package derivations in which Debian distributes them.  Users who need to contact the author in his role as
       Debian package maintainer can reach him at <thb@debian.org>.  However, most e-mail will naturally be about the book itself: this should be sent to <thb@derivations.org>.
