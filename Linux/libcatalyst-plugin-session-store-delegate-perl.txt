NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Delegate - Delegate session storage to an application model object.

SYNOPSIS
               use Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Delegate;

DESCRIPTION
       This store plugins makes delegating session storage to a first class object model easy.

THE MODEL
       The model is used to retrieve the delegate object for a given session ID.

       This is normally something like DBIC's resultset object.

       The model must respond to the "get_delegate" method or closure in the sesion config hash (defaults to "get_session_store_delegate").

       An object must always be returned from this method, even if it means autovivifying. The object may optimize and create itself lazily in the actual store only when ->store methods are actually
       called.

THE DELEGATE
       A single delegate belongs to a single session ID. It provides storage space for arbitrary fields.

       The delegate object must respond to method calls as per the "session_store_delegate_key_to_accessor" method's return values.

       Typically this means responding to $obj->$field type accessors.

       If necessary, the delegate should maintain an internal reference count of the stored fields, so that it can garbage collect itself when all fields have been deleted.

       The fields are arbitrary, and are goverend by the various session plugins.

       The basic keys that must be supported are:

       expires
           A timestamp indicating when the session will expire.

           If a store so chooses it may clean up session data after this timestamp, even without being told to delete.

       session
           The main session data hash.

           Might not be used, if only "flash" exists.

       flash
           A hash much like the main session data hash, which can be created and deleted multiple times per session, as required.

       The delegate must also respond to the "flush" method which is used to tell the store delegate that no more set/get/delete methods will be invoked on it.

METHODS
       session_store_delegate_key_to_accessor $key, $operation
           This method implements the various calling conventions. It accepts a key and an operation name ("get", "set" or "delete"), and must return a method (could be a string or a code reference), and
           an optional list of arguments that will be invoked on the delegate.

           The  default  version  splits  $key on the first colon, extracting the field name and the ID. It then returns the unaltered field name, and if the operation is 'delete' also provides the extra
           argument "undef". This works with accessor semantics like these:

               $obj->foo;
               $obj->foo("bar");
               $obj->foo(undef);

           To facilitate a convention like

               $obj->get_foo;
               $obj->set_foo("bar");
               $obj->delete_foo;

           or

               $obj->get("foo");
               $obj->set("foo", "bar");
               $obj->delete("foo");

           simply override this method. You may look in the source of this module to find commented out versions which should help you.

       session_store_delegate
           This method returns the delegate, which may be cached in $c.

       get_session_store_delegate $id
           This method should get the delegate object for a given ID. See "THE MODEL" for more details.

       session_store_model
           This method should return the model that will provide the delegate object.The default implementation will simply return "$c->model( $c->session_store_model_name )".

       session_store_model_name
           Returns "$c->config->{session}{model_name} || "Sessions"".

       finalize_session_delegate $delegate
           Invokes the "flush" method on the delegate. May be overridden if that behavior is inappropriate.

       get_session_data $key
       store_session_data $key, $value
       delete_session_data $key
           These methods translate the store API into the delegate API using "session_store_delegate_key_to_accessor".
