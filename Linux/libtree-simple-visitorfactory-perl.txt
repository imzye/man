NAME
       Tree::Simple::Visitor::ToNestedArray - A Visitor for creating nested array trees from Tree::Simple objects.

SYNOPSIS
         use Tree::Simple::Visitor::ToNestedArray;

         my $visitor = Tree::Simple::Visitor::ToNestedArray->new();

         # given this Tree::Simple tree
         my $tree = Tree::Simple->new("Root")
                       ->addChildren(
                           Tree::Simple->new("Child1")
                               ->addChildren(
                                   Tree::Simple->new("GrandChild1"),
                                   Tree::Simple->new("GrandChild2")
                               ),
                           Tree::Simple->new("Child2"),
                       );

         # include the trunk (Root)
         $visitor->includeTrunk(1);

         # visit the tree
         $tree->accept($visitor);

         my $array_tree = $visitor->getResults();
         # this then creates the equivalent nested array tree:
         # [
         # 'Root', [
         #     'Child1', [
         #             'GrandChild1',
         #             'GrandChild2'
         #             ],
         #     'Child2'
         #     ]
         # ]

         # if you don't include the trunk (Root) then ...
         $tree->accept($visitor);

         my $array_tree = $visitor->getResults();
         # this then creates the following nested array tree:
         # [
         #   'Child1', [
         #           'GrandChild1',
         #           'GrandChild2'
         #           ],
         #   'Child2'
         # ]

DESCRIPTION
       Given a tree constructed from a Tree::Simple hierarchy, this Visitor will create the equivalent tree of nested arrays.

METHODS
       new There are no arguments to the constructor the object will be in its default state. You can use the "setNodeFilter" and "includTrunk" methods to customize its behavior.

       includTrunk ($boolean)
           Setting the $boolean value to true (1) will cause the node value of the tree's root to be included in the nested array output, setting it to false will do the opposite.

       setNodeFilter ($filter_function)
           This  method  accepts  a CODE reference as its $filter_function argument and throws an exception if it is not a code reference. This code reference is used to filter the tree nodes as they are
           placed into the array tree. The $filter_function is passed a Tree::Simple object, and is expected to return the value desired for inclusion into the array tree.

       visit ($tree)
           This is the method that is used by Tree::Simple's "accept" method. It can also be used on its own, it requires the $tree argument to be a Tree::Simple object (or derived  from  a  Tree::Simple
           object), and will throw and exception otherwise.

       getResults
           This method will return the array tree constructed.
