NAME
       libspiro - A clothoid to bezier spline converter

SYNOPSIS
       #include <spiroentrypoints.h> and then compile and link with -lspiro

DESCRIPTION
       Spiro library for curve design which simplifies drawing of beautiful curves.

       libspiro  takes an array of spiro control points which can be easier for an artist to create and modify, and then converts these into a series of bezier splines which can then be used in the myriad of
       ways the world has come to use beziers.

       spiroentrypoints.h has technical information on how to connect with libspiro and further information can be found at http://github.com/fontforge/libspiro
