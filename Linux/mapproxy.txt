NAME
       mapproxy-util-autoconfig - creates MapProxy and MapProxy-seeding configurations

SYNOPSIS
       mapproxy-util autoconfig [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       mapproxy-util autoconfig creates MapProxy and MapProxy-seeding configurations based on existing WMS capabilities documents.

       It  creates a source for each available layer.  The source will include a BBOX coverage from the layer extent, legendurl for legend graphics, featureinfo for querlyable layers, scale hints and all
       detected supported_srs.  It will duplicate the layer tree to the layers section of the MapProxy configuration, including the name, title and abstract.

       The tool will create a cache for each source layer and supported_srs if there is a grid configured in your --base configuration for that SRS.

       The MapProxy layers will use the caches when available, otherwise they will use the source directly (cascaded WMS).
              Note

              The tool can help you to create new configations, but it can’t predict how you will use the MapProxy services.  The generated configuration can be highly inefficient, especially when multi‐
              ple layers with separate caches are requested at once.  Please make sure you understand the configuration and check the documentation for more options that are useful for your use-cases.

OPTIONS
       --capabilities url|filename
              URL or filename of the WMS capabilities document.  The tool will add REQUEST and SERVICE parameters to the URL as necessary.

       --output filename
              Filename for the created MapProxy configuration.

       --output-seed filename
              Filename for the created MapProxy-seeding configuration.

       --force
              Overwrite any existing configuration with the same output filename.

       --base filename
              Base configuration that should be included in the --output file with the base option.

       --overwrite filename, --overwrite-seed filename
              YAML configuration that overwrites configuration options before the generated configuration is written to --output/--output-seed.

   EXAMPLE
       Print configuration on console:

       mapproxy-util autoconfig \
           --capabilities http://osm.omniscale.net/proxy/service

       Write MapProxy and MapProxy-seeding configuration to files:

       mapproxy-util autoconfig \
           --capabilities http://osm.omniscale.net/proxy/service \
           --output mapproxy.yaml \
           --output-seed seed.yaml

       Write MapProxy configuration with caches for grids from base.yaml:

       mapproxy-util autoconfig \
           --capabilities http://osm.omniscale.net/proxy/service \
           --output mapproxy.yaml \
           --base base.yaml

OVERWRITES
       It's likely that you need to tweak the created configuration - e.g. to define another coverage, disable featureinfo, etc.  You can do this by editing the output file of course, or you  can  modify
       the output by defining all changes to an overwrite file.  Overwrite files are applied every time you call mapproxy-util autoconfig.

       Overwrites are YAML files that will be merged with the created configuration file.

       The  overwrites  are  applied independently for each services, sources, caches and layers section.  That means, for example, that you can modify the supported_srs of a source and the tool will use
       the updated SRS list to decide which caches will be configured for that source.

   EXAMPLE
       Created configuration:

       sources:
         mysource_wms:
           type: wms
           req:
               url: http://example.org
               layers: a

       Overwrite file:

       sources:
         mysource_wms:
           supported_srs: ['EPSG:4326'] # add new value for mysource_wms
           req:
               layers: a,b  # overwrite existing value
               custom_param: 42  #  new value

       Actual configuration written to --output:

       sources:
         mysource_wms:
           type: wms
           supported_srs: ['EPSG:4326']
           req:
               url: http://example.org
               layers: a,b
               custom_param: 42

   SPECIAL KEYS
       There are a few special keys that you can use in your overwrite file.

       All    The value of the __all__ key will be merged into all dictionaries.  The following overwrite will add sessionid to the req options of all sources:

              sources:
                __all__:
                  req:
                    sessionid: 123456789

       Extend The values of keys ending with __extend__ will be added to existing lists.

              To add another SRS for one source:

              sources:
                  my_wms:
                    supported_srs__extend__: ['EPSG:31467']

       Wildcard
              The values of keys starting or ending with three underscores (___) will be merged with values where the key matches the suffix or prefix.

              For example, to set levels for osm_webmercator and aerial_webmercator and to set refresh_before for osm_webmercator and osm_utm32:

              seeds:
                  ____webmercator:
                      levels:
                        from: 0
                        to: 12

                  osm____:
                      refresh_before:
                          days: 5

                                                                                              01 October 2025                                                                   mapproxy-util-autoconfig(1)
