ABSTRACT
         Text::Capitalize is for capitalizing strings in a manner
       suitable for use in titles.

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Capitalize provides some routines for title-like formatting of strings.

       The simple capitalize function just makes the initial character of each word uppercase, and forces the rest to lowercase.

       The capitalize_title function applies English title case rules (discussed below) where only the "important" words are supposed to be capitalized.  There are also some customization features
       provided to allow the user to choose variant rules.

       Comparing capitalize and captialize_title:

         Input:             "lost watches of splitsville"
         capitalize:        "Lost Watches Of Splitsville"
         capitalize_title:  "Lost Watches of Splitsville"

       Some examples of formatting with capitalize_title:

         Input:             "KiLLiNG TiMe"
         capitalize_title:  "Killing Time"

         Input:             "we have come to wound the autumnal city"
         capitalize_title:  "We Have Come to Wound the Autumnal City"

         Input:             "ask for whom they ask for"
         captialize_title:  "Ask for Whom They Ask For"

       Text::Capitalize also provides some functions for special effects such as scramble_case, which typically would be used for this sort of transformation:

         Input:            "get whacky"
         scramble_case:    "gET wHaCkY"  (or something similar)

EXPORTS
   default exports
       capitalize
           Makes the initial character of each word uppercase, and forces the rest to lowercase.

           The original routine by Stanislaw Y. Pusep.

       capitalize_title
           Applies English title case rules (See BACKGROUND) where only the "important" words are supposed to be capitalized.

           The one required argument is the string to be capitalized.

           Some customization options may be passed in as pairs of names and values following the required argument.

           The following customizations are allowed:

           Boolean:

             PRESERVE_WHITESPACE
             PRESERVE_ALLCAPS
             PRESERVE_ANYCAPS

           Array reference:

             NOT_CAPITALIZED

           See "Customizing the Exceptions to Capitalization".

   optional exports
       @exceptions
           The list of minor words that don't usually get capitalized in titles (used by capitalize_title).  Defaults to:

                a an the
                and or nor for but so yet
                to of by at for but in with has
                de von

       %defaults_capitalize_title
           Defines  the  default  arguments  for  the  capitalize_title function Initially, this is set-up to shut off the features PRESERVE_WHITESPACE, PRESERVE_ALLCAPS and PRESERVE_ANYCAPS; it also has
           @exceptions as the NOT_CAPITALIZED list.

       scramble_case
           This routine provides a special effect: sCraMBliNg tHe CaSe

           The algorithm here uses a modified probability distribution to get a weirder looking effect than simple randomization such as with random_case.

           For a discussion of the algorithm, see "SPECIAL EFFECTS".

       random_case
           Randomizes the case of each character with a 50-50 chance of each one becoming upper or lower case.

       zippify_case
           Function to provide a special effect: "RANDOMLY upcasing WHOLE WORDS at a TIME".

           This uses a similar algorithm to scramble_case, though it also ignores words on the @exceptions list, just as capitalize_title does.

BACKGROUND
       The capitalize_title function tries to do the right thing by default: adjust an arbitrary chunk of text so that it can be used as a title.  But as with many aspects of the human languages,  it  is
       extremely difficult to come up with a set of programmatic rules that will cover all cases.

   Words that don't get capitalized
       This web page:

         http://www.continentallocating.com/World.Literature/General2/LiteraryTitles2.htm

       presents some admirably clear rules for capitalizing titles:

         ALL words in EVERY title are capitalized except
         (1) a, an, and the,
         (2) two and three letter conjunctions (and, or, nor, for, but, so, yet),
         (3) prepositions.
         Exceptions:  The first and last words are always capitalized even
         if they are among the above three groups.

       But consider the case:

         "It Waits Underneath the Sea"

       Should  the word "underneath" be downcased because it's a preposition?  Most English speakers would be surprised to see it that way.  Consequently, the default list of exceptions to capitalization
       in this module only includes the shortest of the common prepositions (to of by at for but in).

       The default entries on the exception list are:

            a an the
            and or nor for but so yet
            to of by at for but in with has
            de von

       The observant may note that the last row is not composed of English words.  The honorary "de" has been included in honor of "Honore de Balzac".  And "von" was added for the sake of equal time.

   Customizing the Exceptions to Capitalization
       If you have different ideas about the "rules" of English (or perhaps if you're trying to use this code with another language with different rules) you might like to substitute a new exception list
       of your own:

         capitalize_title( "Dude, we, like, went to Old Slavy, and uh, they didn't have it",
                            NOT_CAPITALIZED => [ qw( uh duh huh wha like man you know ) ] );

       This should return:

          Dude, We, like, Went To Old Slavy, And uh, They Didn't Have It

       Less radically, you might like to simply add a word to the list, for example "from":

          use Text::Capitalize 0.2 qw( capitalize_title @exceptions );
          push @exceptions, "from";

          print capitalize_title( "fungi from yuggoth",
                                  NOT_CAPITALIZED => \@exceptions);

       This should output:

           Fungi from Yuggoth

   All Uppercase Words
       In order to work with a wide range of input strings, by default capitalize_title presumes that upper-case input needs to be adjusted (e.g. "DOOM  APPROACHES!"  would  become  "Doom  Approaches!").
       But, this doesn't allow for the possibilities such as an acronym in a title (e.g. "RAM Prices Plummet" ideally should not become "Ram Prices Plummet").  If the PRESERVE_ALLCAPS option is set, then
       it will be presumed that an all-uppercase word is that way for a reason, and will be left alone:

          print capitalize_title( "ram more RAM down your throat",
                                  PRESERVE_ALLCAPS => 1 );

       This should output:

             Ram More RAM Down Your Throat

   Preserving Any Usage of Uppercase for Mixed-case Words
       There  are  some  other  odd  cases that are difficult to handle well, notably mixed-case words such as "iMac", "CHiPs", and so on.  For these purposes, a PRESERVE_ANYCAPS option has been provided
       which presumes that any usage of uppercase is there for a reason, in which case the entire word should be passed through untouched.  With PRESERVE_ANYCAPS on, only the case of all lowercase  words
       will ever be adjusted:

          print capitalize_title( "TLAs i have known and loved",
                              PRESERVE_ANYCAPS => 1 );

       This should output:

          TLAs I Have Known and Loved

          print capitalize_title( "the next iMac: just another NeXt?",
                                   PRESERVE_ANYCAPS => 1);

       This should output:

          The Next iMac: Just Another NeXt?

   Handling Whitespace
       By  default,  the  capitalize_title function presumes that you're trying to clean up potential title strings. As an extra feature it collapses multiple spaces and tabs into single spaces.  If this
       feature doesn't seem desirable and you want it to literally restrict itself to adjusting capitalization, you can force that behavior with the PRESERVE_WHITESPACE option:

          print capitalize_title( "it came from texas:  the new new world order?",
                                  PRESERVE_WHITESPACE => 1);

       This should output:

             It Came From Texas:  The New New World Order?

       (Note: the double-space after the colon is still there.)

   Comparison to Text::Autoformat
       As you might expect, there's more than one way to do this, and these two pieces of code perform very similar functions:

          use Text::Capitalize 0.2;
          print capitalize_title( $t ), "\n";

          use Text::Autoformat;
          print autoformat { case => "highlight", right => length( $t ) }, $t;

       Note: with autoformat, supplying the length of the string as the "right margin" is much faster than plugging in an arbitrarily large number.  There doesn't seem to be any other way of turning  off
       line-breaking (e.g. by using the "fill" parameter) though possibly there will be in the future.

       As of this writing, "capitalize_title" has some advantages:

       1.  It  works  on  characters  outside the English 7-bit ASCII range, for example with my locale setting (en_US) the ISO-8859-1 International characters are handled correctly, so that "ueber maus"
           becomes "Ueber Maus".

       2.  Minor words following leading punctuation become upper case:

              "...And Justice for All"

       3.  It works with multiple sentence input (e.g. "And sooner. And later."  should probably not be "And sooner. and later.")

       4.  The list of minor words is more extensive (i.e. includes: so, yet, nor), and is also customizable.

       5.  There's a way of preserving acronyms via the PRESERVE_ALLCAPS option and similarly, mixed-case words ("iMac", "NeXt", etc") with the PRESERVE_ANYCAPS option.

       6.  capitalize_title is roughly ten times faster.

       Another difference is that Text::Autoformat's "highlight" always preserves whitespace something like capitalize_title does with the PRESERVE_WHITESPACE option set.

       However, it should be pointed out that Text::Autoformat is under active maintenance by Damian Conway.  It also does far more than this module, and you may want to use it for other reasons.

   Still more ways to do it
       Late breaking news: The second edition of the Perl Cookbook has just come out.  It now includes: "Properly Capitalizing a Title or Headline" as recipe 1.14.  You should familiarize  yourself  with
       this if you want to become a true master of all title capitalization routines.

       (And I see that recipe 1.13 includes a "randcap" program as an example, which as it happens does something like the random_case function described below...)

SPECIAL EFFECTS
       Some  functions  have  been provided to make strings look weird by scrambling their capitalization ("lIKe tHiS"): random_case and scramble_case.  The function "random_case" does a straight-forward
       randomization of capitalization so that each letter has a 50-50 chance of being upper or lower case.  The function "scramble_case" performs a very similar function, but does a slightly better  job
       of producing something "weird-looking".

       The  difficulty  is  that  there  are  differences between human perception of randomness and actual randomness.  Consider the fact that of the sixteen ways that the four letter word "word" can be
       capitalized, three of them are rather boring: "word", "Word" and "WORD".  To make it less likely that scramble_case will produce dull output when you want "weird" output,  a  modified  probability
       distribution  has  been  used that records the history of previous outcomes, and tweaks the likelihood of the next decision in the opposite direction, back toward the expected average.  In effect,
       this simulates a world in which the Gambler's Fallacy is correct ("Hm... red has come up a lot, I bet that black is going to come up now."). "Streaks" are much less likely with scramble_case  than
       with random_case.

       Additionally,  with scramble_case the probability that the first character of the input string will become upper-case has been tweaked to less than 50%.  (Future versions may apply this tweak on a
       per-word basis rather than just on a per-string basis).

       There is also a function that scrambles capitalization on a word-by-word basis called "zippify_case", which should produce output like: "In my PREVIOUS life i was a LATEX-novelty REPAIRMAN!"

EXPORT
       By default, this version of the module provides the two functions capitalize and capitalize_title.  Future versions will have no further additions to the default export list.

       Optionally, the following functions may also be exported:

       scramble_case
           A function to scramble capitalization in a wEiRD loOOkInG wAy.  Supposed to look a little stranger than the simpler random_case output

       random_case
           Function to randomize capitalization of each letter in the string.  Compare to "scramble_case"

       zippify_case
           A function like "scramble_case" that acts on a word-by-word basis (Somewhat LIKE this, YOU know?).

       It is also possible to export the following variables:

       @exceptions
           The list of minor words that capitalize_title uses by default to determine the exceptions to capitalization.

       %defaults-capitalize_title
           The hash of allowed arguments (with defaults) that the capitalize_title function uses.

BUGS
       1. In capitalize_title, quoted sentence terminators are treated as actual sentence breaks, e.g. in this case:

            'say "yes but!" and "know what?"'

       The program sees the ! and effectively treats this as two separate sentences: the word "but" becomes "But" (under the rule that last words  must  always  be  uppercase,  even  if  they're  on  the
       exception list) and the word "and" becomes "And" (under the first word rule).

       2.  There's  no  good  way  to  automatically  handle  names like "McCoy".  Consider the difficulty of disambiguating "Macadam Roads" from "MacAdam Rode".  If you need to solve problems like this,
       consider using the case_surname function of Lingua::En::NameParse.

       3. In general, Text::Capitalize is a very parochial English oriented module that looks like it belongs in the "Lingua::En::*" tree.

       4. There's currently no way of doing a PRESERVE_ANYCAPS that *also* adjusts capitalization of words on the exception list, so that "iMac Or iPod" would become "iMac or iPod".
