ARGUMENTS

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The  arckill  command  kills a running job on an ARC enabled resource. The job can be referred to either by the jobid that was returned by arcsub(1) at submission time or by its jobname if the job de‐
       scription that was submitted contained a jobname attribute.

       More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were submitted with the same jobname all those jobs are killed. If the --joblist option is used the list of jobs is read  from  a  file
       with the specified filename. By specifying the --all option, all jobs can be killed.

       The --cluster option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. See arcsub(1) for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option. The --status option can be used to select jobs
       in a specific state. These options can be repeated several times. See arstat(1) for possible state values.

       If the job was successfully killed the attepmt to remove the job from the remote cluster will be made unless the --keep option was specified. Depending on functionality of service job  killing  proce‐
       dure  may  take time and it may be impossible to clean job immediately.  In that case arckill will report number of cleaned jobs smaller than processed ones. Cleaning of leftover jobs may be performed
       by running arcclean later.

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

       ~/.arc/jobs.xml
              This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This list
              is  used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the --all option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the --joblist option a different file can be used
              than the default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       X509_USER_PROXY
              The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard location.

       ARC_LOCATION
              The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not specified the install location will be determined from the path to the command being executed, and if this fails  a
              WARNING will be given stating the location which will be used.

       ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
              The  location  of  ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The default location is $ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc (\ in
              Windows).
