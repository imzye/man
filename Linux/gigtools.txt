NAME
       gigmerge - Merges several Gigasampler (.gig) files to one Gigasampler file.

SYNOPSIS
       gigmerge [ -v ] GIGFILE1 GIGFILE2 [ ... ] NEWGIGFILE

DESCRIPTION
       Takes  a  list  of Gigasampler (.gig) files as input and merges their content to one new single Gigasampler file. Note: There is no check for duplicate (equivalent) samples yet. That means, if for
       example 2 input files use the exact same sample, then this sample will exist twice in the output file.

OPTIONS
        GIGFILE1
              filename of input Gigasampler file

        GIGFILE2
              filename of input Gigasampler file

        NEWGIGFILE
              filename of merged output Gigasampler file

        -v    print version and exit
