NAME
       mogfiledebug -- Dump gobs of information about a FID

SYNOPSIS
           $ mogfiledebug --trackers=host --domain=foo --key=bar
           $ mogfiledebug --trackers=host --fid=1234

DESCRIPTION
       Utility for troubleshooting problemic files in a mogilefs cluster. Also useful for verification or testing new setups.

       Finds as much information about a file as it can. All of the paths, any queues it might be sitting in, etc. Will then test all of the paths, MD5 hash their contents, and check the file lengths. If you
       see errors about a FID in mogilefsd's logs plugging it through mogfiledebug should illuminate most of the potential issues.

       This is also useful information for posting to the mailing list, along with the error you had.

OPTIONS
       --trackers=host1:7001,host2:7001
           Use these MogileFS trackers to negotiate with.

       --domain=<domain>
           Set the MogileFS domain to use.

       --key="<key>"
           The key to inspect. Can be an arbitrary string.

       --fid=<fid>
           A numeric fid to inspect. Provide this as an alternative to a domain/key combination.

       --paths=[print|stat|fetch]
           Whether to print, stat, or fetch each path.  The default is to fetch (and checksum) the contents of all paths.
