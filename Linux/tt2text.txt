NAME
       tt2text - Convert Touch Tone sequence to text

SYNOPSIS
       tt2text touch-tone-squence

DESCRIPTION
       tt2text  converts a Touch Tone squence to text.  There are two types of
       encoding:

              Multi-Press - Used for comments.

                     Letters are represented by one or  more  presses  of  the
                     same  key  depending on their order listed on the button.
                     e.g.  Press 5 key once for J, twice for K, thrice for L.

                     To specify a digit use the number of  letters  listed  on
                     the button plus one.  e.g.  Press 5 key four times to get
                     digit 5.  When two characters in a row use the same  key,
                     use the "A" key as a separator.

              Two-Key - Used for callsigns.

                     Digits are represented by a single key press.

                     Letters  (or  space) are represented by the corresponding
                     key followed by A, B, C, or D depending on the  order  of
                     the letter in the order listed.

       This application will try to decode the sequence using both methods.

OPTIONS
       None.
