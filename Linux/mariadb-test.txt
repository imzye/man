MARIADB-TEST-RUN(1)                                                                       MariaDB Database System                                                                       MARIADB-TEST-RUN(1)

NAME
       mariadb-test-run.pl - run MariaDB test suite

SYNOPSIS

       mariadb-test-run.pl [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The mariadb-test-run.pl Perl script is the main application used to run the MariaDB test suite. It invokes mariadb-test to run individual test cases.

       Invoke mariadb-test-run.pl in the mariadb-test directory like this:

           shell> mariadb-test-run.pl [options] [test_name] ...

       Each test_name argument names a test case. The test case file that corresponds to the test name is t/test_name.test.

       For each test_name argument, mariadb-test-run.pl runs the named test case. With no test_name arguments, mariadb-test-run.pl runs all .test files in the t subdirectory.

       If no suffix is given for the test name, a suffix of .test is assumed. Any leading path name is ignored. These commands are equivalent:

           shell> mariadb-test-run.pl mytest
           shell> mariadb-test-run.pl mytest.test
           shell> mariadb-test-run.pl t/mytest.test

       A suite name can be given as part of the test name. That is, the syntax for naming a test is:

           [suite_name.]test_name[.suffix]

       If a suite name is given, mariadb-test-run.pl looks in that suite for the test. The test file corresponding to a test named suite_name.test_name is found in suite/suite_name/t/test_name.test.
       There is also an implicit suite name main for the tests in the top t directory. With no suite name, mariadb-test-run.pl looks in the default list of suites for a match and runs the test in any
       suites where it finds the test. Suppose that the default suite list is main, binlog, rpl, and that a test mytest.test exists in the main and rpl suites. With an argument of mytest or mytest.test,
       mariadb-test-run.pl will run mytest.test from the main and rpl suites.

       To run a family of test cases for which the names share a common prefix, use the --do-test=prefix option. For example, --do-test=rpl runs the replication tests (test cases that have names
       beginning with rpl).  --skip-test has the opposite effect of skipping test cases for which the names share a common prefix.

       The argument for the --do-test and --skip-test options also allows more flexible specification of which tests to perform or skip. If the argument contains a pattern metacharacter other than a lone
       period, it is interpreted as a Perl regular expression and applies to test names that match the pattern. If the argument contains a lone period or does not contain any pattern metacharacters, it
       is interpreted the same way as previously and matches test names that begin with the argument value. For example, --do-test=testa matches tests that begin with testa, --do-test=main.testa matches
       tests in the main test suite that begin with testa, and --do-test=main.*testa matches test names that contain main followed by testa with anything in between. In the latter case, the pattern match
       is not anchored to the beginning of the test name, so it also matches names such as xmainytesta.

       To perform setup prior to running tests, mariadb-test-run.pl needs to invoke mariadbd with the --bootstrap and --skip-grant-tables options. If MariaDB was configured with the
       --disable-grant-options option, --bootstrap, --skip-grant-tables, and --init-file will be disabled. To handle this, set the MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP environment variable to the full path name of a server
       that has all options enabled.  mariadb-test-run.pl will use that server to perform setup; it is not used to run the tests.

       The init_file test will fail if --init-file is disabled. This is an expected failure that can be handled as follows:

           shell> export MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP
           shell> MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP=/full/path/to/mariadbd
           shell> make test force="--skip-test=init_file"

       To run mariadb-test-run.pl on Windows, you'll need either Cygwin or ActiveState Perl to run it. You may also need to install the modules required by the script. To run the test script, change
       location into the mariadb-test directory, set the MTR_VS_CONFIG environment variable to the configuration you selected earlier (or use the --vs-config option), and invoke mariadb-test-run.pl. For
       example (using Cygwin and the bash shell):

           shell> cd mariadb-test
           shell> export MTR_VS_CONFIG=debug
           shell> ./mariadb-test-run.pl --force --timer
           shell> ./mariadb-test-run.pl --force --timer --ps-protocol

       mariadb-test-run.pl uses several environment variables. Some of them are listed in the following table. Some of these are set from the outside and used by mariadb-test-run.pl, others are set by
       mariadb-test-run.pl instead, and may be referred to in tests.

       The variable MTR_PORT_BASE was added in MySQL 5.1.45 as a more logical replacement for MTR_BUILD_THREAD. It gives the actual port number directly (will be rounded down to a multiple of 10). If you
       use MTR_BUILD_THREAD, the port number is found by multiplying this by 10 and adding 10000.

       Tests sometimes rely on certain environment variables being defined. For example, certain tests assume that MARIADB-TEST is defined so that mariadb-test can invoke itself with exec $MYSQL_TEST.

       Other tests may refer to the last three variables listed in the preceding table, to locate files to read or write. For example, tests that need to create files will typically put them in
       $MYSQL_TMP_DIR/file_name.

       If you are running mariadb-test-run.pl version 1 by setting MTR_VERSION, note that this only affects the test driver, not the test client (and its language) or the tests themselves.

       A few tests might not run with version 1 because they depend on some feature of version 2. You may have those tests skipped by adding the test name to the file lib/v1/incompatible.tests. This
       feature is available from MySQL 5.1.40.

       mariadb-test-run.pl supports the options in the following list. An argument of -- tells mariadb-test-run.pl not to process any following arguments as options.

       •   --help, -h

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   --big-test

           Allow tests marked as "big" to run. Tests can be thus marked by including the line --source include/big_test.inc, and they will only be run if this option is given, or if the environment
           variable BIG_TEST is set to 1. Repeat this option twice to run only "big" tests.

           This is typically used for tests that take a very long to run, or that use many resources, so that they are not suitable for running as part of a normal test suite run.

       •   --boot-dbx

           Run the mariadbd server used for bootstrapping the database through the dbx debugger.

       •   --boot-ddd

           Run the mariadbd server used for bootstrapping the database through the ddd debugger.

       •   --boot-gdb

           Run the mariadbd server used for bootstrapping the database through the gdb debugger.

       •   --[mtr-]build-thread=number

           Specify a number to calculate port numbers from. The formula is 10 * build_thread + 10000. Instead of a number, it can be set to auto, which is also the default value, in which case
           mariadb-test-run.pl will allocate a number unique to this host.

           The value (number or auto) can also be set with the MTR_BUILD_THREAD environment variable.

           The more logical --port-base is supported as an alternative.

       •   --callgrind

           Instructs valgrind to use callgrind.

       •   --check-testcases

           Check test cases for side effects. This is done by checking system state before and after each test case; if there is any difference, a warning to that effect will be written, but the test
           case will not be marked as failed because of it. This check is enabled by default.

       •   --client-bindir=path

           The path to the directory where client binaries are located.

       •   --client-dbx

           Start mariadb-test in the dbx debugger.

       •   --client-ddd

           Start mariadb-test in the ddd debugger.

       •   --client-debugger=debugger

           Start mariadb-test in the named debugger.

       •   --client-gdb

           Start mariadb-test in the gdb debugger.

       •   --client-libdir=path

           The path to the directory where client libraries are located.

       •   --combination=value

           Extra options to pass to mariadbd. The value should consist of one or more comma-separated mariadbd options. This option is similar to --mariadbd but should be given two or more times.
           mariadb-test-run.pl executes multiple test runs, using the options for each instance of --combination in successive runs. If --combination is given only once, it has no effect. For test runs
           specific to a given test suite, an alternative to the use of --combination is to create a combinations file in the suite directory. The file should contain a section of options for each test
           run.

       •   --comment=str

           Write str to the output within lines filled with #, as a form of banner.

       •   --compress

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both support compression.

       •   --cursor-protocol

           Use the cursor protocol between client and server (implies --ps-protocol).

       •   --dbx

           Start the mariadbd(s) in the dbx debugger.

       •   --ddd

           Start the mariadbd(s) in the ddd debugger.

       •   --debug

           Dump trace output for all clients and servers.

       •   --debug-common

           Same as --debug, but sets the 'd' debug flags to "query,info,error,enter,exit".

       •   --debug-server

           Use debug version of server, but without turning on tracing.

       •   --debugger=debugger

           Start mariadbd using the named debugger.

       •   --debug-sync-timeout=N

           Controls whether the Debug Sync facility for testing and debugging is enabled. The option value is a timeout in seconds. The default value is 300. A value of 0 disables Debug Sync. The value
           of this option also becomes the default timeout for individual synchronization points.

           mariadb-test-run.pl passes --loose-debug-sync-timeout=N to mariadbd. The --loose prefix is used so that mariadbd does not fail if Debug Sync is not compiled in.

       •   --defaults-file=file_name

           Use the named file as fixed config file template for all tests.

       •   --defaults_extra_file=file_name

           Add setting from the named file to all generated configs.

       •   --do-test=prefix|regex

           Run all test cases having a name that begins with the given prefix value, or fulfils the regex. This option provides a convenient way to run a family of similarly named tests.

           The argument for the --do-test option also allows more flexible specification of which tests to perform. If the argument contains a pattern metacharacter other than a lone period, it is
           interpreted as a Perl regular expression and applies to test names that match the pattern. If the argument contains a lone period or does not contain any pattern metacharacters, it is
           interpreted the same way as previously and matches test names that begin with the argument value. For example, --do-test=testa matches tests that begin with testa, --do-test=main.testa matches
           tests in the main test suite that begin with testa, and --do-test=main.*testa matches test names that contain main followed by testa with anything in between. In the latter case, the pattern
           match is not anchored to the beginning of the test name, so it also matches names such as xmainytestz.

       •   --dry-run

           Don't run any tests, print the list of tests that were selected for execution.

       •   --embedded-server

           Use a version of mariadb-test built with the embedded server.

       •   --enable-disabled

           Ignore any disabled.def file, and also run tests marked as disabled. Success or failure of those tests will be reported the same way as other tests.

       •   --experimental=file_name

           Specify a file that contains a list of test cases that should be displayed with the [ exp-fail ] code rather than [ fail ] if they fail.

           For an example of a file that might be specified via this option, see mariadb-test/collections/default.experimental.

       •   --extern option=value

           Use an already running server. The option/value pair is what is needed by the mariadb client to connect to the server. Each --extern option can only take one option/value pair as an argument,
           so you need to repeat --extern for each pair needed. Example:

                     ./mariadb-test-run.pl --extern socket=var/tmp/mariadbd.1.sock alias

           Note: If a test case has an .opt file that requires the server to be restarted with specific options, the file will not be used. The test case likely will fail as a result.

       •   --fast

           Do not perform controlled shutdown when servers need to be restarted or at the end of the test run. This is equivalent to using --shutdown-timeout=0.

       •   --force-restart

           Always restart servers between tests.

       •   --force

           Normally, mariadb-test-run.pl exits if a test case fails.  --force causes execution to continue regardless of test case failure.

       •   --gcov

           Collect coverage information after the test. The result is a gcov file per source and header file.

       •   --gcov-src-dir

           Colllect coverage only within the given subdirectory. For example, if you're only developing the SQL layer, it makes sense to use --gcov-src-dir=sql.

       •   --gdb

           Start the mariadbd(s) in the gdb debugger.

       •   --gprof

           Collect profiling information using the gprof profiling tool.

       •   --manual-dbx

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in the dbx debugger.

       •   --manual-ddd

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in the ddd debugger.

       •   --manual-debug

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in a debugger.

       •   --manual-gdb

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in the gdb debugger.

       •   --manual-lldb

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in the lldb debugger.

       •   --mark-progress

           Marks progress with timing (in milliseconds) and line number in var/log/testname.progress.

       •   --max-connections=num

           The maximum number of simultaneous server connections that may be used per test. If not set, the maximum is 128. Minimum allowed limit is 8, maximum is 5120. Corresponds to the same option for
           mariadb-test.

       •   --max-save-core=N

           Limit the number of core files saved, to avoid filling up disks in case of a frequently crashing server. Defaults to 5, set to 0 for no limit. May also be set with the environment variable
           MTR_MAX_SAVE_CORE

       •   --max-save-datadir=N

           Limit the number of data directories saved after failed tests, to avoid filling up disks in case of frequent failures. Defaults to 20, set to 0 for no limit. May also be set with the
           environment variable MTR_MAX_SAVE_DATADIR

       •   --max-test-fail=N

           Stop execution after the specified number of tests have failed, to avoid using up resources (and time) in case of massive failures. retries are not counted, nor are failures of tests marked
           experimental. Defaults to 10, set to 0 for no limit. May also be set with the environment variable MTR_MAX_TEST_FAIL

       •   --mem

           This option is not supported on Windows.

           Run the test suite in memory, using tmpfs or ramdisk. This can decrease test times significantly, in particular if you would otherwise be running over a remote file system.
           mariadb-test-run.pl attempts to find a suitable location using a built-in list of standard locations for tmpfs and puts the var directory there. This option also affects placement of temporary
           files, which are created in var/tmp.

           The default list includes /dev/shm. You can also enable this option by setting the environment variable MTR_MEM[=dir_name]. If dir_name is given, it is added to the beginning of the list of
           locations to search, so it takes precedence over any built-in locations.

           Once you have run tests with --mem within a mariadb-testdirectory, a soflink var will have been set up to the temporary directory, and this will be re-used the next time, until the soflink is
           deleted. Thus, you do not have to repeat the --mem option next time.

       •   --mariadbd=value

           Extra options to pass to mariadbd. The value should consist of one or more comma-separated mariadbd options.

       •   --mariadbd-env=VAR=VAL

           Specify additional environment settings for "mariadbd". Use additional --mariadbd-env options to set more than one variable.

       •   --nocheck-testcases

           Disable the check for test case side effects; see --check-testcases for a description.

       •   --noreorder

           Do not reorder tests to reduce number of restarts, but run them in exactly the order given. If a whole suite is to be run, the tests are run in alphabetical order, though similar combinations
           will be grouped together. If more than one suite is listed, the tests are run one suite at a time, in the order listed.

       •   --notimer

           Cause mariadb-test not to generate a timing file. The effect of this is that the report from each test case does not include the timing in milliseconds as it normally does.

       •   --nowarnings

           Do not look for and report errors and warning in the server logs.

       •   --parallel={N|auto}

           Run tests using N parallel threads. By default, 1 thread is used. Use --parallel=auto for auto-setting of N.

       •   --[mtr-]port-base=P

           Specify base of port numbers to be used; a block of 10 will be allocated.  P should be divisible by 10; if it is not, it will be rounded down. If running with more than one parallel test
           thread, thread 2 will use the next block of 10 and so on.

           If the port number is given as auto, which is also the default, mariadb-test-run.pl will allocate a number unique to this host. The value may also be given with the environment variable
           MTR_PORT_BASE.

           If both --build-thread and --port-base are used, --port-base takes precedence.

       •   --print-testcases

           Do not run any tests, but print details about all tests, in the order they would have been run.

       •   --ps-protocol

           Use the binary protocol between client and server.

       •   --record

           Pass the --record option to mariadb-test. This option requires a specific test case to be named on the command line.

       •   --reorder

           Reorder tests to minimize the number of server restarts needed. This is the default behavior. There is no guarantee that a particular set of tests will always end up in the same order.

       •   --repeat=N

           Run each test N number of times.

       •   --report-features

           First run a "test" that reports MariaDB features, displaying the output of SHOW ENGINES and SHOW VARIABLES. This can be used to verify that binaries are built with all required features.

       •   --report-times

           Report how much time has been spent on different phases of test execution.

       •   --retry=N

           If a test fails, it is retried up to a maximum of N runs (default 1). Retries are also limited by the maximum number of failures before stopping, set with the --retry-failure option. This
           option has no effect unless --force is also used; without it, test execution will terminate after the first failure.

           The --retry and --retry-failure options do not affect how many times a test repeated with --repeat may fail in total, as each repetition is considered a new test case, which may in turn be
           retried if it fails.

       •   --retry-failure=N

           When using the --retry option to retry failed tests, stop when N failures have occurred (default 2). Setting it to 0 or 1 effectively turns off retries.

       •   --shutdown-timeout=SECONDS

           Max number of seconds to wait for servers to do controlled shutdown before killing them. Default is 10.

       •   --skip-combinations

           Do not apply combinations; ignore combinations file or option.

       •   --skip-rpl

           Skip replication test cases.

       •   --skip-ssl

           Do not start mariadbd with support for SSL connections.

       •   --skip-test=regex|regex

           Specify a regular expression to be applied to test case names. Cases with names that match the expression are skipped. tests to skip.

           The argument for the --skip-test option allows more flexible specification of which tests to skip. If the argument contains a pattern metacharacter other than a lone period, it is interpreted
           as a Perl regular expression and applies to test names that match the pattern. See the description of the --do-test option for details.

       •   --skip-test-list=FILE

           Skip the tests listed in FILE. Each line in the file is an entry and should be formatted as: <TESTNAME> : <COMMENT>

       •   --skip-*

           --skip-* options not otherwise recognized by mariadb-test-run.pl are passed to the master server.

       •   --sleep=N

           Pass --sleep=N to mariadb-test.

       •   --sp-protocol

           Create a stored procedure to execute all queries.

       •   --ssl

           If mariadb-test-run.pl is started with the --ssl option, it sets up a secure connection for all test cases. In this case, if mariadbd does not support SSL, mariadb-test-run.pl exits with an
           error message: Couldn't find support for SSL

       •   --staging-run

           Run a limited number of tests (no slow tests). Used for running staging trees with valgrind.

       •   --start

           Initialize and start servers with the startup settings for the specified test case. You can use this option to start a server to which you can connect later. For example, after building a
           source distribution you can start a server and connect to it with the mariadb client like this:

               shell> cd mariadb-test
               shell> ./mariadb-test-run.pl --start alias &
               shell> ../mariadb -S ./var/tmp/master.sock -h localhost -u root

           If no tests are named on the command line, the server(s) will be started with settings for the first test that would have been run without the --start option.

           mariadb-test-run.pl will stop once the server has been started, but will terminate if the server dies. If killed, it will also shut down the server.

       •   --start-and-exit

           Same --start, but mariadb-test-run terminates and leaves just the server running.

       •   --start-dirty

           This is similar to --start, but will skip the database initialization phase and assume that database files are already available. Usually this means you must have run another test first.

       •   --start-from=test_name

           mariadb-test-run.pl sorts the list of names of the test cases to be run, and then begins with test_name.

       •   --strace

           Run the "mariadbd" executables using strace. Default options are -f -o var/log/'mariadbd-name'.strace.

       •   --strace-client

           Create strace output for mariadb-test, optionally specifying name and path to the trace program to use.

           Example: ./mariadb-test-run.pl --strace-client=ktrace

       •   --strace-option=ARGS

           Option to give strace, replaces default option(s).

       •   --stress=ARGS

           Run stress test, providing options to mariadb-stress-test.pl. Options are separated by comma.

       •   --suite[s]=suite_name...

           Comma separated list of suite names to run. The default is: "main-,archive-,binlog-,csv-,federated-,funcs_1-,funcs_2-, handler-,heap-,innodb-,innodb_fts-,innodb_zip-,maria-,
           multi_source-,optimizer_unfixed_bugs-,parts-,perfschema-, plugins-,roles-,rpl-,sys_vars-,unit-,vcol-".

       •   --stop-file=file

           If this file is detected, mariadb-test will not start new tests until the file is removed (also MTR_STOP_FILE environment variable).

       •   --stop-keep-alive=sec

           Works with --stop-file, print messages every sec seconds when mariadb-test is waiting to remove the file (for buildbot) (also MTR_STOP_KEEP_ALIVE environment variable).

       •   --suite-timeout=minutes

           Specify the maximum test suite runtime in minutes. The default is 360.

       •   --testcase-timeout

           Specify the maximum test case runtime in minutes. The default is 15.

       •   --timediff

           Used with --timestamp, also print time passed since the previous test started.

       •   --timer

           Cause mariadb-test to generate a timing file. The default file is named ./var/log/timer.

       •   --timestamp

           Prints a timestamp before the test case name in each test report line, showing when the test ended.

       •   --tmpdir=path

           The directory where temporary file are stored. The default location is ./var/tmp. The environment variable MYSQL_TMP_DIR will be set to the path for this directory, whether it has the default
           value or has been set explicitly. This may be referred to in tests.

       •   --user=user_name

           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server (default root).

       •   --user-args

           In combination with start* and no test name, drops arguments to mariadbd except those specified with --mariadbd (if any).

       •   --valgrind[-all]

           Run mariadb-test and mariadbd with valgrind. This and the following --valgrind options require that the executables have been built with valgrind support.

       •   --valgrind-mariadbd

           Run the mariadbd server with valgrind.

       •   --valgrind-mariadb-test

           Run the mariadb-test and mariadb-client-test executables with valgrind.

       •   --valgrind-option=str

           Option to give valgrind. Replaces default option(s). Can be specified more then once&.

       •   --valgrind-path=path

           Path to the valgrind executable.

       •   --vardir=path

           Specify the path where files generated during the test run are stored. The default location is ./var. The environment variable MYSQLTEST_VARDIR will be set to the path for this directory,
           whether it has the default value or has been set explicitly. This may be referred to in tests.

       •   --verbose

           Give more verbose output regarding test execution. Use the option twice to get even more output. Note that the output generated within each test case is not affected.

       •   --verbose-restart

           Write when and why servers are restarted between test cases.

       •   --view-protocol

           Create a view to execute all non updating queries.

       •   --vs-config=config_val

           Visual Studio configuration used to create executables (default: MTR_VS_CONFIG environment variable) This option is for Windows only.

       •   --wait-all

           If --start or --start-dirty is used, wait for all servers to exit before termination. Otherwise, it will terminate if one (of several) servers is restarted.

       •   --warnings

           Search the server log for errors or warning after each test and report any suspicious ones; if any are found, the test will be marked as failed. This is the default behavior, it may be turned
           off with --nowarnings.
