NAME
       Frontier::Responder - Create XML-RPC listeners for normal CGI processes

SYNOPSIS
        use Frontier::Responder;
        my $res = Frontier::Responder->new( methods => {
                                                        add => sub{ $_[0] + $_[1] },
                                                        cat => sub{ $_[0] . $_[1] },
                                                       },
                                           );
        print $res->answer;

DESCRIPTION
       Use Frontier::Responder whenever you need to create an XML-RPC listener using a standard CGI interface. To be effective, a script using this class will often have to be put a directory from which
       a web server is authorized to execute CGI programs. An XML-RPC listener using this library will be implementing the API of a particular XML-RPC application. Each remote procedure listed in the API
       of the user defined application will correspond to a hash key that is defined in the "new" method of a Frontier::Responder object. This is exactly the way Frontier::Daemon works as well.  In order
       to process the request and get the response, the "answer" method is needed. Its return value is XML ready for printing.

       For those new to XML-RPC, here is a brief description of this protocol.  XML-RPC is a way to execute functions on a different machine. Both the client's request and listeners response are wrapped
       up in XML and sent over HTTP. Because the XML-RPC conversation is in XML, the implementation languages of the server (here called a listener), and the client can be different. This can be a
       powerful and simple way to have very different platforms work together without acrimony. Implicit in the use of XML-RPC is a contract or API that an XML-RPC listener implements and an XML-RPC
       client calls. The API needs to list not only the various procedures that can be called, but also the XML-RPC datatypes expected for input and output. Remember that although Perl is permissive
       about datatyping, other languages are not. Unforuntately, the XML-RPC spec doesn't say how to document the API. It is recommended that the author of a Perl XML-RPC listener should at least use POD
       to explain the API.  This allows for the programmatic generation of a clean web page.

METHODS
       new( OPTIONS )
           This  is  the  class  constructor.  As  is  traditional,  it  returns  a blessed reference to a Frontier::Responder object. It expects arguments to be given like a hash (Perl's named parameter
           mechanism).  To be effective, populate the "methods" parameter with a hashref that has API procedure names as keys and subroutine references as values. See the SYNOPSIS for a sample usage.

       answer()
           In order to parse the request and execute the procedure, this method must be called. It returns a XML string that contains the procedure's response. In a typical CGI program, this string  will
           simply be printed to STDOUT.
