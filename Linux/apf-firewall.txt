NAME
       apf - easy iptables based firewall system

SYNOPSIS
       apf

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the apf command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       Advanced Policy Firewall (APF) is an iptables (netfilter) based firewall system designed around the essential needs of today's Internet deployed servers  and
       the  unique  needs  of  custom deployed Linux installations. The configuration of APF is designed to be very informative and present the user with an easy to
       follow process, from top to bottom of the configuration file. The management of APF on a day-to-day basis is conducted from the command line with  the  'apf'
       command, which includes detailed usage information and all the features one would expect from a current and forward thinking firewall solution.
