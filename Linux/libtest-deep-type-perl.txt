NAME
       Test::Deep::Type - A Test::Deep plugin for validating type constraints

VERSION
       version 0.008

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::More;
           use Test::Deep;
           use Test::Deep::Type;
           use MooseX::Types::Moose 'Str';

           cmp_deeply(
               {
                   message => 'ack I am slain',
                   counter => 123,
               },
               {
                   message => is_type(Str),
                   counter => is_type(sub { die "not an integer" unless int($_[0]) eq $_[0] }),
               },
               'message is a plain string, counter is a number',
           );

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Test::Deep plugin that provides the sub "is_type" to indicate that the data being tested must validate against the passed type. This is an actual type object, not a string name -- for
       example something provided via MooseX::Types, or a plain old coderef that returns a bool (such as what might be used in a Moo type constraint).

FUNCTIONS
   "is_type"
       Exported by default; to be used within a Test::Deep comparison function such as cmp_deeply.  As this module aims to be a solution for many popular type systems, we attempt to use the type in
       multiple ways:

       MooseX::Types/Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint-style types:
           If the "validate" method exists, it is invoked on the type object with the data as its parameter (which should return "undef" on success, and the error message on failure).

       coderef/Moo-style types:
           If  the  type  appears  to  be or act like a coderef (either a coderef, blessed or unblessed, or possesses a coderef overload) the type is invoked as a sub, with the data as its parameter. Its
           return value is treated as a boolean; if it also dies with a message describing the failure, this message is used in the failure diagnostics.

           Type::Tiny types fall into this category, and are fully supported.

CAVEATS
       Regular strings describing a type under a particular system (e.g. Moose, Params::Validate) are not currently supported.
