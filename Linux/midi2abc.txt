DESCRIPTION
       midi2abc takes a MIDI format file and converts it to something as close as possible to abc text format. The user then has to add text fields not present in the MIDI header and possibly tidy up the abc
       note output.

       The output of midi2abc is printed to the screen. To save it to a file, use the redirection operator, (e.g. midi2abc -f file.mid > file.abc) or specify the output file using the -o option.

       Use only one or none of the options -u -gu, -b and -Q. Midi2abc normally converts the MIDI time units into quantum units normally corresponding to the abc 1/16th note or 1/32nd note.  If none of these
       is present, the program will use the PPQN information in the MIDI header to compute the suitable conversion factor. For most MIDI files on the web, it is recommended to rely on the MIDI header  infor‐
       mation and not use any of the options other than the formatting options.

       The program will extract the time signature information from the MIDI file if it is present. Otherwise it will assume 4/4 or you could specify it with -m. option.

       If the tune has an anacrusis, you can use either the -ga or -xa option to estimate the its length. Alternatively, you can specify its value using the -a option. The anacrusis is specified in half unit
       lengths, where the unit length is defined by the L: field. For example if L: 1/8, then a quarter note would be indicated by the value 4, (4 1/16 units).

   OPTIONS
       -a acbeats
              where acbeats specifies the anacrusis in half unit lengths.

       -xa    extract the anacrusis from file by finding the first strong note

       -ga    guess the anacrusis by minimizing the number of ties across bars

       -m time signature
              time signature

       -b bars
              number of bars wanted in output

       -Q tempo
              tempo in quarter-notes per minute

       -u pulses
              Allows you to specify directly the number of midi pulses per abc time unit.

       -ppu parts per abc unit length
              Normally, the smallest note unit that midi2abc can extract is half the L: unit length.This is called the quantum unit.  Thus for L: 1/8, midi2abc can extract 1/16 notes but not 1/32 notes.  You
              can change this by specifying -ppu 4 for example. The number of parts should be a power of 2.

       -aul denominator of abc unit length
              Normally midi2abc chooses a unit length of 1/8 or 1/16 depending upon the time signature. For time signatures smaller than 3/4 the L: 1/16 is used and for larger time signatures L: 1/8 is used.
              You can specify the unit length to be used using this parameter. Thus -aul 32 will cause midi2abc to use a unit length of 1/32 nd note.

       -gu    Tells midi2abc to estimate the number of midi pulses per abc time unit from the note duration or spacing in the MIDI file.

       -gk    Tells midi2abc to guess the key signature by minimizing the number of accidentals even if the key signature is already specified in the MIDI file. By default the key signature is the one speci‐
              fied in the MIDI file.  If it is not specified, then the program guesses the key signature by minimizing accidentals.

       -k key key signature: -6 to 6 sharps.

       -c channel
              select only this midi channel.

       -f infile
              input file in midi format

       -o output file
              specifies the output abc file name.

       -s     do not discard very short notes.

       -sr quantum units
              do  not  notate  a  short  rest smaller than the specified size after a note. If the size (in quantum units) is zero, nothing is done. For larger values, the rest is absorbed into the preceding
              note. In other words, the preceding note is lengthened to include that rest.

       -sum   print a short summary of the input midi file.

       -nb    do not look for broken rhythms

       -nt    do not look for triplets

       -obpl  Print only one bar per line instead of 4. For complex music this improves the readability and avoids some problems with some abc to postscript converters. This option is deprecated.

       -nogr  (No note grouping.) Inserts a space between all notes. It makes a less pretty postscript file but it is easier to edit.

       -bpl nbars
              Print nbars of music on every line followed by a backslash.

       -bps nbars
              When nbars have been printed (including those lines joined by a backslash continuation) go to a new line (with no backslash).

       -splitvoices
              This parameter handles polyphonic chords by splitting an entire voice into multiple voices. (A polyphonic chord is a chord composed of notes that do not start or end at  the  same  time.)  Nor‐
              mally,  midi2abc  joins the longer notes to the notes in the following chord using ties.  Here is an example:  [Bd-]d [Bd-]d|. This should be separated into two voices ideally  Bz Bz and d2 d2.
              However, the separation is not unique. Bz d2 and d2 Bz are also ok.

       -midigram
              When this option appears, all other options are ignored and no abc file is produced. Instead a list of all notes in the MIDI file are printed in a fixed format. Each line represents a  pair  of
              MIDI note on/off event. The line contains the on/off time of the note, its track number, channel number, midi pitch and midi velocity. The last record indicates the duration of the MIDI file in
              MIDI pulse units. The output is designed to go into a graphical user interface which will produce a graphical representation (piano roll).

       -mftext
              When this option appears, all other options are ignored and no abc file is produced. Instead a list of all the MIDI commands are printed. The output is designed to go into a graphical user  in‐
              terface provided by runabc.tcl.

       -mftextpulses
              Same as -mftext except the time units is in midi pulses.

       -title string
              Replaces the default title field following T: with the given string.

       -origin string
              Adds an O: field with the given string.

       -stats Extracts  the characteristics of the given midi file. They include ntrks - the number of tracks, ppqn - pulses per quarter note, timesig - time signature, keysig - key signature, program - map‐
              ping between channel number and midi program, npulses - length of the midi file in pulses, tempocmd - number of times the tempo has been specified, pitchbends -  number  of  pitchbends,  pitch‐
              bendin - number of pitchbends in each of the channels, programcmd - number of times the midi program has been revised, progs and progsact - the programs used and the number of pulses these pro‐
              grams used, drums - the drum numbers that were used, drumhits - the number of times each of those drums were hit, pitches - the number of times the 11 pitch classes (C C# etc...) were activated
              and  a  few  other  complex  variables. These characteristics are used in other applications such as midiexplorer. More details are available in the file midi2abc-stats.txt included in the doc/
              folder of the abcmidi distribution package.

   FEATURES
       * The key is chosen so as to minimize the number of accidentals.  Alternatively, the user can specify the key numerically (a positive number is the number of sharps, a negative  number  is  minus  the
       number of flats).

       *  Note  length  can be set by specifying the total number of bars or the tempo of the piece. Alternatively the note length can be read from the file.  However, by default it is deduced in a heuristic
       manner from the inter-note distances.  This means that you do not have to use the MIDI clock as a metronome when playing in a tune from a keyboard.

       * Barlines are automatically inserted. The user specifies the number of measures in the anacrusis before the first barline and the time signature.

       * The program can guess how the length of the anacrusis, either by looking for the first strong note or minimizing the number of notes split by a tie across a barline.

       * Where a note extends beyond a bar break, it is split into two tied notes.

       * The output has 4 bars per line.

       * Enough accidental signs are put in the music to ensure that no pitch errors occur if a barline is added or deleted.

       * The program attempts to group notes sensibly in each bar.

       * Triplets and broken rhythm (a>b) are supported.

       * Chords are identified.

       * Text information from the original MIDI file is included as comments.

       * The -c option can be used to select only 1 MIDI channel. Events on other channels are ignored.

   LIMITATIONS
       midi2abc does not ...

       * Supply tune title, composer or any other field apart from X: , K:, Q:, M: and L: - these must be added by hand afterwards, though they may have been included in the text of the MIDI file.

       * Support duplets, quadruplets, other esoteric features.

       * Support mid-tune key or time signature changes.

       * Deduce repeats. The output is just the notes in the input file.

       * Recover an abc tune as supplied to abc2midi. However, if you want to do this, "midi2abc  -xa -f file.mid" comes close.
