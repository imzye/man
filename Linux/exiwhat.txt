NAME
       exiwhat - Finding out what Exim processes are doing

SYNOPSIS
       exiwhat

DESCRIPTION
       On  operating systems that can restart a system call after receiving a signal (most modern OS), an Exim process responds to the SIGUSR1 signal by writing a line describing what it is doing to the file
       exim-process.info in the Exim spool directory.  The exiwhat script sends the signal to all Exim processes it can find, having first emptied the file.  It then waits for one second to  allow  the  Exim
       processes to react before displaying the results.  In order to run exiwhat successfully you have to have sufficient privilege to send the signal to the Exim processes, so it is normally run as root.

       Unfortunately,  the  ps  command  which exiwhat uses to find Exim processes varies in different operating systems.  Not only are different options used, but the format of the output is different.  For
       this reason, there are some system configuration options that configure exactly how exiwhat works.  If it doesn't seem to be working for you, check the following compile-time options:

       EXIWHAT_PS_CMD
              the command for running “ps”

       EXIWHAT_PS_ARG
              the argument for “ps”

       EXIWHAT_EGREP_ARG
              the argument for “egrep” to select from “ps” output

       EXIWHAT_KILL_ARG
              the argument for the “kill” command

       An example of typical output from exiwhat is

         164 daemon: -q1h, listening on port 25
       10483 running queue: waiting for 0tAycK-0002ij-00 (10492)
       10492 delivering 0tAycK-0002ij-00 to mail.ref.example [10.19.42.42]
         (editor@ref.example)
       10592 handling incoming call from [192.168.243.242]
       10628 accepting a local non-SMTP message

       The first number in the output line is the process number.  The third line has been split here, in order to fit it on the page.

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
