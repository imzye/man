NAME
       pydoctor - API documentation generator for Python

SYNOPSIS
       pydoctor [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Pydoctor is an API documentation generator that works primarily by static analysis.

       It was written primarily to replace epydoc for the purposes of the Twisted project as epydoc has difficulties with zope.interface, but can be used for non-Zope Python code as well.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -c CONFIGFILE, --config=CONFIGFILE
              Use config from this file (any command lineoptions override settings from the file).

       -p INPUTPICKLE, --input-pickle=INPUTPICKLE

       -o OUTPUTPICKLE, --output-pickle=OUTPUTPICKLE
              Save the system to this pickle file (default: none, the system is not saved by default).

       --extra-system=SYS:URLPREFIX
              Look for objects in this system to.  Links to these objects will have URLPREFIX prepended to them.

       --system-class=SYSTEMCLASS

       --project-base-dir=PROJECTBASEDIRECTORY
              Absolute path to the base directory of the project.  Source links will be computed based on this value.

       --testing
              Don't complain if the run doesn't have any effects.

       --pdb  Like py.test's --pdb.

       --local-only
              Bind the server to localhost only.

       --facing-path=FACING_PATH

       --edit When serving HTML, allow editing.

       --no-check

              Add a package to the system.  Can be repeated to add more than one package.

       --add-module=MODULE
              Add a module to the system.  Can be repeated.

       --prepend-package=PREPENDEDPACKAGE

       --resolve-aliases
              This updates references to classes imported from a module into which they were imported to references to where they are defined.

       --abbreviate-specialcase=ABBREVMAPPING
              This  is  a comma-separated list of key=value pairs.  Where any key corresponds to a module name and value is the desired abbreviation.  This can be used to resolve conflicts with abbrevia‐

       --html-write-function-pages
              Make individual HTML files for every function and method. They're not linked to in any pydoctorgenerated HTML, but they can be useful for third-party linking.

       --html-use-sorttable
              Use the sorttable JS library to make tables of package, module and class contents sortable

       --html-use-splitlinks
              Generate (unobstrusive) JavaScript to allow class methods to be shown either in one table per base class or in one big table.

       --html-shorten-lists
              Generate (unobstrusive) JavaScript to hide some of the entries in long lists of e.g. subclasses.
