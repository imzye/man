NAME
     mrxvt — A tabbed VT102 terminal emulator for X Window System

SYNOPSIS
     mrxvt [options] [-e cmd]

DESCRIPTION
     The mrxvt program is a terminal emulator for X Window System. It provides DEC VT102 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the window system directly.

     mrxvt is based on rxvt(1) version 2.7.11 CVS, and features most of functionality of rxvt, with a few major enhancements (namely multiple tabs, and transparency). Like rxvt, mrxvt aims to be light, fast,
     flexible and desktop independent, thus KDE or GNOME are not required.

     The primary features of mrxvt include (but are not limited to) multiple tabs, dynamically changeable tab titles, customisable command for each tab, input  broadcasting,  true  translucent  window,  fast
     pseudo  transparency with tinting, user supplied background images (XPM, JPEG, PNG), off-focus fading, text shadow, multiple style (NeXT, Rxvt, Xterm, SGI, Plain) scrollbars, XIM, multi-language support
     (Chinese, Korean, Japanese), freetype font and logging.

     The default mrxvt behaviour can be set using the resource configuration file ~/.mrxvtrc.  For backward compatibility, if ~/.mrxvtrc is not found, mrxvt tries to  load  configuration  settings  from  the
     files ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources.  Alternately, you can specify which config file to load using the -cf command line option.

OPTIONS
     This  section describes the commandline options mrxvt accepts. To disable an option, prefix it with an ‘+’ instead of a ‘-’ Most options can be set from your ~/.mrxvtrc file using the option name listed
     in brackets as [option_name].  The option name can also be used as a "long option" from the command line (i.e. by prefixing it with ‘--’ or ‘++’ as appropriate. For example

         mrxvt -tr -shade 85 +trt

     is the same as

         mrxvt --transparent --shading 85 ++transparentTabbar

     which is the same as putting the lines

         Mrxvt.transparent:              True
         Mrxvt.shading:                  85
         Mrxvt.transparentTabbar:        False

     in your ~/.mrxvtrc.

     All options are case sensitive. Some options are similar to those of other terminals, so if you find the explanation given here insufficient, we strongly recommend you look in the rxvt(1)  and  xterm(1)
     manpages.

   Terminal name and display options
     -display|-d displayname
           X display name, the X server to contact

     -geometry|-g geometry
           geometry at startup [geometry]

     -ic file[;geometry]
           application icon file.  [appIcon]

     -iconic|+iconic
           start iconic [iconic]

     -in name
           Icon name for window [iconName]

     -into WinID
           If given an X window identifier, mrxvt will reparent its top-level shell widget to that window.  This is used to embed mrxvt within other applications.

     -name name
           Client instance, icon, and title strings [clientName].

     -title string
           title name of the window [title]

     -tn termname
           The type of terminal mrxvt should emulate. The value of the TERM environment variable is set to this value for all child processes launched by mrxvt.  Note that rxvt and most rxvt clones including
           mrxvt, have slightly different terminal capabilities than those of xterm(1). Thus mrxvt will not always work properly with the terminal set to xterm, and we recommend setting this  value  to  rxvt
           instead.  However  some systems have incorrect (or even missing) terminfo(1) or termcap(1) entries for the terminal rxvt.  If you experience problems with this, the ideal solution would be to cor‐
           rect your systems termcap and terminfo entries. If you are unable to do that, then you can try setting your terminal to xterm and hope everything works properly.  [termName]

   Transparency related options
     -o %d
           Translucent window (true transparent) background opacity degree.  %d is an integer between 0 and 100. This option needs translucent support by the X server,  e.g.,  Xorg  6.8,  and  overrides  the
           pseudo-transparency.  [opacity]

     -od -%d
           Translucent window opacity degree increase/decrease interval.  %d is an integer between 0 and 100 [opacityDegree]

     -tr|+tr
           Enable  /  disable  background pseudo-transparency. To use this feature you must set your desktop wallpaper using an Esetroot compatible program ( i.e. a program that publishes the wallpaper using
           the _XROOTPMAP_ID atom). Some programs that will do this are Esetroot(1), feh(1), fvwm-root(1) with the ‘--retain-pixmap’ option, or KDE. Note: To use  your  precious  backgroundFade,  tinting  or
           shading options, you MUST set the desktop wallpaper in an Esetroot way.  [transparent]

     -trf|+trf
           If  you  choose  NOT  to set the background in an Esetroot compatible way, then you can still have transparency using this option. (You must also enable the transparent option). Background changes
           made by FvwmBacker, xsetbg (xli) or Esetroot compatible programs, will be automatically detected. However changes made by xv(1), xsetroot(1) or other non-Esetroot compatible programs will  not  be
           detected. If you're hell bent on non-Esetroot compatible programs to set your background, then do something like

               xsetroot -solid "#202040" && fvwm-root -d

           Note: To use your precious backgroundFade, tinting or shading options, you MUST set the desktop wallpaper in an Esetroot way.  [transparentForce]

     -trm|+trm
           Enable / disable pseudo-transparent menubar. Pseudo-transparency must be turned on.  [transparentMenubar]

     -trs|+trs
           Enable / disable pseudo-transparent scrollbar. Pseudo-transparency must be turned on.  [transparentScrollbar]

     -trt|+trt
           Enable / disable pseudo-transparent tabbar. Pseudo-transparency must be turned on.  [transparentTabbar]

   Background image related options
     -mbpixmap file[;geometry]
           Menubar background image. Pseudo-transparency must be turned off.  [menubarPixmap]

     -pixmap file[;geometry]
           Background image for all terminals if not set individually. Pseudo-transparency must be turned off.  [Pixmap]

     -sbpixmap file[;geometry]
           Scrollbar background image. Pseudo transparency must be turned off.  [scrollbarPixmap]

     -tbpixmap file[;geometry]
           Tabbar background image. Pseudo transparency must be turned off.  [tabbarPixmap]

     -tupixmap|+tupixmap
           Apply tabbar background image to tabs.  [tabUsePixmap]

   Scrolling related options
     -mp|+mp
           scroll one page when press mouse wheel button [mouseWheelScrollPage]

     -sa mode
           Scrollbar alignment ( top | bottom) [scrollbarAlign]

     -sb|+sb
           Hide / show scrollbar [scrollBar]

     -sbt width
           Scrollbar thickness/width [scrollbarThickness]

     -si|+si
           Inhibit scrolling on tty output.  [scrollTtyOutputInhibit]

     -sk|+sk
           scroll-on-keypress [scrollTtyKeypress]

     -sl n
           The number of scrolled lines to save (for all tabs) if not set individually. The maximal number of saved lines is 65535.  [saveLines]

     -sr|+sr
           Scrollbar on right [scrollbarRight]

     -ss mode
           Scrollbar style.  mode should be one of plain, xterm, rxvt, next or sgi.  [scrollbarStyle]

     -st|+st
           Draw floating scrollbar (i.e. without a trough).  [scrollbarFloating]

   Color related options
     -bg color
           Background color [background]

     -bd color
           Border color [borderColor]

     -bgfade %d
           (Obsolete)  Make  colors  %d darker for background image or pseudo-transparent background.  %d is an integer between 0 and 100. This is like tinting the background with black. This option is obso‐
           lete, and you should use the tint and shade options instead.  [backgroundFade]

     -bgtype type
           Transformation type for background pixmap (not implemented yet)

     -cr color
           color of cursor [cursorColor]

     -fade %d
           Make colors %d darker when mrxvt looses focus.  %d is an integer between 0 and 100 [fading]

     -fg color
           Foreground color.  [foreground]

     -itabbg color
           Background color of inactive tabs and tabbar.  [itabBackground]

     -itabfg color
           Foreground color of inactive tabs.  [itabForeground]

     -pr color
           color of pointer [pointerColor]

     -shade %d
           Shade background to %d degree when tinting the background.  %d is an integer between 0 and 100. You must also define a color using the tint option. When compiled with XRender support, the  tabbar,
           menubar and scroll bar are tinted with their respective background colors for pseudo-transparent terminals.  [shading]

     -tabbg color
           background color of active tab.  [tabBackground]

     -tabfg color
           Foreground color of tabbar [tabForeground]

     -tint color
           Color  tinted  on  background  image or pseudo-transparent background. This works differently depending on the tint type: With XRender (when compiled with --enable-xrender), color is the color you
           want to tint your background to. The brighter the color, the less transparent it will be (regardless of the shade degree specified by -shade).  For example, if  you  want  your  background  tinted
           black, set color to ‘#000000’, however if you want a white tinted transparent background, set color to some level of grey (e.g.  ‘#808080’) but NOT to ‘#ffffff’.

           When compiled without XRender support, color works like a color mask. Thus if you want a black tinted background, set color to ‘#ffffff’.

           The shade degree (using -shade) must be defined as well.  [tintColor]

     -tinttype type
           Function applied for background tinting (not implemented yet).

     -ts color
           color of text shadow [textShadow]

     -tsm mode
           Text shadow mode, specify shadow position of text: left | right | top | bottom | topleft | topright | botleft | botright | none.  [textShadowMode]

     -txttype -type
           Function applied for text drawing (not implemented yet)

     -ufbg color
           Default background color when the terminal window looses focus.  [ufBackground]

   Font related options
     -fb fontname
           bold text X11 font name [boldFont]

     -fm fontname
           multichar text X11 font name [mfont]

     -fn fontname
           normal text X11 font name [font]

     -xft|+xft
           Use freetype font instead of X11 font. This option controls all other freetype font related options.  [xft]

     -xftaa|+xftaa
           Enable / disable antialiasing of freetype font. This makes font look much nicer, but significantly slows down the rendering speed. The -xft option must be enabled.  [xftAntialias]

     -xftah|+xftah
           Enable / disable autohint of freetype font. The -xft option must be enabled [xftAutoHint]

     -xftfm fontname
           Multichar text freetype font family. The -xft option must be enabled [xftmFont]

     -xftfn fontname
           Normal text freetype font family. The -xft option must be enabled [xftFont]

     -xftga|+xftga
           Enable / disable global advance of freetype font. The -xft option must be enabled [xftGlobalAdvance]

     -xftht|+xftht
           Enable / disable hinting of freetype font. The -xft option must be enabled [xftHinting]

     -xftmsz size
           Freetype multichar font size in pixels. The -xft option must be enabled.  [xftmSize]

     -xftnfm|+xftnfm
           Do not load freetype mfont, but use freetype font instead. This can avoid a large line space if the size of font and mfont are very different. The -xft option must be enabled [xftNomFont]

     -xftpfn font
           Specify  a  proportionally spaced font to use for drawing tab-titles. If set, the tab bar behaves like Firefox's tab-bar: All tabs have the same width, and the widths are shrunk / expanded to keep
           the number of tabs specified by minVisibleTabs visible. The active tab title is drawn in a bold font. (Your colors are still used).  [xftPFont]

     -xftrgb style
           Freetype font sub-pixel order: rgb | bgr | vrgb | vbgr | none.  The -xft option must be enabled.  [xftRGBA]

     -xftslow|+xftslow
           Display freetype multichar string in slow mode for better display effect. The xft option must be enabled.  [xftSlowOutput]

     -xftst style
           Freetype font slant: roman | italic | oblique.  The -xft option must be enabled.  [xftSlant]

     -xftsz number
           Freetype font size in pixel. The -xft option must be enabled [xftSize]

     -xftbwt style
           Freetype bold font weight: light | medium | demibold | bold | black.  The -xft option must be enabled.  [xftBoldWeight]

     -xftwd style
           Freetype font width: ultracondensed | condensed | normal | expanded | ultraexpanded.  The -xft option must be enabled.  [xftWidth]

     -xftwt style
           Freetype font weight: light | medium | demibold | bold | black.  The -xft option must be enabled.  [xftWeight]

   Tabs and command related options
     -aht  Automatically hide or show the tab bar depending on the number of tabs. On startup, the tabbar is shown only if there are more than one tabs present. If there is only one tab, and  a  new  one  is
           created, then the tabbar is shown. If there are two tabs and one is closed, then the tabbar is hidden. A keyboard shortcut used at any time to hide / show the tabbar.  [autohideTabbar]

     -at|+at
           Run  command  specified  with -e on all tabs (by default the command specified by -e is only used for the first tab opened). This causes the profile option command to be ignored. However a command
           specified via the NewTab macro is honored.  [cmdAllTabs]

     -bt|+bt
           Show tabbar at bottom.  [bottomTabbar]

     -e [arguments ...]
           Specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be run in the mrxvt window. By default this command is only run initially, and all tabs created after startup will run the  default  shell
           (or program supplied by -profile%d). This behaviour can be overridden with the -at option.  [command]

     -hb|+hb
           Hide buttons in the tabbar.  [hideButtons]

     -het string
           Message to display in tabs after the child process exits. (This string is escape and percent interpolated).  [holdExitText]

     -heT string
           Set the title of tabs to string after the process in the tab exits. (This string is escape and percent interpolated).  [holdExitTitle]

     -hold mask
           Hold  the  tab open after the child process in it exits.  mask is the mask of flags which control weather the tab will be held open based on the exit status of the child process. If the lowest bit
           (0x01) of mask is set, then the tab will always be held open after the child exits. If the next bit (0x02) is set, then the tab will only be held open if  the  child  exits  abnormally  (e.g.  via
           abort(1)).  If the third bit (0x04) is set, then the tab will be held open if the child exits with non-zero status.

           NOTE:  In  previous versions of mrxvt this was a boolean option. For backward compatibility, the value of True, On, Yes will be treated as 1 and anything illegal will be treated as 0.  The default
           is 0x06.  [holdExit]

     -ht|+ht
           Hide tabbar on initialization [hideTabbar]

     -htb|+htb
           Highlight inactive tabs only when bell sounds. Default is to highlight inactive tabs whenever they produce output.  [highlightTabOnBell]

     -ip profiles
           profiles is a comma separated list of profiles numbers. On startup mrxvt opens each of these profiles in a tab.  [initProfileList]

     -ls|+ls
           Indicates that the shell that is started in the mrxvt window will be a login shell (i.e., the first character of argv[0] will be a dash, indicating to the shell that  it  should  read  the  user's
           .login or .profile). [loginShell]

     -mtw width
           The maximum width (in characters) of the displayed tabs. This can not be larger than 40. If you use Xft, then you might want to use the minVisibleTabs option instead.  [maxTabWidth]

     -mvt n
           When using xftPFont to display tabs, keep at least n tabs visible.  [minVisibleTabs]

     -profileN.option value
           Set  option  to  value in profile N.  When a new tab is created with profile N it uses all options that are set for this profile. Currently the only options that can be set per profile are Pixmap,
           background, command, foreground, saveLines, holdExit, holdExitText, holdExitTitle, tabTitle, titleFormat, winTitleFormat and workingDirectory.  Then all the settings from that profile  number  are
           used.

           N  can be any integer between 0 and the compiled in maximum (default 5). The profile number 0 is special, and contains default settings which are used for all profiles where this option is not set
           (e.g.  -profile0.tt mrxvt sets the tab title to mrxvt for all profiles where the tab title has not been set). In this case the -profile0. can be omitted entirely (i.e.  -profile0.tt is  equivalent
           to -tt).

           This  option  is  intended  to  replace the -vt%d.xx options from mrxvt version 0.5.0. The old -vt%d.xx would set options for the %dth tab. This causes inconsistent behaviour when the user moves /
           closes tabs. The behaviour of the -profile option is to set options for a particular profile, and then these settings can be associated (on demand) to newly created tabs.  [profileN.option]

     -ps|+ps
           Protect tab from being closed if it is using the secondary screen, for example, when the user is running vim(1)  or  mutt(1),  this  can  prevent  the  terminal  from  being  accidentally  closed.
           [protectSecondary]

     -sti|+sti
           Synchronize icon name with tab title when switch to a new tab or the title of the active tab changes.  [syncTabIcon]

     -stt|+stt
           Synchronize terminal title with tab title when switch to a new tab or the title of the active tab changes. (See also the -wtf option).  [syncTabTitle]

     -tnum N
           OBSOLETE. Opens N tabs on startup. For backward compatibility, the tabs are opened with profile 0, 1, ...  N-1.  [initTermNumber]

     -tt string
           Title of the tab [tabTitle]

     -tf format
           If set, this controls the displayed title of each tab.  format is % interpolated, and the result is displayed as the tab title.

           NOTE:  Currently this option requires the tab titles to be drawn with a proportionally spaced font (which is currently only possible with Xft). Also, this option only affects the displayed tab ti‐
           tle, and thus %t will still expand to the actual tab title, as set via an escape sequence, or macro. For example, setting this option  to  ‘%n.  %t’  will  cause  all  the  tabs  to  be  numbered.
           [titleFormat]

     -ut|+ut
           Utmp inhibit.  [utmpInhibit]

     -vbf|+vbf
           If unset, colored bold text will not be rendered using overstrike / bold font. See also boldColors and veryBright.  [veryBoldFont]

     -wd   Working  directory  of the child process. If non-empty, then the child process is started in this directory. If set to ‘.’ then the child process is run in the working directory of the current tab
           if possible. On Linux, this is the default. (NOTE: It is not always possible to find the working directory of the current tab. This works fine on Linux, but causes problems on other systems  [e.g.
           OpenBSD], which is why it is only enabled by default on Linux).  [workingDirectory]

     -wtf format
           Controls the format of the window title. If set, and the option -stt is used, then the window title is set to format (after % interpolation), instead of the tab title.  [winTitleFormat]

   Multichar and multi-language support
     -mcc|+mcc
           Multichar cursor movement [multibyte_cursor]

     -km mode
           multichar encoding mode [multichar_encoding]

     -im name
           name of X Input Method (XIM) [inputMethod]

     -pt mode
           XIM input style: OverTheSpot|OffTheSpot|Root [preeditType]

     -thai|+thai
           Thai support [thai]

     -grk mode
           Greek keyboard mapping: iso|ibm [greek_keyboard]

   Menu related options
     -menu filename[;tag]
           Menubar definition file.  [menu]

     -showmenu|+showmenu
           show menubar [showMenu]

   Keyboard and window related options
     -b number
           internal border width [internalBorder]

     -bc|+bc
           Display a blinking cursor.  [cursorBlink]

     -bcst|+bcst
           Enable / disable broadcasting input to all terminals [broadcast]

     -bci number
           Cursor blink interval (ms) [cursorBlinkInterval]

     -bl|+bl
           Use a borderless window.  [borderLess]

     -blc cmd
           Bell  command instead of beeping. If cmd begins with ‘!’ then it is passed to /bin/sh -c for execution. Otherwise it is split into words at spaces or tabs only, and executed via execvp(3).  If you
           don't want a space or tab to cause word splitting, then precede it with a ‘\’.  If you want to pass ‘\ ’ as an argument, double the ‘\’.

           Note: Only backslashes (or chains of backslashes) that precede a space or tab character are treated specially. That is ‘\\a’ will be left untouched, however ‘\\ ’ will expand to a ‘\’ and the  ‘ ’
           will cause a word break, and ‘\ ’ will expand to a ‘ ’ which does not cause a word break.  [bellCommand]

     -bw|-w number
           external border width [externalBorder]

     -desktop number
           Desktop to place the window (for gnome compatible window manager). The number starts from 0, NOT 1!  [desktop]

     -dm|+dm
           Enable  /  disable  all  keyboard  macros.  This  functionality  can  be  toggled  at runtime via a pop-up menu, or the ToggleMacros keyboard shortcut. NOTE: When keyboard macros are disabled, the
           ToggleMacros keyboard macro will still work. Thus you can re-enable your keyboard macros via the keyboard using this function.  [disableMacros]

     -fs|+fs
           Startup fullscreen. Use in conjunction with [smoothResize] to really make it full screen. Requires an EWMH compatible window manager.  [fullscreen]

     -lk|+lk
           Enable Linux console style Home/End keys [linuxHomeEndKey]

     -mod mode
           Meta modifier: alt|meta|hyper|super|mod1|...|mod5.  [modifier]

     -lsp number

           X resource configuration file to save the current configuration [confFileSave]

     -path path
           Colon delimited list of directories to search for background images and menu files.  mrxvt first searches for the file in the current directory, then in the directories specified by path, then  in
           the  directories specified by the environment variable PATH_ENV and finally tries in the user configuration directory ~/.mrxvt and the (compiled in) system wide configuration directory /etc/mrxvt.
           [path]

     -sid string

   Long options
     The following options do not have a “short” form. If these options are to be used on the command line, they must be prefixed with a ‘--’ (or ‘++’ for boolean options). They can of course be used in  the
     mrxvt configuration file.

     answerBackString string
           Specify the reply mrxvt sends to the shell when an ENQ (control-E) character is passed through. It may contain escape values as described in the entry on keysym following.

     backspaceKey string
           The string to send when the backspace key is pressed. If set to DEC or unset it will send Delete (code 127) or, if shifted, Backspace (code 8) - which can be reversed with the appropriate DEC pri‐
           vate mode escape sequence.

     bgRefreshInterval delay
           Specify the delay (ms) to wait before refreshing the background in pseudo-transparency. Generally tinting and refreshing the background is slow (especially with XRender),  and  causes  lags  while
           dragging the window. This delay causes enables the window to be dragged smoothly. If you have a fast system, you can reduce or disable this (by setting it to 0). The default value is 100ms.

     boldFontN font
           Specifies bold font to use along with fontset N.

     boldColors True|False
           If false, the bold primary colors (0 -- 7) will be rendered using the brighter analogues (8--15) in a regular font. If true a bold font will be used. See also veryBright.

     colorN color
           Use the specified colour for the colour value N, where 0-7 corresponds to low-intensity (normal) colours and 8-15 corresponds to high-intensity colours.

     colorBD color
           Color to use to display bold text. If unspecified, the text will be displayed using a bold font / overstrike.

     colorRV color
           Color to use to display reverse video text. If unspecified, the text will be displayed as reverse video.

     colorUL color
           Color to use to display underlined text. If unspecified, the text will be displayed as underlined.

     cursorColor2 color
           Second color of cursor.

     cutChars string
           String  containing  all characters to be treated as one word for double click selection. If you want double clicks to select URL's, then set this to a string containing all letters (both upper and
           lower case), digits and punctuation you find in urls.

     deleteKey string
           The string to send when the delete key (not the keypad delete key) is pressed. If unset it will send the sequence traditionally associated with the Execute key.

     focusDelay msec
           The time interval (in mili-seconds) to wait after getting / losing focus, before fading the colors and changing the background color as specified by the -fade and -ufbg options. Set it to 0 if you
           want your colors faded immediately on focus change events.

           This option is there mainly to work around a bug in some window managers which send focus in immediately followed by focus out events when moving windows, or pressing Alt+Tab (e.g. fvwm-2.5.16).

     fontN font
           Specify the alternative font n. n can be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

     greektoggle_key keysym
           Key to toggle into greek keyboard mapping. See README.greek for details.

     highlightColor color
           Color to use for selection. If not specified, reverse video is used. (Note blinking text is also displayed with this color).

     mapAlert True|False
           If true, de-iconifies the window when a bell is received.

     mfontn font
           Specify alternative multiple character font n.

     pointerBlankDelay delay
           Delay (ms) to blank pointer after.

     printPipe cmd
           Specify a command pipe for vt100 printer.

     refreshLimit N
           This  option  and  skipPages  are to be used to replace the ‘jump scroll’ behaviour of other terminal emulators (and previous version of mrxvt).  Generally when data is available from a tab, mrxvt
           reads as much of it as is available (up to our buffer size), and process it. After we are done processing it (generally takes a fraction of a mili-second), we look for more data from the  tab.  If
           we  obtain  not more than N characters, then we request a screen refresh (which takes a while, especially if you use Xft with anti aliasing). If we obtain more than N characters from the tab, then
           we delay the screen refresh until the tab eventually has either N or fewer characters of output, or the tab has (cumulatively) produced at least skipPages of data.

           The default value is 0. On new fast machines, this is probably the best. If you find screen refreshes laggy on on slow older machines, then increase this value a little (say to 10). Setting it  to
           something enormous (say BUFSIZ) will cause mrxvt to request screen refreshes every time the active tab has data, and effectively disable the so called ‘jump scrolling’.

     scrollColor color
           Color of scrollbar (see also troughColor).

     selectStyle mode
           Set mouse selection style to old which is 2.20, oldword which is xterm style with 2.20 old word selection, or anything else which gives xterm style selection.

     skipPages N
           This  option  and  refreshLimit  are to be used to replace the ‘jump scroll’ behaviour of other terminal emulators (and previous version of mrxvt).  If the screen refresh is delayed because of the
           refreshLimit option, then mrxvt will refresh the screen every N pages of output. The default is 25. If you set it to a very large value (say INT_MAX), then mrxvt will refresh the screen only after
           the tab has stopped ‘flat out’ scrolling.

     smartResize True|False
           Enable  /  disable  smart resize. When the tabbar is shown, or font size is increased, the resize terminal window could be partially off screen. If smartResize is enabled, then mrxvt tries to move
           the terminal window to stay on screen.

     smoothResize True|False
           Enable / disable smooth resize. If enabled, then the mrxvt window is resized in pixel increments (instead of character increments). This is useful if you want  a  full  screen  /  maximized  mrxvt
           window that covers the entire screen (without leaving an annoying few pixel wide strip uncovered).

     troughColor
           Color of scrollbar trough (see also scrollColor).

     useFifo True|False
           If enabled, then mrxvt will create a fifo(7) /tmp/.mrxvt-%pid and listen for macros on it. To execute macros, just write them to this fifo. For example

               /bin/echo -e "NewTab\nRaise" >> /tmp/.mrxvt-%pid

           creates a new tab and raises the mrxvt window with process ID %pid.  NOTE: The meaning and syntax of this option might change in future versions.

     veryBright True|False
           If true, and if boldColors is false, then bold primary colors are rendered as bright colors with a bold font (this was the default behaviour in 0.5.2 and earlier versions).

CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
     A line in the config file generally looks like this

         ClassName.OptionName:   Value

     Blank lines, and lines beginning with ‘#’ are ignored (comments).

     The  ClassName is the name specified via the -name option (by default ‘mrxvt’).  When mrxvt starts up, it ONLY reads options with ClassName ‘Mrxvt’, ‘XTerm’, or the class specified via the -name option.
     See /etc/mrxvt/mrxvtrc.sample for how this feature can be used.

     The OptionName is the long name of the option you want to set. It can be any long option (listed under the Long Options sub section), or is specified in brackets as [option_name] alongside  regular  op‐
     tions in this man page. Finally Value is the value of this option.

   Example
     The following is an example ~/.mrxvtrc file, or in a configuration file you will load with -cf option at startup. You can consult the doc/mrxvtrc.sample in the directory for more details.

         Mrxvt.profile0.tabTitle:        term1
         Mrxvt.profile1.tabTitle:        term2
         Mrxvt.profile2.tabTitle:        term3
         Mrxvt.profile0.saveLines:       600
         Mrxvt.profile1.saveLines:       600
         Mrxvt.profile2.saveLines:       600
         # Mrxvt.profile0.Pixmap:        /home/images/vt0bg.xpm
         # Mrxvt.profile1.Pixmap:        /home/images/vt1bg.xpm
         # Mrxvt.profile2.Pixmap:        /home/images/vt2bg.xpm
         Mrxvt.scrollbarStyle:           next
         Mrxvt.initTermNumber:           3

         Mrxvt.transparentTabbar:        False
         Mrxvt.transparentMenubar:       False
         Mrxvt.tintColor:                #ffffff
         Mrxvt.shading:                  85
         Mrxvt.foreground:               white
         Mrxvt.background:               black

MENUS
     The menu system is similar to rxvt's menus (see the included file rxvtRef.txt) with a few enhancements, and a few notable exceptions:

     - The menus can use a proportionally spaced font under Xft ( -xftpfn) which is significantly less ugly than a mono-spaced font.

     -  mrxvt  supports  pop-up  menus.  If you create a menu named PopupButtonN (where N is 1, 2, or 3) then that menu is popped up when you control click (with the appropriate mouse button) on the terminal
       window. Additionally if you right click on the Tab bar, then the menu PopupButton1 is popped up.

     - To create a menu containing a list of all open tabs, create an empty menu called PopupButtonN (which will be popped on control click's as described above). To include a list of all open tabs as a  sub
       menu, create a sub-menu called ‘Switch to tab’.

     -  Menu  actions  are completely different in mrxvt than the original implementation in rxvt(1).  The menu actions are exactly the same as macro actions, and are described in the section Defining custom
       shortcuts.

     - On startup mrxvt reads the file default.menu which contains the default menu definitions. The file is searched for in your search path (specified by option -path).

KEYBOARD AND MOUSE SHORTCUTS
     You have several default keyboard shortcuts to ease the use of mrxvt. The default gnome-terminal, Konsole, rxvt shortcuts are predefined for you. You can also define your own shortcuts as  described  in
     Defining custom shortcuts.

   Default keyboard shortcuts
     The  following  key  combinations  are defined by default. These are defined in the system configuration file /etc/mrxvt/mrxvtrc, and can be disabled using the option -nsc.  See the next section for in‐
     structions on defining your own custom keyboard shortcuts.

     Gnome-terminal style shortcuts:
         Ctrl+Shift+t        create a new tab
         Ctrl+Shift+q        Close all tabs and exit
         Ctrl+Shift+w        Close active tab, and do not hold it open if it exits abnormally.
         Ctrl+PgUp           activate left tab

         Ctrl+Shift+F12      Enable / disable all keyboard macros (except this one of course).

   Defining custom shortcuts
     NOTE: The ‘hotkey’ mechanism used in versions 0.4.2 and earlier is now obsolete. It has been replaced by the ‘macro’ functionality (described below) as of version 0.5.0.

     You can define your own keyboard shortcuts in your configuration file by using the following syntax:

         Mrxvt.macro.[modifiers+]keyname:         action

     Here  ‘modifiers’  is  a ‘+’ separated list of modifiers ‘Ctrl’, ‘Alt’, ‘Meta’, ‘Shift’.  ‘Primary’.  and ‘Add’.  The first four refer to the respective modifier keys.  ‘Primary’ tells mrxvt to make the
     macro available ONLY when the primary screen is displayed (e.g.  ‘Primary’ macros will not be effective when you are running vim(1), but will be effective when you are  at  the  shell  prompt).  Finally
     ‘Add’ tells mrxvt to add the macro action to any previous action associated to that particular key. For instance

         Mrxvt.macro.Primary+Shift+Return:       Esc \ec
         Mrxvt.macro.Primary+Add+Shift+Return:   Str ^M

     will  define  the macro ‘Shift+Return’ to first send the escape sequence ‘\ec’ to mrxvt (which has the effect of clearing the scroll back buffer) and then send ‘Ctrl-M’ to the child process, but ONLY in
     the primary screen. If you're running a shell, then this effectively clears the scroll back buffer and executes the command.

     If the ‘Add’ modifier is not specified, then the macro action replaces any previous action (if any) associated to the specified key. It is an error to add a macro to a non-existing macro. Currently  one
     key can have at most 16 actions associated to it (this might be reduced to 8 in future).

     ‘keyname’  is  the  name  of the key you want to bind to the specified macro. Non alpha numeric keys (e.g. punctuation, or cursor/keypad keys) are specified by using their keyname, which you can find by
     xev(1), or looking directly in the system header file /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h.

     In case you want to unbind a default keyboard macro, just bind the appropriate key to the function ‘Dummy’.  For example

         Mrxvt.macro.Ctrl+Shift+t:       Dummy

     will disable the default keyboard shortcut ‘Ctrl+Shift+t’.  If you want to disable all keyboard macros, use the option ‘-dm’ (which can also be accessed via a pop-up menu). The default  keyboard  macros
     are defined in the system configuration file /etc/mrxvt/mrxvtrc so if you only want to disable all default shortcuts keys, don't read the system configuration file by using the -nsc option.

     Notice  that keyboard shortcuts definitions are incompatible with X Windows own resource parsing API, i.e., XGetDefaults. So, to enable the keyboard shortcuts, you will need to enable resources but dis‐
     able xgetdefault when you configure mrxvt.

     Finally ‘action’ is the action you want bound to the specified macro key. The available actions you can bind to macros are:

         Dummy
               Clear an existing keyboard shortcut

         Esc str
               Send the escape sequence str to mrxvt.

         Str str
               Send the string str to the child process.

         Exec command
               Executes command asynchronously. The command run without any controlling shell or TTY. This is generally used to launch X11 programs (e.g. open the selected text in firefox).  If  you  want  a
               command run in a new tab, see the NewTab macro).

               The  argument  command is word split exactly as described in the -blc option (thus for instance beginning it with ‘!’ will pass it to /bin/sh -c for word splitting and execution). However keep
               in mind that like all macro arguments, command is first ‘\’ interpolated. Thus if on the rare occasion you want ‘\ ’ to be part of command, then you will have to do  something  like  ‘\\\\\\ ’
               and not ‘\\\ ’ as you would with the argument of -blc.

         NewTab [-N] ["title"] [[!]command]
               Open  a new tab.  N specifies the profile number. If omitted, profile 0 is used. If only ‘-’ (with no number) is specified, then the profile of the current active tab is used (i.e. this can be
               used to duplicate the current tab).  title is specified (needs to be double quoted), use that for the tab title. If command is specified, execute that command in the new tab  (instead  of  the
               one specified by the resource file, or the shell).

               command  is  word  split as described in the Exec macro. However if command begins with an ‘!’  then run a shell first, and execute the command in the shell as if the user had typed command at
               the shell prompt. If instead you want command to be passed to /bin/sh -c for word splitting and execution, then begin command with ‘\!’.

         Close [N]
               Close a tab. If no argument is specified, close all tabs and exit. If N is 0, close the active tab. Otherwise close the Nth tab.

         GotoTab [N]
               Goto tab. If N is ommited or 0, then goto the previous active tab. Otherwise goto the Nth tab. If N begins with a ‘+’ or ‘-’ then N is relative to the current tab.

         MoveTab N
               Move active tab to position N.  If N begins with a ‘+’ or ‘-’ then N is relative to the current tab.

         Scroll amount
               Scroll the active tab by amount lines (negative values mean scroll backward). If amount ends with ‘p’ then scroll amount pages instead of lines.

         Copy  Copy selection into clipboard (not implemented).

         Paste
               Pasete selection into active tab.

         ToggleSubwin [[+|-][b|m|s|t]]
               Toggle visibility of sub-windows. If the argument begins with a ‘+’ the subwindow is shown. If it begins with a ‘-’ the subwindow is hidden. Otherwise it is toggled. The letters ‘b’, ‘m’,  ‘s’
               and ‘t’ represent the tabbar buttons, menubar, scrollbar and tabbar respectively. NOTE: Currently you can only toggle one subwindow at a time.

         ResizeFont [+|-]N
               Resize the font. With Xft, N represents the size increment of the xft font. Without Xft, N represents the index of the X11 fonts specified by the fontN resources.

         ToggleVeryBold
               Toggle use of bold font for colored text.

         ToggleTransparency
               Toggle pseudo transparency.

         ToggleBroadcast
               Toggle broadcasting of input to all tabs.

         ToggleHold [mask]
               If  mask  is  not  specified,  then just close all tabs who's child processes have exited. (This is almost compatible with the behaviour of mrxvt 0.5.1 and earlier). If mask is specified, then
               change the hold status of the current tab.  mask must begin with ‘+’, ‘-’, or ‘!’ and be followed by a bit mask (as in the holdExit option).  ‘+’ will add bits to the holdExit option for  this
               tab,  ‘-’  will subtract, and ‘!’ will toggle. Remember that if the lowest bit of the current tabs holdExit option is set, then the tab will always be held open and everything else will be ig‐
               nored.

         ToggleFullscreen
               Toggle between full screen and regular mode. Also enable --smoothResize to get true full screen. This will only work if you are running an EWMH compatible window manager (e.g. Fvwm / OpenBox /
               KDE / Gnome).

         Raise
               Raise the mrxvt window.

         SetTitle
               Set title of active tab to selection. (The selection must be owned by mrxvt)

         UseFifo status
               Enable or disable using a fifo(1) to listen for macros on (see the useFifo option). The argument status should be 0, 1, -1 to disable, enable or toggle respectively.

         PrintScreen [-psn] [command]
               Dump  screen  to  printer  (or command).  If -p is specified, then the output is pretty printed (i.e. escape sequences are used to get the same color in the output as on your screen). If -s is
               specified, then the entire scroll back is printed (instead of just the current screen). If -n is specified, then every screen line is terminated with a newline char (by  default  screen  lines
               that  wrap  to  the  next  line are not terminated with a newline). Finally, if command is specified it is used as the printer pipe (if not the value of printPipe or the compiled in default is
               used).

         SaveConfig [filename]
               Save config to file. If no filename is specified, save to ~/.mrxvtrc.save.

         ToggleMacros
               Toggle the use of keyboard shortcuts. When macros are disabled (either by using this macro, or by the -dm option), then this is the only keyboard shortcut that will work. Thus you  can  re-en‐
               able your keyboard shortcuts via the keyboard using this function.

     Additionally, the argument to any of the above macros are ‘\’ and ‘%’ interpolated as follows:

         \a        Bell
         \b        Backspace
         \E, \e    Escape
         \n        Newline
         \r        Carriage return
         \t        Tab
         \ddd      Char with octal ASCII code ddd.
         ^@, ^A .. ^Z .. ^_, ^?
                   Control-@, Control-A ...

         %G        Global (static) tab number.
         %p        PID of child process in current tab.
         %P        PID of mrxvt
         %n        Tab number.
         %N        Expands to ‘normally’ if the process exited normally (e.g. by calling exit(1)) or ‘abnormally’ otherwise. (Note this is independent of the exit status).
         %s        Text selected in the mrxvt window.
         %S        If the process in this tab is dead, then it expands to the exit status of the child process. Otherwise left unchanged.
         %t        Tab title.
         %T        Total number of tabs created in mrxvt lifetime.

   Mouse shortcuts
     Changing tab titles
           This mouse shortcut can be used to dynamically change the tab title as follows: Select text in the terminal window. Then middle click on a tab to change the tab's title. If you middle click on the
           tabbar background, then the title of the active tab is changed.

     Tab list menu
           By default, if you right click on the tab bar, or control-left-click on the terminal window, a popup menu with a list of currently open tabs pops up. The actual menu popped up can be customized as
           described under the section MENUS.

     Popup menus
           If you Control-click on the terminal window (with any mouse button), it pops up a menu. The actual menu popped up can be customized as described under the section MENUS.

     Moving tabs
           Click and drag a tab to some other location on the tab-bar to move it.

ESCAPE SEQUENCES
     You  have  several  escape sequences to control mrxvt.  All default rxvt(1) escape sequences are supported by mrxvt.  A few extra escape sequences have been added to improve DEC compatibility, and allow
     interaction with extra mrxvt features (e.g. tabs). The supported escape sequences are listed in the file mrxvt_seq.txt included in the distribution.

     For omissions in the documentation, and a more complete reference to escape sequences you should look at the file ctlseqs.txt that comes with the xterm package, console_codes(4) and  the  original  rxvt
     documentation in the file rxvtRef.txt.

     For basic interaction with mrxvt (e.g. changing the tab title etc.) you should also look at the programs share/scripts/settitle.c and share/scripts/mrxvtset.pl that are supplied with the mrxvt distribu‐
     tion.

ENVIRONMENT
     COLORFGBG
           Set to the terminal foreground and background colors.

     COLORTERM
           Sets to the terminal sub-name that indicates its color.

     DISPLAY
           Used (and set) to the X display bieng used.

     PATH_ENV
           Path to look for menu / background files (see -path option).

     TERM  Set to the terminal name in the window you have created.

     MRXVT_TABTITLE
           Set to the initial tab title of each terminal. Notice that its value will not be altered if the user uses a shortcut or escape sequence to change the tab title. The user must  modify  it  manually
           after doing that.

     WINDOWID
           Set to the X window id number of the mrxvt window.

FILES
     The actual pathnames given may differ on your system.
