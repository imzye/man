NAME
       safe_asterisk — A wrapper to run the asterisk executable in a loop

SYNOPSIS
       safe_asterisk [ asterisk_params ]

DESCRIPTION
       safe_asterisk is a script that runs asterisk in a loop, which can be useful if you fear asterisk may crash.

       The script does not run in the background like a standard service. Rather, it runs in its own linux virtual console (9, by default).  It also uses the option '-c' of asterisk(8) to avoid detaching as‐
       terisk from that terminal.

       safe_asterisk also runs asterisk with unlimited core file size, and thus asterisk will dump core in case of a crash.

       To get a "picture" of console 9, from another terminal (e.g: from a remote shell session) you can use:

         screendump 9

       The init script of the Debian package should be able to run safe_asterisk as the asterisk service, if so configured. See coments in /etc/default/asterisk

FILES
       /tmp
              safe_asterisk runs in that directory, rather than in / as usual.

       /tmp/core
              If core files were generated there, they may be

       /etc/asterisk/startup.d
              Files in this directory will be 'source'd by the safe_asterisk script before it starts Asterisk proper, allowing them to set additional environment variables or run any  other  steps  that  are
              needed for your system.

BUGS
       While showing the output on a console is useful, using screen(1) as the terminal may be better.

       The script does not read configuration from standard location under /etc

       It uses fixed locations under /tmp , and thus may be exposed to a symlink attacks.
