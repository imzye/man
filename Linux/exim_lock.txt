NAME
       exim_lock - Mailbox maintenance

SYNOPSIS
       exim_lock [options]mailbox-file

DESCRIPTION
       The exim_lock utility locks a mailbox file using the same algorithm as Exim.  For a discussion of locking issues, see section "appendfile transport", subsection "Operational details for appending" the
       Exim specification.  exim_lock can be used to prevent any modification of a mailbox by Exim or a user agent while investigating a problem.  The utility requires the name of the file as its first argu‐
       ment.   If  the  locking is successful, the second argument is run as a command (using C's “system()” function); if there is no second argument, the value of the SHELL environment variable is used; if
       this is unset or empty, /bin/sh is run.  When the command finishes, the mailbox is unlocked and the utility ends.  The following options are available:

       -fcntl Use “fcntl()” locking on the open mailbox.

       -flock Use “flock()” locking on the open mailbox, provided the operating system supports it.

       -interval
              This must be followed by a number, which is a number of seconds; it sets the interval to sleep between retries (default 3).

       -lockfile
              Create a lock file before opening the mailbox.

       -mbx   Lock the mailbox using MBX rules.

       -q     Suppress verification output.

       -retries
              This must be followed by a number; it sets the number of times to try to get the lock (default 10).

       -restore_time
              This option causes exim_lock to restore the modified and read times to the locked file before exiting. This allows you to access a locked mailbox (for example, to take a  backup  copy)  without
              disturbing the times that the user subsequently sees.

       -timeout
              This must be followed by a number, which is a number of seconds; it sets a timeout to be used with a blocking “fcntl()” lock.  If it is not set (the default), a non-blocking call is used.

       -v     Generate verbose output.

              If none of -fcntl, -flock, -lockfile or -mbx are given, the default is to create a lock file and also use “fcntl()” locking on the mailbox, which is the same as Exim's default.  The use of -fc‐
              ntl or -flock requires that the file be writable; the use of -lockfile requires that the directory containing the file be writable.  Locking by lock file does not last for  ever;  Exim  assumes
              that a lock file is expired if it is more than 30 minutes old.

              The  -mbx  can be used with either or both of -fcntl or -flock.  It assumes -fcntl by default. MBX locking causes a shared lock to be taken out on the open mailbox, and an exclusive lock on the
              file /tmp/.n.m where n and m are the device number and inode number of the mailbox file. When the locking is released, if an exclusive lock can be obtained for the mailbox, the file in /tmp  is
              deleted.

              The  default  output contains verification of the locking that takes place.  The -v option causes some additional information to be given.  The -q option suppresses all output except error mes‐
              sages.

       A command such as

         exim_lock /var/spool/mail/spqr

       runs an interactive shell while the file is locked, whereas

         exim_lock -q /var/spool/mail/spqr <<End
         <some commands>
         End

       runs a specific non-interactive sequence of commands while the file is locked, suppressing all verification output.  A single command can be run by a command such as

         exim_lock -q /var/spool/mail/spqr     "cp /var/spool/mail/spqr /some/where"

       Note that if a command is supplied, it must be entirely contained within the second argument - hence the quotes.

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
