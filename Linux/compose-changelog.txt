NAME
       compose-changelog - show changes between two composes

SYNOPSIS
       compose-changelog [OPTIONS...]  OLD_COMPOSE NEW_COMPOSE

DESCRIPTION
       compose-changelog  shows  changes  between  two composes. It parses the
       metadata and checks RPMs mentioned there. The results are saved in mul‐
       tiple files in current directory (unless specified otherwise).

       The  files  have  a name of changelog-NAME.SUFFIX, where NAME is by de‐
       fault the compose ID of the new compose. The SUFFIX marks what type  of
       file  this  is. The brief file contains summary of the differences. The
       verbose file contains all details in human readable form. The json file
       contains all details in JSON format.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       -p, --path=DIR
              Set directory in which to create the files.

       -n, --name=NAME
              Set custom identifier for the generated files.  --full Print all
              information about packages including names of all RPMs and their
              sizes.  Without  this option the output is shortened to only in‐
              cluded information about actual changes.

       --module-suffix[=SUFFIX]
              Use this argument for modular composes. The suffix  followed  by
              hex  hash will be stripped from package release values, to avoid
              having rebuilds with no change reported as upgrade or  downgrade
              just because of different module hash.

              The default value used in MBS is module_. Unless configured oth‐
              erwise, that is the one you want.

EXIT CODE
       This tool always exits with status code of 0.
