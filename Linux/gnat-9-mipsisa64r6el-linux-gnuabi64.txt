NAME
       gnat, gnatbind, gnatbl, gnatchop, gnatfind, gnathtml, gnatkr, gnatlink, gnatls, gnatmake, gnatprep, gnatpsta, gnatpsys, gnatxref - GNAT toolbox

DESCRIPTION
       Those programs are part of GNU GNAT, a freely available Ada 95 compiler.

       For  accessing  the full GNAT manuals, use info gnat-ug-4.8 and info gnat-rm-4.8 for the sections related to the reference manual.  If those sections cannot be found, you will have to install
       the gnat-4.4-doc package as well (since these manuals contain invariant parts, the package is located in the non-free part of the Debian archive).  You may also browse  http://gcc.gnu.org/on‐
       linedocs which provides the GCC online documentation.
