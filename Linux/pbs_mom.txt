NAME
       pbs_mom - start a pbs batch execution mini-server

SYNOPSIS
       pbs_mom [-a alarm] [-C chkdirectory] [-c config] [-D] [-d directory] [-F] [-h help] [-H hostname] [-L logfile] [-M MOMport] [-R RPPport] [-p|-q|-r] [-w] [-x]

       SH  DESCRIPTION  The pbs_mom command starts the operation of a batch Machine Oriented Mini-server, MOM, on the local host.  Typically, this command will be in a local boot file such as /etc/rc.local .
       To insure that the pbs_mom command is not runnable by the general user community, the server will only execute if its real and effective uid is zero.

       One function of pbs_mom is to place jobs into execution as directed by the server, establish resource usage limits, monitor the job's usage, and notify the server when the job completes.  If they  ex‐
       ist,  pbs_mom  will execute a prologue script before executing a job and an epilogue script after executing the job.  The next function of pbs_mom is to respond to resource monitor requests.  This was
       done by a separate process in previous versions of PBS but has now been combined into one process.  The resource monitor function is provided mainly for the PBS  scheduler.   It  provides  information
       about  the status of running jobs, memory available etc.  The next function of pbs_mom is to respond to task manager requests.  This involves communicating with running tasks over a tcp socket as well
       as communicating with other MOMs within a job (aka a "sisterhood").

       Pbs_mom will record a diagnostic message in a log file for any error occurrence.  The log files are maintained in the mom_logs directory below the home directory of the server.  If the log file cannot
       be opened, the diagnostic message is written to the system console.

OPTIONS
       -A alias        Used with -m (multi-mom option) to give the alias name of this instance of pbs_mom

       -a alarm        Specifies the alarm timeout in seconds for computing a resource.  Every time a resource request is processed, an alarm is set for the given amount of time.  If the request has not com‐
                       pleted before the given time, an alarm signal is generated.  The default is 5 seconds.

       -C chkdirectory Specifies the path of the directory used to hold checkpoint files.  [Currently this is only valid on Cray systems.]  The default directory is PBS_HOME/spool/checkpoint, see the -d  op‐
                       tion.  The directory specified with the -C option must be owned by root and accessible (rwx) only by root to protect the security of the checkpoint files.

       -c config       Specifies an alternative configuration file, see description below.  If this is a relative file name it will be relative to PBS_HOME/mom_priv, see the -d option.  If the specified file
                       cannot be opened, pbs_mom will abort.  If the -c option is not supplied, pbs_mom will attempt to open the default
                        configuration file "config" in PBS_HOME/mom_priv.  If this file is not present, pbs_mom will log the fact and continue.

       -h help         Displays the help/usage message.

       -H hostname     Sets the MOM's hostname.  This can be useful on multi-homed networks.

       -D              Debug mode. Do not fork.

       -d directory    Specifies the path of the directory which is the home of the servers working files, PBS_HOME.  This option is typically used along with -M when debugging MOM.  The default directory is
                       given by $PBS_SERVER_HOME which is typically /usr/spool/PBS.

       -F              Do not fork. Use when running under systemd.

       -L logfile      Specifies an absolute path name for use as the log file.  If not specified, MOM will open a file named for the current date in the PBS_HOME/mom_logs directory, see the -d option.

       -m              Directs  the  MOM  to  start  in multi-mom mode. In addition to using -m the -M, -R and -A options need to be used to properly start a MOM in multi-mom mode.  For example pbs_mom -m -M
                       30002 -R 30003 -A alias-host will start pbs_mom with the service port on port 30002, the manager port at 30003 and with the name alias-host.

       -M port         Specifies the port number on which the mini-server (MOM) will listen for batch requests.

       -R port         Specifies the port number on which the mini-server (MOM) will listen for resource monitor requests, task manager requests and inter-MOM messages.

       -p              (Default after version 2.4.0) (Preserve running jobs) -- Specifies the impact on jobs which were in execution when the   mini-server shut-down.  The -p option  tries  to  preserve  any
                       running jobs when the MOM restarts.  The new mini-server will not be the parent of any running jobs, MOM has lost control of her  offspring (not a new situation for a mother).  The MOM
                       will allow the jobs to continue to run and monitor them indirectly via polling. All recovered jobs will report an exit code of 0 when they are complete. The -p option is  mutually  ex‐
                       clusive with the -r, -P and -q options.

       -P              (Terminate  all jobs and remove them from the queue) -- Specifies the impact on jobs which were in execution when the mini-server shut-down.  With the -P option, it is assumed that ei‐
                       ther the entire system has been restarted or the MOM has been down so long that it can no longer guarantee that the pid of any running process is the same as the recorded  job  process
                       pid  of a recovering job. Unlike the -p option no attempt is made to try and preserve or recover running jobs. All jobs are terminated and removed from the queue.  The -q option is mu‐
                       tually exclusive with the -p, -q and -r options.

       -q              (Requeue all jobs - This is the default behavior in versions prior to 2.4.0) -- Specifies the impact on jobs which were in execution when the  mini-servershut-down.  Do  not  terminate
                       running  processes.  With the -q option, it is assumed that either the entire system has been restarted or the MOM has been down so long that it can no longer guarantee that the pid of
                       any running process is the same as the recorded job process pid of a recovering job. No attempt is made to kill job processes.  The MOM will mark the jobs as terminated and notify  the
                       batch server which owns the job. Re-runnable jobs will be requeued.  The -q option is mutually exclusive with the -p, -P and -r options.

       -r              (Terminate  running  processes  and requeue all jobs) -- Specifies the impact on jobs which were in execution when the mini-server shut-down. With the -r option, MOM will kill any pro‐
                       cesses belonging to running jobs, mark the jobs as terminated and notify the batch server that owns the job. Re-runnable jobs are reset to a queued state so they can be run again.  The
                       -r option is mutually exclusive with the -p, -P and -q options.

                       If the -r option is used following a reboot, process IDs (pids) may be reused and MOM may kill a process that is not a batch session.

       -S port         Specifies the port number on which the pbs_server is listening for requests.  If pbs_server is started with a -p option, pbs_mom will need to use the -S option and match the port value
                       which was used to start pbs_server.

       -w              When started with -w, pbs_moms wait until they get their MOM hierarchy file from pbs_server to send their first update, or until 10  minutes  pass.  This  reduces  network  traffic  on
                       startup and can bring up clusters faster.

       -x              Disables  the check for privileged port resource monitor connections.  This is used mainly for testing since the privileged port is the only mechanism used to prevent any ordinary user
                       from connecting.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file may be specified on the command line at program start with the -c flag.  The use of this file is to provide several types of run time information  to  pbs_mom:  static  resource
       names and values, external resources provided by a program to be run on request via a shell escape, and values to pass to internal set up functions at initialization (and re-initialization).

       Each item type is on a single line with the component parts separated by white space.  If the line starts with a hash mark (pound sign, #), the line is considered to be a comment and is skipped.

       Static Resources
              For  static  resource  names  and  values, the configuration file contains a list of resource names/values pairs, one pair per line and separated by white space.   An Example of static resource
              names and values could be the number of tape drives of different types and could be specified by

              tape3480      4
              tape3420      2
              tapedat       1
              tape8mm       1

       Shell Commands
              If the first character of the value is an exclamation mark (!), the entire rest of the line is saved to be executed through the services of the system(3) standard library routine.

              The shell escape provides a means for the resource monitor to yield arbitrary information to the scheduler.  Parameter substitution is done such that the value of any qualifier  sent  with  the
              query,  as  explained  below, replaces a token with a percent sign (%) followed by the name of the qualifier.  For example, here is a configuration file line which gives a resource name of "es‐
              cape":

              escape     !echo %xxx %yyy

              If a query for "escape" is sent with no qualifiers, the command executed would be "echo %xxx %yyy".  If one qualifier is sent, "escape[xxx=hi there]", the command executed  would  be  "echo  hi
              there  %yyy".   If  two qualifiers are sent, "escape[xxx=hi][yyy=there]", the command executed would be "echo hi there".  If a qualifier is sent with no matching token in the command line, "es‐
              cape[zzz=snafu]", an error is reported.

       size[fs=<FS>]
              Specifies that the available and configured disk space in the <FS> filesystem is to be reported to the pbs_server and scheduler.  NOTE: To request disk space on a per  job  basis,  specify  the
              file resource as in 'qsub -l nodes=1,file=1000kb'  For example, the available and configured disk space in the /localscratch filesystem will be reported:

              size[fs=/localscratch]

       Initialization Value
              An initialization value directive has a name which starts with a dollar sign ($) and must be known to MOM via an internal table.  The entries in this table now are:

              auto_ideal_load
                     if  jobs  are  running, sets idea_load based on a simple expression.  The expressions start with the variable 't' (total assigned CPUs) or 'c' (existing CPUs), an operator (+ - / *), and
                     followed by a float constant.

                     $auto_ideal_load t-0.2

              auto_max_load
                     if jobs are running, sets max_load based on a simple expression.  The expressions start with the variable 't' (total assigned CPUs) or 'c' (existing CPUs), an operator (+  -  /  *),  and
                     followed by a float constant.

              cputmult
                     which sets a factor used to adjust cpu time used by a job.  This is provided to allow adjustment of time charged and limits enforced where the job might run on systems with different cpu
                     performance.  If Mom's system is faster than the reference system, set cputmult to a decimal value greater than 1.0.   If Mom's system is slower, set cputmult to a value between 1.0  and
                     0.0.  For example:

                     $cputmult 1.5
                     $cputmult 0.75

              configversion
                     specifies the version of the config file data, a string.

              check_poll_time
                     specifies  the  MOM interval in seconds.  MOM checks each job for updated resource usages, exited processes, over-limit conditions, etc. once per interval.  This value should be equal or
                     lower to pbs_server's job_stat_rate.  High values result in stale information reported to pbs_server.  Low values result in increased system usage by MOM.  Default is 45 seconds.

              down_on_error
                     causes MOM to report itself as state "down" to pbs_server in the event of a failed health check.  This feature is EXPERIMENTAL and likely to be removed in the future.  See  HEALTH  CHECK
                     below.

              enablemomrestart
                     enable  automatic  restarts  of  MOM.  If enabled, MOM will check if its binary has been updated and restart itself at a safe point when no jobs are running; thus making upgrades easier.
                     The check is made by comparing the mtime of the pbs_mom executable.  Command-line args, the process name, and the PATH env variable are preserved across restarts.  It is recommended that
                     this not be enabled in the config file, but enabled when desired with momctl (see RESOURCES for more information.)

              ideal_load
                     ideal processor load.  Represents a low water mark for the load average.  Nodes that are currently busy will consider itself free after falling below ideal_load.

              igncput
                     Ignore cpu time violations on this mom, meaning jobs will not be cancelled due to exceeding their limits for cpu time.

              ignmem Ignore memory violations on this mom, meaning jobs will not be cancelled due to exceeding their memory limits.

              ignvmem
                     If set to true, then pbs_mom will ignore vmem/pvmem limit enforcement.

              ignwalltime
                     If set to true, then pbs_mom will ignore walltime limit enforcement.

              job_output_file_mask
                     Specifies a mask for creating job output and error files. Values can be specified in base 8, 10, or 16; leading 0 implies octal and leading 0x or 0X hexadecimal. A value of "userdefault"
                     will use the user's default umask.  $job_output_file_mask 027

              log_directory
                     Changes the log directory. Default is $TORQUEHOME/mom_logs/. $TORQUEHOME default is /var/spool/torque/ but can be changed in the ./configure script. The value is a string and  should  be
                     the full path to the desired mom log directory.  $log_directory /opt/torque/mom_logs/

              logevent
                     which sets the mask that determines which event types are logged by pbs_mom.  For example:

                     $logevent 0x1fff
                     $logevent 255

                     The  first example would set the log event mask to 0x1ff (511) which enables logging of all events including debug events.  The second example would set the mask to 0x0ff (255) which en‐
                     ables all events except debug events.

              log_file_suffix
                     Optional suffix to append to log file names. If %h is the suffix, pbs_mom appends the hostname for where the log files are stored if it knows it, otherwise it will  append  the  hostname
                     where the mom is running.  $log_file_suffix tom = 20100223.tom

              log_keep_days
                     Specifies how many days to keep log files. pbs_mom deletes log files older than the specified number of days. If not specified, pbs_mom won't delete log files based on their age.

              loglevel
                     specifies the verbosity of logging with higher numbers specifying more verbose logging.  Values may range between 0 and 7.

              log_file_max_size
                     If   this  is set to a value > 0 then pbs_mom will roll the current log file to log-file-name.1 when its size is  greater  than or  equal  to  the  value of log_file_max_size. This value
                     is interpreted as kilobytes.

              log_file_roll_depth
                     If this is set to a value >=1 and  log_file_max_size  is  set then  pbs_mom  will continue rolling the log files to log-file-name.log_file_roll_depth.

              max_load
                     maximum processor load.  Nodes over this load average are considered busy (see ideal_load above).

              memory_pressure_threshold
                     The option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use cpusets.  If set to a value > 0, a job gets killed if its memory pressure exceeds this value, and if  $memory_pressure_duration
                     is set.  The default is 0 (memory pressure recording is off).
                     See cpuset(7) for more information about memory pressure.

              memory_pressure_duration
                     The  option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use cpusets.  Specifies the number of subsequent MOM intervals a job's memory pressure must be above $memory_pressure_threshold to
                     get killed.  The default is 0 (jobs are never killed due to memory pressure).  set
                     See cpuset(7) for more information about memory pressure.

              node_check_script
                     specifies the fully qualified pathname of the health check script to run (see HEALTH CHECK for more information).

              node_check_interval
                     specifies when to run the MOM health check.  The check can be either periodic, event-driver, or both.  The value starts with an integer specifying the number  of  MOM  intervals  between
                     subsequent  executions of the specified health check.  After the integer is an optional comma-separated list of event names.  Currently supported are "jobstart" and "jobend".  This value
                     defaults to 1 with no events indicating the check is run every MOM interval. (see HEALTH CHECK for more information)

                     $node_check_interval 0  #Disabled.
                     $node_check_interval 0,jobstart  #Only runs at job starts
                     $node_check_interval 10,jobstart,jobend

              nodefile_suffix
                     Specifies the suffix to append to a host names to denote the data channel network adapter in a multihomed compute node.  $nodefile_suffix i With the suffix of 'i' and the control channel
                     adapter with the name node01, the data channel would have a hostname of node01i.

              nospool_dir_list
                     If the job's output file should be in one of the paths specified here, then it will be spooled directly in that directory instead of the normal spool directory.
                     Specified in the format path1, path2, etc.  $nospool_dir_list/home/mike/*,/var/tmp/spool/

              pbsclient
                     which  causes  a  host  name to be added to the list of hosts which will be allowed to connect to MOM as long as they are using a privilaged port for the purposes of resource monitor re‐
                     quests.  For example, here are two configuration file lines which will allow the hosts "fred" and "wilma" to connect:

                     $pbsclient      fred
                     $pbsclient      wilma

                     Two host name are always allowed to connection to pbs_mom, "localhost" and the name returned to pbs_mom by the system call gethostname().  These names need not be specified in  the  con‐
                     figuration file.  The hosts listed as "clients" can issue Resource Monitor (RM) requests.  Other MOM nodes and servers do not need to be listed as clients.

              pbsserver
                     which defines hostnames running pbs_server that will be allowed to submit jobs, issue Resource Monitor (RM) requests, and get status updates.  MOM will continually attempt to contact all
                     server hosts for node status and state updates.  Like $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name, the hostname may be followed by a colon and a port number.  This parameter replaces  the  oft-confused
                     $clienthost parameter from TORQUE 2.0.0p0 and earlier.  Note that the hostname in $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name is used if no $pbsserver parameters are found

              prologalarm
                     Specifies maximum duration (in seconds) which the MOM will wait for the job prolog or job job epilog to complete.  This parameter default to 300 seconds (5 minutes)

              rcpcmd Specify  the  the  full path and argument to be used for remote file copies.  This overrides the compile-time default found in configure.  This must contain 2 words: the full path to the
                     command and the switches.  The copy command must be able to recursively copy files to the remote host and accept arguments of the form "user@host:files"  For example:

                     $rcpcmd /usr/bin/rcp -rp
                     $rcpcmd /usr/bin/scp -rpB

              restricted
                     which causes a host name to be added to the list of hosts which will be allowed to connect to MOM without needing to use a privilaged port.  These names allow for wildcard matching.  For
                     example, here is a configuration file line which will allow queries from any host from the domain "ibm.com".

                     $restricted      *.ibm.com

                     The  restriction which applies to these connections is that only internal queries may be made.  No resources from a config file will be found.  This is to prevent any shell commands from
                     being run by a non-root process.
                     This parameter is generally not required except for some versions of OSX.

              remote_checkpoint_dirs
                     Specifies what server checkpoint directories are remotely mounted.  This directive is used to tell the MOM which directories are shared with the server.  Using remote checkpoint directo‐
                     ries eliminates the need to copy the checkpoint files back and forth between the MOM and the server. This parameter is available in 2.4.1 and later.

                     $remote_checkpoint_dirs /var/spool/torque/checkpoint

              remote_reconfig
                     Enables the ability to remotely reconfigure pbs_mom with a new config file.  Default is disabled.  This parameter accepts various forms of true, yes, and 1.

              source_login_batch
                     Specifies whether or not mom will source the /etc/profile, etc. type files for batch jobs. Parameter accepts various forms of true, false, yes, no, 1 and 0. Default is True.

              source_login_interactive
                     Specifies whether or not mom will source the /etc/profile, etc. type files for interactive jobs. Parameter accepts various forms of true, false, yes, no, 1 and 0. Default is True.

              spool_as_final_name
                     If set to true, jobs will spool directly as their output files, with no intermediate locations or steps. This is mostly useful for shared filesystems with fast writing capability.

              status_update_time
                     Specifies  (in  seconds) how often MOM updates its status information to pbs_server.  This value should correlate with the server's scheduling interval.  High values increase the load of
                     pbs_server and the network.  Low values cause pbs_server to report stale information.  Default is 45 seconds.

              tmpdir Sets the directory basename for a per-job temporary directory.  Before job launch, MOM will append the jobid to the tmpdir basename and create the directory.  After  the  job  exit,  MOM
                     will recursively delete it.  The env variable TMPDIR will be set for all pro/epilog scripts, the job script, and TM tasks.
                     Directory  creation  and removal is done as the job owner and group, so the owner must have write permission to create the directory.  If the directory already exists and is owned by the
                     job owner, it will not be deleted after the job.  If the directory already exists and is NOT owned by the job owner, the job start will be rejected.

              timeout
                     Specifies the number of seconds before TCP messages will time out.  TCP messages include job obituaries, and TM requests if RPP is disabled.  Default is 60 seconds.

              usecp  specifies which directories should be staged with cp instead of rcp/scp.  If a shared filesystem is available on all hosts in a cluster, this directive is used to make these  filesystems
                     known to MOM.  For example, if /home is NFS mounted on all nodes in a cluster:

                     $usecp *:/home  /home

              varattr
                     This  is  similar  to a shell escape above, but includes a TTL.  The command will only be run every TTL seconds.  A TTL of -1 will cause the command to be executed only once.  A TTL of 0
                     will cause the command to be run everytime varattr is requested.  This parameter may be used multiple times, but all output will be grouped into a single "varattr" attribute in  the  re‐
                     quest and status output.  The command should output data in the form of varattrname=va1ue1[+value2]...

                     $varattr 3600 /path/to/script [<ARGS>]...

              use_smt
                     This  option is only available, if pbs_mom is enabled to use cpusets.  It has only effect, if there are more that one logical processor per physical core in the system (simultaneous mul‐
                     tithreading or hyperthreading is enabled via BIOS settings).  If set to true, all logical processors of allocated cores are added to the cpuset of a job. If set to false, only the  first
                     logical processor per allocated core is contained in the cpuset of a job.  The default is true.

              wallmult
                     which  sets  a factor used to adjust wall time usage by to job to a common reference system.  The factor is used for walltime calculations and limits the same as cputmult is used for cpu
                     time.

       The configuration file must be executable and "secure".  It must be owned by a user id and group id less than 10 and not be world writable.  Output from this file must  be  in  the  format  $VAR=$VAL,
       i.e.,

              dataset13=20070104
              dataset22=20070202
              viraltest=abdd3

       xauthpath
              Specifies the path to the xauth binary to enable X11 fowarding.

       mom_host
              Sets the local hostname as used by pbs_mom.

LAYOUT FILE
       There is also an optional layout file for creating multiple moms on one box in a specified layout. In the file, each mom on the single box is given its own hostname, cpu indexes, memory nodes (a linux
       construct), and memory size. This is useful for NUMA systems. Each line in the file specifies one mom. The file follows the following format:

       <hostname> cpus=<X> mem=<Y> memsize=<Z>
              cpus and mem can be comma separated lists, while memsize should be a memory size in the format:

       <number><units>
              For example, a file could contain the following line:

       foohost-1 cpus=1,2 mem=1,2,3,4 memsize=8GB
              This would specify that foohost-1 has cpus 1 and 2, memory nodes 1-4, and a total of 8 GB of memory.

RESOURCES
       Resource Monitor queries can be made with momctl's -q option to retrieve and set pbs_mom options.  Any configured static resource may be retrieved with a request of the same name.  These are  resource
       requests not otherwise documented in the PBS ERS.

       cycle  forces an immediate MOM cycle

       status_update_time
              retrieve or set the $status_update_time parameter

       check_poll_time
              retrieve or set the $check_poll_time parameter

       configversion
              retrieve the config version

       jobstartblocktime
              retrieve or set the $jobstartblocktime parameter

       enablemomrestart
              retrieve or set the $enablemomrestart parameter

       loglevel
              retrieve or set the $loglevel parameter

       down_on_error
              retrieve or set the EXPERIMENTAL $down_on_error parameter

       diag0 - diag4
              retrieves various diagnostic information

       rcpcmd retrieve or set the $rcpcmd parameter

       version
              retrieves the pbs_mom version

HEALTH CHECK
       The  health check script is executed directly by the pbs_mom daemon under the root user id. It must be accessible from the compute node and may be a script or compiled executable program.  It may make
       any needed system calls and execute any combination of system utilities but should not execute resource manager client commands.  Also, as of TORQUE 1.0.1, the pbs_mom daemon blocks until  the  health
       check  is  completed and does not possess a built-in timeout.  Consequently, it is advisable to keep the launch script execution time short and verify that the script will not block even under failure
       conditions.

       If the script detects a failure, it should return the keyword 'ERROR' to stdout followed by an error message.  The message (up to 256 characters) immediately following the ERROR  string  will  be  as‐
       signed to the node attribute 'message' of the associated node.

       If  the script detects a failure when run from "jobstart", then the job will be rejected.  This should probably only be used with advanced schedulers like Moab so that the job can be routed to another
       node.

       TORQUE currently ignores ERROR messages by default, but advanced schedulers like moab can be configured to react appropriately.

       If the experimental $down_on_error MOM setting is enabled, MOM will set itself to state down and report to pbs_server; and pbs_server will report the node as "down".   Additionally,  the  experimental
       "down_on_error"  server  attribute  can be enabled which has the same effect but moves the decision to pbs_server.  It is redundant to have MOM's $down_on_error and pbs_server's down_on_error features
       enabled.  See "down_on_error" in pbs_server_attributes(7B).

FILES
       $PBS_SERVER_HOME/server_name
              contains the hostname running pbs_server.

       $PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv
                 the default directory for configuration files, typically (/usr/spool/pbs)/mom_priv.

       $PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_logs
                 directory for log files recorded by the server.

       $PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv/prologue
                 the administrative script to be run before job execution.

       $PBS_SERVER_HOME/mom_priv/epilogue
                 the administrative script to be run after job execution.

SIGNAL HANDLING
       pbs_mom handles the following signals:

       SIGHUP causes pbs_mom to re-read its configuration file, close and reopen the log file, and reinitialize resource structures.

       SIGALRM
              results in a log file entry. The signal is used to limit the time taken by certain children processes, such as the prologue and epilogue.

       SIGINT and SIGTERM
              results in pbs_mom exiting without terminating any running jobs.  This is the action for the following signals as well: SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ, SIGCPULIM, and SIGSHUTDN.

       SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2
              causes MOM to increase and decrease logging levels, respectively.

       SIGPIPE, SIGINFO
               are ignored.

       SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGTRAP, and SIGSYS
              cause a core dump if the PBSCOREDUMP environmental variable is defined.

       All other signals have their default behavior installed.

EXIT STATUS
       If the mini-server command fails to begin operation, the server exits with a value greater than zero.
