NAME
       arbitron - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Report readership statistics for mailboxes on the server.

SYNOPSIS
       arbitron [ -C config-file ] [ -o ] [ -u ] [ -l ] [ -p months ]
                [ -d days | -D mmddyyyy[:mmddyyyy] ] mailbox...

DESCRIPTION
       arbitron  collects  and  reports readership statistics for mailboxes on
       the server. It also optionally prunes the mailboxes of \Seen state  for
       dormant users.

       arbitron produces one line of output per mailbox, reporting the mailbox
       name followed by a space, followed by the number of readers (and if  -u
       is  specified,  followed  by  a colon and a comma-separated list of the
       reader's user IDs), and if -o is not specified, another space  and  the
       number  of subscribers (and if -u is specified, followed by a colon and
       a comma-separated list of the subscribers userids).

       IMPORTANT:
          This format is subject to change in future versions.

       Each "reader" is  a  distinct  authorization  identity  which  has  the
       imap-admin-access-control-right-s  right  to  the mailbox and which has
       SELECTed the mailbox within either the past -d days or the specified -D
       date[:range].

       Users  are  not  counted as reading their own personal mail‐boxes. Per‐
       sonal mailboxes are not reported unless there is at  least  one  reader
       other than the mailboxes owner.

       arbitron  reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file
       unless specified otherwise by -C.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -o     Report "the old way" -- not including subscribers.

       -l     Enable long reporting (comma delimited table consisting of mbox,
              userid, r/s, start time, end time).

       -d days
              Count as a reader an authorization identity which has  used  the
              mailbox within the past days days.

       -D mmddyyyy[:mmddyyyy]
              Count  as  a reader an authorization identity which has used the
              mailbox within the given date range.

              The start date and optionally the  end  date  are  specified  as
              2-digit month of the year, 2-digit day of the month, and 4-digit
              year.

              If the end date is not specified, the current system  time  will
              be used as the end time.

              NOTE:
                 Please note that the date notation is American [mmddyyyy] not
                 [ddmmyyyy].

       -p months
              Prune \Seen state for users who have not used the mailbox within
              the past months months. The default is infinity.
