FILESYSTEM LAYOUT FOR CERTIFICATES
       $SSL_DIR/CA/crt.pem                   # CA certificate that signed
                                               all certificates.
       $SSL_DIR/CA/private/key.pem           # CA private key
                                               (on server only)
       $SSL_DIR/me/crt.pem                   # public certificate of the host
       $SSL_DIR/me/private/key.pem           # private key of the host
       $SSL_DIR/me/fingerprint               # fingerprint of my certificate
       $SSL_DIR/remote/HOSTNAME/fingerprint  # fingerprint of the HOSTNAME
                                               certificate
