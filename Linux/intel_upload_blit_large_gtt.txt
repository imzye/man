NAME
       intel_upload_blit_large_gtt - microbenchmark of Intel GPU performance

SYNOPSIS
       intel_upload_blit_large_gtt

DESCRIPTION
       intel_upload_blit_large_gtt  is  a  microbenchmark tool for DRM perfor‐
       mance.  It should be run  with  kernel  modesetting  enabled,  and  may
       require root privilege for correct operation.  It does not require X to
       be running.

       Given that it is a microbenchmark, its utility is largely  for  regres‐
       sion testing of the kernel, and not for general conclusions on graphics
       performance.
