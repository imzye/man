       scl load|unload <collection1> [<collection2> ...]

       scl list-collections

       scl list-enabled

       scl list-packages <collection>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents scl, a program which is an utility for running software packaged as a Software Collection.

       scl  utility  allows to execute an application which is not located in the filesystem root hierarchy but is present in an alternative location. This application can still use and benefit from software
       installed in the root filesystem. In order to let an application be visible to the system one has to use scl utility as an interface.

OPTIONS
       enable, run <collection1> [<collection2> ...] <command> [-x|--exec]
              Run <command> within the environment of the given collections. Each collection contains a module file that defines how collection modifies the environment. First  the  environment  is  modified
              according  to  module  files  of the given collections and then <command> is executed. Control is returned back to the caller with the original environment as soon as the <command> finishes. If
              <command> is '-' (dash) then it is read from the standard input.

              If --exec is specified then function exec() will be used for command execution otherwise function system() will be used.

              Note: if you use <command> consisting of multiple arguments, you either need to use quotes or the -- command separator. Everything that follows the separator will be considered a command or its
              argument.

              Note:  some  commands modify user environment in some way. Those commands may potentially break SCLs, as their activation also usually depends on env.  modification as well. Typical examples of
              such commands are su and sudo. Every collection modifies the environment differently, thus more details may be found in the documentation of the particular collection.

       load <collection1> [<collection2> ...]
              Load the given collections into current shell. The environment of current shell is modified according to module files of the collections. This command properly works in these shells: bash, zsh,
              tcsh. You need to source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh and /etc/profile.d/scl-init.sh for this command to work in shells: dash, mksh, ksh. This command is not supported in other shells.

       unload <collection1> [<collection2> ...]
              Unload  the  given  collections  from  current shell. The environment of current shell is returned back to the state before loading the collections. This command properly works in these shells:
              bash, zsh, tcsh. You need to source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh and /etc/profile.d/scl-init.sh for this command to work in shells: dash, mksh, ksh. This command is not supported in other shells.

       list-collections
              Lists all installed Software Collections on the system.

       list-enabled
              Lists Software Collections enabled in current shell.

       list-packages <collection1> <collection2> ...
              If a collection name is specified then list of installed packages belonging to the collection is listed.

       register <path>
              If <path> leads to valid SCL file structure, scl will register that as a SCL.  <path> directory needs to contain module file and root directory, to be considered valid SCL.  <path> needs to  be
              an absolute path to the collection location.

       deregister <collection> [-f|--force]
              <collection> will no longer be considered SCL.  If the <collection> was installed locally, then the use of --force is needed.i

       man <collection>
              Show manual page for <collection>.

       -v, --version
              Show version.

EXAMPLES
       scl enable example 'less --version'
              runs command 'less --version' in the environment with collection 'example' enabled

       scl load foo bar
              Load foo and bar Software Collections into current shell

       scl unload foo bar
              Unload foo and bar Software Collections from current shell

       cat my_command | scl enable baz -
              run set of commands listed in my_command file in the environment with baz Software Collection enabled

       scl list-collections
              list all installed collections

       scl list-packages example
              list all packages within example collection

       scl register /foo/bar
              registers new collection with a name bar

       scl deregister bar --force
              forces the deregistration of collection bar

       A wrapper script must use proper quoting or command separator like in the
              following examples

              #!/bin/bash
              COMMAND="ruby $(printf "%q " "$@")"
              scl enable ruby193 "$COMMAND"
              # or
              scl enable ruby193 -- $COMMAND
