NAME
       slim - Simple LogIn Manager

SYNOPSIS
       slim [options] [<arguments>]

DESCRIPTION
       SLiM  is a lightweight login manager for X11, allowing the initialization of a graphical session by entering username and password in a login screen.  It is desktop-agnostic and should work (suit‐
       ably configured) with any session style.

OPTIONS
       -c /path/to/config
              select a non-standard configuration file instead of /etc/slim.conf

       -d     run as a daemon

       -n     do NOT run as a daemon

       -s     be systemd compatible by disabling consolekit support. This option does nothing if consolekit support has not been built in.

       -p /path/to/theme
              display a preview of the theme. An already running X11 session is required for theme preview.

       -w <www>x<hhh>
              set the size of the window used for theme preview. This option is only valid after a -p option

       -h     display a brief help message

       -v     display version information

EXAMPLES
       slim -d
              run slim in daemon mode

       slim -p /usr/share/slim/themes/default -w 800x600
              preview of the default theme at low resolution

STARTING SLIM AT BOOT
       Please refer to the documentation of your Operating System to make slim automatically startup after the system boots. In particular, the method is very different between SysV,  OpenRC,  runit  and
       systemd init processes.

CONFIGURATION
       Global configuration is stored in the /etc/slim.conf file. See the comments inside the file for a detailed explanation of the options.

USAGE AND SPECIAL USERNAMES
       When started, slim will show a login panel; enter the username and password of the user you want to login as.

       Special usernames:

       console
              open an xterm login console. No password needed

       exit   quit slim. No password needed. See the note in BUGS.

       halt   shutdown the machine

       reboot reboot the machine

       suspend
              power-suspend the machine

       See the configuration file for customizing the above commands.  The 'halt' and 'reboot' commands need the root password, and hence may not work on systems where root login is disabled.

       Shortcuts:

       F11    executes a custom command (by default takes a screenshot)

       F1     choose session type from session list.

BUGS
       When run as a daemon from OpenRC (and possibly other init systems), causing SLiM to quit can sometimes result in a blank screen and unresponsive computer.  This includes when using the "exit" spe‐
       cial username.

       SLiM does not handle expired passwords and treats them as expired accounts.

       Probably still a few more but I'm working on them.
