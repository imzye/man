NAME
       ptrash - move file(s) to ~/.trash directory

SYNOPSIS
       ptrash [OPTIONS] file-name-1 [file-name-2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       ptrash  is a console based simple application. ptrash moves the named file(s) to trash directory located under the home directory of a user.  In case if ~/.trash is non-existent, ptrash creates it for
       you and then moves the file(s) to this directory. By default, ptrash runs in non-interactive mode, which means it does not ask user if she is sure to move the file to ~/.trash even when the named file
       already exists in trash and proceeds with overwriting that file.

       -d --delete
              Delete file(s) from trash

       -i     Enables an interactive moving of files to/from trash. ie. It asks for confirmation before over writing OR deleting any existing file.

       -r --restore
              Restore a file from trash to it's original location

       -h --help
              Prints this short usage help

              Verbose operation mode
