NAME
       tagtest - HylaFAX tag line testing program

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/tagtest [ options ] input.tif

DESCRIPTION
       tagtest  is a program for testing the ``tag line'' support in the HylaFAX server.  tagtest takes a TIFF/F (TIFF Class F) file and generates a new TIFF/F file that is a copy of the input file, but with
       sample tag lines imaged across the top of each page.  Options are provided for specifying a tag line format string and a tag line font file.  If neither are specified, then tagtest  will  use  builtin
       defaults.  tagtest is designed for testing tag line format strings and fonts before they are configured for use by the facsimile server.

OPTIONS
       -f file   Image the tag line format string using the Portable Compiled Font (PCF) in file.  By default tagtest looks for the font file fixed.pcf.

       -m format Use format when imaging tag lines.  If this option is not specified, then tagtest uses the format string ``From %%n|%c|Page %%p of %%t''.

       -o file   Write output to file.  By default output is written to the file t.tif.
