NAME
       btplay - Directly play video torrents using btfs.

SYNOPSIS
       btplay [OPTIONS]... torrentlink

DESCRIPTION
       btfs uses fuse (filesystem in user space) to expose a bittorrent source as a normal directory on your filesystem.

       btplay is a wrapper for btfs that mounts and plays the video directly without a user having to specify a mount point. You can pass either a .torrent link or a magnet link contained in single quotation
       marks.
