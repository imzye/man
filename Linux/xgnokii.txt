NAME
       xgnokii - graphical interface of the gnokii telephone toolkit

SYNOPSIS
       xgnokii

DESCRIPTION
       xgnokii is a fancy graphical interface for libgnokii.  It uses the settings in the [global] section of the configuration file of gnokii(1).

       You can assume that your phone is supported, however there are rare cases that you will get very limited functionality with xgnokii.

       xgnokii can save contacts in vCard format (thanks to Pavel Machek <pavel at ucw dot cz>) if you add .vcard or .gcrd extension (case sensitive) to the file name in the export contacts dialog.

       gnokii is a multiple systems tool suite and (eventually) modem/fax driver for the mobile phones.

       gnokii at the beginning was designed to support Nokia phones. At the moment it supports most of the Nokia mobiles and also supports other phones that understand AT commands.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Various error messages are printed to STDERR when xdebug = on is set in gnokii config file

BUGS
       This man page is too short. See more details in gnokii man page.
