NAME
       Apache::AuthCookie::Params::Base - Internal CGI AuthCookie Params Base Class

VERSION
       version 3.32

SYNOPSIS
        Internal Use Only!

DESCRIPTION
       This is the base class for AuthCookie Params drivers.

METHODS
   new($r)
       Constructor.  This will generate either an internal Apache::AuthCookie::Params::CGI object, or, if available, use libapreq2.  Note that libapreq2 will not be used if you turned on "Encoding"
