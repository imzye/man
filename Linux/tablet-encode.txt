DESCRIPTION
       There are a number of different ways of using tablet-encode, but the simplest is to give one existing movie (or URL) and the filename of the target:

           tablet-encode input.avi output.avi
           tablet-encode http://www.example.com/somefilm.mov output.avi
           tablet-encode dvd://1 output.avi

       The  last  of  these has shown MPlayer's support for DVDs. tablet-encode will also auto-detect directories containing VIDEO_TS folders as DVDs, and if the title on the DVD is unspecified, the
       longest will be used:

           tablet-encode dvd: output.avi
           tablet-encode /media/dvd/ output.avi

       For TV series' DVDs, the '--episodes' option can be used. This will rip all episodes on the DVD within 10% of the middle-longest track (i.e. the median):

           tablet-encode --episodes dvd: /media/nokia-external/Video/

       A number of presets are available. If none is specified, it defaults to "average". A full list of the presets can be seen by passing `list' to the --preset option:

           tablet-encode --preset list

       If the target of the encoding is a directory, multiple input files can be specified:

           tablet-encode file1.avi file2.mov file3.wmv  output/

       There are many more options, a full listing is provided in the online help:

           tablet-encode --help

       Running tablet-encode with no parameters will start a GUI version, if possible. A GUI progress bar can be shown when specifying arguments with the `--gui' option. This requires the  Gtk2-Perl
       bindings to be installed.

CONFIGURING
       The  file  `.tablet-encode.conf' will be read from your home directory at start up. In this file you can define your own presets, change the default preset used if none is specified and a few
       other things.

       To define your own preset, say "dvd", create ~/.tablet-encode.conf in your favourite editor and add the content:

           $PRESET{dvd} = { abitrate => 256, vbitrate => 800, width => 400 };

       This will define a preset called 'dvd' with an audio bitrate of 256kbps, a video bitrate of 800kbps and a maximum width of 400 pixels. The height is  auto-calculated  based  on  the  tablet's
       screen and the size of the input video.

       To use the 'dvd' preset instead of 'average' when no preset is specified, add the following line to ~/.tablet-encode.conf:

           $defaultPreset = 'dvd';

       Note that this is a mini-Perl script, so blank lines and lines starting `#' will be ignored. All statements MUST end in a semi-colon, `;'.

       For Nokia 770 users, you may wish to always use 770-compatibility mode. To achieve this, in ~/.tablet-encode.conf put:

           $options{770} = 1;
