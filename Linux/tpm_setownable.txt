NAME
       tpm_setownable - change whether the TPM allows tpm_takeownership operations

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_setownable [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm_setownable reports the status of the TPM's flags regarding if the TPM can be owned.  This is the default behavior and also accessible via the --status option. Requesting a report of this status
       prompts for the owner password.  The --allow option sets the system's TPM to allow tpm_takeownership operations (via the TPM_SetOwnerInstall API).  This operation requires physical presence.  The
       --prevent option (via the TPM_SetOwnerInstall API) prevents the TPM from accepting tpm_takeownership operations.  This operation requires physical presence.  These operations are persistent.
       tpm_takeownership requires the tpm be enabled.
