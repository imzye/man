Template::Plugin::Digest::MD5(3pm)                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                  Template::Plugin::Digest::MD5(3pm)

NAME
       Template::Plugin::Digest::MD5 - TT2 interface to the MD5 Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
         [% USE Digest.MD5 -%]
         [% checksum = content FILTER md5 -%]
         [% checksum = content FILTER md5_hex -%]
         [% checksum = content FILTER md5_base64 -%]
         [% checksum = content.md5 -%]
         [% checksum = content.md5_hex -%]
         [% checksum = content.md5_base64 -%]

DESCRIPTION
       The Digest.MD5 Template Toolkit plugin provides access to the MD5 algorithm via the "Digest::MD5" module.  It is used like a plugin but installs filters and vmethods into the current context.

       When you invoke

           [% USE Digest.MD5 %]

       the following filters (and vmethods of the same name) are installed into the current context:

       "md5"
           Calculate the MD5 digest of the input, and return it in binary form.  The returned string will be 16 bytes long.

       "md5_hex"
           Same as "md5", but will return the digest in hexadecimal form. The length of the returned string will be 32 and it will only contain characters from this set: '0'..'9' and 'a'..'f'.

       "md5_base64"
           Same  as  "md5",  but  will  return  the digest as a base64 encoded string.  The length of the returned string will be 22 and it will only contain characters from this set: 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z',
           '0'..'9', '+' and '/'.

           Note that the base64 encoded string returned is not padded to be a multiple of 4 bytes long.  If you want interoperability with other base64 encoded md5 digests you might want  to  append  the
           redundant string "==" to the result.

       As the filters are also available as vmethods the following are all equivalent:

           FILTER md5_hex; content; END;
           content FILTER md5_hex;
           content.md5_base64;

WARNING
       The  Digest::MD5  man  page  notes that the MD5 algorithm is not as strong as it used to be.  It has since 2005 been easy to generate different messages that produce the same MD5 digest.  It still
       seems hard to generate messages that produce a given digest, but it is probably wise to move to stronger algorithms for applications that depend on the digest to uniquely identify a message.

       One of his wishes was for his OpenSource work to continue. At his funeral, many of his colleagues and friends, spoke of how he felt like a person of the world, and  how  he  embrace  the  idea  of
       OpenSource being for the benefit of the world.
