NAME
       ck-list-sessions - Show ConsoleKit Session Information

SYNOPSIS
       ck-list-sessions [--all] [--format=format] [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       ck-list-sessions  is  a utility that displays information from the ConsoleKit database.  By default, only open sessions are shown.  The --all option can be used to display all existing sessions on
       the system.  ck-list-sessions returns information about each ConsoleKit session.  Users can specify which properties to display via the --format option.

       The following properties can be displayed for each session:

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -a, --all               Show all ConsoleKit sessions.  If this option is not provided, only open sessions are shown.

       -f, --format=format     Display information using the specified format.  The format value is a list of properties to display separated by commas.

       -h, --help              Display detailed usage message.

       -V, --version           Display the version of the ck-list-sessions application.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
   ConsoleKit session properties
       For each session, the following session properties are displayed:

       unix-user               The user id value associated with the session.

       realname                The name of the user associated with the session.

       seat                    The ID for the ConsoleKit Seat associated with the session.

       session-type            The ConsoleKit session type.  This value is set by the process that opens the session and will usually be set to the display protocol used, i.e.  x11, wayland, tty, mir, or
                               unspecified.

       session-class           The ConsoleKit session class.  This value is set by the process that opens the session and will usually be set to user for normal sessions or greeter, lock-screen, or back‐
                               ground for special purpose sessions.

       session-state           The current state of the ConsoleKit session. It is managed by ConsoleKit and will either return online, active, or closing.

       display-type            The ConsoleKit display type.  This value is specified by the "DisplayTemplate" key in the ConsoleKit session configuration file associated with this session.

       open                    The value is "TRUE" if the session is open, and "FALSE" otherwise.

       active                  The value is "TRUE" if the session is active on the seat to which it is attached, and "FALSE" otherwise.

       x11-display             The value of the X11 DISPLAY environment variable for this session if one is present.

       x11-display-device      The value of the display device that the X11 display for the session is connected to.  If there is no x11-display set, then this value is undefined.

       display-device          The display device associated with the session.

       remote-host             If the session is not local, the value is the host name associated with the session.  If the session is local, the value is empty.

       VTNr                    The virtual terminal the ConsoleKit session is on, if any.

       is-local                The value is "TRUE" if the session is local, and "FALSE" if remote.

       on-since                An ISO 8601 date-time string that corresponds to the time the session started.

       login-session-id        The value of the login session ID that the underlying system uses to enforce session boundaries. If there is no login session ID set then this value is an empty string.

       idle-since-hint         An ISO 8601 date-time string that corresponds to the time of the last change of the idle-hint.  This is a hint used to indicate that the session may be idle.  For  sessions
                               with a x11-display set (ie. graphical sessions), it is up to each session to delegate the responsibility for updating this value. Typically, the screensaver will set this.

                               However,  for  non-graphical sessions with a display-device set the Session object itself will periodically update this value based on the activity detected on the display-
                               device itself.

                               This should not be considered authoritative.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: Show running sessions.

       example% ck-list-sessions

       This command would generate output like the following for each session:

       SessionSeat1Local:
               unix-user = '50'
               realname = 'GDM Reserved UID'
               seat = 'Seat1'
               session-type = 'LoginWindow'
               display-type = 'Local'
               open = 'TRUE'
               active = 'TRUE'
               x11-display = ':0'
               x11-display-device = '/dev/console'
               display-device = '/dev/console'
               remote-host-name = ''
               is-local = 'TRUE'
               on-since = '2009-08-11T06:46:42.941134Z'
               login-session-id = ''
               idle-since-hint = ''

       Example 2: Show only the session-id, unix-user, and display-type properties.

       example% ck-list-sessions --format="session-id,unix-user,display-type"

       This command would generate output like the following for each session:

       SessionSeat1Local       50      Local
