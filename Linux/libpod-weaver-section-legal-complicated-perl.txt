NAME
       Pod::Weaver::Section::Legal::Complicated - Different authors, copyright holders, and licenses for each module.

VERSION
       version 1.23

SYNOPSIS
       In your weaver.ini

         [Legal::Complicated]

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin is aimed at distributions that have several files, each of them with possibly different authors, copyright owners and licenses.

       It will look for these values in comments of the source code (analyzed through a "ppi_document") with the following form:

         # AUTHOR:  John Doe <john.doe@otherside.com>
         # AUTHOR:  Mary Jane <mary.jane@thisside.com>
         # OWNER:   2001-2005 University of Over Here
         # OWNER:   2012 Mary Jane
         # LICENSE: GPL_3

       This example would generate the following POD:

         =head2 AUTHORS

         John Doe <john.doe@otherside.com>
         Mary Jane <mary.jane@thisside.com>

         =head2 COPYRIGHT

         This software is copyright (c) 2001-2005 by University of Over Here, and 2012 by Mary Jane.

         This software is available under The GNU General Public License, Version 3, June 2007.

       Note that this plugin makes a distinction between the authors (whoever wrote the code), and the actual copyright owners (possibly the person who paid them to write it).

       I am not a lawyer myself, any feedback on better ways to deal with this kind of situations is most welcome.

ATTRIBUTES
   add_dist_license
       If true, it will also add the distribution license to each of the files.  Defaults to false.

   head
       Sets the heading level for the legal section. Defaults to 1.

NOTE ON DEPENDENCIES
       This plugin is dependent on the Software::License::* module of the license being used. Since it is not feasible to list them all, only Software::License is listed as dependency (of the
       distribution, even though it is not actually used directly.
