NAME
       mgnokiidev - links /dev/gnokii to a virtual modem

SYNOPSIS
       mgnokiidev /dev/pts/?

DESCRIPTION
       mgnokiidev is a tool from the gnokii tool suite used to create the link /dev/gnokii that points to a pseudo-tty (/dev/pts/?).

       It is called after gnokiid has created a virtual modem that is attached to the pty.  It's operation is transparent under normal usage as gnokiid takes care of calling it when required.

       Since mgnokiidev must modifiy files in /dev, it must be either run as root or SUID root.  The latter is the preferred method.  Normally the mgnokiidev binary is chmod 4750 and owned by root.gnokii.

       gnokii is a Linux/Unix tool suite and (eventually) modem/fax driver for Nokia mobile phones, released under the GPL.

       gnokii supports most phones from the 3810/8110 and 5110/6110 series, details including bugs specific to each series appear in the files Docs/README-3810 and Docs/README-6110 respectively.
