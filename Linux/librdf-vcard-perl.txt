NAME
       RDF::vCard::Entity - represents a single vCard

DESCRIPTION
       Instances of this class correspond to individual vCard objects, though it could potentially be used as basis for other RFC 2425-based formats such as iCalendar.

   Constructor
       •   new(%options)

           Returns a new RDF::vCard::Entity object.

           The only option worth worrying about is profile which sets the profile for the entity. This defaults to "VCARD".

           RDF::vCard::Entity overloads stringification, so you can do the following:

             my $vcard = RDF::vCard::Entity->new;
             print $vcard if $vcard =~ /VCARD/i;

   Methods
       •   to_string()

           Formats the object according to RFC 2425 and RFC 2426.

       •   to_jcard()

           Formats the object according to <http://microformats.org/wiki/jcard>.

           to_jcard(1) will return the same data but without the JSON stringification.

       •   add_to_model($model)

           Given an RDF::Trine::Model, adds triples to the model for this entity.

       •   node()

           Returns an RDF::Trine::Node::Blank identifying this entity.

       •   entity_order()

           Returns a string along the lines of "Surname;Forename" useful for sorting a list of entities.

       •   profile()

           Returns the entity type - e.g. "VCARD".

       •   lines()

           Returns an arrayref of RDF::vCard::Line objects in the order they were originally added.

           This excludes the "BEGIN:VCARD" and "END:VCARD" lines.

       •   add($line)

           Add a RDF::vCard::Line.

       •   get($property)

           Returns a list of RDF::vCard::Line objects for the given property.

           e.g.

             print "It has an address!\n" if ($vcard->get('ADR'));

       •   "matches($property, $regexp)"

           Checks to see if a property's value matches a regular expression.

             print "In London\n" if $vcard->matches(ADR => /London/);

       •   add_component($thing)

           Adds a nested entity within this one. This method is unused for vCard, but is a hook for the benefit of RDF::iCalendar.

       •   "components"

           Lists nested entities within this one.
