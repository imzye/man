NAME
       gfsec-split-gpg - Split a GnuPG primary private key

SYNOPSIS
       gfsec-split [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [-u|--user-id id] [-k|--keep] [-c|--config file] [-i|--interactive] [-n|--threshold N] URI...

DESCRIPTION
       gfsec-split-gpg  is  a wrapper script around gfsec-split to facilitate splitting a GnuPG private primary key into a number of shares and dispatching the resulting shares onto external storage sup‐
       ports.

       The split key can then be temporarily reconstructed gfsec-use(1).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display the help message.

       -v, --version
              Display the version message.

       -u, --user-id uid
              Split the primary key associated with the specified OpenPGP User ID. This option is only needed if the GnuPG private keyring contains more than one primary private key.

       -k, --keep
              By default, gfsec-split-gpg will remove the key from the GnuPG keyring once it has been successfully split. Use this option to prevent the key from being removed.

       -c, --config file
              Write the configuration file (allowing to reconstruct the secret with gfsec-use(1) ) to the specified file. Default is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gfsecret/masterkey.conf.  If FILE is a  single  file‐
              name without extension and without a directory part, the file will be placed under the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gfsecret directory with a .conf extension.

       -i, --interactive
              Present the user with an interactive menu to specify the shares to create.

       -n, --threshold N
              Specify the minimal number of shares required to re-assemble the split file. Default is 2.

NOTES
       This script will only work with GnuPG 2.1 or higher.  It will abort before attempting anything if it cannot detect a binary for the correct GnuPG version.

EXAMPLE INVOCATION
       gfsec-split-gpg alice \
         file:///home/alice/.local/share/gfsecret/mykey \
         label://USBSTICK/mykey \
         mtp://RF2GB6X704P/Documents/mykey \

       The  above  example  will split Alice's primary private key into three shares: one on the local filesystem, one on the USB mass storage device with the label USBSTICK, and one on the MTP-compliant
       device with the serial RF2GB6X704P.  A configuration file will be written in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gfsecret/mysecret allowing to automatically reconstruct the file with gfsec-use(1) provided  at  least
       one of the two removable supports are present.
