NAME
       libsass - libsass Documentation

       This  package  provides a simple Python extension module sass which is binding LibSass (written in C/C++ by Hampton Catlin and Aaron Leung).  It's very straightforward and there isn't any headache
       related to Python distribution/deployment.  That means you can add just libsass into your setup.py's install_requires list or requirements.txt file.

       It currently supports CPython 3.7+ and PyPy 3!

FEATURES
       • You don't need any Ruby/Node.js stack at all, for development or deployment either.

       • Fast. (LibSass is written in C++.)

       • Simple API.  See example code for details.

       • Custom functions.

       • @import callbacks.

       • Support both tabbed (Sass) and braces (SCSS) syntax.

       • WSGI middleware for ease of development.  It automatically compiles Sass/SCSS files for each request.  See also sassutils.wsgi for details.

       • setuptools/distutils integration.  You can build all Sass/SCSS files using setup.py build_sass command.  See also sassutils.distutils for details.

       • Works also on PyPy.

       • Provides prebuilt wheel (PEP 427) binaries for Windows and Mac.

INSTALL
       It's available on PyPI, so you can install it using pip:

          $ pip install libsass

       NOTE:
          libsass requires some features introduced by the recent C++ standard.  You need a C++ compiler that support those features.  See also libsass project's README file.

EXAMPLES
   Compile a String of Sass to CSS
       >>> import sass
       >>> sass.compile(string='a { b { color: blue; } }')
       'a b {\n  color: blue; }\n'

   Compile a Directory of Sass Files to CSS
       >>> import sass
       >>> import os
       >>> os.mkdir('css')
       >>> os.mkdir('sass')
       >>> scss = """\
       ... $theme_color: #cc0000;
       ... body {
       ...     background-color: $theme_color;
       ... }
       ... """
       >>> with open('sass/example.scss', 'w') as example_scss:
       ...      example_scss.write(scss)
       ...
       >>> sass.compile(dirname=('sass', 'css'), output_style='compressed')
       >>> with open('css/example.css') as example_css:
       ...     print(example_css.read())
       ...
       body{background-color:#c00}

USER'S GUIDE
   Using with Flask
       This guide explains how to use libsass with the Flask web framework.  sassutils package provides several tools that can be integrated into web applications written in Flask.

   Contents
       • Using with Flask

         • Directory layout

         • Defining manifest

         • Building Sass/SCSS for each request

         • Building Sass/SCSS for each deployment

   Directory layout
       Imagine the project contained in such directory layout:

       • setup.py

       • myapp/

         • __init__.py

         • static/

           • sass/

           • css/

         • templates/

       Sass/SCSS files will go inside myapp/static/sass/ directory.  Compiled CSS files will go inside myapp/static/css/ directory.  CSS files can be regenerated, so add myapp/static/css/ into  your  ig‐
       nore list like .gitignore or .hgignore.

   Defining manifest
       The sassutils defines a concept named manifest.  Manifest is the build settings of Sass/SCSS.  It specifies some paths related to building Sass/SCSS:

       • The path of the directory which contains Sass/SCSS source files.

       • The path of the directory which the compiled CSS files will go.

       • The path, exposed to HTTP (through WSGI), of the directory that will contain the compiled CSS files.

       Every package may have its own manifest.  Paths have to be relative to the path of the package.

       For  example,  in  the  above project, the package name is myapp.  The path of the package is myapp/.  The path of the Sass/SCSS directory is static/sass/ (relative to the package directory).  The
       path of the CSS directory is static/css/.  The exposed path is /static/css.

       These settings can be represented as the following manifests:

          {
              'myapp': ('static/sass', 'static/css', '/static/css')
          }

       As you can see the above, the set of manifests are represented in dictionary, in which the keys are packages names and the values are tuples of paths.

   Building Sass/SCSS for each request
       SEE ALSO:

          Flask --- Hooking in WSGI Middlewares
                 The section which explains how to integrate WSGI middlewares to Flask.

          Flask --- flask:app-dispatch
                 The documentation which explains how Flask dispatches each request internally.

       In development, manually building Sass/SCSS files for each change is a tedious task.  SassMiddleware makes the web application build Sass/SCSS files for each request automatically.   It's  a  WSGI
       middleware, so it can be plugged into the web app written in Flask.

       SassMiddleware takes two required parameters:

       • The WSGI-compliant callable object.

       • The set of manifests represented as a dictionary.

       So:

          from flask import Flask
          from sassutils.wsgi import SassMiddleware

          app = Flask(__name__)

          app.wsgi_app = SassMiddleware(app.wsgi_app, {
              'myapp': ('static/sass', 'static/css', '/static/css')
          })

       And then, if you want to link a compiled CSS file, use the url_for() function:

          <link href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.scss.css') }}"
                rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

       NOTE:
          The linked filename is style.scss.css, not just style.scss.  All compiled filenames have trailing .css suffix.

   Building Sass/SCSS for each deployment
       NOTE:
          This section assumes that you use setuptools for deployment.

       SEE ALSO:

          Flask --- flask:distribute-deployment
                 How to deploy Flask application using setuptools.

       If  libsass  is  installed in the site-packages (for example, your virtualenv), the setup.py script also gets a new command provided by libsass: build_sass.  The command is aware of the sass_mani‐
       fests option of setup.py and builds all Sass/SCSS sources according to the manifests.

       Add these arguments to setup.py script:

          setup(
              # ...,
              setup_requires=['libsass >= 0.6.0'],
              sass_manifests={
                  'myapp': ('static/sass', 'static/css', '/static/css')
              }
          )

       The setup_requires option makes sure that libsass is installed in site-packages (for example, your virtualenv) before the setup.py script.  That means if you run the setup.py  script  and  libsass
       isn't installed in advance, it will automatically install libsass first.

       The sass_manifests specifies the manifests for libsass.

       Now setup.py build_sass will compile all Sass/SCSS files in the specified path and generates compiled CSS files inside the specified path (according to the manifests).

       If you use it with sdist or bdist commands, the packed archive will also contain the compiled CSS files!

          $ python setup.py build_sass sdist

       You can add aliases to make these commands always run the build_sass command first.  Make setup.cfg config:

          [aliases]
          sdist = build_sass sdist
          bdist = build_sass bdist

       Now it automatically builds Sass/SCSS sources and include the compiled CSS files to the package archive when you run setup.py sdist.

   sass --- Binding of libsass
       This simple C extension module provides a very simple binding of libsass, which is written in C/C++.  It contains only one function and one exception type.

       >>> import sass
       >>> sass.compile(string='a { b { color: blue; } }')
       'a b {
         color: blue; }
       '

       exception sass.CompileError(msg)
              The exception type that is raised by compile().  It is a subtype of exceptions.ValueError.

       sass.MODES = frozenset({'dirname', 'filename', 'string'})
              (frozenset) The set of keywords compile() can take.

       sass.OUTPUT_STYLES = {'compact': 2, 'compressed': 3, 'expanded': 1, 'nested': 0}
              (collections.abc.Mapping) The dictionary of output styles.  Keys are output name strings, and values are flag integers.

       sass.SOURCE_COMMENTS = {'default': 1, 'line_numbers': 1, 'map': 2, 'none': 0}
              (collections.abc.Mapping) The dictionary of source comments styles.  Keys are mode names, and values are corresponding flag integers.

              Added in version 0.4.0.

              Deprecated since version 0.6.0.

       class sass.SassColor(r, g, b, a)

       class sass.SassError(msg)

       class sass.SassFunction(name, arguments, callable_)
              Custom function for Sass.  It can be instantiated using from_lambda() and from_named_function() as well.

              Added in version 0.7.0.

              classmethod from_lambda(name, lambda_)
                     Make a SassFunction object from the given lambda_ function.  Since lambda functions don't have their name, it need its name as well.  Arguments are automatically inspected.

                     Parameters

                            • name (str) -- the function name

                            • lambda (types.LambdaType) -- the actual lambda function to be called

                     Returns

              property signature
                     Signature string of the function.

       class sass.SassList(items, separator, bracketed=False)

       class sass.SassMap(*args, **kwargs)
              Because sass maps can have mapping types as keys, we need an immutable hashable mapping type.

       class sass.SassNumber(value, unit)

       class sass.SassWarning(msg)

       sass.compile(**kwargs)
              There are three modes of parameters compile() can take: string, filename, and dirname.

              The string parameter is the most basic way to compile Sass.  It simply takes a string of Sass code, and then returns a compiled CSS string.

              Parameters

                     • string (str) -- Sass source code to compile.  it's exclusive to filename and dirname parameters

                     • output_style (str) -- an optional coding style of the compiled result.  choose one of: 'nested' (default), 'expanded', 'compact', 'compressed'

                     • source_comments (bool) -- whether to add comments about source lines.  False by default

                     • source_map_contents (bool) -- embed include contents in map

                     • source_map_embed (bool) -- embed sourceMappingUrl as data URI

                     • omit_source_map_url (bool) -- omit source map URL comment from output

                     • source_map_root (str) -- base path, will be emitted in source map as is

                     • include_paths (collections.abc.Sequence) -- an optional list of paths to find @imported Sass/CSS source files

                     • precision (int) -- optional precision for numbers. 5 by default.

                     • custom_functions (set, collections.abc.Sequence, collections.abc.Mapping) -- optional mapping of custom functions.  see also below custom functions description

                     • custom_import_extensions -- (ignored, for backward compatibility)

                     • indented (bool) -- optional declaration that the string is Sass, not SCSS formatted. False by default

                     • importers (collections.abc.Callable) -- optional callback functions.  see also below importer callbacks description

              Returns
                     the compiled CSS string

              Return type
                     str

              Raises sass.CompileError -- when it fails for any reason (for example the given Sass has broken syntax)

              The filename is the most commonly used way.  It takes a string of Sass filename, and then returns a compiled CSS string.

              Parameters

                     • filename (str) -- the filename of Sass source code to compile.  it's exclusive to string and dirname parameters

                     • output_style (str) -- an optional coding style of the compiled result.  choose one of: 'nested' (default), 'expanded', 'compact', 'compressed'

                     • source_comments (bool) -- whether to add comments about source lines.  False by default

                     • source_map_filename (str) -- use source maps and indicate the source map output filename.  None means not using source maps.  None by default.

                     • source_map_contents (bool) -- embed include contents in map

                     • source_map_embed (bool) -- embed sourceMappingUrl as data URI

                     • omit_source_map_url (bool) -- omit source map URL comment from output

                     • source_map_root (str) -- base path, will be emitted in source map as is

                     • include_paths (collections.abc.Sequence) -- an optional list of paths to find @imported Sass/CSS source files

                     • precision (int) -- optional precision for numbers. 5 by default.

                     • custom_functions (set, collections.abc.Sequence, collections.abc.Mapping) -- optional mapping of custom functions.  see also below custom functions description

                     • custom_import_extensions -- (ignored, for backward compatibility)

                     • importers (collections.abc.Callable) -- optional callback functions.  see also below importer callbacks description

              Returns
                     the compiled CSS string, or a pair of the compiled CSS string and the source map string if source_map_filename is set

              Return type
                     str, tuple

              Raises

                     • sass.CompileError -- when it fails for any reason (for example the given Sass has broken syntax)

                     • exceptions.IOError -- when the filename doesn't exist or cannot be read

              The dirname is useful for automation.  It takes a pair of paths.  The first of the dirname pair refers the source directory, contains several Sass source files  to  compiled.   Sass  source
              files  can  be  nested  in directories.  The second of the pair refers the output directory that compiled CSS files would be saved.  Directory tree structure of the source directory will be
              maintained in the output directory as well.  If dirname parameter is used the function returns None.

              Parameters

                     • dirname (tuple) -- a pair of (source_dir, output_dir).  it's exclusive to string and filename parameters

                     • output_style (str) -- an optional coding style of the compiled result.  choose one of: 'nested' (default), 'expanded', 'compact', 'compressed'

                     • source_comments (bool) -- whether to add comments about source lines.  False by default

                     • source_map_contents (bool) -- embed include contents in map

                     • source_map_embed (bool) -- embed sourceMappingUrl as data URI

                     • omit_source_map_url (bool) -- omit source map URL comment from output

                     • source_map_root (str) -- base path, will be emitted in source map as is

                     • include_paths (collections.abc.Sequence) -- an optional list of paths to find @imported Sass/CSS source files

                     • precision (int) -- optional precision for numbers. 5 by default.

                     • custom_functions (set, collections.abc.Sequence, collections.abc.Mapping) -- optional mapping of custom functions.  see also below custom functions description

                     • custom_import_extensions -- (ignored, for backward compatibility)

              Raises sass.CompileError -- when it fails for any reason (for example the given Sass has broken syntax)

              The custom_functions parameter can take three types of forms:

              set/Sequence of SassFunctions
                 It is the most general form.  Although pretty verbose, it can take any kind of callables like type objects, unnamed functions, and user-defined callables.

                     sass.compile(
                         ...,
                         custom_functions={
                             sass.SassFunction('func-name', ('$a', '$b'), some_callable),
                             ...
                         }
                     )

              Mapping of names to functions
                     Less general, but easier-to-use form.  Although it's not it can take any kind of callables, it can take any kind of  functions  defined  using  def/lambda  syntax.   It  cannot  take
                     callables other than them since inspecting arguments is not always available for every kind of callables.

                        sass.compile(
                            ...,
                            custom_functions={
                                'func-name': lambda a, b: ...,
                                ...
                            }
                        )

              set/Sequence of named functions
                 Not general, but the easiest-to-use form for named functions.  It can take only named functions, defined using def.  It cannot take lambdas sinc names are unavailable for them.

                     def func_name(a, b):
                         return ...

                     sass.compile(
                         ...,
                         custom_functions={func_name}
                     )

              Newer  versions of libsass allow developers to define callbacks to be called and given a chance to process @import directives. You can define yours by passing in a list of callables via the
              importers parameter. The callables must be passed as 2-tuples in the form:

                 (priority_int, callback_fn)

              A priority of zero is acceptable; priority determines the order callbacks are attempted.

              These callbacks can accept one or two string arguments. The first argument is the path that was passed to the @import directive; the second (optional)  argument  is  the  previous  resolved
              path,  where  the  @import  directive was found. The callbacks must either return None to indicate the path wasn't handled by that callback (to continue with others or fall back on internal
              libsass filesystem behaviour) or a list of one or more tuples, each in one of three forms:

              • A 1-tuple representing an alternate path to handle internally; or,

              • A 2-tuple representing an alternate path and the content that path represents; or,

              • A 3-tuple representing the same as the 2-tuple with the addition of a "sourcemap".

              All tuple return values must be strings. As a not overly realistic example:

                 def my_importer(path, prev):
                     return [(path, '#' + path + ' { color: red; }')]

                 sass.compile(
                         ...,
                         importers=[(0, my_importer)]
                     )

              Now, within the style source, attempting to @import 'button'; will instead attach color: red as a property of an element with the imported name.

              Added in version 0.4.0: Added source_comments and source_map_filename parameters.

              Changed in version 0.6.0: The source_comments parameter becomes to take only bool instead of str.

              Deprecated since version 0.6.0: Values like 'none', 'line_numbers', and 'map' for the source_comments parameter are deprecated.

              Added in version 0.7.0: Added precision parameter.

              Added in version 0.7.0: Added custom_functions parameter.

              Added in version 0.11.0: source_map_filename no longer implies source_comments.

              Added in version 0.17.0: Added source_map_contents, source_map_embed, omit_source_map_url, and source_map_root parameters.

              Added in version 0.18.0: The importer callbacks can now take a second argument, the previously- resolved path, so that importers can do relative path resolution.

   sassutils.distutils --- setuptools/distutils integration
       This module provides extensions (and some magical monkey-patches, sorry) of the standard distutils and setuptools (now it's named Distribute) for libsass.

       To use this, add libsass into setup_requires (not install_requires) option of the setup.py script:

          from setuptools import setup

          setup(
              # ...,
              setup_requires=['libsass >= 0.6.0']
          )

       It will adds build_sass command to the setup.py script:

          $ python setup.py build_sass

       This commands builds Sass/SCSS files to compiled CSS files of the project and makes the package archive (made by sdist, bdist, and so on) to include these compiled CSS files.

       To set the directory of Sass/SCSS source files and the directory to store compiled CSS files, specify sass_manifests option:

          from setuptools import find_packages, setup

          setup(
              name='YourPackage',
              packages=find_packages(),
              sass_manifests={
                  'your.webapp': ('static/sass', 'static/css')
              },
              setup_requires=['libsass >= 0.6.0']
          )

       The option should be a mapping of package names to pairs of paths, e.g.:

          {
              'package': ('static/sass', 'static/css'),
              'package.name': ('static/scss', 'static')
          }

       The option can also be a mapping of package names to manifest dictionaries:

          {
              'package': {
                  'sass_path': 'static/sass',
                  'css_path': 'static/css',
                  'strip_extension': True,
              },
          }

       Added in version 0.15.0: Added strip_extension so a.scss is compiled to a.css instead of a.scss.css.  This option will default to True in the future.

       Added in version 0.6.0: Added --output-style/-s option to build_sass command.

       class sassutils.distutils.build_sass(dist: Distribution, **kw)
              Builds Sass/SCSS files to CSS files.

              finalize_options()
                     Set final values for all options/attributes used by the command.  Most of the time, each option/attribute/cache should only be set if  it  does  not  have  any  value  yet  (e.g.  if
                     self.attr is None: self.attr = val).

              get_package_dir(package)
                     Returns the directory, relative to the top of the source distribution, where package package should be found (at least according to the package_dir option, if any).

                     Copied from distutils.command.build_py.get_package_dir() method.

              initialize_options()
                     Set or (reset) all options/attributes/caches used by the command to their default values. Note that these values may be overwritten during the build.

              run()  Execute the actions intended by the command.  (Side effects SHOULD only take place when run() is executed, for example, creating new files or writing to the terminal output).

       sassutils.distutils.validate_manifests(dist, attr, value)
              Verifies that value is an expected mapping of package to sassutils.builder.Manifest.

   sassutils.wsgi --- WSGI middleware for development purpose
       class sassutils.wsgi.SassMiddleware(app, manifests, package_dir={}, error_status='200 OK')
              WSGI middleware for development purpose.  Every time a CSS file has requested it finds a matched Sass/SCSS source file and then compiled it into CSS.

              It shows syntax errors in three ways:

              Heading comment
                     The result CSS includes detailed error message in the heading CSS comment e.g.:

                        /*
                        Error: invalid property name
                        */

              Red text in body:before
                     The result CSS draws detailed error message in :before pseudo-class of body element e.g.:

                        body:before {
                            content: 'Error: invalid property name';
                            color: maroon;
                            background-color: white;
                        }

                     In most cases you could be aware of syntax error by refreshing your working document because it will removes all other styles and leaves only a red text.

              logging
                     It logs syntax errors if exist during compilation to sassutils.wsgi.SassMiddleware logger with level ERROR.

                     To enable this:

                        from logging import Formatter, StreamHandler, getLogger
                        logger = getLogger('sassutils.wsgi.SassMiddleware')
                        handler = StreamHandler(level=logging.ERROR)
                        formatter = Formatter(fmt='*' * 80 + '\n%(message)s\n' + '*' * 80)
                        handler.setFormatter(formatter)
                        logger.addHandler(handler)

                     Or simply:

                        import logging
                        logging.basicConfig()

              Parameters

                     • app (collections.abc.Callable) -- the WSGI application to wrap

                     • manifests (collections.abc.Mapping) -- build settings.  the same format to setup.py script's sass_manifests option

                     • package_dir (collections.abc.Mapping) -- optional mapping of package names to directories.  the same format to setup.py script's package_dir option

              Changed in version 0.4.0: It creates also source map files with filenames followed by .map suffix.

              Added in version 0.8.0: It logs syntax errors if exist during compilation to sassutils.wsgi.SassMiddleware logger with level ERROR.

              static quote_css_string(s)
                     Quotes a string as CSS string literal.
