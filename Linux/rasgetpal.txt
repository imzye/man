NAME
       rasgetpal - extract the color palette of a rasterfile and write it to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       rasgetpal [-Version] srcfile [dstfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Given srcfile and no dstfile, rasgetpal will extract the color palette from srcfile and print it in textual form to standard output. Given srcfile and dstfile, rasgetpal will extract the color palette
       from srcfile and save it in file dstfile. If the extension of dstfile is ".txt", the color palette is saved in textual form. If it is ".pal", the palette is saved in a binary HDF-compatible format.

       Once you have a ".pal" color palette you can use it with NCSA's XImage or any other application that uses this format of color palette. A textual color palette can be edited using a standard text edi‐
       tor and then fed back to ctrans, rasview, or rascat in order to get a modified color palette. It's also useful when you simply want to know what's in your color palette. See "man ras_palette" for more
       information on these different formats.

OPTIONS
       -help  Print help information.

       -Version
              Print the version number.

EXAMPLE
       Let's suppose you have an X Window Dump rasterfile called window.xwd and you'd like to get a textual copy of the color palette.

          % rasgetpal window.xwd window.txt
          % vi window.txt /* edit the color table */
          % rasview -pal window.txt window.xwd

       You could also use the command below to get the same palette file:

          % rasgetpal window.xwd >window.txt

       Now suppose you'd like to get an HDF-compatible binary palette from "window.xwd":

          % rasgetpal window.xwd new.pal

CAVEATS
       A color map can be extracted from indexed rasterfiles but not from direct-color rasterfiles.
