NAME
       markdown2 - Command to convert a markdown file to HTML

SYNOPSIS
       markdown2 [PATHS...]

DESCRIPTION
       A fast and complete Python implementation of Markdown, a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

       Supported extra syntax options (see -x|--extras option below and see <https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details):

       * code-friendly: Disable _ and __ for em and strong.  * cuddled-lists: Allow lists to be cuddled to the preceding paragraph.  * fenced-code-blocks: Allows a code block to not have to be indented

              by fencing it with '```' on a line before and after. Based on <http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/> with support for syntax highlighting.

       * footnotes: Support footnotes as in use on daringfireball.net and

              implemented in other Markdown processors (tho not in Markdown.pl v1.0.1).

       * header-ids: Adds "id" attributes to headers. The id value is a slug of

              the header text.

       * highlightjs-lang: Allows specifying the language which used for syntax

              highlighting when using fenced-code-blocks and highlightjs.

       * html-classes: Takes a dict mapping html tag names (lowercase) to a

              string to use for a "class" tag attribute. Currently only supports "img", "table", "pre" and "code" tags. Add an issue if you require this for other tags.

       * link-patterns: Auto-link given regex patterns in text (e.g. bug number

              references, revision number references).

       * markdown-in-html: Allow the use of `markdown="1"` in a block HTML tag to

              have markdown processing be done on its contents. Similar to <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#markdown-attr> but with some limitations.

       * metadata: Extract metadata from a leading '---'-fenced block.

              See <https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/issues/77> for details.

       * nofollow: Add `rel="nofollow"` to add `<a>` tags with an href. See

              <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow>.

       * numbering: Support of generic counters.  Non standard extension to

              allow sequential numbering of figures, tables, equations, exhibits etc.

       * pyshell: Treats unindented Python interactive shell sessions as <code>

              blocks.

       * smarty-pants: Replaces ' and " with curly quotation marks or curly

       apostrophes.
              Replaces --, ---, ..., and . . . with en dashes, em dashes,

              and ellipses.

       * spoiler: A special kind of blockquote commonly hidden behind a

              click on SO. Syntax per <http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/72878>.

       * strike: text inside of double tilde is ~~strikethrough~~ * tag-friendly: Requires atx style headers to have a space between the # and

              the header text. Useful for applications that require twitter style tags to pass through the parser.

       * tables: Tables using the same format as GFM

              <https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#tables> and PHP-Markdown Extra <https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#table>.

       * toc: The returned HTML string gets a new "toc_html" attribute which is

              a Table of Contents for the document. (experimental)

       * use-file-vars: Look for an Emacs-style markdown-extras file variable to turn

              on Extras.

       * wiki-tables: Google Code Wiki-style tables. See

              <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax#Tables>.

       * xml: Passes one-liner processing instructions and namespaced XML tags.
