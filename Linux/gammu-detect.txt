GAMMU-DETECT(1)                      Gammu                     GAMMU-DETECT(1)

NAME
       gammu-detect - Gammu device detection

       New in version 1.28.95.

SYNOPSIS
          gammu-detect [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Script to detect available devices, which might be suitable for gammu.

       NOTE:
          This program lists all devices, which might be suitable, it does not
          do any probing on devices them self.

       Currently it supports following devices:

       • USB devices using udev

       • Serial ports using udev

       • Serial ports on Windows

       • Bluetooth devices using Bluez

       NOTE:
          Supported devices depend on platform you are using and  compiled  in
          features.  You  can find out what is actually compiled in by running
          gammu-detect -v.

       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with  long  op‐
       tions  starting  with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included
       below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -d, --debug
              Show debugging output for detecting devices.

       -v, --version
              Show version information and compiled in features.

       -u, --no-udev
              Disables scanning of udev.

       -b, --no-bluez
              Disables scanning using Bluez.

       -w, --no-win32-serial
              Disables scanning of Windows serial ports.

OUTPUT
       The output of gammu-detect is configuration file for  Gammu  (see  gam‐
       murc)  with  configuration section for every device which might be used
       with gammu.

       NOTE:
          You can choose which section to use in gammu by gammu -s.

       When invoked as gammu-detect -d, also all examined devices  are  listed
       as comments in the output.

EXAMPLE
          ; Configuration file generated by gammu-detect.
          ; Please check The Gammu Manual for more information.
