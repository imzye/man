NAME
       bomstrip, bomstrip-files — strip the BOM sequence from UTF-8 files

SYNOPSIS
       bomstrip
       bomstrip-files file ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  bomstrip utility reads UTF-8 data from its standard input and copies it to its standard output, stripping the BOM (byte-order mark) from the beginning of the text if it is present.  There are
       no command-line options and no parameters.

       The bomstrip-files utility removes the UTF-8 BOM from the specified files, saving each file's original contents with a .bom extension.  It uses the  bomstrip  utility,  trying  to  execute  it  as
       “bomstrip”; if the bomstrip utility is installed under another name, or if a more complex command is desired, it may be supplied in the BOMSTRIP environment variable.

EXAMPLES
       Strip the BOM, if present, from a text file:

             bomstrip < bom.txt > nobom.txt

       Strip the BOM, if present, from all text files, backing them up with a .bom extension:

             bomstrip-files *.txt

       Use the OCAML implementation of bomstrip:

             env BOMSTRIP='ocaml bomstrip.ocaml' bomstrip-files *.txt

HISTORY
       The  bomstrip  utility  (in many languages) was written by Mechiel Lukkien, with implementations in various languages sent to him by others, including Andreas Gohr, Andrew Gerrand, Berteun Damman,
       Matthijs Bomhoff, Peter Pentchev, and Ruben Smelik.  The bomstrip-files utility and this manual page were written by Peter Pentchev in the hope that they reflect the behavior of all  the  bomstrip
       implementations in all languages.
