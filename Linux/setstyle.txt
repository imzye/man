NAME
       setstyle - set style related options for Window Maker or loads a theme

SYNOPSIS
       setstyle [options] stylefile|themepack

DESCRIPTION
       setstyle  reads the file stylefile and writes its contents to the WMWindowMaker domain, effectively setting the Window Maker style.  If the supplied path is a directory (themepack), it will be treated
       as a theme pack and it will be loaded appropriately.

OPTIONS
       --help print a help message with the list of options.

       --ignore keyword
              ignore the attribute named keyword from the style file.  You can specify this option as many times as needed.  You may find a non-exhaustive list of the keywords from the getstyle(1) man page.

       --no-cursors
              ignore cursor definition options from the style file (NormalCursor, ArrowCursor, MoveCursor, ResizeCursor, TopLeftResizeCursor, TopRightResizeCursor, BottomLeftResizeCursor,  BottomRightResize‐
              Cursor, VerticalResizeCursor, HorizontalResizeCursor, WaitCursor, QuestionCursor, TextCursor, SelectCursor).

       --no-fonts
              ignore font related options from the style file (IconTitleFont, ClipTitleFont, MenuTextFont, MenuTitleFont, WindowTitleFont).

       --version
              print the version of Window Maker from which the program comes.

ENVIRONMENT
       WMAKER_USER_ROOT
              specifies  the  initial  path  for the Defaults directory. "Defaults/" is appended to this variable to determine the actual location of the databases. If the variable is not set, it defaults to
              "~/GNUstep"

FILES
       WMAKER_USER_ROOT/Defaults/WindowMaker
              This is the actual file that's written.
