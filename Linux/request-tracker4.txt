NAME
       rt-crontool - Command-line interface to Request Tracker

SYNOPSIS
           # find all active tickets in the queue 'general' and set their priority to 99 if they are overdue:
           rt-crontool \
             --search RT::Search::ActiveTicketsInQueue  --search-arg general \
             --condition RT::Condition::Overdue \
             --action RT::Action::SetPriority --action-arg 99 \
             --verbose

           # Escalate tickets
             rt-crontool \
               --search RT::Search::ActiveTicketsInQueue  --search-arg general \
               --action RT::Action::EscalatePriority

           # Process tickets in parallel
             rt-crontool \
               --search RT::Search::ActiveTicketsInQueue  --search-arg general \
               --action RT::Action::SomeTimeConsumingAction
               --max-processes 10 --max-tickets-per-process 100

DESCRIPTION
       This script is a tool to act on tickets from an external scheduling tool, such as cron.

       Security:

       This tool allows the user to run arbitrary perl modules from within RT. If this tool were setgid, a hostile local user could use this tool to gain administrative access to RT. It is
       incredibly important that nonprivileged users not be allowed to run this tool. It is suggested that you create a non-privileged unix user with the correct group membership and RT access to
       run this tool.

OPTIONS
       search
           Specify the search module you want to use

       search-arg
           An argument to pass to --search

       condition
           Specify the condition module you want to use

       condition-arg
           An argument to pass to --condition

       action
           Specify the action module you want to use. This option may be repeated to apply multiple actions to found tickets.

       action-arg
           An argument to pass to --action. This option may be repeated to pass corresponding arguments to multiple calls of --action.

       template
           Specify name or id of template(s) you want to use

       transaction
           Specify if you want to use either 'first', 'last' or 'all' transactions

       transaction-type
           Specify the comma separated list of transactions' types you want to use

       reload-ticket
           Reload ticket before processing in tickets iteration. This is to refresh ticket metadata, which is useful especially for long-running jobs.

       max-processes
           Specify the max number of children to maintain. This implies parallel processing, which is false by default.

       max-ticket-per-process
           Specify the max number of tickets to process in each child. Only take effect with --max-processes.  Default is 100.

       log Adjust LogToSTDERR config option

       verbose
           Output status updates to STDOUT

       dry-run
           Actions are composed of 2 parts: "Prepare" and "Commit".  "dry-run" skips the "Commit" part.
