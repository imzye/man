NAME
       wmix - Dockapp mixer for OSS or ALSA

SYNOPSIS
       wmix [options...]
       wmix -h

DESCRIPTION
       Docked  application  to  control  audio mixer for OSS or ALSA.  Allows toggling record source, muting individual channels, adjusting volume and balance, all in a compact dockapp size, with TV-like
       on-screen-display for volume levels.

       Supports mouse wheel to adjust current channel's volume, supports also the volume control keys on “multimedia” keyboards and can  be  controlled  remotely  with  unix  signals  SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2  to
       raise/lower the volume.  Keeps a simple configuration file for user-defined settings.

OPTIONS
       -d <display>
              Connect to remote X display

       -e <name>
              Exclude channel from control (see CHANNEL NAMES below)

       -f <file>
              Use config file instead of ~/.wmixrc

       -h     Display list of command-line options

       -k     Disable grabbing the audio volume control keys on keyboard (see BUGS below)

       -m <device>
              Use specified mixer device instead of /dev/mixer

       -v     Verbose start, report detected channels

CONFIGURATION FILE
       If readable, the file ~/.wmixrc (or the file specified through -f option) is read on startup.  It may contains one configuration command per line:

       device=<mixer_device>
              defines the device file to use instead of /dev/mixer

       exclude=<channel_name>
              exclude the specified channel from control, you can use it as many times as needed (see CHANNEL NAMES below)

       mousewheel=<0|1>
              when set to 0, disable the volume control through mouse wheel (default=1)

       osd=<0|1>
              when set to 0, disable display of the volume in an OSD like fashion (default=1)

       osdcolor=<color>
              specify  the  color to use for OSD volume display.  It can be the name of a color (see /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt) or an RGB specification (as rgb:<red>/<green>/<blue> with hexadecimal numbers)
              as expected by X11 (default=green)

       scrolltext=<0|1>
              when set to 0, disable text scrolling to display the name of current selected channel, use static short name instead (default=1)

       wheelbtn1=<button>
       wheelbtn2=<button>
              defines the buttons events associated in X11 to the mouse wheel, with btn1 for up and btn2 for down (default: btn1=4 and btn2=5)

       wheelstep=<percentage>
              sets the volume change step when using the mouse wheel, specified as a percentage of the total volume range (i.e.: 1 < value < 100, default=3)
              For compatibility, values between 0.0 and 1.0 will be considered as a raw percentage

       You may include comments in the file using the character # in which case everything will be ignored from the character to the end of the line.

CHANNEL NAMES
       The names for the different channels are provided by ALSA/OSS as short names, for which wmix provides a long name match for readability.  The default behavior is to scroll the  long  name  of  the
       current channel in the text line of the dockapp, but if you disable the scroll text then the short name will be displayed instead.

       If  you  want  to  exclude a channel from the list of channels controlled by the dockapp you have to use the short name.  You can get the list of all the channels available in your sound card with
       wmix -v and the short name will be between parentheses, here is an example:

       Supported channels:
         1: Master volume      (Vol  )
         2: PC Speaker         (Spkr )
         3: PCM Wave 2 volume  (Pcm2 )
         4: Input gain         (IGain)
         5: Phone output       (PhoneOut)

FILES
       ~/.wmixrc
              User configuration file (change with option -f)

       ~/.wmix.pid
              Contains process id of wmix, in case you'd need it for SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 volume control

       /dev/mixer
              Device used for controlling volume (change with option -m or with command device in the config file)

       /usr/share/doc/wmix/README
              More information on the user interface

BUGS
       The mute functionality is implemented by setting the volume to 0 and remembering the previous volume to restore it when unmuting.  While this is perfectly ok, you may encounter strange looking be‐
       havior if you have other application controlling the volume, and possibly implementing mute in similar ways, because there is no way to know that a channel has been muted.

       The X server allows only one application at a time to place a grab on a key, so if another application already claimed the volume control keys then wmix will warn you about it and continue without
       the functionality.  If on the other hand you encounter problem with applications that do not work because they could not grab these keys (a typical symptom is an X Error of type BadAccess with ma‐
       jor opcode 33 X_GrabKey), you can ask wmix to not grab them using the command line option -k.

       If you modify the configuration file, do not expect wmix to reload it automatically, this is considered a too costly feature for such a small application.
