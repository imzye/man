NAME
     flpsed — annotate PostScript and PDF files

SYNOPSIS
     flpsed [-bdh] [-t tag=value] [-z zoom] [infile] [outfile]

DESCRIPTION
     The flpsed utility allows one to annotate Postscript files.  PDF files can be imported using the pdftops and exported using the ps2pdf utility.  If the docu‐
     ment was saved in Postscript format, added text can be reedited later.  flpsed is useful for filling in forms or adding short comments.  Batch mode can be used
     to automate form filling.

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Batch mode (no GUI). In batch mode flpsed reads from stdin, if no infile is specified. Batch mode is useful in combination with the file ... -t option.

     -d      Dump tags and values from a document to stdout (implies -b ).

     -h      Show short help text.

     -t tag=value
             Set text to value where tag is tag Multiple -t options are allowed.

     -z zoom
             Set initial zoom value in percent.

     -geometry WxH+X+Y
             Set initial geometry.

     -iconic
             Start iconified.

     -scheme string
             Use fltk scheme string Currently fltk supports "plastic" and "gtk+".

EXIT STATUS
     The flpsed utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The command:

           flpsed file1

     will start flpsed and load file1 for interactive editing.

     The command:

           flpsed -b -t foo=bar file1 file2

     will set the text of all text fields in file1 carrying the tag "foo" to "bar" and write the resulting Postscript document to file2
