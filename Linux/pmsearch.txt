PMSEARCH(1)                 General Commands Manual                PMSEARCH(1)

NAME
       pmsearch  -  help  text  and  names  search  for metrics, instances and
       instance domains

SYNOPSIS
       pmsearch [-CdinqsStTV?]  [-c config] [-h host] [-p  port]  [-N  number]
       [-O offset] [query | indom]

DESCRIPTION
       pmsearch  performs full text search queries to find metrics using names
       and help text from metrics, instance domains and instances.

       It  makes  use  of  capabilties  of  the  Performance  Co-Pilot   (PCP)
       pmproxy(1)  service,  the  Redis distributed data store, and the RediS‐
       earch module.

       Note that in order to use these services, it is mandatory that  pmproxy
       is communicating with a redis-server(1) that has the redisearch.so mod‐
       ule loaded.  When configured to do so, pmproxy will then  automatically
       index PCP metric names, instance names, metric and instance domain help
       text into the RediSearch store, from PCP  archives  that  it  discovers
       locally.   Refer  to  pmlogger(1)  and  pmlogger_daily(1)  for  further
       details.

       By default pmsearch communicates with a local redis-server(1),  however
       the  -h  and  -p  options  can  be  used  to specify an alternate Redis
       instance.  If this instance is a node of a  Redis  cluster,  all  other
       instances in the cluster will be discovered and used automatically.

OPTIONS
       -c config, --config=config
            Specify the config file to use.

       -C, --no-colour
            No highlighting in results text.

       -d, --docid
            Report  document  ID of each search result.  Documents are identi‐
            fied using a unique SHA-1 hash which  is  always  displayed  in  a
            40-hexdigit human readable form.

       -h host, --host=host
            Connect  to  the  Redis  server  at  host, rather than the one the
            localhost.

       -i, --info
            Report search engine internal metrics.

       -n, --indom
            Perform an instance domain related entities search

       -N N, --number=N
            Return N, search results at most.

       -O N, --offset=N
            Paginated results from given offset.

       -p port, --port=port
            Connect to the Redis server at port, rather than the default 6379.

       -q, --query
            Perform a general text search (default).

       -s, --suggest
            Peform a name suggestion search

       -S, --score
            Report score (rank) of each result.

       -T, --total
            Report total number of of search results.

       -t, --times
            Report elapsed search execution time.

       -V, --version
            Display version number and exit.

       -?, --help
            Display usage message and exit.

EXAMPLES
         $ pmsearch kernel idle
         Type: metric
         Name: kernel.all.cpu.idle
         One line: total idle CPU time from /proc/stat for all CPUs

         Type: metric
         Name: kernel.all.idletime
         One line: time the current kernel has been idle since boot

         Type: metric
         Name: kernel.percpu.cpu.idle
         InDom: 60.0
         One line: percpu idle CPU time metric from /proc/stat

PCP ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the
       file  and  directory names used by PCP.  On each installation, the file
       /etc/pcp.conf contains the  local  values  for  these  variables.   The
       $PCP_CONF  variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
       file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see pmGetOptions(3).
