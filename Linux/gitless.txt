DESCRIPTION
       The gl utility is a version control system built on top of Git.

       The gl utility accepts the following commands:

       track   Start tracking changes to files.

       untrack
               Stop tracking changes to files.

       status  Show the status of the repository.

       diff    Show the status of the repository.

       commit  Save changes to the local repository.  By default all tracked modified files are committed.  To customize the set of files to be committed use the only, exclude, and include flags.

               -m      Specify the commit message.

               -p, --partial
                       Interactively select segments of files to commit.

       branch  List, create, edit, or delete branches.

               -c, --create
                       Create the specified branch(es).

               -d, --delete
                       Delete the specified branch(es).

               -dp, -divergent-point
                       The commit from which to “branch out”.

               -sh, --set-head
                       Set the head of the current branch.

               -su, --set-upstream
                       Set the upstream branch of the current branch.

               -uu, --unset-upstream
                       Unset the upstream branch of the current branch.

               -v      Be verbose, output the head of each branch.

       tag     List, create, or delete tags.

               -c, --create
                       Create tag(s).

               -ci, --commit
                       Specify the commit to tag.

               -d, --delete
                       Delete tag(s).

               -r, --remote
                       List remote tags in addition to local ones.

       checkout
               Checkout the committed versions of the specified files.

               -cp, --commit-point
                       The commit point to checkout the files as.

       merge   Merge the divergent changes of one branch onto another.

               -a      Abort the merge in progress.

       resolve
               Mark files with conflicts as resolved.

       fuse    Fuse  the  divergent changes of a branch onto the current branch.  By default all divergent changes from the given source branch are fused.  To customize the set of commits to fuse use the
               only and exclude flags.

               -a, --abort
                       Abort the fuse in progress.

               -ip, --insertion-point
                       The divergent changes will be inserted after the specified commit.

       remote  List, create, edit, or delete remotes.

               -c, --create

               -d, --delete
                       Delete a remote.

       publish
               Publish commits upstream.

       switch  Switch branches.

               -mo, --move-over
                       Move the uncommitted changes made to the current branch to the destination branch.

       init    Create an empty Gitless repository or create one from an existing remote repository.

       history
               Show the commit history.

               -b, --branch
                       The branch to show the history of.

               -c, --compact
                       Output the history in a compact format.

               -l, --limit
                       Limit the number of commits displayed.

               -v, --verbose
                       Be verbose, output the diffs of the commits.

COMMON OPTIONS
       The following options have a similar meaning for various commands:

       -e, --exclude
               Exclude the specified files; the files must be tracked and modified.

       -h, --help
               Display a help message.

       -i, --include
               Include the specified files; the files must be untracked.

       -o, --only
               Use only the specified files; the files must be tracked and modified.

ENVIRONMENT
       The gl utility makes use of the following environment variables, if specified:

       EDITOR  Specify the editor to use for composing commit messages; default: “vim”.

       PAGER   Specify the pager to be used if the core.pager setting is not specified in the Git configuration; default: “less -r -f”.  If the pager to be executed is actually less(1),  the  -r  and  -f
               flags are appended to its arguments.

FILES
       The operation of the gl utility is influenced by the same configuration files that git(1) uses; see the “FILES” section of the git-config(1) documentation.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The gl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
