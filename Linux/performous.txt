       Performous  supports  songs  in  UltraStar,  Frets on Fire and StepMania formats.  Also, microphones and instruments from SingStar, Guitar Hero and Rock Band as well as some dance pads are autode‐
       tected.

       If you have trouble with the program (no songs found, audio not working, etc), try running it on a terminal. Some useful debug information is printed there.

AUDIO DEVICE CONFIGURATION
       Performous normally autodetects microphones and playback devices correctly, but if this fails on your machine, you will need to configure them in the Audio Devices screen.  Advanced  configuration
       is possible through the command line, just remember to enter the configuration menu and press Ctrl+S to save them to your config file so that they don't need to be specified every time the program
       starts.

       The list of available PortAudio devices is printed to the console, but it can also be seen from the GUI.
