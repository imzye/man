NAME
       pcb-rnd - Printed Circuit Board editor

SYNPOSIS
       pcb-rnd [options] [inputfile]

DECSRIPTION
       pcb-rnd is a modular PCB editor. The main use is interactive editing. If no -x is specified on the command line, the graphical editor mode is initiated. Automated, headless processing is also possible
       with -x or --gui batch.

OPTIONS
       --help topic
              Print help about topic and exit; if no topic is specified, print available topics.

       -x exporter [exportflags] inputfile
              Instead of interactive editing, export the design (loaded from inputfile) to a file using the specified exporter plugin. A list of exporter-specific parameters may follow to control the details
              of the process.

       --gui hid
              Use the hid plugin for the "gui" frontend. Common choices are "gtk" or "lesstif" for graphical user interfaces and "batch" for a headless command-line interface (or automated batch processing).

       -c path=val
              Set a config node in role CFR_CLI. The path of the node is path (e.g. editor/grid) and the new value is val (e.g. 5mm).
