NAME
       dumpasn1 - ASN.1 object dump/syntax check program

SYNOPSIS
       dumpasn1 [-acdefghilmoprstuvwxz] <file>

DESCRIPTION
       An ASN.1 object dump program which will dump data encoded using any of the ASN.1 encoding rules in a variety of user-specified formats.

       DumpASN1 - ASN.1 object dump/syntax check program.  Copyright Peter Gutmann 1997 - 2021.  Last updated 12 February 2021.

              Input options:

              - = Take input from stdin (some options may not work properly) -<number> = Start <number> bytes into the file -- = End of arg list -c<file> = Read Object Identifier info from alternate
              config file

              (values will override equivalents in global config file)

              Output options:

       -f<file> = Dump object at offset -<number> to file (allows data to be

              extracted from encapsulating objects)

       -w<number> = Set width of output, default = 80 columns

              Display options:

       -a = Print all data in long data blocks, not just the first 128 bytes

       -d = Print dots to show column alignment

       -g = Display ASN.1 structure outline only (no primitive objects)

       -h = Hex dump object header (tag+length) before the decoded output

       -hh = Same as -h but display more of the object as hex data

       -i = Use shallow indenting, for deeply-nested objects

       -l = Long format, display extra info about Object Identifiers

       -m<number>
              = Maximum nesting level for which to display content

       -p = Pure ASN.1 output without encoding information

       -t = Display text values next to hex dump of data

       -v = Verbose mode, equivalent to -ahlt

              Format options:

       -e = Don't print encapsulated data inside OCTET/BIT STRINGs

       -r = Print bits in BIT STRING as encoded in reverse order

       -u = Don't format UTCTime/GeneralizedTime string data

       -x = Display size and offset in hex not decimal

              Checking options:

       -o = Don't check validity of character strings hidden in octet strings

       -s = Syntax check only, don't dump ASN.1 structures

       -z = Allow zero-length items

       Warnings generated by deprecated OIDs require the use of '-l' to be displayed.  Program return code is the number of errors found or EXIT_SUCCESS.
