NAME
       swipl - SWI-Prolog 9.2.9

SYNOPSIS
       swipl [--help|--version|--arch|--dump-runtime-variables]
       swipl [options] prolog-file ... [--] [arg ...]
       swipl [options] [-o output] -c file ...
       swipl [options] [-o output] -b initfile ...

       The  first  version  provides information about the system and exits immediately. The second version is the primary way to call Prolog on one or more Prolog source file(s) and provide arguments to
       the application that can be requested using current_prolog_flag(argv, Argv).  The third version is used to create a saved state while the last version is used for boot-compilation  of  the  Prolog
       parts of the system.

DESCRIPTION
       SWI-Prolog is a comprehensive and stable implementation of the Prolog language with a large set of libraries. Among its distinguishing features are mature support for multi-threading, a mature em‐
       bedded  web-server  library,  graphical  development tools (debugger, profiler, cross-referencer, editor), an embedded efficient RDF store, support for XML/SGML/HTML and Unicode.  More widely sup‐
       ported features are support for constraint programming, atom garbage collection, interfaces to databases (ODBC), C, C++ and Java (JPL).

       SWI-Prolog implements the ISO core standard. Many of its extensions are largely compatible to YAP and SICStus Prolog.

       This manual page only lists the commandline options.  Full documentation is available on-line as well as in HTML and PDF format from the WWW home page at http://www.swi-prolog.org

OPTIONS
       --help Give a summary of the most important options.

       --version
              Display version and architecture information.

       --abi-version
              Display ABI version key.  This key indicates binary compatibility of various interfaces.

       --arch Print the architecture identifier.

       --dump-runtime-variables[=format]
              Dump information that is generally useful for installation scripts in a form defined by format.  Defines formats are sh (default, bourne shell) and cmd (Windows CMD).  This option  is  used
              by swipl-ld (1) to fetch necessary information about Prolog.  It is normally invoked as eval `swipl --dump-runtime-variables`, which assigns the following shell variables:

              CC     The C- compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog.

              PLBASE The home directory of SWI-Prolog.  This is the same value as returned by the current_prolog_flag home.

              PLARCH The architecture identifier used.  Together with PLBASE this defines the location of various components.  For example, the library for embedding is in $PLBASE/lib/$PLARCH/libswipl.a

              PLBITS Address bits for VM.  Either 32 or 64.

              PLLIB  CC identifier to link to SWI-Prolog.  Typically -lswipl

              PLLIBSWIPL
                     Full path name to the shared object (DLL) that provides the Prolog core.

              PLLIBS Additional libraries needed for linking PLLIB

              PLCFLAGS
                     Flags that need to be passed to the C-compiler to generate compatible code.

              PLLDFLAGS
                     Flags that need to be passed to the C-linker for linking embedded executables.

              PLSOEXT
                     Extension used by the hosting operating system for shared objects. On most Unix systems this is "so"; on MS-Windows it is "dll".  AIX uses "o", HPUX "sl".

              PLSOPATH
                     Environment variable used by the hosting operating system to extend the search path for shared objects.  For example, on ELF systems this is "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" and on MS-Windows it is
                     "PATH".

              PLVERSION
                     Numeric representation of the SWI-Prolog version.

              PLVERSIONTAG
                     If present, a version tag such as "rc1".

              PLSHARED
                     Has the value yes if Prolog supports linking shared libraries using load_foreign_library/[1,2] and no otherwise.

              PLTHREADS
                     Has the value yes if Prolog was compiled for multi-threading and no otherwise.

       --home=DIR
              Use DIR as home directory.

       --stack-limit=size[bkmg]
              Set the combined stack limit to size bytes.  The suffix is case insensitive and defines the unit as b (bytes), k (Kbytes), m (Mbytes) or g (Gbytes).

       --table-space=size[bkmg]
              Set the table space limit for SLG resolution (tabling) to size bytes.  The suffixes are the same as for the --stack-limit option.

       --shared-table-space=size[bkmg]
              Set the table space limit for shared tabling to size bytes.  The suffixes are the same as for the --stack-limit option.

       -O     Optimised compilation. See set_prolog_flag/2 in the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual.

       -b initfile ... -c file ...
              Boot  compilation.  initfile ...  are compiled by the C written bootstrap compiler, file ...  by the normal Prolog compiler into an intermediate code file. This option is for system mainte‐
              nance and is given for reference only.

       -c file ...
              Compile file ...  into an intermediate code file.

       -d level
              Set debug level to level.  This option is for system maintenance and is given for reference only.

       --packs[=bool]
              Disable attaching extension packs (add-ons).

       --pce[=bool]
              Disable the XPCE GUI subsystem.

       --pldoc[=port]
              Start the PlDoc documentation system on a free network port and launch the user's browser on http://localhost:port.  If port is specified, the server is started at the given  port  but  the
              browser is not launched.

       -f file
              Use file as initialisation file instead of `init.pl'. `-f none' stops SWI-Prolog from searching for an initialisation file.

       -F file
              Select  startup  script  from the SWI-Prolog home directory.  file Specifies the base-name of the script.  The extension is .rc.  The default script is deduced from the basename of the exe‐
              cutable, taking all leading alphanumerical (letters, digits and underscore) from the program name.  Thus if the program is named swi-2.0 it will try to load the file swi.rc  from  the  SWI-
              Prolog home directory.  If the file does not exist, or the user has no read-access to it, the script is silently not loaded.

       -s file
              Load  file  as a script.  This option may be used from the shell to make Prolog load a file before entering the toplevel.  Deprecated as file names with a Prolog extension (.pl or .qlf) are
              used to load the program.

       -l file
              Load file as a script.  This is a synonym for -s that is compatible with several other Prolog implementations.  If multiple -s or -l arguments are provided, all specified files  are  loaded
              in the order in which they appear on the argument list.

       --quiet[=bool] -q
              Operate silently.  This option suppresses all informational messages.

       --debug[=bool]
              Disable generating code that can be debugged using trace/0, spy/1, etc.

       --debug-on-interrupt[=bool]
              Immediately start handling SIGINT (Control-C) to start the debugger.  By default this is enabled when the interactive toplevel is entered.

       --on-error=style
              How to handle on a (printed) error message.  Default is print which causes errors to be printed while execution continues.  Using status execution continues as with print, but halt/0 causes
              the process to exit with status 1 and halt causes the process to exit with status 1 on the first error.

       --on-warning=style
              Similar to --on-error, but for warning messages.

       -g goal
              Goal  is  executed  just before entering the top level. This option may appear multiple times.  Goals are executed in the order of appearance.  Possible choice points are pruned.  If a goal
              fails an error is printed (depending on the -q flag) and the process stops with exit code 1.  If a goal raises an exception the error is printed and the process stops with exit code 2.   In
              no  goal  is  present  version/0 is called to write the welcome message.  The welcome message can thus be suppressed by giving -g true.  goal can be a complex term. In this case, quotes are
              normally needed to protect it from being expanded by the Unix shell.

       -o output
              Used in combination with -b or -c to determine the output file for compilation.

       -p alias=pathlist
              Define a path alias for file_search_path/2.  pathlist is a ":" separated list of values for the alias. See file_search_path/2 in the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual.

       -t goal
              Use goal as an interactive top level instead of the default goal prolog/0.  goal can be a complex term. If the top level goal succeeds, SWI-Prolog exits with status 0. If it fails, the exit
              status is 1. This flag also determines the goal started by break/0 and abort/0.  If you want to stop the user from entering interactive mode, start the application with `-g goal'  and  give
              `halt' as the top level.

       -x bootfile
              Start from an intermediate code file resulting from a Prolog compilation using the -b or -c option, or created using qsave_program/[1,2].

       --tty[=bool]
              Switches  tty  control (using ioctl(2)).  Normally tty control is switched on. This default depends on the installation. You may wish to switch tty control off if SWI-Prolog is used from an
              editor such as GNU Emacs. If switched off, get_single_char/1 and the tracer will wait for a carriage return.

       --win-app
              This option is available only in swipl-win.exe.  The Start menu shortcut uses this option to change the working directory to ...\Documents\Prolog.  The Prolog subdirectory will  be  created
              if it does not exist.

       --signals[=bool]
              Disable handling of signals.  Often used if SWI-Prolog is embedded in another application on Unix systems.

       --sigalert=NUM
              Use NUM for unblocking system calls.  Default is SIGUSR2.  Using 0 disables installing a signal handler, delaying the delivery of thread signals until the blocking system call completes.

       --threads[=bool]
              Disable  creating  threads in the multi-threaded version.  This notably prevents running global garbage collection on a separate thread and may be used for situations where multiple threads
              are not desirable.

       --traditional
              Disable SWI-Prolog version 7 extensions that are incompatible with earlier versions.

       --     Stop scanning for more arguments.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SWI_HOME_DIR
              Location for finding the startup file  and the libraries.  Normally discovered from the executable or configured default location.  Providing the value through the environment may be needed
              if SWI-Prolog is embedded into another executable.

ON-LINE HELP
       SWI-Prolog has on-line help. This provides a fast lookup and browsing facility to the SWI-Prolog Reference manual. The on-line manual can show predicate definitions as well as entire  sections  of
       the manual.

       help   Equivalent to help(help/1).

       help(+What)
              Show a specified part of the manual.  What is one of:

              Name/Arity
                     give help on the specified predicate

              Name   give help on the named predicate with any arity or a C interface function with that name.

              Section
                     display the specified section of the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual.  Section numbers are dash separated numbers: e.g.  2-3 refers to section 2.3 of the manual.

              If Prolog is used together with the GUI tool XPCE, these predicates start a graphical interface, providing a coherent interface to help/1, apropos/1 and explain/1.

FILES
       This  installation  of SWI-Prolog has been configured using the configure option --prefix=/usr.  If the files listed below are not at the indicated place, the installation has probably been moved.
       Use

       ?- current_prolog_flag(home, Home).

       to find the local installation directory of SWI-Prolog.

       ~/.config/swi-prolog/init.pl
              Personal initialisation files consulted by SWI-Prolog on startup.  The exact location depends on the OS.

       /usr/lib/swipl-9.2.9/bin//
              Location for the executables.

       /usr/lib/swipl-9.2.9/include/
              Location for the include files.  If writable, SWI-Prolog.h is also copied to /usr/include/SWI-Prolog.h.
