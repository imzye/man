NAME
       gidd_alloc - HTCondor Manual

       find a GID within the specified range which is not used by any process

SYNOPSIS
       gidd_alloc min-gid max-gid

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  will scan the alive PIDs, looking for which GID is unused in the supplied, inclusive range specified by the required arguments min-gid and max-gid. Upon finding one, it will add the GID
       to its own supplementary group list, and then scan the PIDs again expecting to find only itself using the GID. If no collision has occurred, the program exits, otherwise it retries.

GENERAL REMARKS
       This is a program only available for the Linux ports of HTCondor.

EXIT STATUS
       gidd_alloc will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
