NAME
       Net::Frame::Device - get network device information and gateway

SYNOPSIS
          use Net::Frame::Device;

          my $device = Net::Frame::Device->new;

          # Get values from a specific device
          my $device2 = Net::Frame::Device->new(dev => 'vmnet1');

          # Get values from a specific target
          my $device3 = Net::Frame::Device->new(target => '192.168.10.2');

          print "dev: ", $device->dev, "\n";
          print "mac: ", $device->mac, "\n";
          print "ip : ", $device->ip,  "\n";
          print "ip6: ", $device->ip6, "\n";
          print "gatewayIp:  ", $device->gatewayIp,  "\n" if $device->gatewayIp;
          print "gatewayMac: ", $device->gatewayMac, "\n" if $device->gatewayMac;

          # Get values from a specific target
          my $device5 = Net::Frame::Device->new(target6 => '2001::1');

          print "dev: ", $device5->dev, "\n";
          print "mac: ", $device5->mac, "\n";
          print "ip6: ", $device5->ip6, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to get network information, and is especially useful when you want to do low-level network programming.

       It also provides useful functions to lookup network MAC addresses.

ATTRIBUTES
       dev The network device. undef if none found.

       ip  The IPv4 address of dev. undef if none found.

       ip6 The IPv6 address of dev. undef if none found.

       mac The MAC address of dev. undef if none found.

       subnet
           The subnet of IPv4 address ip. undef if none found.

       subnet6
           The subnet of IPv6 address ip6. undef if none found.

       gatewayIp
           The gateway IPv4 address. It defaults to default gateway that let you access Internet. If none found, or not required in the usage context, it defaults to undef.

       gatewayIp6
           The gateway IPv6 address. It defaults to default gateway that let you access Internet. If none found, or not required in the usage context, it defaults to undef.

       gatewayMac
           The MAC address gatewayIp. See lookupMac method.

       gatewayMac6
           The MAC address gatewayIp6. See lookupMac6 method.

       target
           This attribute is used when you want to detect which dev, ip, mac attributes to use for a specific target. See SYNOPSIS.

       target6
           This attribute is used when you want to detect which dev, ip6, mac attributes to use for a specific target. See SYNOPSIS.

METHODS
       new
       new (hash)
           Object constructor. See SYNOPSIS for default values.

       updateFromDefault
           Will update attributes according to the default interface that has access to Internet.

       updateFromDev
       updateFromDev (dev)
           Will update attributes according to dev attribute, or if you specify 'dev' as a parameter, it will use it for updating (and will also set dev to this new value).

       updateFromTarget
       updateFromTarget (target)
           Will update attributes according to target attribute, or if you specify 'target' as a parameter, it will use it for updating (and will also set target to this new value).

       updateFromTarget6
       updateFromTarget6 (target6)
           Will update attributes according to target6 attribute, or if you specify 'target6' as a parameter, it will use it for updating (and will also set target6 to this new value).

       lookupMac (IPv4 address, [ retry, timeout ])
           Will  try  to  get the MAC address of the specified IPv4 address. First, it checks against ARP cache table. Then, verify the target is on the same subnet as we are, and if yes, it does the ARP
           request. If not on the same subnet, it tries to resolve the gateway MAC address (by using gatewayIp attribute). You can add optional parameters retry count  and  timeout  in  seconds.  Returns
           undef on failure.

       lookupMac6 (IPv6 address, [ retry, timeout ])
           Will try to get the MAC address of the specified IPv6 address (using ICMPv6). First, verify the target is on the same subnet as we are, and if yes, it does the ICMPv6 lookup request. If not on
           the same subnet, it tries to resolve the gateway MAC address (by using gatewayIp6 attribute). You can add optional parameters retry count and timeout in seconds. Returns undef on failure.

       debugDeviceList
           Just for debugging purposes, especially on Windows systems.
