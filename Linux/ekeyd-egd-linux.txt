NAME
       egd-linux - EGD Entropy Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ekey-egd-linux [ -H hostip ] [ -p portno ] [ -b blocks ] [ -s shannons ] [ -D pidfile ] [ -r time ] [ -v ] [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       ekey-egd-linux is a daemon which connects to an EGD server and places the read entropy in the kernels pool.

OPTIONS
       -H hostip
              Set the host IP address to connect to.

       -p portno
              Set the port number to connect to.

       -b blocks
              Set the number of 1024 bit blocks to request each time.

       -s shannons
              Set the number of shannons per byte.

       -D pidfile
              Specify the name and path of the file used to record the ekey-egd-linux process ID.

       -r time
              Set  the  time  between  reconnect attempts. The default (0) causes the daemon to exit immediately after the initial connection attempt and no additional connection attempts are made. A non
              zero value set is the number of seconds the daemon will wait between connection attempts.
