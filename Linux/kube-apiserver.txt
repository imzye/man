NAME
       kube-apiserver -

SYNOPSIS
       kube-apiserver [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Kubernetes  API server validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, replicationcontrollers, and others. The API Server services REST operations and provides the
       frontend to the cluster's shared state through which all other components interact.

OPTIONS
       --add_dir_header=false      If true, adds the file directory to the header of the log messages

       --address=127.0.0.1      The IP address on which to serve the insecure port (set to 0.0.0.0 or :: for listening in all interfaces and IP families).

       --admission-control=[]      Admission is divided into two phases. In the first phase, only mutating admission plugins run. In the second phase, only validating admission plugins run. The names in  the
       below  list may represent a validating plugin, a mutating plugin, or both. The order of plugins in which they are passed to this flag does not matter. Comma-delimited list of: AlwaysAdmit, AlwaysDeny,
       AlwaysPullImages, CertificateApproval, CertificateSigning, CertificateSubjectRestriction, DefaultIngressClass, DefaultStorageClass,  DefaultTolerationSeconds,  DenyServiceExternalIPs,  EventRateLimit,
       ExtendedResourceToleration,  ImagePolicyWebhook,  LimitPodHardAntiAffinityTopology, LimitRanger, MutatingAdmissionWebhook, NamespaceAutoProvision, NamespaceExists, NamespaceLifecycle, NodeRestriction,
       OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement, PersistentVolumeClaimResize, PersistentVolumeLabel, PodNodeSelector, PodSecurityPolicy, PodTolerationRestriction, Priority, ResourceQuota, RuntimeClass, Security‐
       ContextDeny, ServiceAccount, StorageObjectInUseProtection, TaintNodesByCondition, ValidatingAdmissionWebhook.

       --admission-control-config-file=""      File with admission control configuration.

       --advertise-address=       The IP address on which to advertise the apiserver to members of the cluster. This address must be reachable by the rest of the cluster. If blank, the --bind-address will be
       used. If --bind-address is unspecified, the host's default interface will be used.

       --allow-metric-labels=[]      The map from metric-label to value allow-list of this label. The key's format is ,. The value's format is  ,...e.g.  metric1,label1='v1,v2,v3',  metric1,label2='v1,v2,v3'
       metric2,label1='v1,v2,v3'.

       --allow-privileged=false      If true, allow privileged containers. [default=false]

       --alsologtostderr=false      log to standard error as well as files

       --anonymous-auth=true      Enables anonymous requests to the secure port of the API server. Requests that are not rejected by another authentication method are treated as anonymous requests. Anonymous
       requests have a username of system:anonymous, and a group name of system:unauthenticated.

       --api-audiences=[]      Identifiers of the API. The service account token authenticator will validate that tokens used against the API are bound to at least one  of  these  audiences.  If  the  --ser‐
       vice-account-issuer flag is configured and this flag is not, this field defaults to a single element list containing the issuer URL.

       --apiserver-count=1      The number of apiservers running in the cluster, must be a positive number. (In use when --endpoint-reconciler-type=master-count is enabled.)

       --audit-log-batch-buffer-size=10000      The size of the buffer to store events before batching and writing. Only used in batch mode.

       limit, it is split into several batches of smaller size.

       --audit-log-truncate-max-event-size=102400       Maximum size of the audit event sent to the underlying backend. If the size of an event is greater than this number, first request and response are re‐
       moved, and if this doesn't reduce the size enough, event is discarded.

       --audit-webhook-mode="batch"      Strategy for sending audit events. Blocking indicates sending events should block server responses. Batch  causes  the  backend  to  buffer  and  write  events  asyn‐
       chronously. Known modes are batch,blocking,blocking-strict.

       --audit-webhook-truncate-enabled=false      Whether event and batch truncating is enabled.

       --audit-webhook-truncate-max-batch-size=10485760      Maximum size of the batch sent to the underlying backend. Actual serialized size can be several hundreds of bytes greater. If a batch exceeds this

       --goaway-chance=0      To prevent HTTP/2 clients from getting stuck on a single apiserver, randomly close a connection (GOAWAY). The client's other in-flight requests won't be affected, and the client
       will reconnect, likely landing on a different apiserver after going through the load balancer again. This argument sets the fraction of requests that will be sent a GOAWAY. Clusters with single  apis‐
       ervers, or which don't use a load balancer, should NOT enable this. Min is 0 (off), Max is .02 (1/50 requests); .001 (1/1000) is a recommended starting point.

       --kubelet-timeout=5s      Timeout for kubelet operations.

       --kubernetes-service-node-port=0       If non-zero, the Kubernetes master service (which apiserver creates/maintains) will be of type NodePort, using this as the value of the port. If zero, the Kuber‐
       netes master service will be of type ClusterIP.

       --lease-reuse-duration-seconds=60      The time in seconds that each lease is reused. A lower value could avoid large number of objects reusing the same lease. Notice that a too small value may  cause
       performance problems at storage layer.

       --livez-grace-period=0s       This  option represents the maximum amount of time it should take for apiserver to complete its startup sequence and become live. From apiserver's start time to when this
       amount of time has elapsed, /livez will assume that unfinished post-start hooks will complete successfully and therefore return true.

       --log_file=""      If non-empty, use this log file

       --log_file_max_size=1800      Defines the maximum size a log file can grow to. Unit is megabytes. If the value is 0, the maximum file size is unlimited.

       --logging-format="text"      Sets the log format. Permitted formats: "json", "text".  Non-default formats don't honor these flags: --add_dir_header, --alsologtostderr,  --log_backtrace_at,  --log_dir,
       --log_file, --log_file_max_size, --logtostderr, --one_output, --skip_headers, --skip_log_headers, --stderrthreshold, --vmodule, --log-flush-frequency.  Non-default choices are currently alpha and sub‐
       ject to change without warning.

       --logtostderr=true      log to standard error instead of files

       --master-service-namespace="default"      DEPRECATED: the namespace from which the Kubernetes master services should be injected into pods.

       --max-connection-bytes-per-sec=0      If non-zero, throttle each user connection to this number of bytes/sec. Currently only applies to long-running requests.

       --max-mutating-requests-inflight=200      The maximum number of mutating requests in flight at a given time. When the server exceeds this, it rejects requests. Zero for no limit.

       --max-requests-inflight=400      The maximum number of non-mutating requests in flight at a given time. When the server exceeds this, it rejects requests. Zero for no limit.

       --min-request-timeout=1800      An optional field indicating the minimum number of seconds a handler must keep a request open before timing it out. Currently only honored by the watch request handler,
       which picks a randomized value above this number as the connection timeout, to spread out load.

       --oidc-ca-file=""      If set, the OpenID server's certificate will be verified by one of the authorities in the oidc-ca-file, otherwise the host's root CA set will be used.

       --oidc-client-id=""      The client ID for the OpenID Connect client, must be set if oidc-issuer-url is set.

       --oidc-groups-claim=""       If  provided, the name of a custom OpenID Connect claim for specifying user groups. The claim value is expected to be a string or array of strings. This flag is experimen‐
       tal, please see the authentication documentation for further details.

       --oidc-groups-prefix=""      If provided, all groups will be prefixed with this value to prevent conflicts with other authentication strategies.

       --oidc-issuer-url=""      The URL of the OpenID issuer, only HTTPS scheme will be accepted. If set, it will be used to verify the OIDC JSON Web Token (JWT).

       --oidc-required-claim=      A key=value pair that describes a required claim in the ID Token. If set, the claim is verified to be present in the ID Token with a matching value.  Repeat  this  flag  to
       specify multiple claims.

       --oidc-signing-algs=[RS256]       Comma-separated  list  of allowed JOSE asymmetric signing algorithms. JWTs with a 'alg' header value not in this list will be rejected. Values are defined by RFC 7518
       https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1.

       --oidc-username-claim="sub"      The OpenID claim to use as the user name. Note that claims other than the default ('sub') is not guaranteed to be unique and  immutable.  This  flag  is  experimental,
       please see the authentication documentation for further details.

       --oidc-username-prefix=""      If provided, all usernames will be prefixed with this value. If not provided, username claims other than 'email' are prefixed by the issuer URL to avoid clashes. To skip
       any prefixing, provide the value '-'.

       --one_output=false      If true, only write logs to their native severity level (vs also writing to each lower severity level)

       --permit-address-sharing=false      If true, SO_REUSEADDR will be used when binding the port. This allows binding to wildcard IPs like 0.0.0.0 and specific IPs in parallel, and it avoids  waiting  for
       the kernel to release sockets in TIME_WAIT state. [default=false]

       --permit-port-sharing=false      If true, SO_REUSEPORT will be used when binding the port, which allows more than one instance to bind on the same address and port. [default=false]

       --port=0      The port on which to serve unsecured, unauthenticated access.

       --profiling=true      Enable profiling via web interface host:port/debug/pprof/

       --proxy-client-cert-file=""       Client  certificate  used  to prove the identity of the aggregator or kube-apiserver when it must call out during a request. This includes proxying requests to a user
       api-server and calling out to webhook admission plugins. It is expected that this cert includes a signature from the CA in the --requestheader-client-ca-file flag. That CA is published in the  'exten‐
       sion-apiserver-authentication' configmap in the kube-system namespace. Components receiving calls from kube-aggregator should use that CA to perform their half of the mutual TLS verification.

       --proxy-client-key-file=""      Private key for the client certificate used to prove the identity of the aggregator or kube-apiserver when it must call out during a request. This includes proxying re‐
       quests to a user api-server and calling out to webhook admission plugins.

       --request-timeout=1m0s      An optional field indicating the duration a handler must keep a request open before timing it out. This is the default request timeout for requests but may be overridden by
       flags such as --min-request-timeout for specific types of requests.

       --requestheader-allowed-names=[]       List  of client certificate common names to allow to provide usernames in headers specified by --requestheader-username-headers. If empty, any client certificate
       validated by the authorities in --requestheader-client-ca-file is allowed.

       --requestheader-client-ca-file=""      Root certificate bundle to use to verify client certificates on incoming requests  before  trusting  usernames  in  headers  specified  by  --requestheader-user‐
       name-headers. WARNING: generally do not depend on authorization being already done for incoming requests.

       --requestheader-extra-headers-prefix=[]      List of request header prefixes to inspect. X-Remote-Extra- is suggested.

       --requestheader-group-headers=[]      List of request headers to inspect for groups. X-Remote-Group is suggested.

       --requestheader-username-headers=[]      List of request headers to inspect for usernames. X-Remote-User is common.

       --runtime-config=       A  set  of  key=value  pairs that enable or disable built-in APIs. Supported options are: v1=true|false for the core API group /=true|false for a specific API group and version
       (e.g. apps/v1=true) api/all=true|false controls all API versions api/ga=true|false controls all  API  versions  of  the  form  v[0-9]+  api/beta=true|false  controls  all  API  versions  of  the  form
       v[0-9]+beta[0-9]+ api/alpha=true|false controls all API versions of the form v[0-9]+alpha[0-9]+ api/legacy is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version

       --secure-port=6443      The port on which to serve HTTPS with authentication and authorization. It cannot be switched off with 0.

       --service-account-api-audiences=[]      Identifiers of the API. The service account token authenticator will validate that tokens used against the API are bound to at least one of these audiences.

       --service-account-extend-token-expiration=true       Turns on projected service account expiration extension during token generation, which helps safe transition from legacy token to bound service ac‐
       count token feature. If this flag is enabled, admission injected tokens would be extended up to 1 year to prevent unexpected failure during transition, ignoring value of  service-account-max-token-ex‐
       piration.

       --service-account-issuer=""       Identifier  of the service account token issuer. The issuer will assert this identifier in "iss" claim of issued tokens. This value is a string or URI. If this option
       is not a valid URI per the OpenID Discovery 1.0 spec, the ServiceAccountIssuerDiscovery feature will remain disabled, even if the feature gate is set to true. It is highly recommended that this  value
       comply  with  the  OpenID spec: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html. In practice, this means that service-account-issuer must be an https URL. It is also highly recommended that
       this URL be capable of serving OpenID discovery documents at {service-account-issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration.

       --service-account-jwks-uri=""      Overrides the URI for the JSON Web Key Set in the discovery doc served at /.well-known/openid-configuration. This flag is useful if the discovery docand key set  are
       served  to  relying parties from a URL other than the API server's external (as auto-detected or overridden with external-hostname). Only valid if the ServiceAccountIssuerDiscovery feature gate is en‐
       abled.

       --service-account-key-file=[]      File containing PEM-encoded x509 RSA or ECDSA private or public keys, used to verify ServiceAccount tokens. The specified file can contain  multiple  keys,  and  the
       flag can be specified multiple times with different files. If unspecified, --tls-private-key-file is used. Must be specified when --service-account-signing-key is provided

       --service-account-lookup=true      If true, validate ServiceAccount tokens exist in etcd as part of authentication.

       --service-account-max-token-expiration=0s       The maximum validity duration of a token created by the service account token issuer. If an otherwise valid TokenRequest with a validity duration larger
       than this value is requested, a token will be issued with a validity duration of this value.

       --service-account-signing-key-file=""      Path to the file that contains the current private key of the service account token issuer. The issuer will sign issued ID tokens with this private key.

       --service-cluster-ip-range=""      A CIDR notation IP range from which to assign service cluster IPs. This must not overlap with any IP ranges assigned to nodes or pods. Max of two dual-stack CIDRs is
       allowed.

       --service-node-port-range=30000-32767      A port range to reserve for services with NodePort visibility. Example: '30000-32767'. Inclusive at both ends of the range.

       --show-hidden-metrics-for-version=""      The previous version for which you want to show hidden metrics. Only the previous minor version is meaningful, other values will not be allowed. The format is
       ., e.g.: '1.16'. The purpose of this format is make sure you have the opportunity to notice if the next release hides additional metrics, rather than being surprised when they are permanently  removed
       in the release after that.

       --shutdown-delay-duration=0s      Time to delay the termination. During that time the server keeps serving requests normally. The endpoints /healthz and /livez will return success, but /readyz immedi‐
       ately returns failure. Graceful termination starts after this delay has elapsed. This can be used to allow load balancer to stop sending traffic to this server.

       --skip_headers=false      If true, avoid header prefixes in the log messages

       --skip_log_headers=false      If true, avoid headers when opening log files

       --ssh-keyfile=""      If non-empty, use secure SSH proxy to the nodes, using this user keyfile

       --ssh-user=""      If non-empty, use secure SSH proxy to the nodes, using this user name

       --stderrthreshold=2      logs at or above this threshold go to stderr

       --storage-backend=""      The storage backend for persistence. Options: 'etcd3' (default).

       --storage-media-type="application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf"      The media type to use to store objects in storage. Some resources or storage backends may only support a specific media  type  and  will
       ignore this setting.

       --strict-transport-security-directives=[]       List  of  directives  for HSTS, comma separated. If this list is empty, then HSTS directives will not be added. Example: 'max-age=31536000,includeSubDo‐
       mains,preload'

       --target-ram-mb=0      DEPRECATED: Memory limit for apiserver in MB (used to configure sizes of caches, etc.)

       --tls-cert-file=""      File containing the default x509 Certificate for HTTPS. (CA cert, if any, concatenated after server cert). If HTTPS serving  is  enabled,  and  --tls-cert-file  and  --tls-pri‐
       vate-key-file are not provided, a self-signed certificate and key are generated for the public address and saved to the directory specified by --cert-dir.

       --tls-cipher-suites=[]       Comma-separated  list  of  cipher  suites  for  the  server.  If  omitted,  the  default  Go  cipher  suites  will  be  used.   Preferred  values:  TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
       TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,        TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256,        TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,         TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,         TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,
       TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
       TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256,
       TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,     TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,     TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.      Insecure     values:
       TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA,      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,       TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA,       TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,
       TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA.

       --tls-min-version=""      Minimum TLS version supported. Possible values: VersionTLS10, VersionTLS11, VersionTLS12, VersionTLS13

       --tls-private-key-file=""      File containing the default x509 private key matching --tls-cert-file.

       --tls-sni-cert-key=[]       A  pair  of  x509  certificate and private key file paths, optionally suffixed with a list of domain patterns which are fully qualified domain names, possibly with prefixed
       wildcard segments. The domain patterns also allow IP addresses, but IPs should only be used if the apiserver has visibility to the IP address requested by a client. If no domain patterns are provided,
       the  names  of  the  certificate  are  extracted.  Non-wildcard  matches  trump  over wildcard matches, explicit domain patterns trump over extracted names. For multiple key/certificate pairs, use the
       --tls-sni-cert-key multiple times. Examples: "example.crt,example.key" or "foo.crt,foo.key:*.foo.com,foo.com".

       --token-auth-file=""      If set, the file that will be used to secure the secure port of the API server via token authentication.

       -v, --v=0      number for the log level verbosity

       --watch-cache=true      Enable watch caching in the apiserver

       --watch-cache-sizes=[]      Watch cache size settings for some resources (pods, nodes, etc.), comma separated. The individual setting format: resource[.group]#size, where resource is lowercase  plural
       (no version), group is omitted for resources of apiVersion v1 (the legacy core API) and included for others, and size is a number. It takes effect when watch-cache is enabled. Some resources (replica‐
       tioncontrollers, endpoints, nodes, pods, services, apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io) have system defaults set by heuristics, others default to default-watch-cache-size
