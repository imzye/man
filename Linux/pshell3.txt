NAME
       pshell3 - Python 3 Pyramid command

DESCRIPTION
       usage: pshell3 [-h] [-p PYTHON_SHELL] [-l] [--setup SETUP]

              [config_uri] [config_vars ...]

       Open  an interactive shell with a Pyramid app loaded.  This command accepts one positional argument named "config_uri" which specifies the PasteDeploy config
       file to use for the interactive shell. The format is "inifile#name". If the name is left off, the Pyramid default  application  will  be  assumed.   Example:
       "pshell myapp.ini#main".

       If you do not point the loader directly at the section of the ini file containing your Pyramid application, the command will attempt to find the app for you.
       If you are loading a pipeline that contains more than one Pyramid application within it, the loader will use the last one.

   positional arguments:
       config_uri
              The URI to the configuration file.

       config_vars
              Variables required by the config file. For example, `http_port=%(http_port)s` would expect `http_port=8080` to be passed here.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -p PYTHON_SHELL, --python-shell PYTHON_SHELL
              Select the shell to use. A list of possible shells is available using the --list-shells option.

       -l, --list-shells
              List all available shells.

       --setup SETUP
              A callable that will be passed the environment before it is made available to the shell. This option will override the 'setup' key in the [pshell] ini
              section.
