NAME
       Terminology - Terminal Emulator written with EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries).

SYNOPSIS
       terminology [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This is an EFL terminal emulator with some extra bells and whistles.  It has many features including split terminal support, support for tabs, preview icons for files and so on...

OPTIONS
       -e, --exec <cmnd>
              Specify  command  to  execute.  Defaults to $SHELL (or passwd shell or /bin/sh) When used along with -S/--split, each argument is used as a command for a split, leaving away the extra argu‐
              ments.  With 3 splits, one vertical, a command on the right, an horizontal split on the left with only a command on the bottom, the following arguments should be used: --split v-h-- -e com‐
              mand1 $SHELL command2

       -d=CURRENT-DIRECTORY, --current-directory=CURRENT-DIRECTORY
              Change to directory for execution of terminal command.  Type: STR.

       -t=THEME, --theme=THEME
              Use the named edje theme or path to theme file.  Type: STR.

       -b=BACKGROUND, --background=BACKGROUND
              Use the named file as a background wallpaper for terminology.  Type: STR.

       -g=GEOMETRY, --geometry=GEOMETRY
              Terminal geometry to use (eg 80x24 or 80x24+50+20 etc.).  Type: STR.

       -n=NAME, --name=NAME
              Set window name.  Type: STR.

       -r=ROLE, --role=ROLE

       -S=vh-, --split=vh-
              Terminology can start with splits opened as described below.  The arguments are a string with the following characters:
               -S v splits terminal vertically
               -S h splits horizontally
               - defines a placeholder for a shell or a command when used with
               --exec/-e

                1.   ESC char (\033 or 0x1b)
                2.   } char
                3... sequence of UTF8 chars other than nul (\000 or 0x00).
                4    \000 char (nul byte or 0x00 to indicate end of sequence) e.g.
                echo -n '\033}Hello world\000'

              Commands:

              any values inside square brackets [] are to be replaced by some content (numbers, strings, paths, url's etc.). example:

              aa[PATH-OF-FILE] should be come something like:
                aa/tmp/file.png or aa[true/false] should become something like:
                aatrue or
                aafalse

              ---

              pn[FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                popup the given media file/url now.

              pq[FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                queue a popup for the given media file/url.

              bt[FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                set the terminal background media file/url temporarily.

              bp[FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                set the terminal background media file/url permanently.

              at[on/true/yes/off/false/no]
                set the terminal alpha state to be on, or off temporarily.

              ap[on/true/yes/off/false/no]
                set the terminal alpha state to be on, or off permanently.

              qs
                query grid and font size. stdin will have written to it:
                  W;H;FW;FH
                where W is the width of the terminal grid in characters
                where H is the height of the terminal grid in characters
                where FW is the width of 1 character cell in pixels
                where FH is the height of 1 character cell in pixels

              is[CW;H;FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                insert STRETCHED media (where image will stretch to fill the
                  cell area) and define expected cell area to be W cells
                  wide and H cells high, with the image/media/url.
                where C is the replace character to be identified in later
                  text where W is the width in character cells (up to 511).
                where H is the height in character cells (up to 511).

                note  that  this  escape  alone has no effect. It indicates a future intention of inserting media into the terminal. the terminal will EXPECT a grid of WxH "replace characters" to follow,
              with each sequence of such replace characters bebung with a ib escape command and ending with an ie escape command.

                the FULL-PATH-OR-URL for all  the i commands (is,
                ic, if, it) may be of the form:

                  /full/path/to/file.png

                OR

                  /full/path/to/link0full/path/to/file.png

                  where a newline character separates a URI for a link and
                    a full path to a file to display in the region. the link
                    is the destination URI when a user may click on the given
                    media image.

                  example:

                    printf("\ 33}is#5;3;%s 00"
                           "\ 33}ib#####\ 33}ie\0
                           "\ 33}ib#####\ 33}ie\0
                           "\ 33}ib#####\ 33}ie\0, "/tmp/icon.png");

                  note that # is the replace character, and later # chars if inside begin/end escapes, will be replaced by the given media indicated in the insert media escape.

              ic[CW;H;FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                insert CENTERED media (centered in cell area). Otherwise
                  parameters are identical to the is command, but
                  retains aspect and is padded by blank space.

              if[CW;H;FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                insert FILLED media (fill in cell area). Otherwise parameters
                  are identical to the is command but ensures the entire
                  area is filled like a background even if media goes beyond
                  cell bounds and is clipped.

              it[CW;H;FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                insert THUMB media (thumbnail cell area). Otherwise parameters
                  are identical to the is command, but uses thumbnail
                  generation to make a fast to load but low resolution version
                  (cached) of the media.

              it[CW;H;LINK\nFULL-PATH-OR-URL]
                  insert THUMB media with link (thumbnail cell area). Otherwise parameters
                  are identical to the is command, but uses thumbnail generation to
                  make a fast to load but low resolution version (cached) of the media.
                  LINK is a path (or url) to open _when_ the thumb is clicked on by the
                  user.

              ij[CW;H;FULL-PATH\nGROUP][\n][cmd1][\r\n][cmd2]...
                  insert EDJE object with file path given, and the group name given.
                  The command list (and the \n whitespace delimiter before the list)
                  is optional, but is executed/parsed before display of the actual
                  object to do things like initialize its initial state. See `iC`
                  command for more details on the command list.

                  Be aware that once you have an object with an assigned channel id,
                  it can send back signals and messages via escapes on stdin. These
                  escapes will follow terminology extended escape format
                  (ESC + } ...  00), and the content will be one of:

                    ;CHID\ndrag\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
                    ;CHID\ndrag,start\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
                    ;CHID\ndrag,stop\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
                    ;CHID\ndrag,step\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
                    ;CHID\drag,set\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2

              iC[CHID]\n[cmd1][\r\n][cmd2][\r\n][cmd3]...
                  send a COMMAND (cmd1, cmd2, cmd3 etc.) to an existing named
                  channel id CHID. this can be a list of 1 or more command strings,
                  with each string broken by a continuous sequence of 1 or more \r
                  and/or \n characters. e.g. "\n", "\r", "\r\n",
                  "\n\r", "\n\r\n\n\n", etc.

                  commands understood are:

                    text\nPART NAME\nTEXT STRING
                      set the text of "PART NAME" to string "TEXT STRING"

                    emit\nSIGNAL STRING\nSOURCE STRING
                      emit signal "SIGNAL STRING" "SOURCE STRING"

                    drag\nPART NAME\n[value|size|step|page]\nVAL1\nVAL2
                      manipulate dragable of name "PART NAME" and either set
                      "value", "size", "step" or "page" properties
                      to "VAL1" and "VAL2" for x and y, where
                      VAL1 and VAL2 are floating point values

                    chid\nCHANNEL ID
                      set the channel id of a given edje object (only valid in setup
                      commands for the inline edje object) to "CHANNEL ID" so it can
                      be addressed later.

                    message\nOPCODE ID\n[string|int|float|string_set|int_set|...
                    float_set|string|int|string_float|string_int_set|...
                    string_float_set]\n[message data]
                      send a message with opcode (integer) id "OPCODE ID" of one of
                      the given types supported ("string", "int", "float",
                      etc.) and then with the given "message data" at the end.
                      message data format depends on message type:
                      string:           STRING1
                      int:              INT1
                      float:            FLOAT1
                      string_set:       STRING1\nSTRING2\nSTRING3...
                      int_set:          INT1\nINT2\nINT3...
                      float_set:        FLOAT1\nFLOAT2\nFLOAT3...
                      string_int:       STRING1\nINT1
                      string_float:     STRING1\nFLOAT1
                      string_int_set:   STRING1\nINT1\nINT2\nINT3...
                      string_float_set: STRING1\nFLOAT1\nFLOAT2\nFLOAT3...

              ib
                begin media replace sequence run.

              ie
                end media replace sequence run.

              fr[PATH/FILE]
                begin file send for a file named PATH / FILE

              fs[SIZE_BYTES]
                set the size in bytes of a file send started with the above fr escape

              fd[CHECKSUM DATA]
                block of data for the current file transfer with checksum as a
                string decimal which is the sum of every byte when taken as an
                unsigned char per byte. the checksum is a signed 32bit integer.
                the checksum is the sum of the data after escaping. 4 bits at a
                time per data byte, encoded with high bits in one byte then low
                bits, with the bits encoded as 4 bit value being 0x40 + 4 bit value
                per byte. (@ == 0x0, A == 0x1, B == 0x2, ... N == 0xe, O == 0xf).
                so to rebuild a byte will be (((bytes[0] - 0x40) & 0xf) << 4) |
                ((bytes[1] - 0x40) & 0xf) per byte pair in the data block.

              fx
                exit file send mode (normally at the end of the file or when it's
                complete)
