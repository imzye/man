NAME
       Ukwm - Clutter based compositing GTK2 Window Manager

SYNOPSIS
       ukwm [--display=DISPLAY] [--replace] [--sm-client-id=ID] [--sm-disable] [--sm-save-file=FILENAME] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly ukwm.

       ukwm is a minimal X window manager aimed at nontechnical users and is designed to integrate well with the GNOME desktop.  ukwm lacks some features that may be expected by traditional UNIX or other
       technical users; these users may want to investigate other available window managers for use with GNOME or standalone.

OPTIONS
       --display=DISPLAY
              Connect to X display DISPLAY.

       --replace
              a window manager which is running is replaced by ukwm.  Users are encouraged to change the GNOME window manager by running the new WM with the --replace or -replace option, and subsequently
              saving the session.

       --sm-client-id=ID
              Specify a session management ID.

       --sm-disable
              Disable the session management.

       --sm-save-file=FILENAME
              Load a session from FILENAME.

       --version
              Print the version number.

       -?, --help
              Show summary of options.

CONFIGURATION
       ukwm configuration can be found under Preferences->Windows and Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts on the menu-panel. Advanced configuration can be achieved directly through gsettings.
