NAME
       unbound-streamtcp - unbound DNS lookup utility

SYNOPSIS
       unbound-streamtcp [-unsh] [-f ipaddr[@port]] name type class

DESCRIPTION
       unbound-streamtcp sends a DNS Query of the given type and class for the given name to the DNS server over TCP and displays the response.

       If the server to query is not given using the -f option then localhost (127.0.0.1) is used. More queries can be given on one commandline, they are resolved in sequence.

       The available options are:

       name   This name is resolved (looked up in the DNS).

       type   Specify the type of data to lookup.

       class  Specify the class to lookup for.

       -u     Use UDP instead of TCP. No retries are attempted.

       -n     Do not wait for the answer.

       -s     Use SSL.

       -h     Print program usage.

       -f ipaddr[@port]
              Specify the server to send the queries to. If not specified localhost (127.0.0.1) is used.
