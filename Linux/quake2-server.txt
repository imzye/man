NAME
       quake2-server - classic first person shooter (dedicated server)

SYNOPSIS
       quake2-server [WRAPPER-OPTIONS] [ENGINE-OPTIONS] [ENGINE-COMMANDS]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the quake2-server command.

       Quake II is a popular first-person shooter game, released in 1997 by iD Software.  This wrapper script will launch the Quake II engine.  The game data needs to be installed independently using the
       'game-data-packager' program, and by default it will be looked for at /usr/share/games/quake2 and /usr/share/games/quake2-demo.

       This wrapper script accepts a few GNU-style options.  Any further arguments are passed to the engine unmodified.  Consult the engine documentation for full details, but most engines support a syn‐
       tax where you can give console commands by prefixing with a plus sign.

       In addition to any arguments on the command line, the quake2-server script automatically passes the arguments "+set dedicated 1" to the engine.

OPTIONS
       These options are accepted for WRAPPER-OPTIONS in the synopsis.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       --engine=ENGINE
              Select a non-default Quake II engine binary

       --demo Use the demo data, even if you have both the demo and the full version installed

EXAMPLES
       Run a server to play the demo in cooperative mode: quake2-server --demo +map demo1 +set coop 1

       Run a deathmatch server:
              quake2-server +map q2dm1 +set deathmatch 1

       Use the default server configuration in /etc/quake2-server/debian_server.cfg:
              quake2-server +exec debian_server.cfg
