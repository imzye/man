NAME
       rubiks_cubex - fast non-optimal solver for 3x3x3 Rubik's cube

SYNOPSIS
       rubiks_cubex

       rubiks_cubex <cube-layout>[<center-rotations>]

       rubiks_cubex random[-centers]

DESCRIPTION
       Solves a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube.

OPTIONS
       (none) prints help screen with complete examples

       random randomly scrambles a cube then generate a solution

       random-centers
              randomly scrambles a cube then generate a solution, but will also fix center rotations

       <cube-layout>
              a  54-character  string,  representing each facelet on the cube, going from face to face in this order: top, left, front, right, back, bottom, with a number (1 through 6), in the order: left to
              right, top to bottom (as you're looking at each face)

       <center-rotations>
              an OPTIONAL 6-character addition to the string, representing the rotation of each center, with a number (0 through 3), in this order: top, left, front, right, back, bottom, in which  the  rota‐
              tions  are like so: 0, 1, 2, 3, which mean (respectively): center is rotated correctly, center is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, center is rotated 180 degrees, center is rotated 90 degrees coun‐
              terclockwise.
