NAME
       dictfmt_index2word  -  Creates a .word index file from a DICTD database
       .index file

SYNOPSIS
       dictfmt_index2word [OPTIONS] [index_file]

DESCRIPTION
       dictfmt_index2word creates a word index file on stdout  for  the  index
       file  given  on  stdin  or the command line.  A word index file indexes
       each subword from the multi-word headwords of the .index file,  to  the
       underlying  .dict  file.   A  word  index  file is usually named <base‐
       name>.word, but this is not mandatory as long as  the  proper  name  is
       used in the dictd configuration file.

OPTIONS
       --help displays a usage message and exits

       --locale locale
              use  locale  for sorting the .word file. If this option is omit‐
              ted, the default locale "C" is used.

       index_file
              the .index file to be converted.
