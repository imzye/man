NAME
       Config::MVP::Reader::INI - an MVP config reader for .ini files

VERSION
       version 2.101465

DESCRIPTION
       Config::MVP::Reader::INI reads .ini files containing MVP-style configuration.

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That
       is, if the most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
