NAME
       cgpt - Utility to manipulate GPT partitions with Chromium OS extensions

SYNOPSIS
       cgpt COMMAND [OPTIONS] DRIVE

DESCRIPTION
       Cgpt  is a tool to manipulate a GUID Partition Table from the command line. Although several other utilities exist for the same basic purpose - some with more features and a captive user interface
       - cgpt is unique in that it also supports Chromium OS extensions. These extensions are not generally useful; they are specific to the u-boot firmware found on some Chromebooks. They may be used to
       change priority for kernel partitions and give other hints to u-boot Chromebook firmware. Use this utility only to manipulate a partition table for compatible Chromebooks.

COMMANDS
       Each action performed by this program - with the notable exception of the -h OPTION - is initiated by a command which tells cgpt the type of operation to perform. All available  commands  are  de‐
       scribed below.

       create Create or reset GPT headers and tables.

       add    Add, edit, or remove a partition entry.

       show   Show the partition table and entries.

       repair Repair damaged GPT headers and tables.

       boot   Edit the PMBR sector for legacy BIOSes.

              If no BOOT OPTIONS are specified, this command will just print the PMBR boot GUID.

       find   Find a partition by its GUID.

              If no DRIVE is specified, this command will scan all physical drives for a match.

       prioritize
              Reorder the priority of all ChromeOS kernel partitions.

              If no options are specified, this command will set the lowest active kernel to priority 1 while maintaining the original order.

       legacy Switch between GPT and Legacy GPT.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       The options described in this section apply to every COMMAND supported by this program.

       -h     For more detailed usage, use cgpt COMMAND -h

EXAMPLES
       The following examples demonstrate valid syntax only. It is up to you to interpret them based on the documentation in this manual.

       cgpt show /dev/mmcblk0

       cgpt add -i 1 -t data -l "STATE" /dev/mmcblk0
       cgpt add -i 2 -t kernel -l "KERN-A" /dev/mmcblk0
       cgpt add -i 3 -t rootfs -l "ROOT-A" /dev/mmcblk0
