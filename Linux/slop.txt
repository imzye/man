NAME
       slop - select operation

SYNOPSIS
       slop [-klqn] [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       slop  is  an application that queries for a selection from the user and prints the region to stdout. It grabs the mouse and turns it into a crosshair, lets the user click and drag to make a selec‐
       tion (or click on a window) while drawing a pretty box around it, then finally prints the selection's dimensions to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       -v, --version
              Print version and exit.

       -x, --xdisplay=hostname:number.screen_number
              Sets the xdisplay to use.

       -b, --bordersize=FLOAT
              Sets the selection rectangle's thickness.

       -p, --padding=FLOAT
              Sets the padding size for the selection, this can be negative.

       -t, --tolerance=FLOAT
              How far in pixels the mouse can move after clicking, and still be detected as a normal click instead of a click-and-drag. Setting this to 0 will  disable  window  selections.  Alternatively
              setting it to 9999999 would force a window selection.

       -c, --color=FLOAT,FLOAT,FLOAT,FLOAT
              Sets the selection rectangle's color. Supports RGB or RGBA input. Depending on the system's window manager/OpenGL support, the opacity may be ignored.

       -r, --shader=STRING
              This sets the vertex shader, and fragment shader combo to use when drawing the final framebuffer to the screen. This obviously only works when OpenGL is enabled. The shaders are loaded from
              ~/.config/slop. See https://github.com/naelstrof/slop for more information on how to create your own shaders.

       -f, --format=STRING
              Sets  the  output  format  for  slop.  Format  specifiers  are  %x  (x  offset),  %y  (y  offset),  %w (width), %h (height), %i (window id), %c (1 if cancelled, 0 otherwise), %g (geometry -
              `%wx%h+%x+%y'), and %% for a literal percent sign.

       -n, --nodecorations=INT
              Sets the level of aggressiveness when trying to remove window decorations. `0' is off, `1' will try lightly to remove decorations, and `2' will recursively descend into the root tree  until
              it gets the deepest available visible child under the mouse. Defaults to `0'. Supplying slop with just `-n` is equivalent to supplying `-n1`.

       -l, --highlight
              Instead of outlining a selection, slop will highlight it instead. This is particularly useful if the color is set to an opacity lower than 1.

       -D, --nodrag
              Allows you to click twice to indicate a selection, rather than click-dragging.

       -q, --quiet
              Disable any unnecessary cerr output. Any warnings simply won't print.

       -k, --nokeyboard
              Disables the ability to cancel selections with the keyboard.

       -o, --noopengl
              Disables graphics acceleration. Might be useful if you get rendering bugs.

EXAMPLES
       To emulate a windows XP selection, you can use something like this:

              slop --highlight --tolerance=0 --color=0.3,0.4,0.6,0.4

       In order to avoid using eval(1) in your scripts (pretty big security issue), you can use slop like this instead:

              read -r X Y W H G ID < <(slop -f "%x %y %w %h %g %i")
