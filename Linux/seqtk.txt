NAME
       seqtk - sampling, trimming, fastq2fasta, subsequence, reverse complement

SYNOPSIS
       seqtk <command> <arguments>

DESCRIPTION
       Currently,  seqtk  supports  quality  based  trimming with the phred algorithm, converting fastq to fasta, reverse complementing sequences, extracting or masking subsequences in regions given in a
       BED/name list file, and more.  It contains a subsampling module to sample exactly n sequences or a fraction of sequences.

       Seqtk supports both fasta and fastq input files, which can be optionally gzip compressed.

COMMANDS
       Command: seq       common transformation of FASTA/Q

       comp   get the nucleotide composition of FASTA/Q

       sample subsample sequences

       subseq extract subsequences from FASTA/Q

       trimfq trim FASTQ using the Phred algorithm

       hety   regional heterozygosity

       mutfa  point mutate FASTA at specified positions

       mergefa
              merge two FASTA/Q files

       randbase
              choose a random base from hets

       cutN   cut sequence at long N

       listhet
              extract the position of each het
