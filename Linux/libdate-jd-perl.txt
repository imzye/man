DESCRIPTION
       For date and time calculations it is convenient to represent dates by a simple linear count of days, rather than in a particular calendar.  This is such a good idea that it has been invented
       several times.  If there were a single such linear count then it would be the obvious data interchange format between calendar modules.  With several versions, calendar modules can use such
       sensible data formats and still have interoperability problems.  This module tackles that problem, by performing conversions between different flavours of day count.  These day count systems are
       generically known as "Julian Dates", after the most venerable of them.

       Among Julian Date systems there are also some non-trivial differences of concept.  There are systems that count only complete days, and those that count fractional days also.  There are some that
       are fixed to Universal Time (time on the prime meridian), and others that are interpreted according to a timezone.  Some consider the day to start at noon and others at midnight, which is
       semantically significant for the complete-day counts.  The functions of this module appropriately handle the semantics of all the non-trivial conversions.

       The day count systems supported by this module are Julian Date, Reduced Julian Date, Modified Julian Date, Dublin Julian Date, Truncated Julian Date, Chronological Julian Date, Rata Die, and
       Lilian Date, each in both integral and fractional forms.

   Flavours of day count
       In the interests of orthogonality, all flavours of day count come in both integral and fractional varieties.  Generally, there is a quantity named "XYZD" ("XYZ Date") which is a real count of days
       since a particular epoch (an integer plus a fraction) and a corresponding quantity named "XYZDN" ("XYZ Day Number") which is a count of complete days since the same epoch.  XYZDN is the integral
       part of XYZD.  There is also a quantity named "XYZDF" ("XYZ Day Fraction") which is a count of fractional days since the XYZDN changed (whether that is noon or midnight).  XYZDF is the fractional
       part of XYZD, in the range [0, 1).

       This quantity naming pattern is derived from JD (Julian Date) and JDN (Julian Day Number) which have the described correspondence.  Most of the other flavours of day count listed below
       conventionally come in only one of the two varieties.  The "XYZDF" name type is a neologism.

       All calendar dates given are in ISO 8601 form (Gregorian calendar with astronomical year numbering).  An hour number is appended to each date, separated by a "T"; hour 00 is midnight at the start
       of the day and hour 12 is noon in the middle of the day.  An appended "Z" indicates that the date is to be interpreted in Universal Time (the timezone of the prime meridian), and so is absolute;
       where any other timezone is to be used then this is explicitly noted.

       JD (Julian Date)
           days  elapsed  since  -4713-11-24T12Z.  This epoch is the most recent coincidence of the first year of the Metonic cycle, indiction cycle, and day-of-week cycle, using the Julian calendar.  It
           was correspondingly named after the Julian calendar, and thus after Julius Caesar.  Some information can be found at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day>.

       RJD (Reduced Julian Date)
           days elapsed since 1858-11-16T12Z (JD 2400000.0).  Rarely used.

       MJD (Modified Julian Date)
           days elapsed since 1858-11-17T00Z (JD 2400000.5).  This was introduced by the Smithsonian Astrophysical  Observatory  in  1957,  and  is  recommended  for  general  use  by  the  International
           Astronomical Union and other authorities.

       DJD (Dublin Julian Date)
           days  elapsed since 1899-12-31T12Z (JD 2415020.0).  This was invented by the International Astronomical Union, and the epoch in Terrestrial Time is the J1900.0 epoch used in astronomy.  (Note:
           not B1900.0, which is a few hours later.)  It is rarely used.

       TJD (Truncated Julian Date)
           days elapsed since 1968-05-24T00Z (JD 2440000.5).  This is primarily used by NASA, who devised it during the Apollo era.  There is a rumour that it's defined cyclically,  as  (JD  -  0.5)  mod
           10000, but see <http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/batse/hilev/TJD.TABLE>.

       CJD (Chronological Julian Date)
           days  elapsed since -4713-11-24T00 in the timezone of interest.  CJD = JD + 0.5 + Zoff, where Zoff is the timezone offset in fractional days.  This was devised by Peter Meyer, and described in
           <http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/cjd.htm>.

       RD (Rata Die)
           days elapsed since 0000-12-31T00 in the timezone of interest (CJD 1721425.0).  This is defined in the book Calendrical Calculations.  Confusingly, in the book the integral form is also  called
           "RD".   The  integral form is called "RDN" by this module to avoid confusion, reserving the name "RD" for the fractional form.  (The book is best treated with caution due to the embarrassingly
           large number of errors and instances of muddled thinking.)

       LD (Lilian Date)
           days elapsed since 1582-10-14T00 in the timezone of interest (CJD 2299160.0).  This epoch is the day before the day that the Gregorian calendar first went into use.  It is named after Aloysius
           Lilius, the inventor of the Gregorian calendar.

       The interesting differences between these flavours are whether the day starts at noon or at midnight, and whether they are absolute or timezone-relative.  Three of the four combinations  of  these
       features exist.  There is no convention for counting days from timezone-relative noon that the author of this module is aware of.

       For more background on these day count systems, <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Date> is a good starting place.

   Meaning of the day
       A day count has meaning only in the context of a particular definition of "day".  There are two main flavours of day to consider: solar and conventional.

       A  solar day is based on the apparent motion of Sol in the Terran sky (and thus on the rotation and orbit of Terra).  The rotation of Terra is not constant in time, so this type of day is really a
       measure of angle, not of time.  This is how days have been counted since antiquity, and is still (as of 2006) the basis of civil time.  There are two subtypes of solar day: apparent and mean.  The
       apparent solar day is based on the actual observable position of Sol in the sky from day to day, whereas the mean solar day smooths this motion out, in time, over the course of the year.   At  the
       sub-second level there are different types of smoothing that can be used (UT1, UT2, et al).

       A  conventional  day is any type of day that is not based on Terran rotation.  The astronomical Ephemeris Time, a time scale based on the motion of bodies in the Solar system, has a time unit that
       it calls "day" which is derived from astronomical observations.  The modern relativistic coordinate time scales such as TT have a notional "day" of exactly 86400 SI seconds.  The atomic time scale
       TAI also has a "day" which is as close to 86400 SI seconds as can be achieved.  All of these "days" are roughly the duration of one Sol-relative rotation  of  Terra  during  the  early  nineteenth
       century, but are not otherwise related to planetary rotation.

       Each  of the day count scales handled by this module can be used with any of these types of day.  For a day number to be meaningful it is necessary to be aware of which kind of day it is counting.
       Conversion between the different types of day is out of scope for this module.  (See Time::UTC for TAI/UTC conversion.)

FUNCTIONS
       Day counts in this API may be native Perl numbers or "Math::BigRat" objects.  Both are acceptable for all parameters, in any combination.  In all conversion functions, the result is  of  the  same
       type  as  the  input,  provided that the inputs are of consistent type.  If native Perl numbers are supplied then the conversion is subject to floating point rounding, and possible overflow if the
       numbers are extremely large.  The use of "Math::BigRat" is recommended to avoid these problems.  With "Math::BigRat" the results are exact.

       There are conversion functions between all pairs of day count systems.  This is a total of 512 conversion functions (including 32 identity functions).

       When converting between timezone-relative counts (CJD, RD, LD) and absolute counts (JD, RJD, MJD, DJD, TJD), the timezone that is being used must be specified.  It is given in a ZONE argument as a
       fractional number of days offset from Universal Time.  For example, US Central Standard Time, 6 hours behind UT, would be specified as a ZONE argument of -0.25.  Beware of floating point  rounding
       when  the  offset  does  not  have  a  terminating  binary  representation  (e.g., US Eastern Standard Time at -5/24); use of "Math::BigRat" avoids this problem.  A ZONE parameter is not used when
       converting between absolute day counts (e.g., between JD and MJD) or between timezone-relative counts (e.g., between CJD and LD).

           flavour.  The function returns the same point in time, represented as a continuous day count of output flavour.

           number of output flavour that applies at that instant.  The process throws away information about the time of (output-flavour) day.

           These functions convert from a continuous day count to an integral day count with separate fraction.  The input identifies a point in time, as a continuous day count  of  input  flavour.   The
           function returns a list of two items: the day number and fractional day of output flavour, which together identify the same point in time as the input.

           These  functions  convert  from  a  continuous  day  count  to an integral day count, possibly with separate fraction.  The input identifies a point in time, as a continuous day count of input
           flavour.  If called in scalar context, the function returns the day number of output flavour that applies at that instant, throwing away information about the time of (output-flavour) day.  If
           called in list context, the function returns a list of two items: the day number and fractional day of output flavour, which together identify the same point in time as the input.

           These functions are not recommended, because the context-sensitive return convention makes their use error-prone.  They are retained for backward compatibility.  You should prefer to  use  the
           more specific functions shown above.

           These  functions convert from an integral day count with separate fraction to a continuous day count.  The input identifies a point in time, as an integral day number of input flavour plus day
           fraction in the range [0, 1).  The function returns the same point in time, represented as a continuous day count of output flavour.

           These functions convert from an integral day count with separate fraction to an integral day count.  The input identifies a point in time, as an integral day number of input flavour  plus  day
           fraction  in the range [0, 1).  The function returns the day number of output flavour that applies at that instant.  The process throws away information about the time of (output-flavour) day.
           If converting between systems that delimit days identically (e.g., between JD and RJD), the day fraction makes no difference and may be omitted from the input.

           These  functions  convert from an integral day count with separate fraction to an integral day count, possibly with separate fraction.  The input identifies a point in time, as an integral day
           number of input flavour plus day fraction in the range [0, 1).  If called in scalar context, the function returns the day number of output flavour that applies at that instant,  throwing  away
           information  about  the  time of (output-flavour) day.  If called in list context, the function returns a list of two items: the day number and fractional day of output flavour, which together
           identify the same point in time as the input.

           If converting between systems that delimit days identically (e.g., between JD and RJD), the day fraction makes no difference to the integral day number of the output, and may be  omitted  from
           the input.  If the day fraction is extracted from the output when it wasn't supplied as input, it will default to zero.

           These  functions  are not recommended, because the context-sensitive return convention makes their use error-prone.  They are retained for backward compatibility.  You should prefer to use the
           more specific functions shown above.
