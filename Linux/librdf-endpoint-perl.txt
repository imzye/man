NAME
       RDF::Endpoint - A SPARQL Protocol Endpoint implementation

VERSION
       This document describes RDF::Endpoint version 0.11.

SYNOPSIS
        plackup /usr/local/bin/endpoint.psgi

DESCRIPTION
       This modules implements the SPARQL Protocol for RDF using the PSGI interface provided by Plack. It may be run with any Plack handler.  See Plack::Handler for more details.

       When this module is used to create a SPARQL endpoint, configuration variables are loaded using Config::ZOMG. An example configuration file rdf_endpoint.json is included with this package. Valid
       top-level configuration keys include:

       store
           This  is  used  to  define the underlying RDF::Trine::Store for the endpoint.  It can be a hashref of the type that can be passed to RDF::Trine::Store->new_with_config, but a simple string can
           also be used.

       endpoint
           A hash of endpoint-specific configuration variables. Valid keys for this hash include:

           update  A boolean value indicating whether Update operations should be allowed to be executed by the endpoint.

           load_data
                   A boolean value indicating whether the endpoint should use URLs that appear in FROM and FROM NAMED clauses to construct a SPARQL dataset by  dereferencing  the  URLs  and  loading  the
                   retrieved RDF content.

           service_description
                   An  associative  array (hash) containing details on which and how much information to include in the service description provided by the endpoint if no query is included for execution.
                   The boolean values 'default' and 'named_graphs' indicate that the respective SPARQL dataset graphs should be described by the service description.

           html    An associative array (hash) containing details on how results should be serialized when the output media type is HTML. The boolean value 'resource_links' specifies whether  URI  values
                   should  be  serialized  as  HTML  anchors  (links).   The boolean value 'embed_images' specifies whether URI values that are typed as foaf:Image should be serialized as HTML images. If
                   'embed_images' is true, the integer value 'image_width' specifies the image width to be used in the HTML markup (letting the image height scale appropriately).

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS
   Using Plack::Handler::Apache2
       Using Plack::Handler::Apache2, mod_perl2 can be configured to serve and endpoint using the following configuration:

         <Location /sparql>
           SetHandler perl-script
           PerlResponseHandler Plack::Handler::Apache2
           PerlSetVar psgi_app /path/to/endpoint.psgi
           PerlSetEnv RDF_ENDPOINT_CONFIG /path/to/rdf_endpoint.json
         </Location>

       To get syntax highlighting and other pretty features, in the VirtualHost section of your server, add three aliases:

         Alias /js/ /path/to/share/www/js/
         Alias /favicon.ico /path/to/share/www/favicon.ico
         Alias /css/ /path/to/share/www/css/

       The exact location can be determined by finding where the file "sparql_form.js".

METHODS
       "new ( \%conf )"
       "new ( $model, \%conf )"
           Returns a new Endpoint object. "\%conf" should be a HASH reference with configuration settings.

       "run ( $req )"
           Handles the request specified by the supplied Plack::Request object, returning an appropriate Plack::Response object.

       "run_tag"
           Returns a unique key for each instantiation of this service.

       "service_description ( $request, $model )"
           Returns a new RDF::Trine::Model object containing a service description of this endpoint, generating dataset statistics from $model.
