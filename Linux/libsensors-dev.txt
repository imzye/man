DESCRIPTION
       sensors_init()  loads  the configuration file and the detected chips list. If this returns a value unequal to zero, you are in trouble; you can not assume anything will be initialized properly. If
       you want to reload the configuration file, or load a different configuration file, call sensors_cleanup() below before calling sensors_init() again. This means you can't load  multiple  configura‐
       tion files at once by calling sensors_init() multiple times.

       The configuration file format is described in sensors.conf(5).

       If FILE is NULL, the default configuration files are used (see the FILES section below). Most applications will want to do that.

       sensors_cleanup() cleans everything up: you can't access anything after this, until the next sensors_init() call!

       libsensors_version is a string representing the version of libsensors.

       sensors_parse_chip_name() parses a chip name to the internal representation. Return 0 on success, <0 on error. Make sure to call sensors_free_chip_name() when you're done with the data.

       sensors_free_chip_name() frees the memory that may have been allocated for the internal representation of a chip name. You only have to call this for chip names which do not originate from libsen‐
       sors itself (that is, chip names which were generated by sensors_parse_chip_name()).

       sensors_snprintf_chip_name()  prints  a  chip  name from its internal representation. Note that chip should not contain wildcard values! Return the number of characters printed on success (same as
       snprintf), <0 on error.

       sensors_get_adapter_name() returns the adapter name of a bus type, number pair, as used within the sensors_chip_name structure. If it could not be found, it returns NULL.

       Adapters describe how a monitoring chip is hooked up to the system.  This is particularly relevant for I2C/SMBus sensor chips (bus type "i2c"), which must be accessed over an I2C/SMBus controller.
       Each such controller has a different number, assigned by the system at initialization time, so that they can be referenced individually.

       Super-I/O or CPU-embedded sensors, on the other hand, can be accessed directly and technically don't use any adapter. They have only a bus type but no bus  number,  and  sensors_get_adapter_name()
       will return a generic adapter name for them.

       sensors_get_detected_chips()  returns  all  detected chips that match a given chip name, one by one. If no chip name is provided, all detected chips are returned.  To start at the beginning of the
       list, use 0 for nr; NULL is returned if we are at the end of the list. Do not try to change these chip names, as they point to internal structures!

       sensors_get_features() returns all main features of a specific chip. nr is an internally used variable. Set it to zero to start at the begin of the list. If no more features are found NULL is  re‐
       turned.  Do not try to change the returned structure; you will corrupt internal data structures.

       sensors_get_all_subfeatures() returns all subfeatures of a given main feature. nr is an internally used variable. Set it to zero to start at the begin of the list. If no more subfeatures are found
       NULL is returned.  Do not try to change the returned structure; you will corrupt internal data structures.

       sensors_get_subfeature()  returns  the  subfeature of the given type for a given main feature, if it exists, NULL otherwise.  Do not try to change the returned structure; you will corrupt internal
       data structures.

       sensors_get_label() looks up the label which belongs to this chip. Note that chip should not contain wildcard values! The returned string is newly allocated (free it yourself). On failure, NULL is
       returned.  If no label exists for this feature, its name is returned itself.

       sensors_get_value() Reads the value of a subfeature of a certain chip. Note that chip should not contain wildcard values! This function will return 0 on success, and <0 on failure.

       sensors_set_value() sets the value of a subfeature of a certain chip. Note that chip should not contain wildcard values! This function will return 0 on success, and <0 on failure.

       sensors_do_chip_sets() executes all set statements for this particular chip. The chip may contain wildcards!  This function will return 0 on success, and <0 on failure.

       sensors_strerror() returns a pointer to a string which describes the error.  errnum may be negative (the corresponding positive error is returned).  You may not modify the result!

       sensors_parse_error() and sensors_parse_error_wfn() are functions which are called when a parse error is detected. Give them new values, and your own functions are called instead  of  the  default
       (which print to stderr). These functions may terminate the program, but they usually output an error and return. The first function is the original one, the second one was added later when support
       for  multiple  configuration  files was added.  The library code now only calls the second function. However, for backwards compatibility, if an application provides a custom handling function for
       the first function but not the second, then all parse errors will be reported using the first function (that is, the filename is never reported.)  Note that filename can be NULL (if filename isn't
       known) and lineno can be 0 (if the error occurs before the actual parsing starts.)

       sensors_fatal_error() Is a function which is called when an immediately fatal error (like no memory left) is detected. Give it a new value, and your own function is called instead of  the  default
       (which prints to stderr and ends the program). Never let it return!

DATA STRUCTURES
       Structure sensors_chip_name contains information related to a specific chip.

       typedef struct sensors_chip_name {
            sensors_bus_id bus;
       } sensors_chip_name;

       There are other members not documented here, which are only meant for libsensors internal use.

       Structure sensors_feature contains information related to a given feature of a specific chip:

       typedef struct sensors_feature {
            const char *name;
            int number;
            sensors_feature_type type;
       } sensors_feature;

       There are other members not documented here, which are only meant for libsensors internal use.

       Structure sensors_subfeature contains information related to a given subfeature of a specific chip feature:

       typedef struct sensors_subfeature {
            const char *name;
            int number;
            sensors_subfeature_type type;
            int mapping;
            unsigned int flags;
       } sensors_subfeature;

       The  flags  field  is a bitfield, its value is a combination of SENSORS_MODE_R (readable), SENSORS_MODE_W (writable) and SENSORS_COMPUTE_MAPPING (affected by the computation rules of the main fea‐
       ture).

FILES
       /etc/sensors3.conf
       /etc/sensors.conf
              The system-wide libsensors(3) configuration file. /etc/sensors3.conf is tried first, and if it doesn't exist, /etc/sensors.conf is used instead.

       /etc/sensors.d
              A directory where you can put additional libsensors configuration files.  Files found in this directory will be processed in alphabetical order after the default configuration  file.  Files
              with names that start with a dot are ignored.
