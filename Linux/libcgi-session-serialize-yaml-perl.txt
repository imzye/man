NAME
       CGI::Session::Serialize::yaml - serializer for CGI::Session

DESCRIPTION
       This library can be used by CGI::Session to serialize session data. It uses "YAML", or the faster C implementation, "YAML::Syck" if it is available. YAML serializers exist not just for Perl but
       also other dynamic languages, such as PHP, Python, and Ruby, so storing session data in this format makes it easy to share session data across different languages.

       YAML is made to be friendly for humans to parse as well as other computer languages. It creates a format that is easier to read than the default serializer.

METHODS
       freeze($class, \%hash)
           Receives  two  arguments.  First  is  the  class  name, the second is the data to be serialized. Should return serialized string on success, undef on failure. Error message should be set using
           "set_error()|CGI::Session::ErrorHandler/"set_error()""

       thaw($class, $string)
           Received two arguments. First is the class name, second is the "YAML" data string. Should return thawed data structure on  success,  undef  on  failure.  Error  message  should  be  set  using
           "set_error()|CGI::Session::ErrorHandler/"set_error()""
