NAME
       URI::cpan - URLs that refer to things on the CPAN

VERSION
       version 1.009

SYNOPSIS
         use URI::cpan;

         my $uri = URI->new('cpan:///distfile/RJBS/URI-cpan-1.000.tar.gz');

         $uri->author;       # => RJBS
         $uri->dist_name;    # => URI-cpan
         $uri->dist_version; # => 1.000

       Other forms of cpan: URI include:

         cpan:///author/RJBS

       Reserved for likely future use are:

         cpan:///dist
         cpan:///module
         cpan:///package

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

WARNINGS
       URI objects are difficult to subclass, so I have not (yet?) taken the time to remove mutability from the objects.  This means that you can probably alter a URI::cpan object into a state where it
       is no longer valid.

       Please don't change the contents of these objects after construction.

       This code is derived from code written at Pobox.com by Hans Dieter Pearcey.  Dieter helped thrash out this new implementation, too.
