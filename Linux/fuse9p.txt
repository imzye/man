NAME
       fuse9p - filesystem client for 9p2000.u servers

SYNOPSIS
       mounting
            fuse9p  [-dPv]  [-c  mode] [-k file] [-l user] [-p port] [-t secs]
       [-U uid_map] [-G gid_map] [user@]server[:port] mountpoint

       unmounting
            fusermount -u mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       9p2000 is a file/RPC protocol developed for  Plan9  operationg  system.
       Due  to  its extreme simplicity it can be used to embed file servers in
       different applications to provide access to the internal structures and
       API in runtime. 9p filesystem can be mounted as well with the kernel FS
       implementation, but the kernel v9fs module does not support client  au‐
       thentication. Exporting a read/write filesystem without any authentica‐
       tion is a serious issue. So, if you want to export FS with  authentica‐
       tion  enabled,  you  have  to  use a client that supports it, like this
       fuse9p implementation.

       Another difference from the kernel v9fs  is  a  protocol  optimizations
       that allow fuse9p to work faster, avoiding unnecessary request.

OPTIONS
       -c mode
            Authentication mode. Now only pki mode is supported by fuse9p.

       -d
            Turn  on  debug  and  run in foreground. Please note, that in this
       mode you can not stop fuse9p with Ctrl-C, you should use fusermount -u.

       -G gid_map
           Turn on gid mapping (see UID/GID MAPPING below)

       -k file
            Path to the private RSA key file. Implies -c pki.

       -l user
            User name to use in FS Tattach command.

       -p port
            Server TCP port, if it differs from the default 9p.

       -P
           Stay connected even in the case of network errors

       -t secs
           Timeout (in seconds) for the 9p socket. By default it  is  10  sec‐
       onds.

       -G gid_map
           Turn on gid mapping (see UID/GID MAPPING below)

       -v
           Print py9p version

LIMITATIONS
       Current fuse9p implementation does not support:

        * named pipes
        * UNIX sockets
        * hard linking

       Any  other  functionality can be limited; if so, report an issue to the
       project's bugtracker.

AUTHENTICATION
       pki mode

       PKI authentication mode uses standard SSH RSA keys. The  server  should
       have  the  public  one, the client should use the corresponding private
       key. If the private key file location is  not  set  up  by  -k  option,
       fuse9p  tries to load it from /home/${user}/.ssh/id_rsa. If the user is
       not set up by -l option or in the server spec, fuse9p uses $USER  envi‐
       ronment variable.

RECONNECTION
       Being  started with -P option, fuse9p tries to reconnect to the server,
       if the connection is lost. When there is no connection,  in  this  mode
       fuse9p  provides  empty  mount point. All operations on open files will
       return EIO or ENOENT.

       fuse9p reconnect interval increases with each iteration,  it  grows  by
       power  of  2:  2, 4, 8, 16 etc. seconds up to the some limit. Each file
       stat() or directory listing call resets the interval back to 2 seconds.

       Since the reconnection is running asynchronously,  you  can  get  empty
       mount point even if the server became reachable; if so, just repeat the
       directory listing call.

UID/GID MAPPING
       Often, uids/gids on the server and client side are not the  same.  This
       feature  allows you to map server's uids/gids into client's ones in the
       way like this:

           ... -U "{1000: 500, 1001: 505}" -G "{1000: 500}" ...

       Please note, that server's uid/gid goes first.
