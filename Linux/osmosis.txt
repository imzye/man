NAME
       osmosis - command line OpenStreetMap data processor

SYNOPSIS

       osmosis [--command command parameters ...] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the osmosis command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       osmosis is a command line Java application for processing OSM data. The tool consists of pluggable components that can be chained to perform a larger operation. For example, it has components for
       reading/writing databases and files, deriving/applying changes to data sources, and sorting data, (etc.). It has been written to easily add new features without re-writing common tasks such as
       file and database handling.

       Some examples of the things it can currently do are:

       •   Generate planet dumps from a database

       •   Load planet dumps into a database

       •   Produce change sets using database history tables

       •   Apply change sets to a local database

       •   Compare two planet dump files and produce a change set

       •   Re-sort the data contained in planet dump files

       •   Extract data inside a bounding box or polygon

OPTIONS
       The commands and arguments accepted by osmosis are described in details and shown in examples in the page https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis and its subpages.

BUGS
       The upstreams BTS can be found at https://trac.openstreetmap.org/query?component=osmosis. Bugs are also discussed on upstream mailing list, at https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/osmosis-dev.
