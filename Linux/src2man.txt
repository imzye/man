NAME
       src2man - extract man pages from source files.

SYNOPSIS
       src2man [-n][-d date][-v volume][-r release] [srcfile ...]

DESCRIPTION
       src2man scans source file srcfile. Only C source files are supported for now. Comments blocks starting by "/** num", where num is a section number, are converted into a man file, using txt2man(1).

       The  first  line of the comment block must contain the name of the manpage, usually the function name, followed by a "-" and a short description. The following lines are the "DESCRIPTION" section con‐
       tent, except if they are in upper case, in which case they define a new section.

       If the next line after a comment block is empty, Then no "SYNOPSIS" section will be generated. Otherwise, src2man will look in the following source lines for a function prototype or  a  type  definion
       (struct, union, typedef, ...) matching the manpage name, and include it in a "SYNOPSIS" section. This avoids to duplicate the type or function prototype in the comment block.

       The  best place for code documentation is in the source file, where the body is implemented, not the header file which only contains the prototype. src2man automatically searches for the presence of a
       prototype in the corresponding header file, and if found, will print a "#include" statement in the synopsis.

OPTIONS
       -d date
              Set the date of the man pages. Defaults to current date.

       -n     No man page is created. The name of the manpages that would be created are printed.

       -v volume
              Specify the name of the volume to be printed in center header of generated manpages.

       -r release
              Specify the project name and release number for the generated manpage.

ENVIRONMENT
       SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
              Unix timestamp that is used for date in header instead of current date.

EXAMPLE
       The following example displays C code and comments to generate a manpage foobar.3:

   /** 3
       ·  foobar - a sample dummy function

       ·  This line is now the first of the description section.

       ·  Note that function parameters parm1 and parm2 are highlighted

       ·  in the generated man page.

   */
       int foobar(char *parm1, int parm2)

   {
   ...
       return 0;

   }
