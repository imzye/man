NAME
       compute_halfspaces - use half-spaces to represent a tropical cone

DESCRIPTION
       Computes a minimal representation of a tropical cone given by a generating set, by means of half-spaces.

ARGUMENTS
       -numerical-data
              Set the type of numerical data used by the algorithm, one of: ocaml_int, ocaml_float, ocaml_big_int, ocaml_big_rat, zarith_int, and zarith_rat.

       -min-plus
              Use the min-plus semiring instead of the default max-plus semiring.

       -no-ordering
              The constraints are not dynamically ordered during the execution.
