NAME
       qmgr - pbs batch system manager

SYNOPSIS
       qmgr [-a] [-c command] [-e] [-n] [-z] [server...]

DESCRIPTION
       The qmgr command provides an administrator interface to the batch system.

       The command reads directives from standard input.  The syntax of each directive is checked and the appropriate request is sent to the batch server or servers.

       The  list or print subcommands of qmgr can be executed by general users.  Creating or deleting a queue requries PBS Manager privilege.  Setting or unsetting server or queue attributes requires PBS Op‐
       erator or Manager privilege.

OPTIONS
       -a          Abort qmgr on any syntax errors or any requests rejected by a server.

       -c command  Execute a single command and exit qmgr .

       -e          Echo all commands to standard output.

       -n          No commands are executed, syntax checking only is performed.

       -z          No errors are written to standard error.

OPERANDS
       The server operands identify the name of the batch server to which the administrator requests are sent.  Each server conforms to the following syntax:
           host_name[:port]
       where host_name is the network name of the host on which the server is running and port is the port number to which to connect.  If port is not specified, the default port number is used.

       If server is not specified, the administrator requests are sent to the local server.

STANDARD INPUT
       The qmgr command reads standard input for directives until end of file is reached, or the exit or quit directive is read.

STANDARD OUTPUT
       If Standard Output is connected to a terminal, a command prompt will be written to standard output when qmgr is ready to read a directive.

       If the -e option is specified, qmgr will echo the directives read from standard input to standard output.

STANDARD ERROR
       If the -z option is not specified, the qmgr command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       If qmgr is invoked without the -c option and standard output is connected to a terminal, qmgr will write a prompt to standard output and read a directive from standard input.

       Commands can be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form.  A command is terminated by a new line character or a semicolon, ";", character.  Multiple commands may be entered on a single  line.   A
       command may extend across lines by escaping the new line character with a back-slash "\".

       Comments begin with the # character and continue to end of the line.  Comments and blank lines are ignored by qmgr.

DIRECTIVE SYNTAX
       A qmgr directive is one of the following forms:

       command server [names] [attr OP value[,attr OP value,...]]
       command queue [names] [attr OP value[,attr OP value,...]]
       command node [names] [attr OP value[,attr OP value,...]]

       Where,

       command   is the command to perform on a object.  Commands are:

                 active    sets the active objects.  If the active objects are specified, and the name is not given in a qmgr cmd the active object names will be used.

                 create    is to create a new object, applies to queues and nodes.

                 delete    is to destroy an existing object, applies to queues and nodes.

                 set       is to define or alter attribute values of the object.

                 unset     is to clear the value of attributes of the object.  Note, this form does not accept an OP and value, only the attribute name.

                 list      is to list the current attributes and associated values of the object.

                 print     is to print all the queue and server attributes in a format that will be usable as input to the qmgr command.

       names     is a list of one or more names of specific objects The name list is in the form:
                   [name][@server][,queue_name[@server]...]
                 with  no  intervening  white space.  The name of an object is declared when the object is first created.  If the name is @server, then all the objects of specified type at the server will be
                 effected.

       attr      specifies the name of an attribute of the object which is to be set or modified.  If the attribute is one which consist of a set of resources, then the attribute is specified in the form:
                   attribute_name.resource_name

       OP        operation to be performed with the attribute and its value:

                 =      set the value of the attribute.  If the attribute has a existing value, the current value is replaced with the new value.

                 +=     increase the current value of the attribute by the amount in the new value.

                 -=     decrease the current value of the attribute by the amount in the new value.

       value     the value to assign to an attribute.  If the value includes white space, commas or other special characters, such as the # character, the value string must be inclosed in quote marks (").

       The following are examples of qmgr directives:

       create queue fast priority=10,queue_type=e,enabled = true,max_running=0
       set queue fast max_running +=2
       create queue little
       set queue little resources_max.mem=8mw,resources_max.cput=10
       unset queue fast max_running
       set node state = down,offline
       active server s1,s2,s3
       list queue @server1
       set queue max_running = 10    - uses active queues

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qmgr command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qmgr command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
