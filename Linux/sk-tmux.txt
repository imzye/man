NAME
       sk-tmux - open sk in tmux split pane

SYNOPSIS
       sk-tmux [-u|-d [HEIGHT[%]]] [-l|-r [WIDTH[%]]] [--] [sk OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       sk-tmux is a wrapper script for sk that opens sk in a tmux split pane. It is designed to work just like sk except that it does not take up the whole screen. You can safely use sk-tmux instead of sk in
       your scripts as the extra options will be silently ignored if you're not on tmux.
