NAME
       xonix - a game

SYNOPSIS
       xonix [ -toolkitoption ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The xonix application consists of a playing area and a status display below.

       The status display shows the current values for level, filled area (in percent), number of players (lifes), and elapsed time.

       The playing area has several regions.  The brown region (initially only the border) is ``filled region'', where the player can move, starting from the top left corner.  Beware of the bouncing yel‐
       low eater(s) that do also move across filled regions however, if they hit the player, a life will go away.  The flyers can only bounce across the green (so-called empty) area in the middle.

       The  purpose  of  the game is to move the player across the empty region (whereby it leaves his way in a brown color to show where it came along), and finally cut off a piece of unfilled region by
       moving him back to some filled region.  If the player itself or the (unfilled yet) way will be hit by a flyer, a life will be lost again.  Once the player's way reached another part of filled  re‐
       gion,  the  way  and all adjacent unfilled regions where there is no flyer in will be filled in turn.  One level has completed as soon as 75 % of the originally unfilled area have been filled this
       way.

       Every level, there will be one flyer more.  Every second level, an additional player will be granted.  Every fifth level, an additional eater will be fired off.

       The default keys to move the player around are the arrow keys.  This can be changed in the app-defaults file, however, as well as the timeout between single steps (defaulting to  50  ms  equal  20
       moves per second).

       The default keys to immediately quit the game are `Q' and `Escape'.  Hitting `P' or iconizing the window with the window manager will pause the game; de-iconizing will continue it.

       There  is  also  a  high-score  file, /var/cache/xonix/xonix.scores.  It records the top ten xonix players for that machine.  As a special compile-time option, a mail is sent to the previous xonix
       score leader when he's lost his first rank.

WIDGETS
       Xonix uses the X Toolkit and the Athena Widget Set.  Below is the widget structure of the xonix application.  Indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is  given  first,
       followed by the widget instance name.

OPTIONS
       All the standard toolkit options apply.  It's not particularly useful to attempt forcing any geometry however.

AUTHORS
       The original xonix game has been seen somewhere on an old PC/XT clone.  This is a reimplementation from scratch, done by Torsten Schoenitz starting the project on a Macintosh.  The X11 support has
       been written by Joerg Wunsch with the pleasant help by Alfredo Herrera Hernandez.

BUGS
       Source code comments are still mostly in German.  Some files require the unusual tab width of 4 in order to be displayed correctly.

       It should be possible to pass some parameters from the command line as well (e.g. the time step value), which is currently only possible by the back-door via the -xrm toolkit option.

       Mail any suggestions to <joerg_wunsch@uriah.heep.sax.de>.
