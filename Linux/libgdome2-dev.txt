SYNOPSIS
       gdome-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--libs] [--cflags] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       gdome-config is a tool that is used to determine the compile and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use gdome2.

OPTIONS
       gdome-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of gdome2 on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a gdome2 program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a gdome2 program.

       --prefix=DIR
               If  specified,  use  DIR instead of the installation prefix that gdome2 was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.
               This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=DIR
               If specified, use DIR instead of the installation exec prefix that gdome2 was built when computing the output for the --cflags  and  --libs  options.
               This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --help  Print a short help text and exit.
