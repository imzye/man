NAME
       coils-wrap - runs ncoils three times to give you a three-window output

SYNOPSIS
       coils-wrap [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       coils-wrap runs ncoils three times to give you a three-window output.

       ncoils is a program that compares a sequence to a database of known parallel two-stranded coiled-coils and derives a similarity score. By comparing this score to the distribution of scores in globular
       and coiled-coil proteins, the program then calculates the probability that the sequence will adopt a coiled-coil conformation.

OPTIONS
       -i  input file in FASTA format

       -o  output file

       -r  raw output file, default: `<output file>_raw'

       -m  matrix type; set matrix (MTK or MTIDK)

       -w  weight a&d = b,c,e,f&g (boolean)

EXAMPLES
       "coils-wrap -m MTIDK -i /usr/share/doc/ncoils/1srya.fa -o /tmp/coils.out -r /tmp/coils_raw.txt && less /tmp/coils.out /tmp/coils_raw.txt"

       "ncoils -win 14 < /usr/share/doc/ncoils/1srya.fa"

FILES
       /usr/share/coiledcoils/*.mat
           matrix data files
