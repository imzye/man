SGE_QMASTER(8)                                                                      Grid Engine Administrative Commands                                                                      SGE_QMASTER(8)

NAME
       sge_qmaster - Grid Engine master control daemon

SYNOPSIS
       sge_qmaster [ -help ]

DESCRIPTION
       sge_qmaster controls the overall Grid Engine behavior in a cluster.

OPTIONS
       -help  Prints  a listing of all options.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard configuration files.

       SGE_CELL       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell sge_qmaster uses (in order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. default.

       SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be written to stderr. In addition, the level of detail in which debug information is generated is defined by the defined value.

       SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                      If set, the qmaster will not daemonize.

       SGE_QMASTER_PORT
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which sge_qmaster(8) is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most installations will use a services map entry for the service "sge_qmas‐
                      ter" instead to define that port.

       SGE_EXECD_PORT If  set, specifies the tcp port on which sge_execd(8) is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most installations will use a services map entry for the service "sge_execd"
                      instead to define that port.

       SGE_TEST_DELAY_SCHEDULING
                      If set, specifies a delay in (integral seconds) before a scheduling run, for test purposes.

       SGE_ND         If set, don't daemonize the program (for debugging).

       SGE_ENABLE_COREDUMP
                      If set, enable core dumps on Linux when the admin_user is not root.  Linux normally disables core dumps when the daemon has changed  uid  or  gid.   Setting  SGE_ENABLE_COREDUMP  in
                      sge_qmaster's  environment defeats that to enable core dumps for debugging if they are otherwise allowed.  This is typically not a big hazard with SGE, since most information is ex‐
                      posed in the spool area anyhow.  Dumps will appear in the host spool directory.
                      On Solaris, coreadm(1) may be used to enable such dumps.

       SGE_QMASTER_PIDFILE
                      Path name of file to which to write the daemon process id at startup (default "qmaster.pid").  Note that this must be writable by the admin user (see bootstrap(5)).

RESTRICTIONS
       sge_qmaster is usually started from root on the master or shadow master machines of the cluster.  If started by a normal user, a master  spool  directory  must  be  used  to  which  the  user  has
       read/write access. In this case only jobs being submitted by that same user are handled correctly by the system.

FILES

                       Grid Engine global configuration
