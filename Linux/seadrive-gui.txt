       Seafile is a file syncing and sharing software with file encryption and group sharing, emphasis on reliability and high performance.

       Seafile  is  an open source cloud storage system with privacy protection and teamwork features. Collections of files are called libraries. Each library can be synced separately. A library can also
       be encrypted with a user chosen password. Seafile also allows users to create groups and easily sharing files into groups.

              Don't launch seadrive daemon (you are supposed to launch it yourself). This is for speeding up the development cycles because starting the seadrive daemon and wait for it  to  be  ready  is
              very slow.

                                                                                                                                                                                            seadrive-gui(1)
