NAME
       unmunge - MUNGE credential decoder

SYNOPSIS
       unmunge [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       The  unmunge program validates a MUNGE credential (e.g., one created by
       the munge program).

       By default, the credential is read from stdin and the metadata and pay‐
       load  are written to stdout.  When the metadata and payload are written
       to the same stream, they are separated by a blank line.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display a summary of the command-line options.

       -L, --license
              Display license information.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

       -i, --input file
              Input the credential from the specified file.

       -n, --no-output
              Discard all output.

       -m, --metadata file
              Output metadata to the specified file.

       -o, --output file
              Output the payload to the specified file.

       -k, --keys string
              Specify a subset of metadata keys to output.  The keys are case-
              insensitive  and delimited by whitespace, commas, semicolons, or
              periods -- as long as the string is treated as a single argument
              by  the  shell  (e.g.,  enclosed by quotes).  If a subset is not
              specified, all available keys are selected by default.

       -K, --list-keys
              Display a list of metadata keys.

       -S, --socket path
              Specify the local domain socket for connecting with munged.

METADATA KEYS
       The following metadata keys are supported.

       STATUS The status of the credential decode operation.

       ENCODE_HOST
              The address of the host on which the credential was encoded.

       ENCODE_TIME
              The time at which the credential was encoded (according  to  the
              local clock of the host that encoded it).

       DECODE_TIME
              The  time  at which the credential was decoded (according to the
              local clock of the host that decoded it).

       TTL    The time-to-live value (in seconds) placed  within  the  creden‐
              tial.

       CIPHER The cipher type used to encode the credential.

       MAC    The MAC type used to encode the credential.

       ZIP    The compression type used to encode the credential.

       UID    The user ID of the process that encoded the credential.

       GID    The group ID of the process that encoded the credential.

       UID_RESTRICTION
              The user ID restriction placed within the credential.

       GID_RESTRICTION
              The group ID restriction placed within the credential.

       LENGTH The length (in bytes) of the payload.

EXIT STATUS
       The  unmunge  program  returns an exit code corresponding to the return
       code of munge_decode().  On success, it returns a zero exit code  which
       signifies  the  credential is valid.  On error, it prints an error mes‐
       sage to stderr and returns a non-zero exit code.
