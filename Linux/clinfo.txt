NAME
       clinfo - show OpenCL platforms and devices

SYNOPSIS
       clinfo [options ...]

DESCRIPTION
       clinfo prints all available information about all OpenCL platforms available on the system and the devices they expose.

OPTIONS
       clinfo accepts the following options:

       -a, --all-props
         try  to retrieve all properties, even those not officially supported (e.g. because they require specific extensions), but only show them if the property could be retrieved successfully; see also
         the LIMITATIONS section below; note that even though this may reveal hidden properties, there is no guarantee that the returned values are meaningful, nor that the corresponding feature is actu‐
         ally available at all;

       -A, --always-all-props
         like -a, but also show errors;

       --human
         produce human-friendly output; this is the default (except as noted below);

       --raw
         produce machine-friendly output; this is the default if clinfo is invoked with a name that contains the string “raw”;

       --json
         outputs the raw data (cf. the --raw option) in JSON format; support for this option is experimental, as the representation of some of the values is not finalized;

       --offline
         shows also offline devices for platforms that expose this feature;

       --null-platform
         tries to handle the NULL platform as a normal platform, retrieving and showing its properties and devices; this is in addition to the NULL platform behavior tests done at the  end,  and  can  be
         useful on systems where there are no ICD platforms, but there is a platform hard-coded in the OpenCL library itself;

       -l, --list
         list platforms and devices by name, with no (other) properties;

       -d platform_index:device_index
       --device platform_index:device_index
         only show properties for the specified device in the specified platform; multiple device specifications may be given on the command-line;

       --prop property-name
         only show properties whose symbolic name matches (contains as a substring) the given property-name; the name is normalized as upper-case and with minus sign (-) replaced by underscore signs (_);
         multiple property specifications may be given on the command-line; when this flag is specified, raw mode is forced;

       --help, -?, -h
         show usage;

       --version, -v
         show program version.

NOTES
       Some information is duplicated when available from multiple sources.  Examples:

       • supported device partition types and domains as obtained using the cl_ext_device_fission extension typically match the ones obtained using the core OpenCL 1.2 device partition feature;

       • the preferred work-group size multiple matches the NVIDIA warp size (on NVIDIA devices) or the AMD wavefront width (on AMD devices).

       Some floating-point configuration flags may only be meaningful for specific precisions and/or specific OpenCL versions. For example, CL_FP_CORRECTLY_ROUNDED_DIVIDE_SQRT is only relevant for single
       precision in OpenCL 1.2 devices.

       The implementation-defined behavior for NULL platform or context properties is tested for the following API calls:

       clGetPlatformInfo()
         by trying to show the platform name;

       clGetDeviceIDs()
         by trying to enumerate devices; the corresponding platform (if any) is then detected by querying the device platform of the first device;

       clCreateteContext()
         by trying to create a context from a device from the previous list (if any), and a context from a device from a different platform;

       clCreateteContextFromType()
         by trying to create contexts for each device type (except DEFAULT).

EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
       Support for OpenCL 2.x properties is not fully tested.

       Support for cl_khr_subgroup_named_barrier is experimental due to missing definitions in the official OpenCL headers.

       Raw (machine-parsable) output is considered experimental, the output format might still undergo changes.

       The properties of the ICD loader will also be queried if the clGetICDLoaderInfoOCLICD extension function is found.

       Support for the properties exposed by cl_amd_copy_buffer_p2p is experimental.

       Support for some (documented and undocumented) properties exposed by cl_amd_device_attribute_query is experimental (see also LIMITATIONS).

       Support for the interop lists exposed by cl_intel_simultaneous_sharing is experimental.

       The highest OpenCL version supported by the ICD loader is detected with some trivial heuristics (symbols found); a notice is output if this is lower than the highest platform OpenCL version, or if
       the detected version doesn't match the one declared by the ICD loader itself.

LIMITATIONS
       OpenCL did not provide an explicit mean to detect the supported version of any extension exposed by a device until version 3.0. This makes it impossible in many circumstances to determine a priori
       if it will be possible to successfully query a device about a specific property even if it declares support for a given extension.  Additionally, the actual size and meaning of some properties are
       not officially declared anywhere.

       Most  notably,  this  affects extensions such as cl_amd_device_attribute_query, cl_nv_device_attribute_query and cl_arm_core_id.  Heuristics based on standard version support are partially used in
       the code to determine which version may be supported.

       Properties which are known to be affected by these limitations include:

       CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_FREE_MEMORY_AMD
         documented in v3 of the cl_amd_device_attribute_query extension specification as being the global free memory in KBytes, without any explanation given on why there are two  values,  although  in
         the source code of the ROCm stack the second value is documented as being the largest free block;

       CL_DEVICE_AVAILABLE_ASYNC_QUEUES_AMD
         documented  in  v3 of the cl_amd_device_attribute_query extension specification, but not reported by drivers supporting other v3 properties. This has now been enabled for drivers assumed to sup‐
         port v4 of the same extension;

       CL_DEVICE_TERMINATE_CAPABILITY_KHR
         exposed by the cl_khr_terminate_context has changed value between OpenCL 1.x and 2.x, and it's allegedly a bitfield, whose values are however not defined anywhere.

BUGS
   General
       Please report any issues on the project tracker on GitHub.

   LLVM CommandLine errors
       If multiple OpenCL platforms using shared LLVM libraries are present in the system, clinfo (and other OpenCL application) may crash with errors to the tune of

              : CommandLine Error: Option '(some option name)' registered more than once!
              LLVM ERROR: inconsistency in registered CommandLine options

       or similar. This is not an issue in clinfo, or in any OpenCL platform or application, but it is due to the way LLVM handles its own command-line options parsing.  The issue has been  reported  up‐
       stream as issue #30587.  See the next point for possible workarounds and assistance in identifying the conflicting platforms.

   Segmentation faults
       Faulty OpenCL platforms may cause segmentation faults in clinfo during the information gathering phase, sometimes even before any output is shown. There is very little clinfo can do to avoid this.
       If  you  see  this happening, try disabling all platforms and then re-enabling them one by one until you experience the crash again.  Chances are the last platform you enabled is defective in some
       way (either by being incompatible with other platforms or by missing necessary components and not handling their absence gracefully).

       To selectively enable/disable platforms, one way is to move or rename the *.icd files present in /etc/OpenCL/vendors/ and then restoring them one by  one.  When  using  the  free-software  ocl-icd
       OpenCL  library, a similar effect can be achieved by setting the OPENCL_VENDOR_PATH or OCL_ICD_VENDORS environment variables, as documented in libOpenCL(7).  Other implementations of libOpenCL are
       known to support OPENCL_VENDOR_PATH too.

       Example
         find /etc/OpenCL/vendors/ -name '*.icd' | while read OPENCL_VENDOR_PATH ; do clinfo -l > /dev/null ; echo "$? ${OPENCL_VENDOR_PATH}" ; done

       This one liner will run clinfo -l for each platform individually (hiding the normal output), and report the .icd path prefixed by 0 for successful runs, and a non-zero value for faulty platforms.
