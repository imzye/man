NAME
       botch-calcportsmetric - calculate source package importance

SYNOPSIS
       botch-calcportsmetric [options] strongsrcgraph.xml closuresrcgraph.xml

DESCRIPTION
       Calculate a metric for source package importance based on how many source packages (minimum and maximum) become compilable in a bootstrapping scenario through the compilability of a given source
       package.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           show this help message and exit

       --online
           Retrieve popcon results for source packages

       -v, --verbose
           print additional information

EXAMPLE
       Calculate source package importance:

        zcat packages_amd64.gz | grep-dctrl -FArchitecture all > available
        botch-create_graph --deb-native-arch=amd64 --available=available --strongtype packages sources > strongbuildgraph.xml
        botch-buildgraph2srcgraph --deb-native-arch=amd64 strongbuildgraph.xml packages sources > strongsrcgraph.xml
        botch-create_graph --deb-native-arch=amd64 --available=available --closuretype packages sources > closurebuildgraph.xml
        botch-buildgraph2srcgraph --deb-native-arch=amd64 closurebuildgraph.xml packages sources > closuresrcgraph.xml
        botch-calcportsmetric --online strongsrcgraph.xml closuresrcgraph.xml > importance_metric_noall.txt
