NAME
       enscribe — convert images to sound

SYNOPSIS
       enscribe [options]  [input image]  [output sound]

DESCRIPTION
       enscribe  converts  the  scan-lines of the input image into frequency components  and then using an inverse Fast Fourier Transform, converts them into sound. The  left side of the image is the low
       frequency end, and the right is the high end,  up to just under the Nyquist limit if you want it to. There are several tunable parameters as to how colour is converted into stereo  sound  and  the
       frequency  range to be used. This conversion can be used to create resilient audio  watermarks or to simply create interesting sounds from images.

SEE ALSO
       See enscribe --help for descriptions of the command line options.

BUGS
       This manual page should be expanded to contain descriptions of the command-line options.
