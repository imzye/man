NAME
       shpdump - dumps as text and/or validates the content of an ESRI shapefile

SYNOPSIS
       shpdump [-validate] shp_file

DESCRIPTION
       Prints the contents of the shapefile shp_file to standard output in textual format. Shapefiles actually consist of two files with the same basename and extensions .shp and .shx (or .SHP and .SHX) con‐
       taining the shape data and shape index respectively. The files to open are determined by first stripping any filename extension  from  shp_file  and  attempting  to  open  the  files  shp_file.shp  or
       shp_file.SHP, and shp_file.shx or shp_file.SHX for the respective data and index files.

       Output consists of a header giving number and type of shapes in the file and the bounds for the minimum and maximum X, Y, Z, and M values appearing in the shapes. The header is followed by the geomet‐
       ric data for each shape in the file. All shapes in the file should be of the same type, except that NullShape typed shapes may be intermixed with any other type. The header has the form

           Shapefile Type: type # of Shapes: count

           File Bounds: (minX,minY,minZ,minM)
                    to  (maxX,maxY,maxZ,maxM)

       See section SHAPE TYPES below for the list of possible shape types.

       Next for each shape in the file a header giving it´s shape_index, it´s type type, number of vertices nVertices, number of parts nParts, and bounding box is given, followed by the vertex data  of  each
       part.

           Shape:  shape_index (type) nVertices=nVertices, nParts=nParts
             Bounds: (minX,minY,minZ,minM)
                 to  (maxX,maxY,maxZ,maxM)

             vertices of the first part

           + vertices of the second part...

           + vertices of the last part

       The shape_index of a shape is the number of the shape starting from zero in the shape file. Each vertex has the form

           (X,Y,Z,M)

       If there are multiple parts then the type of the part is appended appended to first vertex of each part, and the first vertex of the second and following parts is preceded by a plus (+) sign. The part
       type is Ring for all shape types except MultiPatch where it is the type of a surface patch. See below for the description of possible part types.

SHAPE TYPES
       Each type of shape except MultiPatch typed shapes comes in three flavours: The normal unsuffixed type, where points lie in X/Y-space; a type with suffix M where points lie in X/Y-space  and  addition‐
       ally have a measure value in M-space; and finally a type with suffix Z where points lie in X/Y/Z-space and also have a measure value in M-space.

       NullShape
              A shape without data. Shapes of this type may be intermixed with other shapes and are sometimes used to represented deleted or missing geometric data for a shape.

       Point or PointZ or PointM
              A single point.

       Arc or ArcZ or ArcM
              Piecewise linear paths. Shapes of this type may consist of multiple parts which may or may not intersect and/or connect. Arcs are called PolyLines in the shapefile specification.

       Polygon or PolygonZ or PolygonM
              Polygon  shapes  consist of one or more parts, called rings, that each define a closed path. Rings must contain at least four vertices with the first and last vertices being equal, and must not
              self-intersect. For shapes of type Polygon, the rings define a polygon with optional holes by giving the vertices of inner rings a counterclockwise orientation and the vertices of outer rings a
              clockwise orientation. Intersection and orientation is always computed in X/Y-space and never in X/Y/M-space.

       MultiPoint or MultiPointZ or MultiPointM
              A set of points.

       MultiPatch
              A  MultiPatch represents one or more surfaces in X/Y/Z-space, and consists of a number of parts called it´s surface patches. Each surface patch describes a either a surface or a hole in another
              surface, depending on the type of the patch. Patches may share a common boundary but may not otherwise intersect. The type of a patch may be one of

              TriangleStrip: A set of connected triangles. The first three points define the first triangle and every following point defines a new triangle using the new point and the two previous points.

              TriangleFan: A set of connected triangles. The first three points define the first triangle and every following point defines a new triangle using the previous point, the current point, and the
              first point, thus forming a fan of triangles around the first point.

              OuterRing:  The  outer ring of a sequence of rings defining a polygon with holes. All following parts of type InnerRing are taken to be the holes of the polygon. The sequence of rings ends with
              the first non-InnerRing typed part or the part of the shape, whichever comes first.

              InnerRing: An inner ring in a sequence of rings defining a polygon with holes. This type of part may only follow an OuterRing or other InnerRing typed parts.

              FirstRing: The first in a sequence of rings defining a polygon of unspecified type. The following parts of type Ring defines the other rings in the polygon. This type of part is used  when  the
              innerness  or outerness of a polygon isn´t known or applicable. The sequence of rings defining the polygon ends with the first non-Ring typed part or the last part of the shape, whichever comes
              first.

              Ring: A ring in a sequence of rings defining a polygon of unspecified type. It may only follow a FirstRing or other Ring typed parts.

              UknownPartType: This type is returned for parts whose type isn´t recognised.

       UnknownShapeType
              This type is returned for shapes whose type isn´t recognised.

OPTIONS
       -validate
              count the number of objects that have invalid ring ordenings

              Performs validation on the orientation of inner and outer rings in Polygon, PolygonZ, and PolygonM objects. According to the shapefile specification outer rings should be given a clockwise ori‐
              entation,  and  inner  rings that define holes a counterclockwise orientation. If some rings of a shape are oriented the wrong way around then the following message is output after dumping that
              shape:

              count rings wound in the wrong direction.

              In addition the total number of shapes with problem rings is output after the last shape has been dumped:

              count object has invalid ring orderings.

       shp_file
              the name of an existing shapefile.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      No shapefile shp_file was given or it couldn´t be opened.

AUTHOR
       shpdump is part of shapelib, maintained by Frank Warmerdam. This guide was created by Eduardo Patoo Kanegae and converted to manpage by Johan Van de Wauw. It was further enhanced  with  the  man  page

BUGS
       The  -validate  option supports only one outer ring in a polygonal shape and assumes that the first ring in a shape is the outer ring. It doesn´t support polygons inside MultiPatch shapes. The X and Y
       coordinates of a point are printed to three decimal places only.
