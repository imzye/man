NAME
       sdr-zmq-daemon - ZeroMQ daemon for Software Defined Radios (SDRs)

SYNOPSIS
       sdr-zmq-daemon

DESCRIPTION
       Simply  start  with  no  options.  It will connect to your software defined radio, and start providing IQ data over ZeroMQ on address tcp://127.0.0.1:10444 and provide a configuration interface on
       tcp://127.0.0.1:10445.  It is intended to be used together with grdab (Using the 'grdab -z' option).

       All SDRs supported by gr-osmosdr can be used with sdr-zmq-daemon. It has been verified to work with RTL-SDR, HackRF and USRP B200.

       It is not a 'true daemon' yet, so you will have to use 'screen' or similar to get it to hide in the background.

OPTIONS
       No options available
