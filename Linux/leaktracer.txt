NAME
       LeakTracer - a memory-usage debugger for C++ programs

SYNOPSIS
       LeakCheck program [ program arguments ... ]

       leak-analyze program [ leak.out ] [ main ] [ program arguments ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the LeakCheck and leak-analyze commands.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the HTML format; see below.

       LeakCheck is a small script that executes a C++ program while logging informations about calls to new and delete into a leak.out file.

       leak-analyze gives a human-readable report of the contents of a leak.out file, by calling gdb(1) to display the faulty lines.

OPTIONS
       These programs accept no special options.  For an explanation of the possible arguments to leak-analyze, see the full documentation.

SEE ALSO
       The official documentation in /usr/share/doc/leaktracer/README.*, available both in HTML and plain text.
