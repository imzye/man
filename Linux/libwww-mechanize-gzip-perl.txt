NAME
       WWW::Mechanize::GZip - tries to fetch webpages with gzip-compression

VERSION
       Version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
           use WWW::Mechanize::GZip;

           my $mech = WWW::Mechanize::GZip->new();
           my $response = $mech->get( $url );

           print "x-content-length (before unzip) = ", $response->header('x-content-length');
           print "content-length (after unzip) = ", $response->header('content-length');

DESCRIPTION
       The WWW::Mechanize::GZip module tries to fetch a URL by requesting gzip-compression from the webserver.

       If the response contains a header with 'Content-Encoding: gzip', it decompresses the response in order to get the original (uncompressed) content.

       This module will help to reduce bandwidth fetching webpages, if supported by the webeserver. If the webserver does not support gzip-compression, no decompression will be made.

       This modules is a direct subclass of WWW::Mechanize and will therefore support any methods provided by WWW::Mechanize.

       The decompression is handled by Compress::Zlib::memGunzip.

   METHODS
       prepare_request
         Adds 'Accept-Encoding' => 'gzip' to outgoing HTTP-headers before sending.

       send_request
         Unzips response-body if 'content-encoding' is 'gzip' and corrects 'content-length' to unzipped content-length.
