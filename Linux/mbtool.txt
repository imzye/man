MBTOOL(8)                         Cyrus IMAP                         MBTOOL(8)

NAME
       mbtool - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       intro

SYNOPSIS
       mbtool [ -C config-file ] -r mailbox...
       mbtool [ -C config-file ] -t mailbox...

DESCRIPTION
       mbtool  is  a  tool  for performing various actions on the indexes of a
       list of mailboxes. The only actions currently supported are  -t,  which
       will  normalize the internaldate time stamp of each record in the index
       to GMT, and -r which will create a new unique ID for each mailbox.

       Only one action may be given and at least mailbox must be listed.

       It is intended that mbtool will be extended over time to  perform  more
       such actions.

       mbtool  reads  its  configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file
       unless specified otherwise by -C.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -t     Normalize  internaldate on all index records of all listed mail‐
              boxes to match the Date: header if they're off by  more  than  a
              day,  which  can  be used to fix up a mailbox which has been re‐
              stored from backup and lost its internaldate information.

       -r     Create a new unique ID for all listed mailboxes.

EXAMPLES
       mbtool -r user.jsmith
          Create new UUID for mailbox user.jsmith.

       mbtool -t user.jsmith
          Normalize internaldate on all index records in user.jsmith.
