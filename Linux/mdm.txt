NAME
       mdm-run - run a command in parallel with mdm-master

SYNOPSIS
       mdm-run command
       mdm-sync command

DESCRIPTION
       mdm-run  annotates command as a candidate for parallel execution.  If an mdm-master process is present (i.e., the environment variable MDM_CMD_SOCK is defined), mdm-run submits command to the mdm-
       master, and it exits when the master issues the command to an mdm-slave process (which may be connected to another terminal) for execution.  mdm-sync runs command in place, but it coordinates with
       mdm-master to ensure that executing command does not interfere with commands that are currently executing in parallel.

       If there is no mdm-master process present (i.e., the environment variable MDM_CMD_SOCK is not defined), both mdm-run and mdm-sync simply run command as if you entered command all by itself.

       These programs are a part of the Middleman System (mdm).

OPTIONS
       Neither mdm-run nor mdm-sync accepts any options.

EXIT STATUS
       If there is no mdm-master process present, the exit status of mdm-run is the exit status of command.  If an mdm-master process is present, the exit status is 0 if and only if command  is  success‐
       fully issued to an mdm-slave process for execution.

       The exit status of mdm-sync is always the exit status of command.

ENVIRONMENT
       The mdm system uses the following environment variable for internal communication, and thus you should not try to set them yourself.

       MDM_CMD_SOCK
              mdm-run uses this environment variable to decide whether a mdm-master process is present.

EXAMPLE
       See mdm.screen(1) for an example use of mdm-run.
