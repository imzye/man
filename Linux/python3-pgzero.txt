NAME
       pgzrun - Run games written in Pygame Zero.

SYNOPSIS
       pgzrun [ gamefile ] [ arguments ]

DESCRIPTION
       pgzrun runs a game written in Pygame Zero

       Pygame Zero provides an environment in which new programmers can write games with Zero boilerplate.

       It is possible to write Pygame Zero games such that they can be run directly with python3, however doing so requires two lines of boilerplate, "import pgzrun" at the start and "pgzrun.go()" at the
       end. To meet the goal of zero boilerplate a launcher is needed.
