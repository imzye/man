SURICATA-OINKMASTER-UPDATER(8)                                         System Manager's Manual                                        SURICATA-OINKMASTER-UPDATER(8)

NAME
       suricata-oinkmaster-updater - Run oinkmaster to update suricata ruleset

SYNOPSIS
       suricata-oinkmaster-updater

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the suricata-oinkmaster-updater command.

       suricata-oinkmaster-updater is a shell script that runs oinkmaster(1) to update suricata(8) ruleset.  The intention is to hook the call to this script from a
       daily cron job, so suricata(8) rulesets are automagically updated every day.

HOW IT WORKS
       The default Debian configuration will run oinkmaster(1) with the config file /etc/suricata/suricata-oinkmaster.conf which is pre-configured to  download  the
       EmergingThreats open ruleset for suricata(8).

       When the download is completed, suricatasc(1) will be called to instruct suricata(8) to reload the ruleset.

CONFIGURATION
       By now, the only way to modify the behaviour of suricata-oinkmaster-updater is to modify the /etc/suricata/suricata-oinkmaster.conf file (which is a oinkmas‐
       ter(1) configuration file). Or modify the shell script itself.

       More options may be added in the future.
