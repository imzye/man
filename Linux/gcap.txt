NAME
       gcap - Youtube closed caption downloader

SYNOPSIS
       gcap [-i] [-t] [-r <regexp>] [--proxy=<addr> | --no-proxy]
            [--help] <url> | <video_id>

DESCRIPTION
       gcap is a command line tool for downloading Youtube closed captions.  The downloaded closed captions are saved in SubRip (srt) file format.  The srt files are saved as "$videoid_$langid.srt" by
       default.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Print help and exit.

       --version
           Print version and exit.

       -q, --quiet
           Be quiet.

       -i, --interactive
           Open the interactive prompt which can be used to select the items.  gcap selects all items by default. See also "INTERACTIVE PROMPT".

       -t, --title
           Parse video title and use it in the output filename(s) instead of video ID. The default is no.

       -r, --regexp=arg
           Cleanup video title using the specified arg regular expression.  The default is "/(\w|\s)/g".

       --proxy arg
           Use arg for HTTP proxy, e.g. "http://foo:1234". Overrides the http_proxy environment setting.

       --no-proxy
           Disable use of HTTP proxy. Overrides both "--proxy" and http_proxy environment settings.

INTERACTIVE PROMPT
       Use the "--interactive" switch to open the prompt. Note that gcap uses (as of 0.1.0) the Umph::Prompt module for this. Once the prompt opens, type "help" to get a list of commands available to the
       prompt.

EXAMPLES
       gcap 0QRO3gKj3qw
       gcap "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw"
           Both yield the same results.

       gcap -ti 0QRO3gKj3qw
           Same as above two but use video title in the filename and choose which of the closed captions should be downloaded.

EXIT STATUS
       Exits 0 on success, otherwise 1.

FILES
       $HOME/.gcaprc, for example:
           echo "--interactive" >> ~/.gcaprc

NOTES
       Availability
           The following error message produced by gcap (or the XML::DOM module) typically indicates that the video does not have any closed captions available for it (URL omitted for brewity):

             Couldn't parsefile [...] with LWP: no element found at line 1,
             column 0, byte -1 at [...]/XML/Parser.pm [...]

       http_proxy
           gcap depends on XML::DOM which uses LWP::UserAgent to download the data. Note that LWP::UserAgent reads http_proxy environment setting. e.g.:

             env http_proxy=http://foo:1234 gcap video_id
