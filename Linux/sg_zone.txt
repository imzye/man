NAME
       sg_zone - send SCSI OPEN, CLOSE, FINISH or SEQUENTIALIZE ZONE command

SYNOPSIS
       sg_zone [--all] [--close] [--count=ZC] [--finish] [--help] [--open] [--sequentialize] [--verbose] [--version] [--zone=ID] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       Sends a SCSI OPEN ZONE, CLOSE ZONE, FINISH ZONE or SEQUENTIALIZE ZONE command to the DEVICE. All but the last are found in the soon to be released ZBC standard (close to draft ZBC BSR INCITS 536 revi‐
       sion 05).  The SEQUENTIALIZE ZONE command was added in zbc2r01b.

       One and only one of the --open, --close, --finish and --sequentialize options can be chosen.

OPTIONS
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -a, --all
              sets the ALL field in the cdb.

       -c, --close
              causes the CLOSE ZONE command to be sent to the DEVICE.

       -C, --count=ZC
              ZC is placed in the Zone Count field in the cdb of all four commands supported by this utility. ZC should be a value from 0 to 65535 (0xffff) inclusive.

       -f, --finish
              causes the FINISH ZONE command to be sent to the DEVICE.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -o, --open
              causes the OPEN ZONE command to be sent to the DEVICE.

       -S, --sequentialize
              causes the SEQUENTIALIZE ZONE command to be sent to the DEVICE.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

       -z, --zone=ID
              where ID is placed in the cdb's ZONE ID field. A zone id is a zone start logical block address (LBA). The default value is 0. ID is assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed with '0x' or  has  a
              trailing 'h' which indicate hexadecimal.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of sg_zone is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
