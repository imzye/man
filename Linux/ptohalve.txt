NAME
       ptohalve - rescale a panorama project

SYNOPSIS
       ptohalve [options] --output halved.pto project.pto

        Options:
         -o | --output     Filename of scaled project (can be the the same as the input)
         -h | --help       Outputs help documentation

DESCRIPTION
       ptohalve takes a hugin .pto project and halves all pixel dimensions.  It will fail if any photos have non-even pixel dimensions. If it succeeds you will need to rescale the photos to match:

         mogrify -geometry 50% *.JPG

       Note, this tool is useful in conjunction with the ptodouble tool which performs the opposite transform.
