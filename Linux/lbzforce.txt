NAME
       lbzforce - force a '.bz2' extension on all lbzip2 files

SYNOPSIS
       lbzforce [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       lbzforce  forces  a .bz2 extension on all lbzip2 files so that lbzip2 will not compress them twice.  This can be useful for files with names truncated after a file transfer.  On systems with a 14 char
       limitation on file names, the original name is truncated to make room for the .bz2 suffix. For example, 12345678901234 is renamed to 12345678901.bz2. A file name such as foo.tbz is left intact.
