NAME
       radamsa - a general purpose fuzzer

SYNOPSIS
       radamsa [options] [sample-path] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Radamsa is a general purpose data fuzzer. It reads data from given sample files, or standard input if none are given, and outputs modified data. It is usually used to generate malformed data for test‐
       ing programs.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              Show a shorter summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Show program version.

       -o, --output pattern
              Specify where to write the modified data. By default the data is written to standard output. The pattern can be a path, in which %n is filled to be the test case number if present, :n  to  have
              the data sent to TCP clients connecting to local port n, or a.b.c.d:n to have radamsa connect to port n of IPv4 address a.b.c.d to send each output.

       -n, --count n
              How many outputs to generate based on the sample(s). Giving -1 or inf causes data to be generated forever. The default is 1.

       -s, --seed n
              Start from random state n, which is a decimal number. Starting from the same random state with the same command line arguments and samples causes the same outputs to be generated. If no seed is
              given explicitly radamsa reads a random one from /dev/urandom or takes the current time in milliseconds.

       -M, --meta path
              Write metadata about generated data to given path. - can be used to have the metadata written to standard output. The metadata contains the seed followed by one line per testcase.

       -l, --list
              Show all available mutations, patterns and generators along with their descriptions.

       -r, --recursive
              Include samples from directories recursively.

       -v, --verbose
              Print what is being done.

       -m, --mutations string
              Request the initial mutation probabilities manually. This is generally not recommended and the options will change in the future versions.

       -p, --patterns string
              Request the mutation patterns manually. This is generally not recommended and the options will change in the future versions.

       -g, --generators string
              Request the data stream generator probabilities manually. This is generally not recommended and the options will change in the future versions.

EXAMPLES
        $ cat file | radamsa | program -
        $ radamsa samples/*.foo | program -
        $ radamsa -o test-%n.foo -n 100 samples/*.foo
        $ radamsa -o :80 -n inf samples/*.resp
        $ radamsa -o 127.0.0.1:80 -n inf samples/*.req
