NAME
       Color::Spectrum::Multi - simple Color::Spectrum wrapper to handle fading between multiple colours.

VERSION
       Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
       A simple wrapper around Color::Spectrum, to allow generating a range of colours fading between multiple colours (e.g. a red -> yellow -> green fade) easy.

       Usage is much the same as Color::Spectrum, except you can supply as many colours as you wish.

         # Procedural interface:
         use Color::Spectrum::Multi qw(generate);
         my @color = generate(10,'#FF0000','#00FF00', '#0000FF');

         # OO interface:
         use Color::Spectrum::Multi;
         my $spectrum = Color::Spectrum::Multi->new();
         my @color = $spectrum->generate(10,'#FF0000','#00FF00', '#0000FF');

DESCRIPTION
       Color::Spectrum provides an easy way to fade between two colours in a given number of steps.  This module is a simple wrapper around Color::Spectrum, making it easy to fade between an arbitrary
       number of colours.

METHODS
       generate
           Given the desired number of steps and two or more colours, returns a series of colours.
