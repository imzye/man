DESCRIPTION
       nouveau is an Xorg driver for NVIDIA video cards.  The driver supports 2D acceleration and provides support for the following framebuffer depths: (15,) 16  and 24.  TrueColor visuals are supported
       for these depths.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The nouveau driver supports PCI, PCI-Express and AGP video cards based on the following NVIDIA chips:

       RIVA TNT              NV4

       RIVA TNT2             NV5

       GeForce 256, QUADRO   NV10

       GeForce2, QUADRO2     NV11 & NV15

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type and the amount of video memory present for all chips.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "HWCursor" "boolean"
              Enable or disable the HW cursor.  Default: on.

       Option "AccelMethod" "string"
              Specify the acceleration method. One of "none", or "exa". Default: exa.

       Option "NoAccel" "boolean"
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       Option "ShadowFB" "boolean"
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default: off.

       Option "WrappedFB" "boolean"
              Enable or disable wfb, only affects nv50+. Useful for some legacy configurations where high rendering latency is perceived.  Default: wfb is disabled.

       Option "GLXVBlank" "boolean"
              Synchronize GLX clients to VBlank. Useful where tearing is a problem, harmful if the GPU isn't fast enough to keep up with the monitor refresh rate. Default: on.

       Option "ZaphodHeads" "string"
              Specify the randr output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a particular driver instance.  If you use this option you most use this option for all instances of the driver.
              For example: Option "ZaphodHeads" "LVDS,VGA-0" will assign xrandr outputs LVDS and VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.

       Option "PageFlip" "boolean"
              Enable DRI2 page flipping. Default: on.

       Option "SwapLimit" "integer"
              Set maximum allowed number of pending OpenGL double-buffer swaps for a drawable before a client is blocked.
              A  value  of  1  corresponds to double-buffering. A value of 2 corresponds to triple-buffering. Higher values may allow higher framerate, but also increase lag for interactive applications,
              e.g., games. Nouveau currently reliably supports a maximum value of 2 on XOrg 1.12+. A maximum setting of 2 on older x-servers is allowed, but it will  break  conformance  with  the  OpenML
              OML_sync_control specification and will cause failure of software that relies on correct presentation timing behaviour as defined in that specification.
              Default: 1.

       Option "DRI" "integer"
              Define the maximum level of DRI to enable. Valid values are 2 or 3.  exa acceleration will honor the maximum level if it is supported.  Default: 2.
