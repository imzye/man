NAME
       scaphandre - Extensible metrology agent for electricity consumption related metrics

SYNOPSIS
       scaphandre [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

DESCRIPTION
       Extensible metrology agent for electricity consumption related metrics

   Commands:
       stdout Write the metrics to the terminal

       json   Write the metrics in the JSON format to a file or to stdout

       prometheus
              Expose the metrics to a Prometheus HTTP endpoint

       qemu   Watch all Qemu-KVM virtual machines running on the host and expose the metrics of each of them in a dedicated folder

       prometheus-push
              Push metrics to Prometheus Push Gateway

       help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

OPTIONS

       -v...

              Increase the verbosity level

       --no-header

              Don't print the header to the standard output

       --vm

              Tell Scaphandre that it's running in a virtual machine. You should have another instance of Scaphandre running on the hypervisor (see docs)

       -s, --sensor <SENSOR>

              The sensor module to use to gather the energy consumption metrics

       --sensor-buffer-per-domain-max-kb <SENSOR_BUFFER_PER_DOMAIN_MAX_KB>

              Maximum memory size allowed, in KiloBytes, for storing energy consumption of each **domain**. Only available for the RAPL sensor (on Linux) [default: 1]

       --sensor-buffer-per-socket-max-kb <SENSOR_BUFFER_PER_SOCKET_MAX_KB>

              Maximum memory size allowed, in KiloBytes, for storing energy consumption of each **socket**. Only available for the RAPL sensor (on Linux) [default: 1]

       -h, --help
