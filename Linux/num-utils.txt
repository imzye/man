NAME
       numbound - Find boundary numbers in files or STDIN.

SYNOPSIS
       numbound [-dhlV] <FILE>

       | numbound [-dhlV]     (Input on STDIN from pipeline.)

       numbound [-dhlV]       (Input on STDIN.  Use Ctrl-D to stop.)

DESCRIPTION
       numbound will find boundary numbers (minimum and maximum) in files or STDIN.  By default it will find the upper bound in the set of numbers (the maximum number) in the files or on STDIN.  You can
       use the -l option for finding the lower bound (minimum number).

OPTIONS
           -l  -- Return the lower bound number in the set  (the minimum number)

           -h  Help: You're looking at it.
           -V  Increase verbosity.
           -d  Debug mode.  For developers

BUGS
       numbound currently will only gather the first number on each line instead of all the numbers on the lines.
