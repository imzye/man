NAME
       quicktree - transforms Stockholm alignment to PHYLIP phylogenetic tree

SYNOPSIS
       quicktree [-options] <inputfile>

DESCRIPTION
       A Fatal Error occurred: No such option as '--help'.

OPTIONS
       -in <m|a>        : input file is a distance matrix in phylip format (m)

              or an alignment in stockholm format* (a, default)

       -out <m|t>       : output is a distance matrix in phylip format (m) or

              a tree in New Hampshire format

       Advanced options : -upgma           : Use the UPGMA method to construct the tree

              (ignored for distance matrix outputs)

       -kimura          : Use the kimura translation for pairwise distances

              (ignored for distance matrix inputs)

       -boot <n>        : Calcuate bootstrap values with n iterations

              (ignored for distance matrix outputs)

       -v               : print version and exit

       *Use sreformat, part of the HMMer package to convert your alignment to Stockholm format
