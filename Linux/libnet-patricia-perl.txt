DESCRIPTION
       This module uses a Patricia Trie data structure to quickly perform IP address prefix matching for applications such as IP subnet, network or routing table lookups.  The data structure is based on
       a radix tree using a radix of two, so sometimes you see patricia implementations called "radix" as well.  The term "Trie" is derived from the word "retrieval" but is pronounced like "try".
       Patricia stands for "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded as Alphanumeric", and was first suggested for routing table lookups by Van Jacobsen.  Patricia Trie performance
       characteristics are well-known as it has been employed for routing table lookups within the BSD kernel since the 4.3 Reno release.

       The BSD radix code is thoroughly described in "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2" by Wright and Stevens and in the paper ``A Tree-Based Packet Routing Table for Berkeley Unix'' by Keith Sklower.

METHODS
       new - create a new Net::Patricia object
              $pt = Net::Patricia->new;

           This  is  the  class' constructor - it returns a "Net::Patricia" object upon success or undef on failure.  The constructor takes an optional argument (of AF_INET or AF_INET6, defaulting to the
           former), and creates a tree with address and mask values of that type as keys.

           The "Net::Patricia" object will be destroyed automatically when there are no longer any references to it.

       add_string
             $pt->add_string(key_string[,user_data]);

           The first argument, key_string, is a network or subnet specification in canonical form, e.g. "10.0.0.0/8", where the number after the slash represents the number of bits in the netmask.  If no
           mask width is specified, the longest possible mask is assumed, i.e. 32 bits for AF_INET addresses.

           The second argument, user_data, is optional.  If supplied, it should be a SCALAR value (which may be a perl reference) specifying the user data that will be stored in the Patricia  Trie  node.
           Subsequently,  this value will be returned by the match methods described below to indicate a successful search.  Remember that perl references and objects are represented as SCALAR values and
           therefore the user data can be complicated data objects.

           If no second argument is passed, the key_string will be stored as the user data and therfore will likewise be returned by the match functions.

           On success, this method returns the user_data passed as the second argument or key_string if no user data was specified.  It returns undef on failure.

       match_string
             $pt->match_string(key_string);

           This method searches the Patricia Trie to find a matching node, according to normal subnetting rules for the address and mask specified.

           The key_string argument is a network or subnet specification in canonical form, e.g. "10.0.0.0/8", where the number after the slash represents the number of bits in the netmask.   If  no  mask
           width value is specified, the longest mask is assumed, i.e. 32 bits for AF_INET addresses.

           If a matching node is found in the Patricia Trie, this method returns the user data for the node.  This method returns undef on failure.

       match_exact_string
             $pt->match_exact_string(key_string);

           This  method  searches the Patricia Trie to find a matching node.  Its semantics are exactly the same as those described for "match_string" except that the key must match a node exactly.  I.e.
           it is not sufficient that the address and mask specified merely falls within the subnet specified by a particular node.

       match_integer
             $pt->match_integer(integer[,mask_bits]);

           This method searches the Patricia Trie to find a matching node, according to normal subnetting rules for the address and mask specified.  Its semantics  are  similar  to  those  described  for
           "match_string"  except  that  the key is specified using an integer (i.e.  SCALAR), such as that returned by perl's "unpack" function for values converted using the "N" (network-ordered long).
           Note that this argument is not a packed network-ordered long.

           Just to be completely clear, the integer argument should be a value of the sort produced by this code:

              use Socket;
              $integer = unpack("N", inet_aton("10.0.0.0"));

       match_exact_integer
             $pt->match_exact_integer(integer[,mask_bits]);

           This method searches the Patricia Trie to find a matching node.  Its semantics are exactly the same as "match_integer" except that the key must match a node exactly.  I.e. it is not sufficient
           that the address and mask specified merely falls within the subnet specified by a particular node.

       remove_string
             $pt->remove_string(key_string);

           This method removes the node which exactly matches the the address and mask specified from the Patricia Trie.

           If the matching node is found in the Patricia Trie, it is removed, and this method returns the user data for the node.  This method returns undef on failure.

       climb
              $pt->climb([CODEREF]);

           This method climbs the Patricia Trie, visiting each node as it does so.  It performs a non-recursive, "preorder" traversal.

           The CODEREF argument is optional.  It is a perl code reference used to specify a user-defined subroutine to be called when visiting each node.  The node's user data will be passed as the  sole
           argument to that subroutine.

           This method returns the number of nodes successfully visited while climbing the Trie.  That is, without a CODEREF argument, it simply counts the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie.

           Note  that currently the return value from your CODEREF subroutine is ignored.  In the future the climb method may return the number of times your subroutine returned non-zero, as it is called
           once per node.  So, if you are currently relying on the climb return value to accurately report a count of the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie, it would be prudent to have your subroutine
           return a non-zero value.

           This method is called climb() rather than walk() because climbing trees (and therfore tries) is a more popular pass-time than walking them.

       climb_inorder
              $pt->climb_inorder([CODEREF]);

           This method climbs the Patricia Trie, visiting each node in order as it does so.  That is, it performs an "inorder" traversal.

           The CODEREF argument is optional.  It is a perl code reference used to specify a user-defined subroutine to be called when visiting each node.  The node's user data will be passed as the  sole
           argument to that subroutine.

           This method returns the number of nodes successfully visited while climbing the Trie.  That is, without a CODEREF argument, it simply counts the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie.

           Note  that currently the return value from your CODEREF subroutine is ignored.  In the future the climb method may return the number of times your subroutine returned non-zero, as it is called
           once per node.  So, if you are currently relying on the climb return value to accurately report a count of the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie, it would be prudent to have your subroutine
           return a non-zero value.

           This method is called climb() rather than walk() because climbing trees (and therfore tries) is a more popular pass-time than walking them.

   Serialization
       Net::Patricia trees, unlike many classes with XS-level data, can be frozen and thawed using Storable.

BUGS
       When passing a CODEREF argument to the climb method, the return value from your CODEREF subroutine is currently ignored.  In the future the climb  method  may  return  the  number  of  times  your
       subroutine  returned  non-zero, as it is called once per node.  So, if you are currently relying on the climb return value to accurately report a count of the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie,
       it would be prudent to have your subroutine return a non-zero value.

       patricialib, the C library used by this perl extension, is an extracted version of MRT's patricia code from radix.[ch], which was worked on by Masaki Hirabaru and Craig Labovitz.  For more info on
       MRT see:

          https://github.com/deepfield/MRT

       The MRT patricia code owes some heritage to GateD's radix code, which in turn owes something to the BSD kernel.
