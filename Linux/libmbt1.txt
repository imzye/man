NAME
       MCE - Many-Core Engine for Perl providing parallel processing capabilities

VERSION
       This document describes MCE version 1.879

       Many-Core Engine (MCE) for Perl helps enable a new level of performance by maximizing all available cores.

DESCRIPTION
       MCE spawns a pool of workers and therefore does not fork a new process per each element of data. Instead, MCE follows a bank queuing model. Imagine the line
       being the data and bank-tellers the parallel workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the ability to chunk the next n elements from the input stream to the
       next available worker.

SYNOPSIS
       This is a simplistic use case of MCE running with 5 workers.

        # Construction using the Core API

        use MCE;

        my $

perl v5.34.0                                                                 2022-05-28                                                                     MCE(3pm)
