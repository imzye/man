NAME
       lcmaps_localaccount.mod - LCMAPS plugin to switch user identity

SYNOPSIS
       lcmaps_localaccount.mod [-gridmapfile grid-mapfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This  plugin  is an acquisition plugin and will provide the LCMAPS system with Local Account credential information.  The plugin tries to find a local account (more specifically a UserID) based on
       the Distinguished Name (DN) of the user's end-entity certificate.

       It will try to find a DN to local account name mapping in the grid-mapfile.  The plugin will resolve the UID, GID and all the secondary GIDs of the mapped local (system) account username.

OPTIONS
       -gridmapfile grid-mapfile
              This file must contain DNs to (local) user account name mappings.  It is strongly advised to set this option and to set it to an absolute path to avoid usage of the wrong file(path).   When
              unset,  the  plugin  will try to obtain the value from one of the environment variables (see ENVIRONMENT). When those are also unset, the default depends on whether the plugin runs inside a
              (setuid-)root application. In the (setuid-)root case, the default is /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile.  In the non-(setuid-)root case, the default is <homedir>/.gridmap. If that  latter  de‐
              fault does not exist, the plugin will return the account information of the calling user.  In a (setuid-)root application, relative paths are taken with respect to /etc/grid-security/.

RETURN VALUES
       LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS
              Success.

       LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL
              Failure.

ENVIRONMENT
       GRIDMAP | GLOBUSMAP | globusmap | GlobusMap
              When no grid-mapfile is specified as option to the plugin, it will try to obtain the file location from one of these environment variables.

NOTES
       Since  version  1.6.0  the localaccount plugin supports grid-mapfile entries with multiple usernames, separated by a comma without whitespace. This can be used in combination with specifying a re‐
       quested username (such as by gsissh), to pick any of these accounts. When no requested username is specified, the first is used. This requires LCMAPS version 1.6.0 or newer.
