NAME
       quassel - manual page for quassel v0.14.0 (dist-da9c1c9)

SYNOPSIS
       quasselcore [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Quassel  IRC  is  a  modern,  distributed  IRC client.  One (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core -- much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC
       client such as WeeChat, but graphical.

       quasselcore provides the daemon which connects to IRC networks, allowing any number of Quassel clients to connect, including the official desktop client, the quasselclient program.
