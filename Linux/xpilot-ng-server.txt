       -playerWallBounceType or wallBounceType <integer>

              What kind of ship wall bounces to use.

              A value of 0 gives the old XPilot wall bounces, where the ship velocity in the direction perpendicular to the wall is reversed after which the velocity is multiplied by the value of the player‐
              WallBounceBrakeFactor option.

              A value of 1 gives the "separate multipliers" implementation.

              A value of 2 causes Mara's suggestion for the speed change in the direction parallel to the wall to be used.  Vtangent2 = (1-Vnormal1/Vtotal1*wallfriction)*Vtangent1

              A value of 3 causes Uau's suggestion to be used: change the parallel one by MIN(C1*perpendicular_change, C2*parallel_speed) if you assume the wall has a coefficient of friction C1.  .

       -playerWallBounceBrakeFactor or playerWallBrake <real>

              Factor to slow down ship in direction perpendicular to the wall when a wall is hit (0 to 1).

       -playerBallBounceBrakeFactor or playerBallBrake <real>

              Elastic or inelastic properties of the player-ball collision 1 means fully elastic, 0 fully inelastic.

       -playerWallFriction or wallFriction <real>

              Player-wall friction (0 to 1).

       -objectWallBounceBrakeFactor or objectWallBrake <real>

              Factor to slow down objects when they hit the wall (0 to 1).

       -objectWallBounceLifeFactor <real>

              Factor to reduce the life of objects after bouncing (0 to 1).

       -afterburnerPowerMult or afterburnerPower <real>

              Multiplication factor for afterburner power.

       -wallBounceDestroyItemProb <real>

              The probability for each item a player owns to get destroyed when the player bounces against a wall.

       -/+reportToMetaServer or reportMeta

              Maximum size of meta update messages.

              List of network addresses of computers which are denied service.  Addresses may be followed by a slash and a network mask.  [ Flags: command, defaults ]

       -/+limitedVisibility

              Should the players have a limited visibility?

       -minVisibilityDistance or minVisibility <real>

              Minimum block distance for limited visibility, 0 for default.

       -maxVisibilityDistance or maxVisibility <real>

              Maximum block distance for limited visibility, 0 for default.

       -/+limitedLives

              Should players have limited lives?  See also worldLives.

       -worldLives or lives <integer>

              Number of lives each player has (no sense without limitedLives).

       -/+reset

              Does the world reset when the end of round is reached?  When true all mines, missiles, shots and explosions will be removed from the world and all players including the winner(s) will be trans‐
              ported back to their homebases.  This option is only effective when limitedLives is turned on.

       -resetOnHuman or humanReset <integer>

              Normally,  new players have to wait until a round is finished before they can start playing. With this option, the first N human players to enter will cause the round to be restarted.  In other
              words, if this option is set to 0, nothing special happens and you have to wait as usual until the round ends (if there are rounds at all, otherwise this option doesn't do anything). If  it  is
              set  to  1,  the  round is ended when the first human player enters. This is useful if the robots have already started a round and you don't want to wait for them to finish.  If it is set to 2,
              this also happens for the second human player.  This is useful when you got bored waiting for another player to show up and have started playing against the robots. When someone  finally  joins
              you,  they  won't  have  to  wait  for  you  to finish the round before they can play too. For higher numbers it works the same. So this option gives the last human player for whom the round is
              restarted. Anyone who enters after that does have to wait until the round is over.

       -/+allowAlliances or alliances

              Are alliances between players allowed?  Alliances are like teams, except they can be formed and dissolved at any time. Notably, teamImmunity works for alliances too.  To manage  alliances,  use
              the '/ally' talk command: '/ally invite <player name>' to invite another player to join you.  '/ally cancel' to cancel such an invitation.  '/ally refuse <player name>' to decline an invitation
              from a player.  '/ally refuse' to decline all the invitations you received.  '/ally accept <player name>' to join the other player.  '/ally accept' to accept all the invitations  you  received.
              '/ally leave' to leave the alliance you are currently in.  '/ally list' lists the members of your current alliance.  If members from different alliances join, all their allies do so.

       -/+announceAlliances

              Are changes in alliances made public?  If this option is on, changes in alliances are sent to all players and all alliances are shown in the score list. Invitations for alliances are never sent
              to anyone but the invited players.

              tors who can watch the recorded game from anyone's viewpoint. Can be set to 0 in the middle of a game to stoprecording.  [ Flags: command, defaults, invisible ]

       -recordFileName or recordFile <string>

              Name of the file where server recordings are saved.  [ Flags: command, defaults, invisible ]

       -recordFlushInterval or recordWait <integer>

              If  set  to  a  nonzero  value  x, the server will flush all recording data in memory to the record file at least once every x seconds.  This is useful if you want to replay the game on another
              server while it is still being played. There is a small overhead (some dozens of bytes extra recording file size) for each flush.

       -/+constantScoring

              Whether the scores given from various things are fixed.

       -/+zeroSumScoring or zeroSum

              Use Zero sum scoring?  [ Flags: command ]

       -/+elimination

              Race mode where the last player drops out each lap.

       -dataURL <string>

              URL where the client can get extra data for this map.

       -/+polygonMode

              Force use of polygon protocol when communicating with clients?  (useful for debugging if you want to see the polygons created in the blocks to polygons conversion function).

       -/+fastAim

              When calculating a frame, turn the ship before firing.  This means you can change aim one frame faster.  Added this option to see how much difference changing the order would make.

       -/+ngControls

              Enable improved precision steering and aiming of main gun.

       -/+legacyMode

              Try to emulate classic xpilot behavior.

       -constantSpeed or oldThrust <real>

              Make ship move forward at a constant speed when thrust key is held down, in addition to the normal acceleration. The constant speed is proportional to the product of  the  acceleration  of  the
              ship  (varying with ship mass and afterburners) and the value of this option. Note that this option is quite unphysical and can using it can cause weird effects (with bounces for example).  Low
              values close to 0.5 (maybe in the range 0.3 to 1) for this option can be used if you want to increase ship agility without increasing speeds otherwise. This can improve gameplay for example  on
              the Blood's Music map. Higher values make the ship behaviour visibly weird.

       -turnPushPersistence or pushPersist <real>

              How much of the turnpush to remain as player velocity. (0.0-1.0)

       -turnGrip or turnPushGrip <real>

              How much of of the turnPush should pull the ship sideways by gripping to the friction of the wall?. (0.0-1.0)

       -thrustWidth or sprayWidth <real>

              Width of thrust spark spray 0.0-1.0 where 1.0 means 180 degrees.

       -thrustMass or sparkWeight <real>

              Weight of thrust sparks.

       -sparkSpeed or sparkVel <real>

              Multiplier affecting avg. speed (relative ship) of thrust sparks.

       -/+ballStyles

              Send ball styles to clients.

       -/+ignoreMaxFPS

              Ignore  client  maxFPS  requests  and always send all frames.  This is a hack for demonstration purposes to allow changing the server FPS when there are old clients with broken maxFPS handling.
              Those clients could be better dealt with separately.  This option will be removed in the future (hopefully).

       -pausedFramesPerSecond or pausedFPS <integer>

              Maximum FPS shown to paused players. 0 means full framerate.  Can be used to reduce server bandwidth consumption.

       -waitingFramesPerSecond or waitingFPS <integer>

              Maximum FPS shown to players in waiting state.  0 means full framerate. Can be used to limit bandwidth used.  Waiting players are those that have just joined a game and have to wait until  next
              round starts. Note that in clients, a W is shown next to waiting players' names in the score list.

       -deadFramesPerSecond or deadFPS <integer>

              Maximum  FPS shown to players in dead state.  0 means full framerate. Can be used to limit bandwidth used.  This option should only be used if pausedFPS and waitingFPS options don't limit band‐
              width usage enough.  Dead players are those that have played this round but have run out of lives. Note that in clients, a D is shown next to dead players' names in the score list.

       -/+teamcup

              Is this a teamcup match?.  [ Flags: command, any, invisible ]

       -teamcupName <string>

              The name of the teamcup (used only if teamcup is true).  [ Flags: command, any, invisible ]

       -teamcupMailAddress <string>

              The mail address where players should send match results.  [ Flags: command, any, invisible ]

       -teamcupScoreFileNamePrefix <string>

              First part of file name for teamcup score files.  The whole filename will be this followed by the match number.  [ Flags: command, any, invisible ]

       -teamcupMatchNumber or match <integer>

              The number of the teamcup match.  [ Flags: command ]

       -mainLoopTime <real>

              Duration of last Main_loop() function call (in milliseconds).  This option is read only.  [ Flags: command ]

       -cellGetObjectsThreshold or cellThreshold <integer>

              Use Cell_get_objects if there is this many objects or more.

              The probabilities are in the range [0.0-1.0] and they refer to the probability that an event will occur in a block per second.  Boolean options are turned off by using +<option>.
