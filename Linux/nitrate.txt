NAME
       nitrate - Command line interpreter for the Nitrate Python API

SYNOPSIS
       nitrate

DESCRIPTION
       python-nitrate  provides a high-level Python interface to the Nitrate test case management system. The package also provides standalone script 'nitrate' which allows easy experimenting with the inter‐
       face directly from the Python interpreter by importing all available objects and enabling the readline support.

       In short, after setting your configuration you can easily manipulate all Nitrate objects from the command line, for example:

          $ nitrate
          >>> for case in TestRun(123):
          ...     print case

CONFIGURATION
       To be able to contact the Nitrate server a minimal user config file ~/.nitrate has to be provided in the user home directory:

          [nitrate]
          url = https://nitrate.server/xmlrpc/
