       -d, --debug {on|s|m|l|xl|off}
              control the printing of run time information to assist with troubleshooting, or further development of this tool; on gives a modest amount of informa‐
              tion; s, m, l, or xl gives an increasing amount of information and off disables the printing of debug information; note that currently on, s, m, and l
