NAME
       all-knowing-dns - Tiny DNS server for IPv6 Reverse DNS

SYNOPSIS
           all-knowing-dns [--configfile <path>] [--querylog]

DESCRIPTION
       AllKnowingDNS provides reverse DNS for IPv6 networks which use SLAAC (autoconf), e.g. for a /64 network.

       The problem with IPv6 reverse DNS and traditional nameservers is that the nameserver requires you to provide a zone file. Assuming you want to provide RDNS for a /64 network, you have 2**64 =
       18446744073709551616 different usable IP addresses (a little less if you are using SLAAC). Providing a zone file for that, even in a very terse notation, would consume a huge amount of disk space
       and could not possibly be held in the memory of the computers we have nowadays.

       AllKnowingDNS instead generates PTR and AAAA records on the fly. You only configure which network you want to serve and what your entries should look like.

OPTIONS
       --configfile=path
           Use path instead of /etc/all-knowing-dns.conf as configuration file.

       --querylog
           Enable logging every query to stdout (for debugging).

CONFIGURATION FILE (/etc/all-knowing-dns.conf)
       The configuration file is wonderfully simple:

           # Configuration file for AllKnowingDNS v1.7

           listen 79.140.39.197
           listen 2001:4d88:100e:1::3

           # RaumZeitLabor
           network 2001:4d88:100e:ccc0::/64
               resolves to ipv6-%DIGITS%.nutzer.raumzeitlabor.de
               with upstream 2001:4d88:100e:1::2

           # Chaostreff
           network 2001:4d88:100e:cd1::/64
               resolves to ipv6-%DIGITS%.treff.noname-ev.de

       This example contains all configuration directives. Let's go over them one by one:

       listen address
           Listens on the given address (IPv4 and IPv6 is supported) on port 53.

       network network
           Specifies  that  queries  for  PTR  records within the given network should be answered (any query for an unconfigured network will be answered with NXDOMAIN). You need to specify at least the
           resolves to directive afterwards.

       resolves to address
           Specifies the address to which PTR records should resolve. The address needs to contain %DIGITS% exactly once. When answering AAAA queries, %DIGITS% will be parsed and  converted  back  to  an
           IPv6 address.

           Example:

               network 2001:4d88:100e:ccc0::/64
                   resolves to ipv6-%DIGITS%.nutzer.raumzeitlabor.de

           Example query:

               The PTR query 2001:4d88:100e:ccc0:216:eaff:fecb:826 will resolve to
               ipv6-0216eafffecb0826.nutzer.raumzeitlabor.de

       with upstream address
           Before answering a PTR query for this network, AllKnowingDNS will ask the DNS server at address first, appending .upstream to the query.

           Example:

               network 2001:4d88:100e:ccc0::/64
                   resolves to ipv6-%DIGITS%.nutzer.raumzeitlabor.de
                   with upstream 2001:4d88:100e:1::2

           Example query:

               The PTR query 2001:4d88:100e:ccc0:219:dbff:fe43:2ec5 will make
               AllKnowingDNS ask for
               5.c.e.2.3.4.e.f.f.f.b.d.9.1.2.0.0.c.c.c.e.0.0.1. \
               8.8.d.4.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.upstream. at 2001:4d88:100e:1::2
               and relay the answer, if any.

DELEGATING ZONES
       This  section  shows  you  how  to delegate a zone in BIND9 or any DNS server with a compatible zone file syntax. To use AllKnowingDNS, you need to delegate the appropriate .ip6.arpa zone for your
       network and one regular domain.
