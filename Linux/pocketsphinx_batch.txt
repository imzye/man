       To  do  batchmode  recognition,  you  will need to specify a control file, using -ctl This is a simple text file containing one entry per line.  Each entry is the name of an input file relative to the
       -cepdir directory, and without the filename extension (which is given in the -cepext argument).

       If you are using acoustic feature files as input (see sphinx_fe(1) for information on how to generate these), you can also specify a subpart of a file, using the following format:

              FILENAME START-FRAME END-FRAME UTTERANCE-ID
