NAME
       SPICCTRL - Sony Vaio SPIC control program

SYNOPSIS
       spicctrl [-a|-b NUM|-B|-c|-C|-l NUM|-L|-p|-r|-R|-s|-S]

DESCRIPTION
       spicctrl is utility that can use the Sony Programmable I/O Control device (SPIC), which is part of Sony Vaio's, to do a few simple things.

       Currently,  it  can  only  be  used to control the brightness on the LCD backlight or print out the battery charge information.  The amount of brightness of the LCD is given as a number ranging from 0
       (most dim) to 255 (most bright).
