NAME
       ftdi_eeprom - Tool for reading/erasing/flashing FTDI USB chip eeproms

SYNOPSIS
       ftdi_eeprom [commands] config-file

DESCRIPTION
       ftdi_eeprom is a small tool for reading/erasing/flashing FTDI USB chip eeproms. It uses libftdi to access the chip, so you will need to have the required permissions on the device.

       The ftdi_sio module should not be loaded. You can prevent it to be automatically loaded by adding it to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.

       You have to unplug and replug your device to get the new values to be read.  Otherwise, you will still get the old values.

COMMANDS
       --device description
              Specify device to open by description string. One of:

                d:<device node>
                i:<vendor>:<product>
                i:<vendor>:<product>:<index>
                s:<vendor>:<product>:<serial>

       --read-eeprom
              Read eeprom and write to ‐filename‐ from config-file.

       --build-eeprom
              Build eeprom image.

       --erase-eeprom
              Erase eeprom.

       --flash-eeprom
              Flash eeprom.

       --verbose
              Print more information.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file contains a list of key-value pairs which will be used to flash an FTDI USB chip eeprom.  Comments start with #. The beginning of such a file might look like the following:

              vendor_id=0x0403        # Vendor ID
              product_id=0x6001       # Product ID

              max_power=0             # Max. power consumption: value * 2 mA. Use 0 if self_powered = true.

              ###########
              # Strings #
              ###########
              manufacturer="ACME Inc"                 # Manufacturer
              product="USB Serial Converter"          # Product
              serial="08-15"                          # Serial

       The example configuration file that could be found in /usr/share/doc/ftdi-eeprom/ is quite well commented so you should be able to use it as a basis.  The following keys are supported:

       vendor_id
              Set the vendor ID of the device. This value could be entered in decimal or hexadecimal form, and should be in the range 0-65535 or 0x0000-0xffff, respectively.

       product_id
              Set the product ID of the device. This value could be entered in decimal or hexadecimal form, and should be in the range 0-65535 or 0x0000-0xffff, respectively.

       max_power
              Set the maximum current the device will use, in 2 mA unit. Use 0 if self_powered = true.

       manufacturer
              Set the manufacturer string which normally holds the name of the manufacturer.

       product
              Set the product string which normally holds the name of the product.

       serial Set the serial string which normally holds the serial number of the product.

       self_powered
              Specify if the device is self-powered or not. The value should be true or false.

       remote_wakeup
              Specify if the device supports remote wake-ups. The value should be true or false.

       use_serial
              If this value is set to true, the serial string will be used. Otherwise the default serial string will be used.

       BM_type_chip
              This value have to be set to true if you are using a BM chip.

       in_is_isochronous
              If set to true this option specify that the input endpoint is in isochronous mode.

       out_is_isochronous
              If set to true this option specify that the output endpoint is in isochronous mode.

       suspend_pull_downs
              If this value is set to true the pull downs are enabled during suspend for lower power consumption.

       change_usb_version
              This value has to be set to true if you want to force the USB version using the usb_version key. Otherwise the default USB version will be used.

       usb_version
              Set the USB version of the device. The change_usb_version value has to be set to true.

       filename
              Specify a filename if you want to dump the content of the eeprom into it.
