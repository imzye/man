NAME
       SpamPD - Spam Proxy Daemon

VERSION
       Documentation for SpamPD version 2.62.

DESCRIPTION
       spampd is an SMTP/LMTP proxy that marks (or tags) spam using SpamAssassin (<http://www.SpamAssassin.org/>). The proxy is designed to be transparent to the sending and receiving mail servers and at
       no point takes responsibility for the message itself. If a failure occurs within spampd (or SpamAssassin) then the mail servers will disconnect and the sending server is still responsible for
       retrying the message for as long as it is configured to do so.

       spampd uses SpamAssassin to modify (tag) relayed messages based on their spam score, so all SA settings apply. This is described in the SA documentation.  spampd will by default only tell SA to
       tag a message if it exceeds the spam threshold score, however you can have it rewrite all messages passing through by adding the --tagall option (see SA for how non-spam messages are tagged).

       spampd logs all aspects of its operation to syslog(8), using the mail syslog facility.

       The latest version can be found at <https://github.com/mpaperno/spampd>.

REQUIRES
       Perl modules:

       Mail::SpamAssassin
       Net::Server (>= v0.89, v2.009+ recommended) with PreForkSimple and/or PreFork submodules.
       IO::File
       Time::HiRes
       IO::Socket::IP (if using TCP/IP sockets)
       IO::Socket::UNIX (if using UNIX sockets)

OPERATION
       spampd  is  meant  to  operate  as  an S/LMTP mail proxy which passes each message through SpamAssassin for analysis.  Note that spampd does not do anything other than check for spam, so it is not
       suitable as an anti-relay system.  It is meant to work in conjunction with your regular mail system.  Typically one would pipe any  messages  they  wanted  scanned  through  spampd  after  initial
       acceptance by your MX host.  This is especially useful for using Postfix's (http://www.postfix.org) advanced content filtering mechanism, although certainly not limited to that application.

       Please re-read the second sentence in the above paragraph.  You should NOT enable spampd to listen on a public interface (IP address) unless you know exactly what you're doing!  It is very easy to
       set up an open relay this way.

       Here are some simple examples (square brackets in the "diagrams" indicate physical machines):

       Running between firewall/gateway and internal mail server
         The  firewall/gateway  MTA would be configured to forward all of its mail to the port that spampd listens on, and spampd would relay its messages to port 25 of your internal server. spampd could
         either run on its own host (and listen on any port) or it could run on either mail server (and listen on any port except port 25).

           Internet ->
           [ MX gateway (@inter.net.host:25) -> spampd (@localhost:2025) ] ->
           [ Internal mail (@private.host.ip:25) ]

       Using Postfix advanced content filtering
         Please see the FILTER_README that came with the Postfix distribution.  You need to have a version of Postfix which supports this (ideally v.2 and up).

           Internet -> [ Postfix (@inter.net.host:25)  ->
                         spampd (@localhost:10025)     ->
                         Postfix (@localhost:10026)  ] -> final delivery

       Note that these examples only show incoming mail delivery.  Since it is often unnecessary to scan mail coming from your network, it may be desirable to set  up  a  separate  outbound  route  which
       bypasses spampd.

   Scalable Mode
       Since  v2.60  spampd  can  optionally run in "scalable mode" which dynamically adjusts the number of child servers which can process requests simultaneously. This is activated automatically if the
       "--min-servers" option is specifically set to be lower than "--max-servers".

       Historically SpamPD inherited from the module Net::Server::PreForkSimple which only allows for a static number of child servers to be running at  once.  This  new  option  essentially  allows  for
       inheriting  from  Net::Server::PreFork which features dynamic allocation of child servers, with some tunable parameters.  (The reason PreFork wasn't used to begin with is because older versions of
       it didn't seem to work...  it was an old TODO to try again later.)

       Here is what the Net::Server::PreFork documentation has to say (option names changed to match spampd):

       "This personality binds to one or more ports and then forks "--min-servers" child process.  The server will make sure that at any given time there are "--min-spare" servers available to receive  a
       client  request,  up  to  "--max-servers".  Each  of  these children will process up to "--maxrequests" client connections. This type is good for a heavily hit site, and should scale well for most
       applications."

       Some experimentation and tuning will likely be needed to get the best performance vs. efficiency. Keep in mind that a SIGHUP sent to the parent process will reload configuration files and  restart
       child servers gracefully (handy for tuning a busy site).

       See  the  documentation  for  "--min-servers",  "--max-servers", "--min-spare", and "--max-spare" options, and also the section about "Other Net::Server Options" for tuning parameters and links to
       further documentation.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
       spampd can be run directly from the command prompt if desired.  This is useful for testing purposes, but for long term use you probably want to put it somewhere like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin and
       execute   it   at   system   startup.    For   example   on   Red   Hat-style   Linux   system   one   can   use   a   script   in   /etc/rc.d/init.d   to   start   spampd   (a    sample    script
       <https://github.com/mpaperno/spampd/tree/master/misc> is available in the spampd code repository).

       spampd  is  available  as a package for a significant number of Linux distributions, including Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, etc). This is typically the easiest/best way to install and configure
       spampd since it should already take into account any system specifics for setting up and running as a daemon, etc.  Note however that packages might not offer the latest version of spampd. A  good
       reference for available packages and their versions can be found at <https://repology.org/project/spampd/versions>.

       spampd is also used in the turnkey Mail-in-a-Box <https://mailinabox.email/> project, which includes Postfix as the main MTA and Dovecot as the local delivery agent with LMTP protocol. Even if you
       don't  need  the  turnkey  solution,  it  may be informative to peruse the MIAB setup <https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/tree/master/setup> / configuration <https://github.com/mail-in-a-
       box/mailinabox/tree/master/conf> files for reference.

       All spampd options have reasonable defaults, especially for a Postfix-centric installation.  You may want to specify the "--max-servers" option if you have an especially beefy or weak  server  box
       because spampd is a memory-hungry program.  Check the "Options" for details on this and all other parameters.

       To show default values for all options, run "spampd --show defaults".

       Since  v2.61 spampd injects a "_SPAMPDVERSION_" "template tag" <https://spamassassin.apache.org/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Conf.html#TEMPLATE-TAGS> macro at message processing time. This can be used in
       an "add_header" SA config file directive, for example.

         add_header all Filter-Version SpamAssassin _VERSION_ (_SUBVERSION_, Rules: _RULESVERSION_) / SpamPD _SPAMPDVERSION_

       Note that  spampd replaces spamd  from the SpamAssassin distribution in function. You do not need to run spamd in order for spampd to work.  This has apparently been the source of some  confusion,
       so now you know.

   Postfix-specific Notes
       Here is a typical setup for Postfix "advanced" content filtering as described in the FILTER_README that came with the Postfix distribution (which you really need to read):

       /etc/postfix/master.cf:

         smtp             inet  n  -  y  -  -   smtpd
           -o content_filter=smtp:localhost:10025
           -o myhostname=mx.example.com

         localhost:10026  inet  n  -  n  -  10  smtpd
           -o content_filter=
           -o myhostname=mx-int.example.com

       The  first  entry is the main public-facing MTA which uses localhost:10025 as the content filter for all mail. The second entry receives mail from the content filter and does final delivery.  Both
       smtpd instances use the same Postfix main.cf file.  spampd is the process that listens on localhost:10025 and then connects to the Postfix listener on localhost:10026.  Note that the  "myhostname"
       options must be different between the two instances, otherwise Postfix will think it's talking to itself and abort sending.

       For the above example you can simply start spampd like this:

        spampd --host=localhost:10025 --relayhost=localhost:10026

       FILTER_README from the Postfix distro has more details and examples of various setups, including how to skip the content filter for outbound mail.

       Another tip for Postfix when considering what timeout values to use for --childtimout and --satimeout options is the following command:

       "# postconf | grep timeout"

       This will return a list of useful timeout settings and their values.  For explanations see the relevant "man" page (smtp, smtpd, lmtp).  By default spampd is set up for the default Postfix timeout
       values.

       The following guide has some more specific setup instructions: Integrating SpamAssassin into Postfix using spampd <https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/IntegratePostfixViaSpampd>

UPGRADING
       Always consult the changelog.txt file which should be included in the spampd repository/distribution.

       If upgrading from a version prior to 2.2, please note that the --add-sc-header option is no longer supported.  Use SA's built-in header manipulation features instead (as of SA v2.6).

       Upgrading  from  version  1  simply  involves  replacing the spampd program file with the latest one.  Note that the dead-letters folder is no longer being used and the --dead-letters option is no
       longer needed (though no errors are thrown if it's present).  Check the "OPTIONS" list below for a full list of new and deprecated options.  Also be sure to check out the change log.

       Since v2.60 spampd has a new "Scalable Mode" feature which varies the number of running child servers based on demand. This is disabled by default. The option previosly known as  "--children"  (or
       "-c") is now called "--max-servers" (or "-mxs"), but the old style is still accepted.  See descriptions of the "max-servers" and "min-servers" options for details.

       Also note that v2.60 added the ability to use a "CONFIGURATION FILE" for specifying all options.

USAGE
         spampd [
           [ --config | --cfg | --config-file | --cfg-file [<filename>] ][...]

           [ --host <host>[:<port>]      | --socket <path> --socket-perms <mode> ]
           [ --relayhost <host>[:<port>] | --relaysocket <path>                  ]

           [--childtimeout        <n>] [--tagall     | -a ] [--log-rules-hit | -rh]
           [ --child-name-template | -cnt [<template>] ]    [--homedir <path>     ]
           [ [--set-envelope-headers | -seh] | [--set-envelope-from | -sef] ]

           [ --logfile | -o (syslog|stderr|<filename>) ][...]
           [ --logsock | -ls <socketpath>    ]  [ --logident    | -li <name> ]
           [ --debug   | -d [<area,...>|1|0] ]  [ --logfacility | -lf <name> ]
           [ --show ( all | (defaults, config, version, argv, start, self) ) ][...]
         ]
         spampd --version
         spampd [--help | -?] | -?? [txt] | -??? [txt] | [-???? | --man [html|txt]]

       Options  are case-insensitive. "=" can be used as name/value separator instead of space (--name=value). "-" or "--" prefix can be used for all options. Shortest unique option name can be used. All
       options must be listed individually (no "bundling"). All boolean options can take an optional argument of 1 or 0, or can be negated by adding a "no-"  prefix  in  front  of  the  name.  An  option
       specified on the command line overrides the same option loaded from config file(s).

OPTIONS
       Please be sure to also read the general information about specifying option arguments in the above "USAGE" section.

       To view default values for all options, run "spampd --show defaults".

       --config or -cfg or --config-file or --cfg-file <filename> "new in v2.60"
            Load  options  from  one  or  more configuration file(s). This option can be specified multiple times. The "filename" can also be a list of files separated by a ":" (colon). If multiple files
            specify the same option, the last one loaded will take precedence. Also any options specified on the actual command line will take precedence (regardless of where they appear relative to  the
            "--config" option).  --config can only be specified on the command line, one cannot use it within another configuration file.

            See "CONFIGURATION FILE" section for more details.

       --host (<ip>|<hostname>)[:<port>]
            Specifies what hostname/IP and port spampd listens on. By default, it listens on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port 10025.

            As  of  v2.60  this option can also handle IPv6 addresses in the form of "--host n:n:n" or, with port, "--host [n:n:n]:port" (the square brackets are optional in both forms but recommended in
            the latter case).

            Note that the port specified this way implicitly overrides the "--port" option.

            Important! You should NOT enable spampd to listen on a public interface (IP address) unless you know exactly what you're doing!

       --port <n>
            Specifies what port spampd listens on. This is an alternate to using the above "--host=ip:port" notation. Note that a port specified in the "--host" option will override this one.

       --socket <socketpath>
            Specifies what UNIX socket spampd listens on. If this is specified, --host and --port are ignored.

       --socket-perms <mode>
            The file mode for the created UNIX socket (see --socket) in octal format, e.g. 700 to specify acces only for the user spampd is run as.

       --relayhost (<ip>|<hostname>)[:<port>]
            Specifies the hostname/IP to which spampd will relay all messages. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port 25.

            As of v2.60 this option can also handle IPv6 addresses in the form of "--relayhost n:n:n" or, with port, "--relayhost [n:n:n]:port" (the  square  brackets  are  optional  in  both  forms  but
            recommended in the latter case).

            Note that the port specified this way implicitly overrides the "--relayport" option.

       --relayport <n>
            Specifies what port spampd will relay to. This is an alternate to using the above --relayhost=ip:port notation. Note that a port specified in the "--relayhost" option will override this one.

       --relaysocket <socketpath>
            Specifies what UNIX socket spampd will relay to. If this is specified --relayhost and --relayport will be ignored.

       --user or -u <username>
       --group or -g <groupname>
            Specifies the user and/or group that the proxy will run as. Default is mail/mail.

       --children or -c <n>
       --max-servers or -mxs <n> "new in v2.60"
            Number of child servers to start and maintain (where n > 0). Each child will process up to "--maxrequests" (below) before exiting and being replaced by another child.  Keep this number low on
            systems w/out a lot of memory.  Note that there is always a parent process running, so if you specify 5 children you will actually have 6 spampd processes running.

            Note: If "--min-servers" option is also set, and is less than "--max-servers", then the server runs in "Scalable Mode" and the meaning of this option changes.  In scalable mode, the number of
            actual running servers will fluctuate between "--min-servers" and "--max-servers", based on demand.

            You  may  want  to set your origination mail server to limit the number of concurrent connections to spampd to match this setting (for Postfix this is the "xxxx_destination_concurrency_limit"
            setting where 'xxxx' is the transport being used, usually 'smtp' or 'lmtp').

            See also "--min-servers", "--min-spare", and "--max-spare" options.

       --min-servers or -mns <n> "new in v2.60"
            Minimum number of child servers to start and maintain (where n > 0).

            Note: If this option is set, and it is less than "--max-servers" option, then the server runs in "Scalable Mode". By default this option is undefined, meaning spampd runs only a set number of
            servers specified in "--max-servers".  In scalable mode, the number of actual running servers will fluctuate between "--min-servers" and "--max-servers", based on demand.

            See also "--max-servers", "--min-spare", and "--max-spare" options.

       --min-spare or -mnsp <n> "new in v2.60"
            The minimum number of servers to have waiting for requests.  Minimum and maximum numbers should not be set to close to each other or the server will fork  and  kill  children  too  often.  (-
            Copied from "Net::Server::PreFork")

            Note: This option is only used when running in "Scalable Mode". See "--min-servers" and "--max-servers" options.

       --max-spare or -mxsp <n> "new in v2.60"
            The maximum number of servers to have waiting for requests. (- Copied from "Net::Server::PreFork")

            Note: This option is only used when running in "Scalable Mode". See "--min-servers" and "--max-servers" options.

       --maxrequests or -mr or -r <n>
            spampd  works  by  forking  child  servers to handle each message. The maxrequests parameter specifies how many requests will be handled before the child exits. Since a child never gives back
            memory, a large message can cause it to become quite bloated; the only way to reclaim the memory is for the child to exit.

       --childtimeout <n>
            This is the number of seconds to allow each child server before it times out a transaction. In an S/LMTP transaction the timer is reset for every command.  This timeout includes time it would
            take to send the message data, so it should not be too short.  Note that it's more likely the origination or destination mail servers will timeout first, which is fine.  This is just a "sane"
            failsafe.

       --satimeout <n>
            This is the number of seconds to allow for processing a message with SpamAssassin (including feeding it the message, analyzing it, and adding the headers/report if necessary).

            This should be less than your origination and destination servers' timeout settings for the DATA command. (For Postfix this is set in "(smtp|lmtp)_data_done_timeout" and "smtpd_timeout").  In
            the  event  of timeout while processing the message, the problem is logged and the message is passed on anyway (w/out spam tagging, obviously).  To fail the message with a temp 450 error, see
            the "--dose" (die-on-sa-errors) option, below.

       --child-name-template or -cnt [<template]> "new in v2.61"
            Template for formatting child process name. Use a blank string (just the argument name without a value) to leave the child process name unchanged (will be same as parent command line).

            The template uses printf() style formatting, but with named parameter placeholders.  For example (wrapped for clarity):

              %base_name: child #%child_count(%child_status)
              [req %req_count/%req_max, time lst/avg/ttl %(req_time_last).4f/%(req_time_avg).4f/%(req_time_ttl).4f,
              ham/spm %req_ham/%req_spam, rules v%sa_rls_ver)]'

            Would produce something like:

              spampd: child #4(D) [req 8/30, time lst/avg/ttl 0.0222/0.0256/0.2045, ham/spm 3/5, rules v1891891]

            Parameters are specified like: "Value of %(my_name)s is %(my_float_value).4f", with names in parenthesis followed by a standard printf() style formatting specifier ("s" is default), or simply
            as "Value of %my_name is %my_value" with the default format being a string (works for numerics also). Keep in mind that any actual "%" characters need  to  be  escaped  as  "%%".   Formatting
            warnings will be logged as "sprintf" errors (most likely a parameter was misspelled).

            The following variables are available:

                base_name     # Base script name, eg. "spampd"
                spampd_ver    # SpamPD version, eg. "2.61"
                perl_ver      # Perl version, eg. "5.28.1"
                ns_ver        # Net::Server version, eg. "2.009"
                ns_typ        # Net::Server type, "PreFork" or "PreForkSimple"
                ns_typ_acr    # Net::Server type acronym, "PF" or "PFS"
                sa_ver        # SpamAassassin version, eg. "3.4.2"
                sa_rls_ver    # SpamAassassin rules update version, eg. "1891891" or "(unknown)"
                child_count   # total number of children launched so far (current child number)
                child_status  # child status, "C" for connected, or "D" for disconnected
                req_count     # number of requests child has processed so far
                req_max       # maximum child requests before exit
                req_time_last # [s] time to process the last message
                req_time_ttl  # [s] total processing time for this child
                req_time_avg  # [s] average processing time for this child (req_time_ttl / req_count)
                req_ham       # count of ham messages scored by child
                req_spam      # count of spam messages scored by child

       --pid or -p <filename>
            Specifies a filename where spampd will write its process ID so that it is easy to kill it later. The directory that will contain this file must be writable by the spampd user.

       --logfile or -o (syslog|stderr|<filename>) "new in v2.60"
            Logging method to use. May be one or more of:

            •    "syslog": Use the system's syslogd (via Sys::Syslog). Default setting.

            •    "stderr": Direct all logging to stderr (if running in background mode these may still end up in the default system log).

            •    "filename":  Use  the  specified file (the location must be accessible to the user spampd is running as). This can also be a device handle, eg: "/dev/tty0" or even "/dev/null" to disable
                 logging entirely.

            This option may be specified multiple times. You may also specify multiple destination by separating them with a ":" (colon): "--logfile stderr:/var/log/spampd.log"

            Simultaneous logging to "syslog", "stderr", and one "filename" is possible.  At this time only one log file can be used  at  a  time  (if  several  are  specified  then  the  last  one  takes
            precedence).

       --logsock or -ls <type> "new in v2.20"  "updated in v2.60"
            Syslog socket to use if "--logfile" is set to syslog.

            "Since v2.60:"

            The  type  can  be  any of the socket types or logging mechanisms as accepted by the subroutine Sys::Syslog::setlogsock(). Depending on the version of Sys::Syslog and the underlying operating
            system, one of the following values (or their subset) can be used:

              native, tcp, udp, inet, unix, stream, pipe, console, eventlog (Win32 only)

            The default behavior since spampd v2.60 is to let Sys::Syslog pick the default syslog socket. This is the recommended usage for Sys::Syslog (since v0.15), which chooses thusly:

              The default is to try native, tcp, udp, unix, pipe, stream, console. Under systems with the
              Win32 API, eventlog will be added as the first mechanism to try if Win32::EventLog is available.

            For more information please consult the Sys::Syslog <https://metacpan.org/pod/Sys::Syslog> documentation.

            To preserve backwards-compatibility, the default on HP-UX and SunOS (Solaris) systems is "inet".

            "Prior to v2.60:"

            The default was "unix" except on HP-UX and SunOS (Solaris) systems it is "inet".

       --logident or -li <name> "new in v2.60"
            Syslog identity name to use. This may also be used in log files written directly (w/out syslog).

       --logfacility or -lf <name> "new in v2.60"
            Syslog facility name to use. This is typically the name of the system-wide log file to be written to.

       --[no]detach [0|1] "new in v2.20"
            Tells spampd to detach from the console and fork into the background ("daemonize").  Using "--nodetach" can be useful for running under control of some daemon management tools or testing from
            a command line.

       --[no]setsid [0|1] "new in v2.51"
            If "--setsid" is specified then spampd will fork after the bind method to release itself from the command line and then run the POSIX::setsid()  command  to  truly  daemonize.  Only  used  if
            "--nodetach" isn't specified.

       --maxsize <n>
            The  maximum  message size to send to SpamAssassin, in KBytes. Messages over this size are not scanned at all, and an appropriate message is logged indicating this.  The size includes headers
            and attachments (if any).

       --dose [0|1]
            Acronym for (d)ie (o)n (s)pamAssassin (e)rrors. When disabled and spampd encounters a problem with processing the message through SpamAssassin (timeout or other error), it will still pass the
            mail on to the destination server.  When enabled, the mail is instead rejected with a temporary error (code 450, which means the origination server should keep retrying to send it).  See  the
            related "--satimeout" option, above.

       --tagall or -a [0|1]
            Tells  spampd  to  have  SpamAssassin  add headers to all scanned mail, not just spam.  Otherwise spampd will only rewrite messages which exceed the spam threshold score (as defined in the SA
            settings).  Note that for this option to work as of SA-2.50, the always_add_report and/or always_add_headers settings in your SpamAssassin local.cf need to be set to 1/true.

       --log-rules-hit or -rh [0|1]
            Logs the names of each SpamAssassin rule which matched the message being processed.  This list is returned by SA.

       --set-envelope-headers or -seh [0|1] "new in v2.30"
            Turns on addition of X-Envelope-To and X-Envelope-From headers to the mail being scanned before it is passed to SpamAssassin. The idea is to help SA process  any  blacklist/whitelist  to/from
            directives on the actual sender/recipients instead of the possibly bogus envelope headers. This potentially exposes the list of all recipients of that mail (even BCC'd ones).  Therefore usage
            of this option is discouraged.

            NOTE:  Even  though  spampd  tries  to  prevent  this  leakage  by  removing  the X-Envelope-To header after scanning, SpamAssassin itself might add headers that report recipient(s) listed in
            X-Envelope-To.

       --set-envelope-from or -sef [0|1] "new in v2.30"
            Same as above option but only enables the addition of X-Envelope-From header.  For those that don't feel comfortable with the possible information exposure of X-Envelope-To.  The above option
            overrides this one.

       --local-only or -L [0|1]
            Turn off all SA network-based tests (DNS, Razor, etc).

       --homedir <directory> "new in v2.40"
            Use the specified directory as home directory for the spamassassin process.  Things like the auto-whitelist and other plugin (razor/pyzor) files get written to here. A good place for this  is
            in the same place your "bayes_path" SA config setting points to (if any).  Make sure this directory is accessible to the user that spampd is running as.

            Thanks to Alexander Wirt for this fix.

       --saconfig <filename>
            Use the specified file for SpamAssassin configuration options in addition to the default local.cf file.  Any options specified here will override the same option from local.cf.

       --debug or -d [<area,...>|1|0] "(updated in v2.60)"
            Turns  on  SpamAssassin  debug  messages  which  print  to the system mail log (same log as spampd will log to).  Also turns on more verbose logging of what spampd is doing (new in v2).  Also
            increases log level of Net::Server to 4 (debug), adding yet more info (but not too much) (new in v2.2).

            "New in v2.60:"

            Setting the value to 1 (one) is the same as using no parameter (eg. simply -d).  The value of 0 (zero) disables debug logging.

            The area list is passed on directly to SpamAssassin and controls logging facilities. If no areas are listed (and debug  logging  is  enabled),  all  debugging  information  is  printed  (this
            equivalent  to  passing  "all"  as the area).  Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area individually; area is the area of the code to instrument. For example, to produce diagnostic
            output on bayes, learn, and dns, use:

                -d bayes,learn,dns

            You can also disable specific areas with the "no" prefix:

                -d all,norules,nobayes

            To show only spampd debug messages (none from SpamAssassin), use:

                -d spampd

            For more information about which areas (aka channels or facilities) are available, please see the documentation at:

            SpamAssassin Wiki::DebugChannels <http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels>

            Mail::SpamAssassin::Logger::add_facilities() <https://spamassassin.apache.org/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Logger.html#METHODS>

       --show <thing>[,<thing>[,...]] "new in v2.60"
            Meant primarily for debugging configuration settings (or code), this will print some information to the console and then exit.

            <thing> may be one or more of:

            •   "defaults": Show default values for all options, in a format suitable for a config file.

            •   "config": Shows option values after processing all given command-line arguments, including anything loaded from config file(s).

            •   "start": Shows the final configuration arguments after processing any config file(s).

            •   "version": Same as "--version" switch but runs after parsing all options and shows actual Net::Server type which would be used (PreFork or PreForkSimple).

            •   "argv": Shows anything remaining on command line (@ARGV) after processing all known arguments (this will be passed onto Net::Server).

            •   "self": Dumps the whole SpamPD object, including all settings. Trés geek.

            •   "all": Prints all of the above.

            Multiple "thing"s may be specified by using the --show option multiple times, or separating the items with a comma: "--show config,start,argv".

            Note that all thing options besides "defaults" and "config" require the Perl module Data::Dumper installed.

       --version "new in v2.52"
            Prints version information about SpamPD, Net::Server, SpamAssassin, and Perl.

       --help or -h or -? [txt]
       --hh or -?? [txt]
       --hhh or -??? [txt]
       --man or -hhhh or -???? [html|txt]
            Prints increasingly verbose usage information. By default help is displayed in "terminal" (groff) format with some text styling applied. If you want to use "less" as a pager, provide it  with
            the "-R" switch, eg.:

              spampd --??? | less -R

            Alternatively you can request plain-text format with the optional "txt" value.

            "--man"  displays the full documentation, optionally in "html" or plain text "txt" formats (default is to use actual "man" format/display). HTML version is saved to a temp file and an attempt
            is made to open it in the default system browser (it is better if the browser is already opened). If available, the optional Perl module HTML::Display is used to (try to) open a browser.

   Other Net::Server Options
       Net::Server supports some other options which spampd doesn't accept directly.  For example there are access control options, child process tuning, and a few more (see below).  Such options can  be
       passed  through  to  Net::Server  (and  subtypes)  by specifying them at the end of the spampd command line (or in a configuration file) following two dashes " -- " by themselves (this is a failry
       typicaly convention for passing options onto another program). As an example, it may look something like this:

         spampd --host 10.0.0.1 -port 10025 -- --cidr_allow 10.0.0.0/24

       The "--cidr_allow" after the " -- " is passed onto Net::Server. If the " -- " were not there, you would get an error from spampd about an unknown option.

       To specify Net::Server options in a configuration file, place them after two dashes ("--") on a line by themselves. See "CONFIGURATION FILE" for an example.

       This only makes sense with the few options not directly controlled by/through spampd.  As of Net::Server v2.009 the list is:

         reverse_lookups, allow, deny, cidr_allow, cidr_deny, chroot, ipv, conf_file,
         serialize, lock_file, check_for_dead, max_dequeue, check_for_dequeue

       If running in "Scalable Mode" then these settings from Net::Server::PreFork can also be very relevant to performance tuning:

         check_for_waiting, check_for_spawn, min_child_ttl

       Keep in mind that the Net::Server types inherit from each other: "PreFork" inherits from "PreForkSimple" which inherits from "Net::Server" itself. Which means all the options are also inherited.

       See the Net::Server(3) <https://https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Server#DEFAULT-ARGUMENTS-FOR-Net::Server>, Net::Server::PreForkSimple(3) <https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Server::PreForkSimple#COMMAND-
       LINE-ARGUMENTS>, and Net::Server::PreFork(3) <https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Server::PreFork#COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENTS> documentation for details.

   Deprecated Options
       The following options are no longer used but still accepted for backwards compatibility with prevoius spampd versions:

       --dead-letters
       --heloname
       --stop-at-threshold
       --add-sc-header
       --hostname
       --auto-whitelist or -aw "deprecated with SpamAssassin v3+"
            This option is no longer relevant with SA version 3.0 and above, which controls auto whitelist use via config file settings. Do not use it unless you must use an older SA  version.  An  error
            will be generated if attempting to use this option with SA 3.0 or above.

            For SA version < 3.0, turns on the SpamAssassin global whitelist feature.  See the SA docs. Note that per-user whitelists are not available.

            NOTE:  DBBasedAddrList  is  used as the storage mechanism. If you wish to use a different mechanism (such as SQLBasedAddrList), the spampd code will need to be modified in 2 instances (search
            the source for DBBasedAddrList).

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Since v2.60 spampd allows for the use of a configuration file to load server parameters.  One or more files can be specified on the command line (see "--config" option for more details on syntax).
       The format of a configuration file is simple key/value pairs. Comments (starting with # or ;) and blank lines are ignored. The option names are exactly  as  they  appear  above  in  the  "OPTIONS"
       section.  They can be listed with or w/out the "-"/"--" prefixes.  Key/value separator can be one or more of space, tab, or "=" (equal) sign.

       Multiple  configuration  files  can  be loaded, with the latter ones being able to override options loaded earlier. Any options specified on the command line will take precedence over options from
       file(s). Configuration file(s) are reloaded during a HUP-induced restart (see "SIGNALS"), making it possible to adjust settings dynamically on a running server.

       You may also provide "passthrough" options directly to Net::Server by putting them after a "--" on a line by itself (this is just like using the  lonesome  "--"  on  a  command  line;  see  "Other
       Net::Server Options").

       Note that one cannot use the "--config" option to load a file from within another file. A config file can only be specified on the command line.

       Use the "spampd --show defaults > spampd.config" command to generate a sample configuration file showing all default values. The example below demonstrates various valid syntax for the file.

         # Sample configuration file for SpamPD.

         # Double dashes
         --user    spampd

         # Single dash and = separator with spaces
         -pid = /var/run/spampd/spampd.pid

         # No dashes required, equals separator no spaces
         homedir=/var/cache/spampd

         # No dashes, space separator
         host  127.0.0.1

         # Disabled option (after comment character)
         #port  10025

         # Boolean values can be set/unset a number of ways:
         tagall      1
         local-only  0
         set-envelope-from
         no-log-rules-hit

         # Passthrough arguments for Net::Server[::PreFork[Simple]] could go here.
         # Be sure to also uncomment the "--" if using any.
         # --
         # cidr_allow      127.0.0.1/32

SIGNALS
       HUP  "updated in v2.60"
            Sending HUP signal to the master process will restart all the children gracefully (meaning the currently running requests will shut down once the request is complete).

            "Since v2.60":

            SpamAssassin  configuration  IS  reloaded on HUP. Any children currently in the middle of a transaction will finish with the previous SA config and then exit. A new set of children, using the
            new config, is spawned immediately upon HUP and will serve any new requests.

            In a similar manner, spampd will also reload its own settings from any configuration file(s) specified on the original command line with "--config" option (see  "OPTIONS"  and  "CONFIGURATION
            FILE").

            "Since v2.52": Children were restarted but SpamAssassin configuration was not reloaded.

            "Prior to v2.52": HUP would try to restart the server with all default settings (usually failing).

       TTIN, TTOU
            Sending TTIN signal to the master process will dynamically increase the number of children by one, and TTOU signal will decrease it by one.

       INT, TERM
            Sending INT or TERM signal to the master process will kill all the children immediately and shut down the daemon.

       QUIT Sending QUIT signal to the master process will perform a graceful shutdown, waiting for all children to finish processing any current transactions and then shutting down the parent process.

EXAMPLES
       Running between firewall/gateway and internal mail server:
            spampd listens on port 10025 on the same host as the internal mail server.

              spampd --host=192.168.1.10

            Same as above but spampd runs on port 10025 of the same host as the firewall/gateway and passes messages on to the internal mail server on another host.

              spampd --relayhost=192.168.1.10

       Using Postfix advanced content filtering example and disable SA network checks:
              spampd --port=10025 --relayhost=127.0.0.1:10026 --local-only

       Using UNIX sockets instead if INET ports:
            spampd listens on the UNIX socket "/var/run/spampd.socket" with persmissions 700 instead of a TCP port:

              spampd --socket /var/run/spampd.socket --socket-perms 700

            spampd will relay mail to "/var/run/dovecot/lmtp" instead of a TCP port:

              spampd --relaysocket /var/run/dovecot/lmtp

            Remember that the user spampd runs as needs to have read AND write permissions on the relaysocket!

       Also thanks to spamd (included with SpamAssassin) and amavisd-new (<http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/>) for some tricks.

       Various people have contributed patches, bug reports, and ideas, all of whom I would like to thank.  I have tried to include credits in code comments and in the change log, as appropriate.
