NAME
       Object::Declare - Declarative object constructor

VERSION
       version 0.25

SYNOPSIS
           use Object::Declare ['MyApp::Column', 'MyApp::Param'];

           my %objects = declare {

           param foo =>
              !is global,
               is immutable,
               valid_values are qw( more values );

           column bar =>
               field1 is 'value',
               field2 is 'some_other_value',
               sub_params are param( is happy ), param ( is sad );

           };

           print $objects{foo}; # a MyApp::Param object
           print $objects{bar}; # a MyApp::Column object

           # Assuming that MyApp::Column::new simply blesses into a hash...
           print $objects{bar}{sub_params}[0]; # a MyApp::Param object
           print $objects{bar}{sub_params}[1]; # a MyApp::Param object

DESCRIPTION
       This module exports one function, "declare", for building named objects with a declarative syntax, similar to how Jifty::DBI::Schema defines its columns.

       In list context, "declare" returns a list of name/object pairs in the order of declaration (allowing duplicates), suitable for putting into a hash.  In scalar context, "declare" returns a hash
       reference.

       Using a flexible "import" interface, one can change exported helper functions names (declarator), words to link labels and values together (copula), and the table of named classes to declare
       (mapping):

           use Object::Declare
               declarator  => ['declare'],     # list of declarators
               copula      => {                # list of words, or a map
                   is  => '',                  #  from copula to label prefixes,
                   are => '',                  #  or to callback that e.g. turns
                   has => sub { has => @_ },   #  "has X" to "has is X" and
                                               #  "X has 1" to "has is [X => 1]"
               },
               aliases     => {                # list of label aliases:
                   more => 'less',             #  turns "is more" into "is less"
                                               #  and "more is 1" into "less is 1"
               },
               mapping     => {
                   column => 'MyApp::Column',  # class name to call ->new to
                   param  => sub {             # arbitrary coderef also works
                       bless(\@_, 'MyApp::Param');
                   },
               };

       After the declarator block finishes execution, all helper functions are removed from the package.  Same-named functions (such as &is and &are) that existed before the declarator's execution are
       restored correctly.

NOTES
       If you export the declarator to another package via @EXPORT, be sure to export all mapping keys as well.  For example, this will work for the example above:

           our @EXPORT = qw( declare column param );

       But this will not:

           our @EXPORT = qw( declare );

       The copula are not turned into functions, so there is no need to export them.
