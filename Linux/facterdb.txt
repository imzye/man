NAME
       facterdb - Get a JSON fact set from the facterdb facts database

SYNOPSIS
       facterdb <json_filter>

DESCRIPTION
       The facterdb tool lets you obtain a JSON-formatted data structure from the facts database that the facterdb library provides. Facts are selected using a filter properly formatted for jgrep.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       FACTERDB_SEARCH_PATHS
         List of paths that contain external facts that will complement the
         default facterdb database.

         When separating paths please use the default path separator character
         supported by your OS:

         - Unix/Linux/OSX = :
         - Windows = ;

         Each fact set you create must meet the following requirements:

         - A JSON serialized file containing a single Hash of all the facts.
         - The facts file must end in .facts
         - Must be placed inside some directory. You can organize this directory
           however you like.

       FACTERDB_SKIP_DEFAULTDB
         If this is variable is set (to any value), it will instruct facterdb to
         not look at its built-in facts which can be useful should you need to
         completely replace which facts are used. You would most likely use this
         in combination with the FACTERDB_SEARCH_PATHS environment variable.

       FACTERDB_INJECT_SOURCE
           If this environment variable is set to any value, the following facts
           are injected into all fact sets:

         - _facterdb_path: The base name of the file used to load this fact set
           e.g. centos-5-i386.facts
         - _facterdb_filename : The full path of the file used to load this fact
           set e.g. /project/facter-db/centos-5-i386.facts

EXAMPLES
       Get facts for facter 2.4 that are either from Debian 7 or RedHat 7:

          facterdb 'facterversion=/^2.4\./ and (operatingsystem=Debian and operatingsystemrelease>=7 or operatingsystem=RedHat and operatingsystemrelease=/^7/)'
