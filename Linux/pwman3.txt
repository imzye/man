NAME
       pwman3 - command line password manager

SYNOPSIS
       pwman3 [OPTIONS]

       pwman3 --help

DESCRIPTION
       Pwman3 aims to provide a simple but powerful command line interface for password management. It allows one to store your password in a SQLite database locked by a master password which can be
       encrypted with different algorithms (e.g AES, Blowfish, DES3, IDEA, etc.).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
         Display help message and exit.

       -c FILE, --config FILE
         Read the configuration from FILE instead of the default ~/.pwman3/config.

       -d DATABASE, --database DATABASE
         When using the default SQLite backend, use DATABASE file path to read/store passwords.

       -e ALGO, --encryption=ALGO
         Use ALGO to encrypt data. Possible values are: AES , ARC2, ARC4, Blowfish, CAST, DES, DES3, IDEA, RC5. The default encryption algorithm used is AES.

       -k, --convert
         Convert old DB format to version >= 0.4. The database that will be converted is the one found in the config file, or the one given as command line argument.

       -O, --output OUTPUT
         Use OUTPUT as file path for the newly created database after converting.
