NAME
       kmerresistance - correlates mapped genes with the predicted species of WGS samples

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       KmerResistance  correlates  mapped  genes with the predicted species of WGS samples, where this this allows for identification of genes in samples which have been poorly sequenced or high accuracy
       predictions for samples with contamination. KmerResistance has one dependency, namely KMA to perform the mapping, which is also freely available.
