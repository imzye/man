NAME
       nrpe - Nagios Remote Plugin Executor - Server

SYNOPSIS
       nagios-nrpe [-n] -c <config_file> [-4|-6] <mode>

DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of this addon is to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on a remote host in as transparent a manner as possible.

       This program runs as a background process on the remote host and processes command execution requests from the check_nrpe plugin on the Nagios host.

OPTIONS
       -n               = Do not use SSL

       -c <config_file> = Name of config file to use

       -4               = Use IPv4 only

       -6               = Use IPv6 only

       <mode>           = One of the following two operating modes:

         -i             =    Run as a service under inetd or xinetd

         -d             =    Run as a standalone daemon

         -d -s          =    Run as a subsystem under AIX

         -f             =    Don't fork() for systemd, launchd, etc.

       Notes: This program is designed to process requests from the check_nrpe plugin on the host(s) running Nagios.  It can run as a service under inetd or xinetd (read the docs for info on this), or as
       a  standalone  daemon.  Once a request is received from an authorized host, NRPE will execute the command/plugin (as defined in the config file) and return the plugin output and return code to the
       check_nrpe plugin.
