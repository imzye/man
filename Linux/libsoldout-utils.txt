NAME
       mkd2man — convert a markdown document into an mdoc manual page

SYNOPSIS
       mkd2man [-h] [-d date] [-s section] [-t title] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       mkd2man utility reads file and generates mdoc(7) input from markdown source.  If unspecified, file is taken to be standard input.

       The options are as follows:

       -d, --date
               set  the  document date (‘Dd’) to date (preferrably in "Month Day, Year" format).  If unspecified, mkd2man uses the file modification date or current date if reading is from standard input
               or if stat(2) fails.

       -h, --help
               display help text.

       -s, --section
               set the document section (‘Dt’) to section.  If unspecified, mkd2man uses 1.

       -t, --title
               set the document title (‘Dt’) to title.  If unspecified, mkd2man uses the suffix-stripped filename part of file.  When reading is from stdin the title must be specified.

EXIT STATUS
       The mkd2man utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
