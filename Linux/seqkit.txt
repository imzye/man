NAME
       seqkit - cross-platform and ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q file manipulation

DESCRIPTION
       SeqKit -- a cross-platform and ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q file manipulation

       Version: 2.1.0

       Seqkit utlizies the pgzip (https://github.com/klauspost/pgzip) package to read and write gzip file, and the outputted gzip file would be slighty larger than files generated by GNU gzip.

       Seqkit writes gzip files very fast, much faster than the multi-threaded pigz, therefore there's no need to pipe the result to gzip/pigz.

   Usage:
              seqkit [command]

   Available Commands:
       amplicon
              extract amplicon (or specific region around it) via primer(s)

       bam    monitoring and online histograms of BAM record features

       common find common sequences of multiple files by id/name/sequence

       concat concatenate sequences with same ID from multiple files

       convert
              convert FASTQ quality encoding between Sanger, Solexa and Illumina

       duplicate
              duplicate sequences N times

       faidx  create FASTA index file and extract subsequence

       fish   look for short sequences in larger sequences using local alignment

       fq2fa  convert FASTQ to FASTA

       fx2tab convert FASTA/Q to tabular format (and length, GC content, average quality...)

              genautocomplete  generate shell autocompletion script (bash|zsh|fish|powershell) grep            search sequences by ID/name/sequence/sequence motifs, mismatch allowed head            print
              first N FASTA/Q records head-genome     print sequences of the first genome with common prefixes in name locate          locate subsequences/motifs, mismatch  allowed  mutate           edit
              sequence  (point  mutation,  insertion,  deletion)  pair             match  up  paired-end  reads  from  two  fastq files range           print FASTA/Q records in a range (start:end) rename
              rename duplicated IDs replace         replace name/sequence by regular expression restart         reset start position for circular genome rmdup            remove  duplicated  sequences  by
              ID/name/sequence  sample           sample  sequences  by  number  or proportion sana            sanitize broken single line FASTQ files scat            real time recursive concatenation and
              streaming of fastx files seq             transform sequences (extract ID, filter by length, remove gaps...)  shuffle         shuffle sequences sliding         extract subsequences in  slid‐
              ing  windows  sort             sort  sequences by id/name/sequence/length split           split sequences into files by id/seq region/size/parts (mainly for FASTA) split2          split se‐
              quences into files by size/parts (FASTA, PE/SE FASTQ) stats           simple statistics of FASTA/Q files subseq          get subsequences by  region/gtf/bed,  including  flanking  sequences
              tab2fx           convert  tabular  format  to FASTA/Q format translate       translate DNA/RNA to protein sequence (supporting ambiguous bases) version         print version information and
              check for update watch           monitoring and online histograms of sequence features

   Flags:
       --alphabet-guess-seq-length int
              length of sequence prefix of the first FASTA record based on which seqkit guesses the sequence type (0 for whole seq) (default 10000)

       -h, --help
              help for seqkit

       --id-ncbi
              FASTA head is NCBI-style, e.g. >gi|110645304|ref|NC_002516.2| Pseud...

       --id-regexp string
              regular expression for parsing ID (default "^(\\S+)\\s?")

       --infile-list string
              file of input files list (one file per line), if given, they are appended to files from cli arguments

       -w, --line-width int
              line width when outputting FASTA format (0 for no wrap) (default 60)

       -o, --out-file string
              out file ("-" for stdout, suffix .gz for gzipped out) (default "-")

       --quiet
              be quiet and do not show extra information

       -t, --seq-type string
              sequence type (dna|rna|protein|unlimit|auto) (for auto, it automatically detect by the first sequence) (default "auto")

       -j, --threads int
              number of CPUs. can also set with environment variable SEQKIT_THREADS) (default 4)

       Use "seqkit [command] --help" for more information about a command.
