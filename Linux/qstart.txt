NAME
       qstart - start pbs batch job processing at a destination

SYNOPSIS
       qstart destination ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  qstart  command directs that a destination should process batch jobs.  If the destination is an execution queue, the server will begin to schedule jobs that reside in the queue for execution.  If
       the destination is a routing queue, the server will begin to route jobs from that queue.

       In order to execute qstart, the user must have PBS Operation or Manager privilege.

OPERANDS
       The qstart command accepts one or more destination operands.  The operands are one of three forms:
            queue
            @server
            queue@server
       If queue is specified, the request is to start that queue at the default server.  If the @server form is given, the request is to start all queues at that server.  If a  full  destination  identifier,
       queue@server, is given, the request is to start the named queue at the named server.

STANDARD ERROR
       The qstart command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qstart command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qstart command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
