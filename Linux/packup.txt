NAME
       PackUP --  PACKage Upgradability Problem solver

SYNOPSIS
       packup [OPTIONS] input_file_name [output_file_name]

DESCRIPTION
       packup  is a solver for the package upgradability problem specified in CUDF [TZ09].  It repeatedly invokes an optimization pseudo-Boolean solver in order to solve the problem.  By default minisat+
       [ES06] is used for that purpose but a different solver can be used by specifying the pertaining command line option.

       If input_file_name is '-', input is read from the standard input.  If the output_file_name is omitted, output is produced to the standard output.

OPTIONS
       -t     Use trendy  criterion

       -p     Use  paranoid criterion

       -u cs  Use user criterion cs.  A criterion is a lexicographic combination of the utility functions removed, notuptodate, unmet_recommends, new, and changed.  Each of them with a polarity ("+"  for
              a  function  to  maximize,  "-"  for a function to minimize). The functions are listed in decreasing order of priority, and separated by the symbol ",". For instance, the paranoid criterion
              could be written as -removed,-changed.  For more details see: http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-live/20101126/criteria/

       --external-solver
              command for the external solver default 'minisat+ -ansi'

       --multiplication-string
              string between coefficients and variables when communicating to the solver, default '*'

       --temporary-directory DIR
              directory where temporary files are created. If this option is not given then the value of $TMPDIR is used if defined, otherwise temporary files are placed in '/tmp'.

       --leave-temporary-files
              do not delete temporary files
