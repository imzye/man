NAME
       patchperl - patch a perl source tree

VERSION
       version 2.14

SYNOPSIS
         patchperl

COMMAND LINE SWITCHES
       "--version"
           Prints the version of Devel::PatchPerl to STDOUT and exits

       "--patchlevel"
           Devel::PatchPerl  will  normally  update  the  "patchlevel.h" file in the perl source tree to indicate that it has applied local patches. This behaviour is negated if it is detected that it is
           operating in a git repository. To override this and update "patchlevel.h" when in a Git repository use this switch.
