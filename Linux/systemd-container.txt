NAME
       systemd.nspawn - Container settings

SYNOPSIS
           /etc/systemd/nspawn/machine.nspawn
           /run/systemd/nspawn/machine.nspawn
           /var/lib/machines/machine.nspawn

DESCRIPTION
       An nspawn container settings file (suffix .nspawn) contains runtime configuration for a local container, and is used by systemd-nspawn(1). Files of this type are named after the containers they
       define settings for. They are optional, and only required for containers whose execution environment shall differ from the defaults. Files of this type mostly contain settings that may also be set
       on the systemd-nspawn command line, and make it easier to persistently attach specific settings to specific containers. The syntax of these files is inspired by .desktop files, similarly to other
       configuration files supported by the systemd project. See systemd.syntax(7) for an overview.

.NSPAWN FILE DISCOVERY
       Files are searched for by appending the .nspawn suffix to the machine name of the container, as specified with the --machine= switch of systemd-nspawn, or derived from the directory or image file
       name. This file is first searched for in /etc/systemd/nspawn/ and /run/systemd/nspawn/. If found there, the settings are read and all of them take full effect (but may still be overridden by
       corresponding command line arguments). Otherwise, the file will then be searched for next to the image file or in the immediate parent of the root directory of the container. If the file is found
       there, only a subset of the settings will take effect however. All settings that possibly elevate privileges or grant additional access to resources of the host (such as files or directories) are
       ignored. To which options this applies is documented below.

       Persistent settings files created and maintained by the administrator (and thus trusted) should be placed in /etc/systemd/nspawn/, while automatically downloaded (and thus potentially untrusted)
       settings files are placed in /var/lib/machines/ instead (next to the container images), where their security impact is limited. In order to add privileged settings to .nspawn files acquired from
       the image vendor, it is recommended to copy the settings files into /etc/systemd/nspawn/ and edit them there, so that the privileged options become available. The precise algorithm for how the
       files are searched and interpreted may be configured with systemd-nspawn's --settings= switch, see systemd-nspawn(1) for details.

[EXEC] SECTION OPTIONS
       Settings files may include an [Exec] section, which carries various execution parameters:

       Boot=
           Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off. If enabled, systemd-nspawn will automatically search for an init executable and invoke it. In this case, the specified parameters using
           Parameters= are passed as additional arguments to the init process. This setting corresponds to the --boot switch on the systemd-nspawn command line. This option may not be combined with
           ProcessTwo=yes. This option is specified by default in the systemd-nspawn@.service template unit.

           Added in version 226.

       Ephemeral=
           Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off, If enabled, the container is run with a temporary snapshot of its file system that is removed immediately when the container terminates. This
           is equivalent to the --ephemeral command line switch. See systemd-nspawn(1) for details about the specific options supported.

           Added in version 240.

       ProcessTwo=
           Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off. If enabled, the specified program is run as PID 2. A stub init process is run as PID 1. This setting corresponds to the --as-pid2 switch on the
           systemd-nspawn command line. This option may not be combined with Boot=yes.

           Added in version 229.

       Parameters=
           Takes a whitespace-separated list of arguments. Single ("'") and double (""") quotes may be used around arguments with whitespace. This is either a command line, beginning with the binary name
           to execute, or – if Boot= is enabled – the list of arguments to pass to the init process. This setting corresponds to the command line parameters passed on the systemd-nspawn command line.

           Note: Boot=no, Parameters=a b "c c" is the same as systemd-nspawn a b "c c", and Boot=yes, Parameters=b 'c c' is the same as systemd-nspawn --boot b 'c c'.

           Added in version 226.

       Environment=
           Takes an environment variable assignment consisting of key and value, separated by "=". Sets an environment variable for the main process invoked in the container. This setting may be used
           multiple times to set multiple environment variables. It corresponds to the --setenv= command line switch.

           Added in version 226.

       User=
           Takes a UNIX user name. Specifies the user name to invoke the main process of the container as. This user must be known in the container's user database. This corresponds to the --user=
           command line switch.

           Added in version 226.

       WorkingDirectory=
           Selects the working directory for the process invoked in the container. Expects an absolute path in the container's file system namespace. This corresponds to the --chdir= command line switch.

           Added in version 229.

       PivotRoot=
           Selects a directory to pivot to / inside the container when starting up. Takes a single path, or a pair of two paths separated by a colon. Both paths must be absolute, and are resolved in the
           container's file system namespace. This corresponds to the --pivot-root= command line switch.

           Added in version 233.

       Capability=, DropCapability=
           Takes a space-separated list of Linux process capabilities (see capabilities(7) for details). The Capability= setting specifies additional capabilities to pass on top of the default set of
           capabilities. The DropCapability= setting specifies capabilities to drop from the default set. These settings correspond to the --capability= and --drop-capability= command line switches. Note
           that Capability= is a privileged setting, and only takes effect in .nspawn files in /etc/systemd/nspawn/ and /run/system/nspawn/ (see above). On the other hand, DropCapability= takes effect in
           all cases. If the special value "all" is passed, all capabilities are retained (or dropped).

           These settings change the bounding set of capabilities which also limits the ambient capabilities as given with the AmbientCapability=.

           Added in version 226.

       AmbientCapability=
           Takes a space-separated list of Linux process capabilities (see capabilities(7) for details). The AmbientCapability= setting specifies capabilities which will be passed to the started program
           in the inheritable and ambient capability sets. This will grant these capabilities to this process. This setting correspond to the --ambient-capability= command line switch.

           The value "all" is not supported for this setting.

           The setting of AmbientCapability= must be covered by the bounding set settings which were established by Capability= and DropCapability=.

           Note that AmbientCapability= is a privileged setting (see above).

           Added in version 248.

       NoNewPrivileges=
           Takes a boolean argument that controls the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS flag for the container payload. This is equivalent to the --no-new-privileges= command line switch. See systemd-nspawn(1) for
           details.

           Added in version 239.

       KillSignal=
           Specify the process signal to send to the container's PID 1 when nspawn itself receives SIGTERM, in order to trigger an orderly shutdown of the container. Defaults to SIGRTMIN+3 if Boot= is
           used (on systemd-compatible init systems SIGRTMIN+3 triggers an orderly shutdown). For a list of valid signals, see signal(7).

           Added in version 230.

       Personality=
           Configures the kernel personality for the container. This is equivalent to the --personality= switch.

           Added in version 226.

       MachineID=
           Configures the 128-bit machine ID (UUID) to pass to the container. This is equivalent to the --uuid= command line switch. This option is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 226.

       PrivateUsers=
           Configures support for usernamespacing. This is equivalent to the --private-users= command line switch, and takes the same options. This option is privileged (see above). This option is the
           default if the systemd-nspawn@.service template unit file is used.

           Added in version 230.

       NotifyReady=
           Configures support for notifications from the container's init process. This is equivalent to the --notify-ready= command line switch, and takes the same parameters. See systemd-nspawn(1) for
           details about the specific options supported.

           Added in version 231.

       SystemCallFilter=
           Configures the system call filter applied to containers. This is equivalent to the --system-call-filter= command line switch, and takes the same list parameter. See systemd-nspawn(1) for
           details.

           Added in version 235.

       LimitCPU=, LimitFSIZE=, LimitDATA=, LimitSTACK=, LimitCORE=, LimitRSS=, LimitNOFILE=, LimitAS=, LimitNPROC=, LimitMEMLOCK=, LimitLOCKS=, LimitSIGPENDING=, LimitMSGQUEUE=, LimitNICE=, LimitRTPRIO=,
       LimitRTTIME=
           Configures various types of resource limits applied to containers. This is equivalent to the --rlimit= command line switch, and takes the same arguments. See systemd-nspawn(1) for details.

           Added in version 239.

       OOMScoreAdjust=
           Configures the OOM score adjustment value. This is equivalent to the --oom-score-adjust= command line switch, and takes the same argument. See systemd-nspawn(1) for details.

           Added in version 239.

       CPUAffinity=
           Configures the CPU affinity. This is equivalent to the --cpu-affinity= command line switch, and takes the same argument. See systemd-nspawn(1) for details.

           Added in version 239.

       Hostname=
           Configures the kernel hostname set for the container. This is equivalent to the --hostname= command line switch, and takes the same argument. See systemd-nspawn(1) for details.

           Added in version 239.

       ResolvConf=
           Configures how /etc/resolv.conf in the container shall be handled. This is equivalent to the --resolv-conf= command line switch, and takes the same argument. See systemd-nspawn(1) for details.

           Added in version 239.

       Timezone=
           Configures how /etc/localtime in the container shall be handled. This is equivalent to the --timezone= command line switch, and takes the same argument. See systemd-nspawn(1) for details.

           Added in version 239.

       LinkJournal=
           Configures how to link host and container journal setups. This is equivalent to the --link-journal= command line switch, and takes the same parameter. See systemd-nspawn(1) for details.

           Added in version 239.

       SuppressSync=
           Configures whether to suppress disk synchronization for the container payload. This is equivalent to the --suppress-sync= command line switch, and takes the same parameter. See systemd-
           nspawn(1) for details.

           Added in version 250.

[FILES] SECTION OPTIONS
       Settings files may include a [Files] section, which carries various parameters configuring the file system of the container:

       ReadOnly=
           Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off. If specified, the container will be run with a read-only file system. This setting corresponds to the --read-only command line switch.

           Added in version 226.

       Volatile=
           Takes a boolean argument, or the special value "state". This configures whether to run the container with volatile state and/or configuration. This option is equivalent to --volatile=, see
           systemd-nspawn(1) for details about the specific options supported.

           Added in version 226.

       Bind=, BindReadOnly=
           Adds a bind mount from the host into the container. Takes a single path, a pair of two paths separated by a colon, or a triplet of two paths plus an option string separated by colons. This
           option may be used multiple times to configure multiple bind mounts. This option is equivalent to the command line switches --bind= and --bind-ro=, see systemd-nspawn(1) for details about the
           specific options supported. This setting is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 226.

       BindUser=
           Binds a user from the host into the container. This option is equivalent to the command line switch --bind-user=, see systemd-nspawn(1) for details about the specific options supported. This
           setting is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 249.

       BindUserShell=
           When used with BindUser, specifies the shell that is included in the user record of users bound from the host into the container. This option is equivalent to the command line switch
           --bind-user-shell=, see systemd-nspawn(1) for details about the specific options supported. This setting is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 258.

       TemporaryFileSystem=
           Adds a "tmpfs" mount to the container. Takes a path or a pair of path and option string, separated by a colon. This option may be used multiple times to configure multiple "tmpfs" mounts. This
           option is equivalent to the command line switch --tmpfs=, see systemd-nspawn(1) for details about the specific options supported. This setting is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 226.

       Inaccessible=
           Masks the specified file or directory in the container, by over-mounting it with an empty file node of the same type with the most restrictive access mode. Takes a file system path as
           argument. This option may be used multiple times to mask multiple files or directories. This option is equivalent to the command line switch --inaccessible=, see systemd-nspawn(1) for details
           about the specific options supported. This setting is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 242.

       Overlay=, OverlayReadOnly=
           Adds an overlay mount point. Takes a colon-separated list of paths. This option may be used multiple times to configure multiple overlay mounts. This option is equivalent to the command line
           switches --overlay= and --overlay-ro=, see systemd-nspawn(1) for details about the specific options supported. This setting is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 233.

       PrivateUsersOwnership=
           Configures whether the ownership of the files and directories in the container tree shall be adjusted to the UID/GID range used, if necessary and user namespacing is enabled. This is
           equivalent to the --private-users-ownership= command line switch. This option is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 249.

[NETWORK] SECTION OPTIONS
       Settings files may include a [Network] section, which carries various parameters configuring the network connectivity of the container:

       Private=
           Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off. If enabled, the container will run in its own network namespace and not share network interfaces and configuration with the host. This setting
           corresponds to the --private-network command line switch.

           Added in version 226.

       VirtualEthernet=
           Takes a boolean argument. Configures whether to create a virtual Ethernet connection ("veth") between host and the container. This setting implies Private=yes. This setting corresponds to the
           --network-veth command line switch. This option is the default if the systemd-nspawn@.service template unit file is used.

           Added in version 226.

       VirtualEthernetExtra=
           Takes a colon-separated pair of interface names. Configures an additional virtual Ethernet connection ("veth") between host and the container. The first specified name is the interface name on
           the host, the second the interface name in the container. The latter may be omitted in which case it is set to the same name as the host side interface. This setting implies Private=yes. This
           setting corresponds to the --network-veth-extra= command line switch, and may be used multiple times. It is independent of VirtualEthernet=. Note that this option is unrelated to the Bridge=
           setting below, and thus any connections created this way are not automatically added to any bridge device on the host side. This option is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 228.

       Interface=
           Takes a space-separated list of interfaces to add to the container. The interface object is defined either by a single interface name, referencing the name on the host, or a colon-separated
           pair of interfaces, in which case the first one references the name on the host, and the second one the name in the container. This option corresponds to the --network-interface= command line
           switch and implies Private=yes. This option is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 226.

       MACVLAN=, IPVLAN=
           Takes a space-separated list of interfaces to add MACLVAN or IPVLAN interfaces to, which are then added to the container. The interface object is defined either by a single interface name,
           referencing the name on the host, or a colon-separated pair of interfaces, in which case the first one references the name on the host, and the second one the name in the container. These
           options correspond to the --network-macvlan= and --network-ipvlan= command line switches and imply Private=yes. These options are privileged (see above).

           Added in version 226.

       Bridge=
           Takes an interface name. This setting implies VirtualEthernet=yes and Private=yes and has the effect that the host side of the created virtual Ethernet link is connected to the specified
           bridge interface. This option corresponds to the --network-bridge= command line switch. This option is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 226.

       Zone=
           Takes a network zone name. This setting implies VirtualEthernet=yes and Private=yes and has the effect that the host side of the created virtual Ethernet link is connected to an automatically
           managed bridge interface named after the passed argument, prefixed with "vz-". This option corresponds to the --network-zone= command line switch. This option is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 230.

       Port=
           Exposes a TCP or UDP port of the container on the host. This option corresponds to the --port= command line switch, see systemd-nspawn(1) for the precise syntax of the argument this option
           takes. This option is privileged (see above).

           Added in version 226.
