NAME
       pForth - an ANS Forth interpreter written in ANSI 'C'

SYNOPSIS
       pforth [options] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       pForth is an interpreter for the ANS Forth language.  It implements the Core, Core Extensions, File-Access, Floating-Point, Locals, Programming-Tools, and Strings word sets.

       Any files specified on the command line will be processed as if typed.  This is useful for scripting.

OPTIONS
       -d<filename.dic>
              Specify an alternate dictionary.  By default, pforth.dic will be searched for first in the current directory, and then in /usr/lib/pforth.

       -i     Initialization mode, used for creating an initial dictionary.

       -q     Quiet mode.

SEE ALSO
       There are some other pForth docs in /usr/doc/pforth, and a web page at http://www.softsynth.com/pforth/.

       Information on Forth in general is available from the Forth Interest Group web site at http://www.forth.org/.
