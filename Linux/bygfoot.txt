NAME
       bygfoot - football (a.k.a soccer) management game.

SYNOPSIS
       bygfoot [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the bygfoot

       bygfoot allows you to manage a team by training the players, buying and
        selling them, contracting loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be
        promoted or relegated, even become a champion if you're a skillful manager.The
        game is deliberately kept simple (though not easy): you only have to keep one
        eye at your players and another at your stadium. You can customise Bygfoot by
        writing your own country definition files or by creating your own team definition.
