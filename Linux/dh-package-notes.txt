NAME
       dh_package_notes - Add package metadata to ELF header

SYNOPSIS
       dh_package_notes

DESCRIPTION
       dh_package_notes provides a linker specs file to include package metadata in ELF binaries built by packages.

       The package metadata specification for ELF binaries can be found at <https://systemd.io/ELF_PACKAGE_METADATA/>.

       dh_package_notes provides a linker specs file at /usr/share/debhelper/dh_package_notes/debian-package-notes.specs which can be used by including
       /usr/share/debhelper/dh_package_notes/package-notes.mk at the top of debian/rules. This will export the right environment variables that will result in a package note ELF section being added to
       all packaged ELF files, with the package type set to deb, the package name and version set to the source package name and version respectively, the OS set to Debian and debuginfod URL set to
       https://debuginfod.debian.net. On Ubuntu, the OS will be set to Ubuntu and debuginfod URL will be set to https://debuginfod.ubuntu.com.

       Note that it is not sufficient to build-depend on this package, the include must be used at the top of debian/rules for this to be enabled.
