NAME
       meterec - console multitrack audio recorder

SYNOPSIS
       meterec [ -tpcih ] [ -r ref-level ] [ -o output-format ] [ -s session-name ] [ -j jack-name ] [ -f frequency ] [ -u uuid ]

DESCRIPTION
       meterec real-time jack ports vu-meter, records specified ports to take file and replays selected take(s).

OPTIONS
       -r ref-level
              Adjust the 0dB reference level of the port vu-meter.

       -o output-format
              ´w64´, 'wav', 'ogg' or 'flac'. Format of the take files produced when recording. The same session can use different formats subsequently. Defaults to 'w64' or 'wav'.

       -s <session-name>, -s <session-file>
              Name  of  the  session  beeing  recorded. If a file called <session-name>.mrec exists, meterec will execute from the current directory.  if a file called <session-file> exists, meterec will
              change to it's base directory before executing.  defaults to ´./meterec.mrec´.

       -j jack-name
              Name of the meterec client in the jack graph. This name should be specified if using several meterec instances on the same jack server. Using the same <jack-name> for multiple  meterec  in‐
              stances is not supported.  Defaults to ´meterec´

       -f frequency
              Set the display refresh rate in frames per second. This setting does not affects the pace at wich command keys can be used, nor the meter peak value fall time.

       -u uuid
              Universal  unique  identifyer used by jack-session save/restore managers.  WARNING: jack-session requests that directory holding session restore data is erased before session is saved! Make
              sure you do not use the meterec-session directory or a parent directory to save your jack-session: this would erase all previously recoded audio as well as configuration data for  this  me‐
              terec-session.

       -t     Start recording at startup. Default is to start in playback mode. With this option a new take will be captured at startup. This allows to call meterec from a script or do a quick take right
              from the shell. If recording should only be starting upon user action or when jack-transport goes to roll state, use this option along with -p option.

       -p     Do not playback at startup. Default is to start in playback mode. Use this option if you want meterec to wait for user input of jack-transport to start playback.

       -i     Do  not  interact  with  jack-transport  state.  By  default meterec will set jack-transport state when user start or stop playback and playback will start or stop when jack-transport state
              changes.

       -c     Do not connect automatically to jack ports. By default meterec will use the list of connections stored in <jack-session>.mrec to connect it's ports to other jack clients at startup as  well
              as when these ports becomes available.

       -h     Show options and command keys summary.

COMMAND KEYS (all views)
       q      Quit

       <TAB>  Switch between the different ´views´: vu-meter, edit, connections.

       <SPACE>
              Start playback, stop playback. unless -i option is used, the jack-transport state will be updated so the other jack clients supporting jack-transport are syncronised with meterec.

       <ENTER>
              Start recording, stop playback and record. At least one port should be in one of the recording modes for recording to start. Also updates jack-transport state.

       <BKSPS>
              when record is already ongoing, this creates a new take on the fly. This operation allows to have subsequent takes without any gaps in audio. When recording is not ongoing this key will en‐
              gage the record mode: the recording of audio is pending until playback starts.  This allows to have meterec start recording when jack-transport state goes to ´roll´

       <UP>   Select port above in the list. Will wrap at list boundaries.

       <DOWN> Well... Select port bellow in the list. Will wrap at list boundaries.

       v      Reset maximum level vu-meter markers. Each port will record the maximum signal level reached and display it with a column char ':'. It is sometime usefull to reset these markers for a fresh
              start.

       n      Toggle port names display. Since the port name is located over the vu-meter display it might be annoying when reading levels.

       i      Insert name. Helps tidy you workspace by giving each port a meaningfull name.

       t      Toggles pass-thru for this port. Depending on the instrument plugged in, it is usefull to have the live audio at the input side available at the output side.

       T      Toggles pass thru for all ports.

       m      Mute/unmute  that  port  playback.  No recoded audio for this port will be played when this port is muted.  The audio data coming from the input side due to ´pass-thru´ beeing active is not
              muted.

       M      Mute/unmute all ports playback.

       s      Mute all but that port playback (solo). Note this is not standard ´solo´ approach found in mixers as you cannot ´solo´ several ports at the same time.

       S      Unmute all ports playback.

       r      toggle REC record mode for that port. Available audio from previous take will not be played back when recording.

       R      toggle REC record mode for all ports

       d      toggle DUB record mode for that port. Available audio from previous take will played along when recording.  The resulting take will contain only audio played during the last take.

       D      toggle DUB record mode for all ports

       o      toggle OVR record mode for that port. Available audio from previous take will played along when recording.  The resulting take will contain a mix of audio played during the  last  take  and
              audio from previous take. When using this record mode, you should use take-locking to precisely control what is the track that will be mixed when recodring. Remeber to remove the lock to be
              able to ear the result!

       O      toggle OVR record mode for all ports

       <SHIFT>F1-F12
              Set time index. Current playhead position will be stored in this index.

       F1-F12 Jump to time index. When playback is ongoing, playhead will jump to stored time index. No action if this time index is not set or if in record state.

       <CTRL>F1-F12
              Use  time  index  as  loop boundary. Will be used at upper or lower bound depending on time index value and already programmed loop boundary. If the time index was not set, current playhead
              time will be used and stored for this time index.

       +      Use current time as loop boundary. Usefull for setting a loop quickly.

       -      Clear loop boundaries. Playback will keep on reading once the former loop upper bound is reached.

       /      Clear loop lower bound. Programming a new bound will move the remaining bound to lower bound if it is upper than remaingin upper bound.

       *      Clear loop upper bound. Programming a new bound will move the remaining bound to upper bound if it is lower than remaingin lower bound.

       <HOME> Be kind, rewind.

FEATURES
       Monitor port
              meterec has an extra output port called 'monitor' that is providing a copy of audio signal available at the input side of the currently selected port.

       Take-locking
              By default meterec will play the latest take for a given port when playing back or recording with DUB or OVR mode.  If you want to play an other take you have to set a lock on the  particu‐
              lar tack you want to ear.  This is done in ´edit view´. If a port has lock for several tracks, the track recorded during the latest take will be played (most recent).

       Loops  Setting loop boundaries will not make meterec jump into the loop right away. Only once the upper loop bound is reached, playback will jump to lower bound.

       Ports connection
              The  connection views show 3 ports columns. On the left: all available output ports of jack clients other than this meterec instance. On the right: all available input ports of jack clients
              other that this client. The middle columns shows all meterec ports available in this session. To connect 2 ports first select the meterec port you want to connect in the middle column, then
              go to left or right colum and browse to the port you wish to connect to and hit the ´c´ key. Connected ports will be shown by a '+' sign and highligted  if  your  console  allows.  For  all
              ports, a ´->´ sign between the input side and the ouput side show if this port is in pass-thru mode.

INTERRUPT
       You can abort meterec at any time by pressing Ctrl-C.  The current state will be saved to <session-name>.mrec before meterec exits.

FILES
       <session-file>, <session-name>.mrec
              Contains current state of session: list of ports with connections, record mode, mute state, name, takes map. List of time indexes. Sampling rate.

       <session-name>.log
              Activity log of latest meterec run for session <session-name>.

       <session-name>_<nnnn>.[ogg|wav|w64|flac]
              Take file. <nnnn> is the take number. This file contains audio for all the ports that where selected for record during take <nnnn>. You can open/edit this file in an audio editor if it sup‐
              ports multitrack audio files.
