DESCRIPTION
       The  s5  tool  eases the creation of presentation slides using the “Simple Standards-based Slide Show System”.  It may be used to create a working copy of a template directory or, later, to update
       the working copy after the template has changed over time.

       The s5 tool supports the following command-line options:

       -d      Specify the top-level directory containing the available templates.

       -h      Display a short help text and exit.

       -N      No-operation mode; just display the commands without executing them.

       -t template
               Specify the template within the directory given by the -d option.

       -T full
               Specify the full path to the template directory instead of the default /usr/share/s5/s5-blank

       -v      Verbose operation; display diagnostic information.

       The s5 tool supports the following actions:

       blank path
               Aliases: create, new

               Copy the template directory into the directory specified by path, creating it if necessary.

       cksum path
               Aliases: check, verify

               Verify the checksums recorded for the S5 presentation files in the directory specified by path.  The s5 utility reports both files that have been modified (fail  the  checksum  check)  and
               files that no longer exist yet have checksums recorded.

       help    Alias: usage

               Display a short help message and exit.

       mksum path
               Record  the  template  checksums into a file in a directory specified by path.  Users should never really have to execute this by hand, since it is done internally as part of the blank and
               update command processing.

       update path
               Update the S5 presentation files in the directory specified by path with the new versions in the S5 template directory.

               Before updating, the s5 utility verifies the checksums of the files in the path directory, and terminates if a mismatch is found.  After that, s5 checks for any files that  exist  in  both
               the new template and in the path directory, but are not recorded in the checksum file (i.e. have been placed in path by hand after the last s5 blank or s5 update run) and terminates if any
               such files differ.

               If  all  these  checks are successful, the s5 utility copies the template files over those in path, overwriting any existing files and retaining any files that do not exist in the template
               directory.

THE CONFIGURATION FILE
       The s5 utility's operation may be customized by specifying some common parameters in a configuration file that is read at  each  invocation.   There  are  two  configuration  files  -  the  global
       /etc/s5.conf and a per-user .s5.conf in the user's home directory.  The global file is read first; the per-user file may override any of its settings.

       The configuration file has simple shell-like syntax; its purpose is merely to optionally set some variables.  Lines starting with the “#” character are ignored as comments.  The variables that af‐
       fect the operation of s5 are:

       S5_DIR  The top-level directory containing all the templates; overridden by the command-line -d option.  Default: /usr/share/s5

       S5_TEMPLATE
               The name of the template to use, a subdirectory within S5_DIR; overridden by the command-line -t option.  Default: s5-blank

THE CHECKSUMS FILE
       The s5 utility stores the checksums of blank S5 presentations into a file named s5-checksums.txt into the presentation directory.  This is a simple text file with lines containing of a keyword and
       values.  The keywords that the s5 utility currently generates and parses are as follows:

       CKSUM_CMD checksum-program
               The name of the checksum program to use; the default is cksum(1).

       CKSUM_ARGS [[argument...]]
               The arguments (if any) passed to the checksum program as defined by the CKSUM_CMD line.  The default is an empty string, no arguments passed.

       FILE filename
               The name of the file that the following CKSUM line refers to.

       CKSUM checksum-line-text
               The output of the checksum command as specified by CKSUM_CMD and CKSUM_ARGS conflated into a single line.

EXAMPLES
       Start a brand new presentation:

             s5 blank ~/txt/openfest/2006/gnupg-pres
             cd ~/txt/openfest/2006/gnupg-pres/
             mv s5-blank/ gnupg/

       Verify if any of the S5 files in the presentation have been modified:

             s5 cksum gnupg/

       Do the same, but display verbose information about the lines read from the checksums file and the files verified:

             s5 -v cksum gnupg/

       Update the S5 presentation files after installing a new system-wide version of the S5 template:

             s5 update gnupg/

       Store  the  checksums of the S5 template files (not the real files in the presentation directory!) into the s5-checksums.txt file in the gnupg/ directory; this is actually redundant, as it is done
       as part of the s5 blank invocation:

             s5 mksum gnupg/
