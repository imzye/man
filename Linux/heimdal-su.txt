SU(1)                     BSD General Commands Manual                    SU(1)

NAME
     su — substitute user identity

SYNOPSIS
     su [-K | --no-kerberos] [-f] [-l | --full] [-m] [-i instance |
        --instance=instance] [-c command | --command=command] [login [shell
        arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
     su will use Kerberos authentication provided that an instance for the
     user wanting to change effective UID is present in a file named .k5login
     in the target user id's home directory

     A special case exists where ‘root's’ ~/.k5login needs to contain an entry
     for: ‘user/⟨instance⟩@REALM’ for su to succed (where ⟨instance⟩ is ‘root’
     unless changed with -i).

     In the absence of either an entry for current user in said file or other
     problems like missing ‘host/hostname@REALM’ keys in the system's keytab,
     or user typing the wrong password, su will fall back to traditional
     /etc/passwd authentication.

     When using /etc/passwd authentication, su allows ‘root’ access only to
     members of the group ‘wheel’, or to any user (with knowledge of the
     ‘root’ password) if that group does not exist, or has no members.

     The options are as follows:

     -K, --no-kerberos don't use Kerberos.

     -f don't read .cshrc.

     -l, --full simulate full login.

     -m leave environment unmodified.

     -i instance, --instance=instance root instance to use.

     -c command, --command=command command to execute.
