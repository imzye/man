NAME
       clip - Clip an OOGL object against planes or other surfaces

SYNOPSIS
       clip [-v axisx,y,z,...]
           [-g value-or-point] [-l value-or-point]
           [-s nstrips[,fraction]] [-e]
           [-sph centerx,y,z,...] [-cyl centerx,y,z,...]
           [ooglfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Clip, adapted from Daeron Meyer's ginsu module, allows clipping an OOGL
       object against planes, spheres, or  cylinders  from  the  UNIX  command
       line.   Its  input  can  come  from a file or standard input; output is
       written to standard output.

       Options specify a function of space position; the output is the portion
       of  the  object  where  the function is greater or less than some given
       value, or the portion lying between two values.  Alternatively, an  ob‐
       ject  can  be sliced into equally-spaced strips.  Objects may be of any
       dimension (but see the BUGS section).

       Options are:

       -g value-or-point

       -l value-or-point
              Select the portion of the object where the function  is  greater
              than (-g) or less than (-l) the given value.  If both are speci‐
              fied, the result is the portion of the  object  satisfying  both
              conditions.

              If,  rather  than a single number, the argument to -l or -g is a
              point (a series of x,y,z,... values separated by commas, with no
              embedded  blanks),  then  the  clipping surface is one chosen to
              pass through that point.

       -v axisx,y,z,...
              Specifies a direction in space.  For planar  clipping  (the  de‐
              fault),  it's  the plane normal direction; the clipping function
              is the inner product between the direction vector and the  point
              on  the  object.  For cylindrical clipping, -v specifies the di‐
              rection of the cylinder's axis; the  clipping  function  is  the
              distance from the axis.

       -sph centerx,y,z,...
              Clip  against spheres centered on x,y,z,....  The clipping func‐
              tion is the distance from the given center.  Coordinates must be
              separated by commas without intervening spaces.

       -cyl centerx,y,z,...
              Clip  against  cylinders  with  an  axis  passing  through  cen‐
              terx,y,z,..., with axis direction given by the -v  option.   The
              clipping function is the distance from the axis.

       -s nslices[,fraction]
              Clip an object into a series of nslices ribbons spanning its en‐
              tire extent -- the range of  function-values  over  the  object.
              Part  of  each ribbon is omitted; the fraction, default .5, sets
              the width of the visible part of a ribbon compared to the ribbon
              period.   There are a total of (nslices+fraction-1) ribbon peri‐
              ods across the object, so e.g. -s 2,.5 slices  the  object  into
              equal thirds, omitting the middle third.  The output OOGL object
              is a LIST of OFFs, one per ribbon.

       -e     Don't emit a clipped OOGL object, just print two numbers,  list‐
              ing  the minimum and maximum function values for the object.  If
              -g or -l clipping options are specified, the object  is  clipped
              before  determining  the  function range.  If none of the object
              remains, clip prints "0 0".

EXAMPLES
       To extract the portion of an object lying below the x+y+z=1 plane:

         clip -l 1  -v 1,1,1  file.oogl  > portion.oogl

       To extract the portion of an object lying in the  positive  octant  and
       below  the  x+y+z=1  plane,  we can pipe multiple instances of clip to‐
       gether to find the intersection of several half-spaces:

         clip -g 0  -v 1,0,0 file.oogl | \
            clip -g 0 -v 0,1,0 | \
            clip -g 0 -v 0,0,1 | \
            clip -l 1 -v 1,1,1 > portion.oogl

       To find the region lying between two surfaces (either above one and be‐
       low the other, or below the first and above the second), say the planes
       2x + y -.5z = 1 and y + 2z = 0:

            echo "{ LIST"
            clip -v 2,1,-.5 -g 1  file.oogl | clip -v 0,1,2 -l 0
            clip -v 2,1,-.5 -l 1  file.oogl | clip -v 0,1,2 -g 0
            echo "}"

       We use pipelines to compute intersections, and a  LIST  to  form  their
       union.

BUGS
       Uses  anytooff(1)  to convert input data to OFF format internally; this
       can lose information.  The only arbitrary-dimensional form accepted  at
       present  is  nOFF,  not  nSKEL  or nMESH.  However the four-dimensional
       4OFF, 4QUAD, 4MESH, 4VECT, etc. formats should work.

       Clip really only clips edges.  If a curved  clipping  surface  cuts  an
       edge  twice,  or removes only an interior portion of some polygon, clip
       misses it  entirely.   Clipping  against  a  curved  surface  yields  a
       straight  edge (a chord of the ideal curved edge segment).  This latter
       failing might be fixed someday.
