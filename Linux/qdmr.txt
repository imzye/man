NAME
       qdmr - Graphical tool for programming DMR radios.

SYNOPSIS

       qdmr [OPTIONS] [CODEPLUG_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       qdmr is a graphical tool to program DMR radios. That is, reading, editing, generating and uploading codeplugs to these radios.

       The configuration of these radios is usually stored in a highly vendor and device specific binary codeplug.  qdmr stores this configuration in a human-readable and device independent format, thus
       allowing for sharing codeplugs across devices.

OPTIONS
       CODEPLUG_FILE
           If the optional codeplug file is passed to qdmr, it gets loaded on startup. Otherwise, the application starts with an empty codeplug.

       -style=STYLE
           This option allows to set a Qt style for the application. This can be used to alter the style of the widgets. So call <cmd>qdmr -style=windows</cmd> if you fancy.

           However, this option is of real use if you want to use a dark theme. By installing a dark Qt theme like kvantum-dark and starting qdmr by passing this theme to the style option. That is

           qdmr -style=kvantum-dark

           You may set the Qt style for all Qt applications using the <env>QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE</env> environment variable.

       -stylesheet=FILENAME
           This option allows for specifying a style sheet to alter the appearance of some or all widgets of qdmr.

LOGGING
       Qdmr writes a lot of debug and error messages to <io>stderr</io>. This can be used to inspect some issues during reading/writing the a codeplug to the device. There is also a log file containing
       these messages usually at <file>~/.local/share/DM3MAT/qdmr/qdmr.log</file>.

BUGS
       This program is still under development and may contain bugs that may cause harm to the radios and may even destroy them. Hence you may use this software on your own risk. If you want to have
       guaranties, consider using the CPS (code-plug programming software) supplied with your radio.

       There are some issues with the so-called dark mode under Linux. The Qt library is not able to detect that the desktop has a dark mode theme. To this end, qdmr cannot react to it too. To enable a
       dark theme for qdmr, see the -style option above.

       Writing a single application supporting several radios of different manufacturers is a hard task. To this end, there are plenty of bugs to be expected. If you stumble across one of them, consider
