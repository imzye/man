NAME
       podofopages - move and delete pages in a PDF document

SYNOPSIS
       podofopages [--delete] [--move] [inputfile] [outputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       podofopages is one of the command line tools from the PoDoFo library that provide several useful operations to work with PDF files. It can move and delete pages in a PDF document.

OPTIONS
       --delete NUMBER

              Deletes  the  page NUMBER (number is 0-based). The page will not really be deleted from the PDF. It is only removed from the so called pagestree and therefore becomes hidden. The content of the
              page can still be retrieved from the document though.

       --move FROM TO

              Moves a page FROM TO in the document (FROM and TO are 0-based).
