NAME
       specrb - standalone test runner for test/spec and Test::Unit test suites

SYNOPSIS
       specrb [OPTIONS] [FILES | -a ] [-- untouched arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       The Ruby script specrb allows you to run tests written with test/spec from the command line. It can also be used for plain Test::Unit test suites. You can
       either specify the names of the test files you want to run, or let specrb find automatically all the tests in your project, by using the -a switch (see
       TEST/SPEC OPTIONS below).

       You can also use various options on the command line to pass parameters to the Ruby interpreterm or to modify the behavior of test/spec and/or test/unit.
