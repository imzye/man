NAME
       claws-mail-pgpinline - handle PGP/Inline signed and/or encrypted mails

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-pgpinline package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-pgpinline is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin allows decrypting mails, verifying signatures and sign or encrypt your own mails using PGP/Inline.

       It requires GnuPG and GPGME.

   Warning
       Notice this method for signing or encryption is deprecated and you probably should be using PGP/MIME, but it is still provided for compatibility with user agents which are unable to handle the
       10-year old PGP/MIME standard (being Outlook from Windows platform the most noticeable example).

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named pgpinline.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

FILES
       ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
           Configuration file for GnuPG, read gpg and gpgconf manual pages for details.
