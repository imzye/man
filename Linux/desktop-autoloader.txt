NAME
       desktop-autoloader - Desktop Session Autoloader Launch Script

SYNOPSIS
       desktop-autoloader

DESCRIPTION
       desktop-autoloader  is  a  tiny  script  that loads a virtual desktop session in Xvfb.  Its purpose is to fill the kernel's file system RAM cache with all necessary files needed for running a real
       desktop session (of the same type).

       The Desktop Session Autoloader is a nice-to-have tool on diskless clients (aka LTSP Fat Clients). It accelerates the login of the first-user-of-the-day tremendously. To take advantage of the  pre-
       loaded desktop session, make sure the diskless systems get launched via Wake-on-LAN before 7:30am.

       desktop-autoloader  should  not  be  executed  directly,  it is executed via CRON.  It gets only executed when the system is booted before a certain time of day (so it does not inflict performance
       breakdown on already running sessions.

OPTIONS
       There are no options.
