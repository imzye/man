MKISS(8)                 Linux System Managers Manual                 MKISS(8)

NAME
       mkiss - Attach a multi KISS interface

SYNOPSIS
       mkiss  [-c]  [-f]  [-h]  [-l] [-s speed] [-p pollrate] [-v] [-x n_ptmx]
       ttyinterface pty ..

DESCRIPTION
       Mkiss allows dual port TNCs or multiple TNCs sharing  the  same  serial
       port  to  be used with the Linux AX.25 kernel software. The AX.25 soft‐
       ware has no support for dual port TNCs or  multiple  TNCs  charing  the
       same  serial  line.  The  different ports are addressed by encoding the
       port number in the control byte of every kiss frame.  Mkiss  watches  a
       serial  port, and routes kiss frames to/from the pseudo ttys. The other
       side of the pseudo ttys are then attached with kissattach as normal.

       Statistics about the operation of mkiss may be obtained by sending  the
       SIGUSR1  signal  to  the running program. On reception of such a signal
       mkiss will print a set of statistics to the system log if  logging  has
       been enabled.

       Although  mention  is  made of using pseudo ttys as the last arguments,
       these devices may be normal serial ports. However mkiss provides no way
       in  which  to  set their speed, the speed must therefore be set by some
       other method.

       If the pty argument is "/dev/ptmx", then Unix98 behaviour will automat‐
       icaly  take  effekt. With Unix98 pty's, the slave pty name could not be
       forseen. That's why mkiss will print the corresponding slave  pty  name
       as a separate line on stdout.

       If  the  pty name is the special name "none", no pty is opened. This is
       useful if you have multiport tnc like the KPC-9612 on i.e. /dev/ttyUSB0
       and you only like to handle packets for the second port. The KPC has no
       option to configure the second tnc to listen on  kiss  port  number  0.
       Thus, if you like to send all frames from the pty to the kiss port num‐
       ber 1, we need to tell mkiss to tag them for port  number  1.  This  is
       done  by "mkiss /dev/ttyUSB0 none /dev/ptmx". Frames received with port
       number 0 are discarded.

OPTIONS
       -c        This enables a one-byte checksum on each incoming and  outgo‐
                 ing  KISS  frame on the serial port. This checksum is used by
                 G8BPQ KISS roms to maintain the integrity of KISS frames.

       -f        This enables a 16-bit checksum on each incoming and  outgoing
                 KISS  frame  on  the  serial  port.  This checksum is used by
                 Flexnet Node and BayCom Mailbox to maintain the integrity  of
                 KISS frames.

       -h        Enables  hardware  handshaking on the serial line to the TNC.
                 The KISS specification states that no hardware  flow  control
                 shall  be used so the default is off. But some KISS implemen‐
                 tations do use hardware flow control.

       -l        Enables system logging, the default is off.

       -s speed  Set the speed of the serial port.

       -p pollrate
                 Enables polling. Polled mode is used by G8BPQ  KISS  roms  to
                 prevent  contention  on systems where multiple TNCs share the
                 same serial line.  Pollrate is  interval  between  polls  (in
                 100ms units).

       -v        Display the version.

       -x number This  option  is for Unix98 PTYs. It allocates "number" ptys;
                 their names are written to stdout. When -x is used,  the  pty
                 arguments  are  optional. "mkiss -x 3 ttyname" is an comfort‐
                 able  alternative  to  "mkiss  ttyname  /dev/ptmx   /dev/ptmx
                 /dev/ptmx".
