NAME
       autorandr - automatically select a display configuration based on connected devices

SYNOPSIS
       autorandr [OPTION] [PROFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       This program automatically detects connected display hardware and then loads an appropriate X11 setup using xrandr. It also supports the use of display profiles for different hardware setups.

       Autorandr also includes several virtual configurations including off, common, clone-largest, horizontal, and vertical. See the documentation for explanation of each.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit

       -c, --change
              Automatically load the first detected profile

       -d, --default PROFILE
              Make profile PROFILE the default profile. The default profile is used if no suitable profile can be identified. Else, the current configuration is kept.

       -l, --load PROFILE
              Load profile PROFILE

       -s, --save PROFILE
              Save the current setup to profile PROFILE

       -r, --remove PROFILE
              Remove profile PROFILE

       --batch
              Run autorandr for all users with active X11 sessions

       --current
              List only the current (active) configuration(s)

       --config
              Dump the variable values of your current xrandr setup

       --cycle
              Cycle through all detected profiles

       --debug
              Enable verbose output

       --detected
              List only the detected (i.e. available) configuration(s)

       --dry-run
              Don't change anything, only print the xrandr commands

       --fingerprint
              Fingerprint the current hardware setup

       --match-edid
              Match displays based on edid instead of name

       --ignore-lid
              By default, closed lids are considered as disconnected if other outputs are detected. This flag disables this behaviour.

       --force
              Force loading or reloading of a profile

       --list List all profiles

       --skip-options [OPTION] ...
              Set a comma-separated list of xrandr arguments to skip both in change detection and profile application. See xrandr(1) for xrandr arguments.

       --version
              Show version information and exit

FILES
       Configuration  files  are  searched  for  in  the autorandr directory in the colon separated list of paths in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS - or in /etc/xdg if that var is not set.  They are then looked for in
       ~/.autorandr and if that doesn't exist, in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autorandr or in ~/.config/autorandr if that var is unset.

       In each of those directories it looks for directories with config and setup in them.  It is best to manage these files with the autorandr utility.

DEFAULT OPTIONS
       You can store default values for any option in an INI-file located at ~/.config/autorandr/settings.ini. In a config section, you may place any default values in the  form  option-name=option-argu‐
       ment.

HOOK SCRIPTS
       Four more scripts can be placed in the configuration directory:

       postswitch
              Executed after a mode switch has taken place. This can be used to notify window managers or other applications about the switch.

       preswitch
              Executed before a mode switch takes place.

       postsave
              Executed after a profile was stored or altered.

       predetect
              Executed before autorandr attempts to run xrandr.

       These  scripts  must be executable and can be placed directly in the configuration directory, where they will always be executed, or in the profile subdirectories, where they will only be executed
       on changes regarding that specific profile.

       Instead (or in addition) to these scripts, you can also place as many executable files as you like in subdirectories called script_name.d (e.g. postswitch.d).

       Some of autorandr's state is exposed as environment variables prefixed with AUTORANDR_, such as: AUTORANDR_CURRENT_PROFILE, AUTORANDR_CURRENT_PROFILES, AUTORANDR_PROFILE_FOLDER, and AUTORANDR_MON‐
       ITORS with the intention that they can be used within the hook scripts.

       The one kink is that during preswitch, AUTORANDR_CURRENT_PROFILE is reporting the upcoming profile rather than the current one.
