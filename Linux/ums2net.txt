NAME
       ums2net - daemon for UMS to network proxy

SYNOPSIS

       ums2net -c ConfigFile [-d] [-P PIDFile]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ums2net command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       ums2net is a daemon that allows to use nc to flash a USB Mass Storage device.

       The program comes up normally as a daemon, opens the TCP ports specified in the configuration file, and waits for connections. Once a connection occurs, the program attempts to open the device and
       write any data received from the network onto it. If another user is already using the connection, the connections is blocked until another user is done.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

       -c ConfigFile
           Load configs from ConfigFile.

       -d
           Debug mode, don't detach from the console.

       -P PIDFile
           Generate pid file.

FILES
       /etc/ums2net.conf
           The system-wide configuration file to control the behaviour of ums2net. There's some examples shipped under /usr/share/doc/ums2net/examples
