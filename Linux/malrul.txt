DESCRIPTION
       Malaga is a development environment for natural-language grammars based
       on the Left-Associative Grammar formalism.  Malaga grammars can be used
       for automatic morphological and/or syntactic analysis.

       that is to be translated (suffix .mor, .syn or .all) and the associated
       symbol file (suffix .sym or .esym) as command-line arguments. The order
       of the arguments is arbitrary.

       See info Malaga for details.
