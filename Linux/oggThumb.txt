NAME
       oggThumb - creates thumbnails from an ogg video file

SYNOPSIS
       oggThumb [options] file1.ogv [ file2.ogv [ file3.ogv [...] ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       oggThumb  creates  Thumbnails  from one or more ogg video files, at a given time position or a given frame number. It is also possible to create a series of thumbnails at different time or frame posi‐
       tions. The pictures can be created in JPG or PNG format and can be resized to any given size.

       The default naming of each thumbnail series follows the following rule:

       <filename_without_extension>_x.<picture_extension>

       Where x starts with 0 and is incremented with every created thumbnail. So the thumbnails are successively numbered by the appearance order. This is even valid, if time positions and frame numbers  are
       mixed.

OPTIONS
       -t     Time  at which a thumbnail should be created. More than one thumbnail time can be concatenated by commas. The times can be set by integer or floating point values in seconds. If the time is not
              exactly matching, the next frame is used. The times don't have to be sorted incrementally.

              Example: -t 12.4,14.157,13.23

       -f     Number of a frame that should be created as a thumbnail. More than one thumbnail frame can be concatenated by commas. The frame numbers must be an integers. The frame numbers don't have  to  be
              sorted incrementally.

              Example: -f 12000,13000,11000

       -s     Picture  output  size.  The  thumbnail  is created in the size given as <width>x<height>.  If you want to include the thumbnails into your webpage and you need to have a fixed width but dynamic
              height, you can set the dynamic axis to 0. So the aspect ratio of the video frame is kept. This is the same for setting width or height to 0.

              Example: -s 0x100

       -o     Output format. This can be png or jpg. The default is jpg.

              Example: -o png

       -n     Alternative thumbnail picture name. The % can be used within the name to indicate the counter placeholder.

              In case of more than one video file, the counter continuous throughout the different videos, so that the pictures are not overwritten.

              If the name has an extension. This extension is used to identify the output picture format.

              Example: -n myNo_%_thumb

EXAMPLE
       oggThumb -t 10.3,22.4,31.9,43.4,59.4 -f 1200 -s 0x100 myFile.ogv

       oggThumb -f 200,400,300,100 -t 3.54 -n %_thumb.png myfile.ogv mysecondfile.ogv
