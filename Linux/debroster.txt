DEBROSTER(1)                                                                              General Commands Manual                                                                              DEBROSTER(1)

NAME
       debroster - programs to gloat at expos.

SYNOPSIS
       debroster [No options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the debroster command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Or rather,
       it didn't until the author wrote this one ;-)

       debroster is a program that fires up an Eterm, with the logo as a background, and then scrolls a list of Debian developers. It is intended to be used at expos and the like to brag  about  how  big
       the Debian project is.

OPTIONS
       None are implemented - it doesn't need any.

SEE ALSO
       The scripts themselves - they are pretty simple.

AUTHOR
