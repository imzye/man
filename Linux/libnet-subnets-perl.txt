NAME
       Net::Subnets - Computing Subnets In Large Scale Networks

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::Subnets;
           my $sn = Net::Subnets->new;
           $sn->subnets(\@subnets);
           if (my $subnetref = $sn->check(\$address)) {
               ...
           }
           my ($lowipref, highipref) = $sn->range(\$subnet);
           my $listref = $sn->list(\($lowipref, $highipref));

DESCRIPTION
       Very fast matches large lists of IP addresses against many CIDR subnets and calculates IP address ranges.

       This is a simple and efficient example for subnet matching:

           use Net::Subnets;

           my @subnets   = qw(10.0.0.0/24 10.0.1.0/24);
           my @addresses = qw/10.0.0.1 10.0.1.2 10.0.3.1/;

           my $sn = Net::Subnets->new;
           $sn->subnets(\@subnets);
           my $results;
           foreach my $address (@addresses) {
               if (my $subnetref = $sn->check(\$address)) {
                   $results .= "$address: $$subnetref\n";
               }
               else {
                   $results .= "$address: not found\n";
               }
           }
           print($results);

       This is a simple example for range calculation:

           use Net::Subnets;

           my @subnets = qw(10.0.0.0/24 10.0.1.0/24);

           my $sn = Net::Subnets->new;
           my $results;
           foreach my $subnet (@subnets) {
               my ($lowipref, $highipref) = $sn->range(\$subnet);
               $results .= "$subnet: $$lowipref - $$highipref\n";
           }
           print( $results );

       This is a simple example for list generation:

           use Net::Subnets;

           my $lowip  = '192.168.0.1';
           my $highip = '192.168.0.100';

           my $sn = Net::Subnets->new;
           my $listref = $sn->list(\($lowip, $highip));
           foreach my $address (@$listref) {
               # do something cool
           }

METHODS
   "new"
           my $subnets = Net::Subnets->new;

           Creates an "Net::Subnets" object.

   "subnets"
           $subnets->subnets([qw(10.0.0.0/24 10.0.1.0/24)]);

           The C<subnets> method lets you prepare a list of CIDR subnets.

   "check"
           my $match = $subnets->check(\$address);

           The C<check> method lets you check an IP address against the previously
           prepared subnets.

   "range"
           my ($lowest, $highest) = $subnets->range(\$subnet)

           The C<range> method lets you calculate the IP address range of a subnet.

   "list"
           my $list = $subnets->list(\$lowest, $highest);

           The C<list> method lets you calculate a list containing all IP addresses
           in a given range.
