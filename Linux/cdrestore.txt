NAME
       cdrestore - Streaming restore from CD-R(W)/DVD-R(W)

SYNOPSIS
       cdrestore [-qvDFRTV] [-d device] [-i image] [-l size]
                 [-t track] [-c command]

DESCRIPTION
       cdrestore is a utility to make streaming restores from CD-R(W)/DVD-R(W) disks. It's designed to work with any backup tool which is able to restore from stdin (like tar/cpio/afio).

OPTIONS
       -d device
              The device name which is used for reading the backup.
              (default: /dev/cdrom)

       -i image
              Enables virtual image mode. The backup stream is read from the given image file. You have to use this option, if you are restoring from a dumped image too.
              (default: none)

       -l size
              Specifies the media size. This value is used to display the free space on the media only.
              By default the given value is taken as megabytes. You can append a single letter to the number to select: (k)ilobytes, (m)egabytes, (g)igabytes or (s)ectors (e.g. 170k, 4488m, 350000s).
              (default: 650m)

       -t track
              The number of the data track on the media for reading the backup.
              (default: none)

       -T     Enables test mode. The complete restore process is done to test data integrity (includes CRC checksum test, if available), but no data is output.
              NOTE: This only verifies that the data is readable by cdrestore at all. This doesn't guarantee that your backup software will be able to do a real restore with the data.

       -F     Forces cdrestore to begin the restore in the middle of a multi-disk set. This may be useful if you have lost a disk or a disk is badly damaged.
              NOTE: This will most probably start the restore in the middle of a file. It's up to your backup software to sync to the beginning of the next file.

       -R     Disable the kernel readahead for the CDROM device during the restore process.  (see cdbackup(1) Known problems)

       -c command
              The command which is executed whenever cdrestore needs to request a new media for multi-disk backups. This command (or script) should prompt the user and return after the device is ready again.
              The command receives one argument, which is the device name passed with -d. This can be used to issue commands to the device like ejecting the media.
              (default: use internal diskchange prompt)

       -q     Queries the media, prints out the contents and exits.

       -v     Enables verbose mode.

       -D     Enables DEBUG output (probably not useful for normal use).

       -V     Prints out version information and exits.

EXAMPLES
       Query the 700 MB media on /dev/sr0:

              cdrestore -d /dev/sr0 -l 700 -q

       Restore a tar archive to the current directory from track 2 of a 702 MB media on /dev/scd0:

              cdrestore -d /dev/scd0 -l 702 -t 2 | tar xf -

       Query the contents of a virtual image:

              cdrestore -i /tmp/vimage -l 4488m -q

       Check data integrity of track 3 in a virtual image after dumping it to DVD media:

              cdrestore -i /dev/dvd -t 3 -T
