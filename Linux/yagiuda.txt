NAME
       optimise - output data file formats

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the output formats of the files created by the Yagi-Uda project's optimise program. The input files required for optimise are plain ASCII which can be generated by input
       or  first.   or  may be generated manually with a text editor, if care is used. The format required by optimise is described in input(5). Optimise's output files, which have the .bes extension are
       the same format as the input files and are again obviously described by input(5).

Example of a .up file.
       The .up file list the improvements made by optimise to an antenna design. Starting from the original design, the file is appended each time a new better design is found. Here is an example,  where
       the final line is the performance of the 4 element beam with the .dat file shown earlier.
           1 7.57dBi,  16.93dB F/B, Z=(31.77-56.34j) Ohms, SWR=3.95, SL=16.95 dB
          84 7.58dBi,  16.93dB F/B, Z=(31.78-56.32j) Ohms, SWR=3.95, SL=16.95 dB
         623 7.58dBi,  16.93dB F/B, Z=(31.78-56.28j) Ohms, SWR=3.95, SL=16.95 dB
       89345 9.74dBi, 103.06dB F/B, Z=(37.55 +1.61j) Ohms, SWR=1.33, SL=17.78 dB

What is what in the .up file
       The first column is an integer specifying the iteration. The other columns, going from left to right are gain(dBi), FB, input impedance, VSWR and level of the most significant sidelobe, in dB down
       on the peak gain.
