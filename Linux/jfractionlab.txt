DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jfractionlab command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page..

       JFractionLab is formed by a set of exercices applications that are
        used for carrying out different types of math activities with a numeric
        and visual representation of the fractions.
        It shows the user every step of the calculation and therefore helps him
        to understand them. It gives the user an answer after each input,
        making impossible to have a false answer.
