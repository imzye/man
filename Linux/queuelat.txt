NAME
       queuelat - Queue latency test program

SYNOPSIS
       queuelat [-c|--cycles N] [-f|--freq F] [-h|--help] [-m|--max-len LEN] [-p|--packets F] [-q|--queue-len N] [-t|--timeout TIME]

DESCRIPTION
       queuelat simulates a network queue checking for latency violations in packet processing.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -c, --cycles=N
              Estimated number of cycles it takes to process one packet. This value should come from the envisioned packet forwarding application being simulated.

       -f, --freq=F
              TSC frequency in MHz.

       -h, --help
              Show help

       -m, --max-len=N
              Maximum allowed latency, in nanoseconds. If latency to process any packet exceeds this value, the program quits, writing a message to the trace buffer.

       -p, --packets=F
              Million packets per second that arrive for processing.

       -q, --queue-len=N
              Minimum queue length to print in the trace

       -t, --timeout=TIME
              Timeout in seconds to quit the program.
