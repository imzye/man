Agent::Driver::Default(3pm)                                                         User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                         Agent::Driver::Default(3pm)

NAME
       Log::Agent::Driver::Default - default logging driver for Log::Agent

SYNOPSIS
        # Implicit use
        use Log::Agent;
        logconfig(-prefix => "prefix");   # optional

        # Explicit use
        use Log::Agent;
        require Log::Agent::Driver::Default;

        my $driver = Log::Agent::Driver::Default->make("prefix");
        logconfig(-driver => $driver);

DESCRIPTION
       The default logging driver remaps the logxxx() operations to their default Perl counterpart. For instance, logerr() will issue a warn() and logwarn() will call warn() with a clear "WARNING: "
       emphasis (to distinguish between the two calls).

       The only routine of interest here is the creation routine:

       make($prefix)
           Create a Log::Agent::Driver::Default driver whose prefix string will be $prefix. When no prefix is configured, the first letter of each logged string will be uppercased.

CHANNELS
       The "error", "output" and "debug" channels all go to STDERR.

BUGS
       If logdie() is used within an eval(), the string you will get in $@ will be prefixed. It's not really a bug, simply that wrapping a code into eval() and parsing $@ is poor's man exception handling
       which  shows  its limit here: since the programmer using logdie() cannot foresee which driver will be used, the returned string cannot be determined precisely.  Morality: use die() if you mean it,
       and document the string as an exception.
