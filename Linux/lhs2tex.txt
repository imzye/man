NAME
       lhs2TeX - a literate Haskell to (La)TeX code translator

SYNOPSIS
       lhs2TeX [options] file

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool takes as its input a literate Haskell source file (Bird-style or LaTeX-style or even a combination thereof), and produces output, which, depending on the STYLE selected, can be ei‐
       ther a LaTeX document or a stripped version of the code.  The output is produced on stdout.  Several directives are interpreted by lhs2TeX itself and can be used to customize the output  fur‐
       ther.

OPTIONS
       There are two sorts of options for lhs2TeX. The first selects a STYLE which governs the overal mode of operation for lhs2TeX. Only one style may be selected:

       --poly The  poly style is an improvement of the older math style. It produces a LaTeX document, with the code blocks formatted using a proportional font. The output is highly customizable us‐
              ing formatting directives. Furthermore, the resulting code respects some of the alignments made in the source file.

       --math The math style is as poly style, but has less alignment capabilities. Tokens appearing in the source file at a special column are all aligned in the output. Furthermore, indentation is
              respected.

       --newcode
              In the new code style, everything but code blocks is stripped from the file. In addition, certain syntactic transformations can be performed on the code  using  formatting  directives.
              For example, if the source code is annotated in certain positions to produce even nicer results in poly style, one can use newcode style to remove these annotations.

       --code In code style, all comments and specification code is stripped from the file, so that only the code remains. Use this if you want to produce a smaller version of your source file.

       --tt   Typewriter  style  prints  code almost verbatim, using a monospaced font, but formatting certain symbols (lambda abstraction, arrows ...) using an extended character set. This style is
              default if no style is explicitly selected, but this behaviour should not be relied upon.  The default style may be changed in future versions.

       --verb Verbatim style prints code as-is, using a monospaced font. No formatting whatsoever is applied to the code. However, lhs2TeX does not make use of  a  LaTeX  verbatim  environment,  but
              rather escapes special TeX constructs in the translation. This implies that it is easier to pass the resulting TeX code to macros or use it inside certain environments than it would be
              with a native verbatim-environment.

       The following options are considered are also considered as styles, but return only information about the program:

       -h, -?, --help
              Returns a short usage message listing all the available options.

       -V, --version
              Returns version information.

       --copying
              Displays the complete GNU General Public License.

       --warranty
              Displays the parts of the GPL than concerns warranty.

       The remaining options modify the behaviour of the program.

       -Ppath, --path=path
              Takes  a  (colon-separated)  list  path of paths that are used as search path for files to be included. If the list starts with a colon, then the list is appended to the current search
              path. If the list ends with a colon, then the list is prepended to the current search path. If there is neither a colon at the beginning nor at the end of the list, then the  list  re‐
              places the current search path.

              Environment  variables  can  be  used in the list of paths, if enclosed in curly braces, i.e., {VAR} expands to the current value of the environment variable VAR. If a path ends with a
              double slash //, then all subdirectories of that path are included in the search path. Note that this can significantly slow down lhs2TeX when looking for files.

              The built-in default search path of lhs2TeX is

                 {HOME}/lhs2TeX//
                 {HOME}/.lhs2TeX//
                 {LHS2TEX}//
                 /usr/local/share/lhs2tex//
                 /usr/local/share/lhs2TeX//
                 /usr/local/lib/lhs2tex//
                 /usr/local/lib/lhs2TeX//
                 /usr/share/lhs2tex//
                 /usr/share/lhs2TeX//
                 /usr/lib/lhs2tex//
                 /usr/lib/lhs2TeX//

       -ifile, --include=file
              Includes file before anything else. This option has the same effect as an

                 %include file

              directive at the beginning of the source file.

       -lequation, --let=equation
              Assumes equation while processing the source file. This option has the same effect as a

                 %let equation

              directive at the beginning of the source file.

       -sflag, --set=flag
              Sets flag to True at the beginning of the source file. This option has the same effect as a

                 %let flag=True

              at the beginning of the source file.

       -uflag, --unset=flag
              Sets flag to False at the beginning of the source file. This option has the same effect as a

                 %let flag=False

              at the beginning of the source file.
