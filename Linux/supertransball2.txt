NAME
       supertransball2 - Thrust type of game

DESCRIPTION
       Super  Transball  2  is a game which was inspired by ZARA THRUSTA for the Amiga 500. In each level the goal is to find the SPHERE, to capture it and to carry it to the upper part of the level. The
       main challenge is the gravity that attracts your ship which makes it inevitable to control the ship's thrust. Many other obstacles like cannons, tanks, doors or lasers will also try to  make  your
       journey difficult and don't be wasteful with your thrusters and weapons or you will run out of fuel in no time.

       Super Transball 2 ships with 3 unique level packs consisting of 26 levels in total. You can choose between them by pressing the L-key ingame. If a level seems being to difficult you can skip it by
       entering a code after pressing the C-key in the main menu. These cheats are available in /usr/share/doc/supertransball2.

VIDEO RESOLUTION
       The game starts in windowed mode with a resolution of 320x240 pixel. However you can change this setting ingame with the ALT-key + 1,2,3,4 or ENTER combination.
