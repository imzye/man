NAME
       src - src Documentation

       psd-tools is a Python package for working with Adobe Photoshop PSD files as described in specification.

INSTALLATION
       Use pip to install the package:

          pip install psd-tools

       NOTE:
          In order to extract images from 32bit PSD files PIL/Pillow must be built with LITTLECMS or LITTLECMS2 support (apt-get install liblcms2-2 or brew install little-cms2)

GETTING STARTED
          from psd_tools import PSDImage

          psd = PSDImage.open('example.psd')
          psd.composite().save('example.png')

          for layer in psd:
              print(layer)
              image = layer.composite()

       Check out the Usage documentation for more examples.

   Usage
   Command line
       The package provides command line tools to handle a PSD document:

          psd-tools export <input_file> <output_file> [options]
          psd-tools show <input_file> [options]
          psd-tools debug <input_file> [options]
          psd-tools -h | --help
          psd-tools --version

       Example:

          psd-tools show example.psd  # Show the file content
          psd-tools export example.psd example.png  # Export as PNG
          psd-tools export example.psd[0] example-0.png  # Export layer as PNG

   Working with PSD document
       psd_tools.api package provides the user-friendly API to work with PSD files.  PSDImage represents a PSD file.

       Open an image:

          from psd_tools import PSDImage
          psd = PSDImage.open('my_image.psd')

       Most of the data structure in the psd-tools suppports pretty printing in IPython environment.

          In [1]: PSDImage.open('example.psd')
          Out[1]:
          PSDImage(mode=RGB size=101x55 depth=8 channels=3)
            [0] PixelLayer('Background' size=101x55)
            [1] PixelLayer('Layer 1' size=85x46)

       Internal layers are accessible by iterator or indexing:

          for layer in psd:
              print(layer)
              if layer.is_group():
                  for child in layer:
                      print(child)

          child = psd[0][0]

       NOTE:
          The iteration order is from background to foreground, which is reversed from version prior to 1.7.x. Use reversed(list(psd)) to iterate from foreground to background.

       The opened PSD file can be saved:

          psd.save('output.psd')

       If the PSD File's layer structure was updated, saving it will update the ImagaData section to produce an accurate thumbnail.

   Working with Layers
       There are various layer kinds in Photoshop.

       The most basic layer type is PixelLayer:

          print(layer.name)
          layer.kind == 'pixel'

       Some of the layer attributes are editable, such as a layer name:

          layer.name = 'Updated layer 1'

       It is possible to create a new PixelLayer from a PIL object, the PIL image will be converted to the color mode of the PSD File given in parameter:

          PixelLayer.frompil(pil_image, psd_file, "Layer name", top_offset, left_offset, Compression.RLE)

       See the function documentation for further parameter explanations.

       Group has internal layers:

          for layer in group:
              print(layer)

          first_layer = group[0]

       Create a new group object.:

          Group.new("Group name", open_folder=True, parent=parent_group)

       TypeLayer is a layer with texts:

          print(layer.text)

       ShapeLayer draws a vector shape, and the shape information is stored in vector_mask and origination property.  Other layers can also have shape information as a mask:

          print(layer.vector_mask)
          for shape in layer.origination:
              print(shape)

       SmartObjectLayer embeds or links an external file for non-destructive editing. The file content is accessible via smart_object property:

          import io
          if layer.smart_object.filetype in ('jpg', 'png'):
              image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(layer.smart_object.data))

       SolidColorFill, PatternFill, and GradientFill are fill layers that paint the entire region if there is no associated mask. Sub-classes of AdjustmentLayer represents layer adjustment applied to the
       composed image. See Adjustment layers.

   Modifying the layer structure
       The layer structure of a PSD object can be modified through methods emulating a python list.

       The internal model of the psd layer structure will be automatically updated when saving the psd to a file or a similar operation.  Moving a layer from a PSD to another will also automatically con‐
       vert the PixelLayer to the target psd's color mode.

       The follwing are valid for both PSDImage and Group objects.

       Set an item:

          group[0] = layer

       Add a layer to a group:

          group.append(layer)

       Add a list of layers to a group:

          group.extend(layers)

       Insert a layer to a specific index in the group:

          group.insert(3, layer)

       Remove a layer from the a group:

          group.remove(layer)

       Pop a layer from the group:

          layer = group.pop()

       Emptying a layer group:

          group.clear()

       Get the index of a layer in the group:

          group.index(layer)

       Count the occurences of a layer in a group:

          group.count(layer)

       Move a given list of layers in a newly created Group. If no parent group is given in parameter, the new group will replace the first layer of the list in the PSD structure:

          Group.group_layers(layer_list, "Group Name", parent=parent_group, open_folder=True)

       Below an example of such an operation.:

          - PSDImage
              - Group 1
                  - PixelLayer
                  - FillLayer
              - PixelLayer
              - TypeLayer
              - SmartObjectLayer
              - PixelLayer

          Group.group_layers(PSDImage[:2], "New Group")
          - PSDImage
              - New Group
                  - Group 1
                      - PixelLayer
                      - FillLayer
                  - PixelLayer
                  - TypeLayer
              - SmartObjectLayer
              - PixelLayer

       Some operations are available for all Layer objects.

       Delete a layer from its layer structure:

          layer.delete()

       Layers can be moved from a group to another:

          layer.move_to_group(target_group)

       Layers can be moved within the group to change their order:

          layer.move_up(5) # Will send the layer upward in the group
          layer.move_down(3) # Will send the layer downward in the group

   Exporting data to PIL
       Export the entire document as PIL.Image:

          image = psd.composite()
          image.save('exported.png')

       Export a single layer including masks and clipping layers:

          image = layer.composite()

       Export layer and mask separately without composition:

          image = layer.topil()
          mask = layer.mask.topil()

       To composite specific layers, such as layers except for texts, use layer_filter option:

          image = psd.composite(
              layer_filter=lambda layer: layer.is_visible() and layer.kind != 'type')

       Note that most of the layer effects and adjustment layers are not supported.  The compositing result may look different from Photoshop.

   Exporting data to NumPy
       PSDImage or layers can be exported to NumPy array by numpy() method:

          image = psd.numpy()
          layer_image = layer.numpy()

   Migrating to 1.10
       psd-tools 1.10 has a few breaking changes.

       Basic layer structure editing is supported in 1.10. You can add or remove a pixel layer, or change the grouping of layers.

       psd-tools 1.10 drops compose module. Use composite instead.

       version 1.10.x:

          image = psd.composite()
          layer_image = layer.composite()

   Migrating to 1.9
       psd-tools 1.9 switches to NumPy based compositing.

       version 1.8.x:

          psd = PSDImage.open(filename)
          image = psd.compose()
          layer = psd[0]
          layer_image = layer.compose()

       version 1.9.x:

          psd = PSDImage.open(filename)
          image = psd.composite()
          layer = psd[0]
          layer_image = layer.composite()

       NumPy array API is introduced:

          image = psd.numpy()
          layer_image = layer.numpy()

   Migrating to 1.8
       There are major API changes in version 1.8.x.

       NOTE:
          In version 1.8.0 - 1.8.7, the package name was psd_tools2.

   PSDImage
       File open method is changed from load to open().

       version 1.7.x:

          psd = PSDImage.load(filename)
          with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
              psd = PSDImage.from_stream(f)

       version 1.8.x:

          psd = PSDImage.open(filename)
          with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
              psd = PSDImage.open(f)

   Layers
       Children of PSDImage or Group is directly accessible by iterator or indexing.

       version 1.7.x:

          for layer in group.layers:
              print(layer)

          first_child = group.layers[0]

       version 1.8.x:

          for layer in group:
              print(layer)

          first_child = group[0]

       In version 1.8.x, the order of layers is reversed to reflect that the index should not change when a new layer is added on top.

   PIL export
       Primary PIL export method is compose().

       version 1.7.x:

          image = psd.as_PIL()

          layer_image = compose(layer)
          raw_layer_image = layer.as_PIL()

       version 1.8.x:

          image = psd.compose()

          layer_image = layer.compose()
          raw_layer_image = layer.topil()

   Low-level data structure
       Data structures are completely rewritten to support writing functionality.  See psd_tools.psd subpackage.

       version 1.7.x:

          psd.decoded_data

       version 1.8.x:

          psd._record

   Drop pymaging support
       Pymaging support is dropped.

   Contributing
       Development  happens  at github: bug tracker.  Feel free to submit bug reports or pull requests. Attaching an erroneous PSD file makes the debugging process faster. Such PSD file might be added to
       the test suite.

       The license is MIT.

   Package design
       The package consists of two major subpackages:

       1.

          psd_tools.psd: subpackage that reads/writes low-level binary
                 structure of the PSD/PSB file. The core data structures are built around attrs class that all implement read and write methods. Each data object tries to resemble the structure described
                 in the specification. Although documented, the specification is far from complete and some are even inaccurate. When psd-tools finds unknown data structure, the package keeps  such  data
                 as bytes in the parsed result.

       2.

          psd_tools.api: User-facing API that implements various
                 easy-to-use methods that manipulate low-level psd_tools.psd data structures.

   Testing
       In order to run tests, make sure PIL/Pillow is built with LittleCMS or LittleCMS2 support. For example, on Ubuntu, install the following packages:

          apt-get install liblcms2-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev zlib1g-dev

       Then install psd-tools with the following command:

          pip install -e .[dev]

       Finally, run tests with pytest:

          pytest

   Documentation
       Install Sphinx to generate documents:

          pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme

       Once installed, use Makefile:

          make docs

   psd_tools.psd.base
       Base data structures intended for inheritance.

       All the data objects in this subpackage inherit from the base classes here.  That means, all the data structures in the psd_tools.psd subpackage implements the methods of BaseElement  for  serial‐
       ization and decoding.

       Objects that inherit from the BaseElement typically gets attrs decoration to have data fields.

   BaseElement
