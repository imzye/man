NAME
       kate - Advanced text editor by KDE

SYNOPSIS
       kate [-s, --start name] [--startanon] [-n, --new] [-b, --block] [-p, --pid pid] [-e, --encoding name] [-l, --line line] [-c, --column column] [-i, --stdin] [--tempfile] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       Kate is the KDE Advanced Text Editor.

       Kate also provides the editor part for various applications, under the name KWrite.

       Some of Kate's many features include configurable syntax highlighting for languages ranging from C and C++ to HTML to bash scripts, the ability to create and maintain projects, a multiple document
       interface (MDI), and a self-contained terminal emulator.

       But Kate is more than a programmer's editor. Its ability to open several files at once makes it ideal for editing UNIX®'s many configuration files. This document was written in Kate.

OPTIONS
       -s, --start name
           Start Kate with a given session.

       --startanon
           Start Kate with a new anonymous session, implies -n.

       -n, --new
           Force start of a new Kate instance (is ignored if start is used and another Kate instance already has the given session opened), forced if no parameters and no URLs are given at all.

       -b, --block
           If using an already running Kate instance, block until it exits, if URLs given to open.

       -p, --pid  pid
           Only try to reuse kate instance with this pid (is ignored if start is used and another Kate instance already has the given session opened).

       -e, --encoding  name
           Set encoding for the file to open.

           You can use this to force a file opened in utf-8 format, for instance. (The command iconv -l provides a list of encodings, which may be helpful to you.)

       -l, --line  line
           Navigate to this line.

       -c, --column  column
           Navigate to this column.

       -i, --stdin
           Read the contents of stdin.

       --tempfile
           The files/URLs opened by the application will be deleted after use.

       file
           File to open.

EXAMPLES
       To open a file named source.cpp at column 15, line 25, in an existing Kate window, you could use:

           kate -c 15 -l 25 source.cpp

       If you have an active internet connection, you can take advantage of KDE's network transparency to open a file from an FTP site. If you do not have write permission on the remote server, the file will
       be opened read only and you will be prompted for a local filename to save to if you make changes. If you do have write permission, changes will be saved transparently over the network.
