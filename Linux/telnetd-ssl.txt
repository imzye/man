NAME
       telnetlogin — login wrapper for telnetd

SYNOPSIS
       telnetlogin [-h host] [-p] [-f username] [username]

DESCRIPTION
       telnetlogin is a setuid wrapper that runs login(1).  It is meant to be invoked by telnetd(8); the idea is to remove the necessity of running telnetd as root.

       telnetlogin  should  be  installed  mode  4750,  user  root,  group  telnetd.  Then,  telnetd  may  be  run  from  /etc/inetd.conf  as  user  ``nobody'',  group ``telnetd'', and with the option -L
       path-to-telnetlogin.

       telnetlogin accepts only the subset of options to login(1) shown above, in the order listed. This is the order telnetd(8) normally provides them in.  telnetlogin also does sanity checks on the en‐
       vironment variables TERM, and REMOTEHOST.  It also insists that the standard input, output, and error streams are open on a terminal, and that it is the process  group  leader  of  the  foreground
       process  of  that  terminal. After checking all of these conditions, checking the values of the above environment variables for reasonable values, resetting signal handlers, and so forth, it execs
       login.
