NAME
       fgfs - the FlightGear flight simulator

SYNOPSIS
       fgfs [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       fgfs is the main executable for FlightGear, a free, open-source, multi-
       platform and sophisticated flight simulator framework for the  develop‐
       ment and pursuit of interesting flight simulator ideas.

OPTIONS
       Options  are first read from the command-line arguments passed to fgfs.
       The program then checks for the existence of ~/.fgfsrc.hostname  (where
       hostname  is the hostname of the machine) and of ~/.fgfsrc; if at least
       one of those files exists, it is read and parsed (see the fgfsrc(5) man
       page for the full specifications of the file format).

       If conflicting options are given, the ones read last will prevail.

   General options
       --help, -h
              Display  usage  information about the most relevant command-line
              options and exit.

       --verbose, -v
              When combined with --help/-h, display  usage  information  about
              all command-line options, not just the most relevant ones.

       --version
              Display version information about fgfs and some of the libraries
              used by the program (SimGear, OpenSceneGraph, PLIB), then exit.

       --fg-root=path
              Set the FlightGear data root directory ($FG_ROOT)  to  path.  If
              this  option  is  not  set,  fgfs uses the path specified in the
              FG_ROOT environment variable or,  absent  that,  the  FlightGear
              data directory chosen at the time the program was compiled.

       --fg-scenery=path
              Set the FlightGear scenery directories ($FG_SCENERY) to path.

              You  can  specify  multiple  directories by separating them with
              colons (:), as in /first/path:/second/path (on Microsoft Windows
              operating  systems,  multiple paths should be separated by semi‐
              colons instead): in that case, fgfs will follow  the  order  the
              paths  are  written  in to search for scenery files, stopping as
              soon as a match is found.

              If this option is not set, fgfs uses the path specified  in  the
              FG_SCENERY  environment  variable  or,  absent that, the Scenery
              subdirectory inside $FG_ROOT.

       --fg-aircraft=path
              Load additional aircraft from path besides the  Aircraft  subdi‐
              rectory  inside  $FG_ROOT.  Alternatively,  you  can  use --air‐
              craft-dir to target a specific aircraft in a given directory.

       --download-dir=path
              Store aircraft and scenery downloaded via the simulator in path.

              The TerraSync directory may be specifically set with the  --ter‐
              rasync-dir option.

       --allow-nasal-read=dirs
              Allow  Nasal aircraft scripts to read files from the directories
              listed in dirs (separate multiple paths with  colons,  or  semi‐
              colons on Microsoft Windows operating systems).

              By  default,  Nasal  scripts  are allowed to read data only from
              $FG_ROOT and $FG_HOME, as a security measure.

       --read-only
              Make $FG_HOME (the location where user-specific FlightGear  data
              is stored) read-only.

       --language=code
              Set the language used by the simulator to code, where code is an
              ISO 639-1 two-letter locale code (for example, en or it).

       --restore-defaults
              Reset all user settings to their defaults.

       --enable-save-on-exit, --disable-save-on-exit
              Save/do not save user settings when the program exits.

       --ignore-autosave
              Ignore the user settings saved the previous time FlightGear  was
              run. This option implies --disable-save-on-exit.

       --browser-app=path
              Use  the Web browser specified in path to open aircraft documen‐
              tation.

       --prop:[type:]name=value
              Set the property name to value. You can optionally  specify  the
              property  type  by  setting type to string, double, float, long,
              int or bool.

       --config=path
              Load additional configuration directives  from  path.  The  file
              should follow the format described in fgfsrc(5).

       --no-default-config
              Do  not load any configuration files unless they were explicitly
              specified with --config.

       --units-feet
              Use feet as the internal measure unit for distances.

       --units-meters
              Use meters as the internal measure unit for distances.

       --console
              Display a console window for simulator/aircraft  debugging  pur‐
              poses.

              This  option  is  recognized only on Microsoft Windows operating
              systems; on other systems, debug messages are always printed  to
              standard output/standard error.

       --launcher
              Start the FlightGear Launcher, a graphical Qt-based interface to
              the simulator.

              This option is available only if FlightGear was compiled with Qt
              support enabled.

       --json-report
              Print a report in JSON format on the standard output. The report
              will give useful information for debugging purposes, such as the
              FlightGear  version, the scenery/aircraft paths in use, the Ter‐
              raSync and the data download directories and the paths to  navi‐
              gation data files.

   Features
       --enable-panel, --disable-panel
              Enable/disable  the pop-up aircraft instrument panel if the cho‐
              sen airplane has it.

       --enable-hud, --disable-hud
              Enable/disable the heads-up display (HUD) if the chosen airplane
              has it.

       --enable-anti-alias-hud, --disable-anti-alias-hud
              Enable/disable heads-up display antialiasing.

       --enable-hud-3d, --disable-hud-3d
              Enable/disable the 3D version of the heads-up display.

       --hud-tris

              heads-up display.

       --hud-culled
              Display the number of triangles culled when painting the  heads-
              up display.

       --enable-random-objects, --disable-random-objects
              Show/hide random scenery objects, such as buildings. Scenery ob‐
              jects increase realism, but require more resources  (memory  and
              graphic card power).

       --enable-random-vegetation, --disable-random-vegetation
              Show/hide random vegetation.

       --enable-random-buildings, --disable-random-buildings
              Show/hide random buildings.

       --enable-ai-models, --disable-ai-models
              Enable/disable  the internal AI subsystem, which is required for
              multiplayer gaming, AI traffic and many other  animations.  Dis‐
              abling the internal AI subsystem is deprecated.

       --enable-ai-traffic, --disable-ai-traffic
              Enable/disable artificial plane traffic.

       --ai-scenario=scenario
              Add  and enable the AI scenario scenario. This option may be re‐
              peated multiple times to enable multiple scenarios.

       --enable-freeze
              Start the simulator in a frozen (paused) state.

       --disable-freeze
              Start the simulator in a running (unpaused) state.

       --enable-fuel-freeze
              Do not consume any fuel (keep its quantity  in  the  tanks  con‐
              stant).

       --disable-fuel-freeze
              Consume fuel normally.

       --enable-clock-freeze
              Do not let the clock advance while running the simulation.

       --disable-clock-freeze
              Let the clock advance normally.

       --failure=pitot|static|vacuum|electrical
              Fail  the  aircraft pitot, static, vacuum or electrical systems.
              This option may be repeated multiple times to fail more than one
              system.

       --load-tape=tape
              Load and replay the flight recorder tape tape.

   Audio options
       --show-sound-devices
              Show a list of available audio devices and exit.

       --sound-device=name
              Set  the  sound  device to use to name, where name is the device
              name shown by the --show-sound-devices option.

       --enable-sound, --disable-sound
              Enable/disable sound in the simulator.

   Rendering options
       --terrain-engine=tilecache|pagedLOD
              Choose the terrain engine to use. tilecache is the "traditional"
              terrain  engine  (recommended);  pagedLOD is a new, experimental
              terrain engine designed to minimize memory usage by loading more
              detailed versions of scenery objects on demand.

              The pagedLOD engine is available only if FlightGear was compiled
              with GDAL support.

       --lod-levels=levels
              Set the level of detail levels to  levels,  where  levels  is  a
              space-separated list of numeric levels. This option is available
              only if the terrain engine in use is pagedLOD.

       --lod-res=resolution
              Set the terrain mesh resolution to resolution.  This  option  is
              available only if the terrain engine in use is pagedLOD.

       --lod-texturing=bluemarble|raster|debug
              Set the terrain texture method. This option is available only if
              the terrain engine in use is pagedLOD.

       --lod-range-mult=multiplier
              Set the range multiplier (the breakpoint from a low  to  a  high
              level of detail) to multiplier. This option is available only if
              the terrain engine in use is pagedLOD.

       --enable-rembrandt, --disable-rembrandt
              Enable/disable the Rembrandt engine ⟨http://wiki.flightgear.org/
              Project_Rembrandt⟩,  which  adds deferred shading (rendering all
              properties of an object, such as shading, lighting, fog) in more
              than one pass.

       --renderer=name
              If  the  Rembrandt engine is enabled, use the rendering pipeline
              described in $FG_ROOT/Effects/name.xml.

       --enable-splash-screen, --disable-splash-screen
              Show/hide the simulator splash screen  while  loading  the  air‐
              craft/scenery.

       --enable-mouse-pointer, --disable-mouse-pointer
              Force  enable  display/do not force display the mouse pointer at
              startup.

       --max-fps=frequency
              Limit the maximum frame rate of the simulator  to  frequency  Hz
              (frames per second).

       --bpp=depth
              Use  a  color  depth of depth bits per pixel to display the air‐
              craft and scenery.

       --fog-disable, --fog-fastest, --fog-nicest
              Choose the fog/haze  rendering  technique.   --fog-disable  will
              disable fog/haze entirely; --fog-fastest will explicitly ask the
              graphics card driver to choose the most efficient, but  possibly
              less  accurate,  fog/haze rendering algorithm; --fog-nicest will
              leave the algorithm choice to  the  driver,  leading  to  higher
              quality results.

       --enable-enhanced-lighting, --disable-enhanced-lighting
              Enable/disable  enhanced  runway lighting. This option is depre‐
              cated.

       --enable-distance-attenuation, --disable-distance-attenuation
              Enable/disable runway light  distance  attenuation  (the  runway
              lights become less intense as distance increases).

       --enable-horizon-effect, --disable-horizon-effect
              Enable/disable the celestial body growth illusion near the hori‐
              zon.

       --enable-specular-highlight, --disable-specular-highlight
              Enable/disable specular reflections on textured objects.

       --fov=degrees
              Set the field of view angle (FOV) to degrees. High field of view
              angles  allow  you  to see a wider part of the world; low angles
              allow you to "zoom in" on details.

       --aspect-ratio-multiplier=factor
              Set the horizontal and vertical aspect ratio multiplier to  fac‐
              tor.

       --enable-fullscreen, --disable-fullscreen
              Enable/disable fullscreen mode.

       --shading-flat, --shading-smooth
              Use  flat/smooth shading. If flat shading is active, the simula‐
              tor uses the same color to paint the face of an object: this  is
              faster,  but makes edges more pronounced. Smooth shading smooths
              color changes between vertices, leading  to  higher-quality  re‐
              sults, at an expense in performance.

       --materials-file=file
              Load the definitions of the materials used to render the scenery
              from file. By default, materials are  loaded  from  $FG_ROOT/re‐
              gions/materials.xml.

       --texture-filtering=value
              Set  the  anisotropic texture filtering to value. The acceptable
              values are 1 (default), 2, 4, 8 or 16.

       --enable-wireframe, --disable-wireframe
              Enable/disable the wireframe drawing mode (in which only  object
              edges are painted).

       --geometry=widthxheight
              Set  the  window geometry (size) to widthxheight (both width and
              height are in pixels).

       --view-offset=LEFT|RIGHT|CENTER|value
              Specify the default forward view direction  as  an  offset  from
              straight  ahead.   The  allowed  values  are  LEFT (-90°), RIGHT
              (90°), CENTER (0°) or a specific number in degrees.

   Aircraft options
       --aircraft=name, --vehicle=name
              Load an aircraft/vehicle from a set file named name-set.xml. The
              file  is  searched  for  in  $FG_ROOT/Aircraft, in the directory
              pointed to by the environment variable FG_AIRCRAFT  and  in  the
              directories passed to fgfs(1) using the --fg-aircraft option.

       --aircraft-dir=path
              Explicitly  specify  the  directory  in  which the -set.xml file
              should be searched for. If this argument is used, the path cache
              stored  in ~/.fgfs/autosave_X_Y.xml, the directories passed with
              the --fg-aircraft option and  the  directory  specified  in  the
              FG_AIRCRAFT environment variable are not taken into account.

       --show-aircraft
              Print a list of available aircraft and exit.

       --min-status=alpha|beta|early-production|production
              Do  not list aircraft having a status level (development status)
              lower than the one specified. See the FlightGear wiki  "Aircraft
              rating       system"      page      ⟨http://wiki.flightgear.org/
              Aircraft_rating_system⟩ for an extended description of  aircraft
              ratings.

       --fdm=jsb|larcsim|yasim|magic|balloon|ada|external|null
              Select the core flight dynamics model to use among the following
              ones:

              •  jsb:   the   JSBSim   flight    dynamics    model    ⟨http://
                 www.jsbsim.org/⟩,  which takes a data-driven approach to mod‐
                 eling: given the performance data for an aircraft  (mass  and
                 balance,  ground reactions, propulsions, aerodynamics...), it
                 assembles it together to produce the global  aircraft  dynam‐
                 ics;

              •  larcsim:   the   LaRCsim   flight   dynamics  model  ⟨http://
                 www.jsbsim.org/⟩, the original model used in FlightGear up to
                 2000, developed at NASA, now inactive;

              •  yasim:    the    YASim   flight   dynamics   model   ⟨http://
                 wiki.flightgear.org/YASim⟩, which,  given  the  physical  and
                 flying  characteristics of an aircraft, attempts to solve for
                 them;

              •  magic: the "Magic Carpet" flight model;

              •  balloon: a hot air balloon simulation;

              •  ada: an externally-driven flight dynamics model  designed  by
                 the Aeronautical Development Agency of Bangalore, India;

              •  external/null: use an external flight dynamics model (the ex‐
                 ternal option has the same meaning as null and is  maintained
                 for backward compatibility purposes).

       --aero=name
              Load  the  aircraft aerodynamics model from the file name.xml in
              the aircraft directory.

       --model-hz=n
              Run the flight dynamics model at a frequency of n  Hz  (n  times
              per second).

       --speed=n
              Run the flight dynamics model n times faster than real time.

       --trim, --notrim
              Trim/do not attempt to trim the model. This option is only valid
              if the flight dynamics module in use is JSBSim.

       --on-ground
              Start the aircraft on the ground. This is the default option.

       --in-air
              Start the aircraft in the air. This option is implied if --alti‐
              tude is specified.

       --enable-auto-coordination, --disable-auto-coordination
              Enable/disable  auto  coordination  (joint control of rudder and
              ailerons).

       --livery=name
              Load the aircraft livery from a file named name.

       --state=value
              Set the initial aircraft state to value. The states that can  be
              used are aircraft-dependent.

   Time options
       --timeofday=real|dawn|morning|noon|afternoon|dusk|evening|midnight
              Start the simulator at the specified time of day:

              •  real: real clock time;

              •  dawn: the time when the Sun is 90° E on the horizon;

              •  morning: the time when the Sun is 75° E on the horizon;

              •  noon: the time when the Sun is 0° on the horizon;

              •  afternoon: the time when the Sun is 75° W on the horizon;

              •  dusk: the time when the Sun is 90° W on the horizon;

              •  evening: the time when the Sun is 100° W on the horizon;

              •  midnight: the time when the Sun is 180° on the horizon.

       --season=summer|winter
              Load summer/winter textures.

       --time-offset=[+|-]hh:mm:ss
              Add a time offset to the startup time specified with the --time‐
              ofday option.
