NAME
       nypatchy - tool to work with specialized-format patches

SYNOPSIS
       nypatchy pam fort cradle print cc as data [ fort2 cc2 as2 data2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       nypatchy  is  a  tool for working with Patchy Master Files (PAM files).  A PAM file is an ordinary text file (generally with a three-letter extension of ".car") that holds source code interleaved with
       special pre-processing instructions for nypatchy.  The source code may be in C, FORTRAN, assembly language, or a combination of these.  The pre-processing instructions allow one to  maintain  separate
       optional  patches  independently,  for  instance  in  the case of architecture-specific code.  Details of the pre-processing commands used by nypatchy are beyond the scope of this man page; the reader
       should refer to the full manual available from CERN.

       Telling nypatchy which set of patches to use may be done on standard input or via a so-called cradle file.  Typically the cradle file will contain one or more +USE  statements  as  well  as  +EXE  and
       +QUIT, for instance in the case of the isajet Monte Carlo generator:

       +USE,*ISAJET
       +EXE
       +PAM
       +QUIT

USAGE
       In  the command line shown above, pam is the PAM file, if any.  fort is the name of the primary output source code file, if any.  cradle is the name of the cradle file, if any (default is standard in‐
       put, for instance a here-doc).  print is the name of the file to receive printed output (the default is standard output).  cc, as, data are the names of the source code output files for data types CC,
       AS, DATA.  The remaining parameters are the source code output files to receive diverted material for respective data types FORT, CC, AS, DATA.

       Parameters  may be omitted by substituting a dash - for them.  Trailing parameters may be cut short by giving "." or ".go"; the latter commences execution immediately rather than starting the nypatchy
       interactive prompt.

       nypatchy will return to the shell a code of 0 if successful, 1 if there is a warning, and 2 if an error occurs.  Since the program stops creating output, but continues to run (in order  to  check  for
       further errors) if an error occurs, the user should be sure to test the error code $? after any nypatchy run.

EXAMPLES
       nypatchy -- xyz .go
              reads the cradle (instructions) from file xyz.cra, which must list all other files to be used.

       nypatchy .go << EOF
              <cradle>

       EOF
              has the cradle given as a here-document.

       nypatchy zebra.car zebra.fca zebra.cra zebra.lis .go
              reads the PAM file zebra.car, outputting the resulting source code to zebra.fca, taking the cradle from zebra.cra, with printing done to zebra.lis.

       Running the command "nypatchy help .no" also gives some brief help on usage.
