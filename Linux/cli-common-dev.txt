NAME
       dh_makeclilibs - automatically create clilibs file

SYNOPSIS
       dh_makeclilibs [debhelper options] [-r] [-V[dependancies]] [-mminversion] [-lnextincompatible] [-Xitem]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_makeclilibs is a debhelper program that automatically scans for versioned CIL (.NET) assemblies, and generates a clilibs file for the libraries it finds.

       By default, dh_makeclilibs scans the .dll files in the package directories and writes the discovered compatibility data (major/minor, build, token) to "clilibs" files in the appropriate packages.

       However, if a file like debian/package.clilibs is found, this one will be installed and no scanning is performed.

OPTIONS
       -V, -Vdependancies
       --version-info, --version-info=dependancies
           By  default, the clilibs file generated by this program does not make packages depend on any particular version of the package containing the assembly.  It may be necessary for you to add some
           version dependency information to the clilibs file. If -V is specified with no dependency information, the current version of  the  package  is  plugged  into  a  dependency  that  looks  like
           "packagename (>= packageversion)". If -V is specified with parameters, the parameters can be used to specify the exact dependency information needed (be sure to include the package name).

           Beware of using -V without any parameters; this is a conservative setting that always ensures that other packages' shared library dependencies are at least as tight as they need to be, so that
           if the maintainer screws up then they won't break. The flip side is that packages might end up with dependencies that are too tight and so find it harder to be upgraded.

       -mminversion
           Like -V, but specifies only the version string, the package name comes from the package that is actually processed. This option is more flexible if you try to set a range of valid versions for
           different assembly packages coming from one source package.

       -lnextincompatible
           Specifies the (expected) version of this package when the compatibility to the current assemblies will break.

       -r  An  experimental  option  to  automaticaly guess the next incompatible upstream version and insert them (like working with -l and -m options, see above). Do not expect the guessed values to be
           always correct - normally, the usualy assumed version string has the form generation.major.minor where versions with  changes  in  "minor"  are  compatible  and  "major"  versions  break  with
           compatibility.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain "item" anywhere in their filename or directory from being treated as shared libraries.

       --internal-mono
           Uses the Mono runtime in . (used for bootstrapping Mono packages)

EXAMPLES
        dh_makeclilibs

       Assuming this is a package named libfoobar0.9x-cil, generates a clilibs file that looks something like:
        libfoobar  1.0.2345.0_23a12f34  libfoobar0.9x-cil

        dh_makeclilibs -V

       Assuming the current version of the package is 0.93-3, generates a clilibs file that looks something like:
        libfoobar 1.0.2345.0_23a12f34 libfoobar0.9x-cil (>= 0.93-3)

        dh_makeclilibs -V 'libfoobar0.9x-cil (>= 0.92)'

       Generates a clilibs file that looks something like:
         libfoobar 1.0.2345.0_23a12f34 libfoobar0.9x-cil (>= 0.92)

       Assuming that your package creates libfoobar-cil and liblafasel-cil, which are compatible to 0.92 versions but the upstream is going to break compatibility in the next version, 0.94:

        dh_makeclilibs -m 0.92 -l 0.94

       Generates clilibs file that looks something like:

         libfoobar 1.0.2345.0_23a12f34 libfoobar-cil (>= 0.92), libfoobar-cil (<< 0.94)

       and

         liblafasel 1.0.2345.0_23a12f34 liblafasel-cil (>= 0.92), liblafasel-cil (<< 0.94)

KNOWN BUGS
       Will possibly not work correctly with DH_COMPAT levels 1 and 2.
