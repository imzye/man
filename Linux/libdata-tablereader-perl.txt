NAME
       Data::TableReader::Decoder::Spreadsheet - Base class for implementing spreadsheet decoders

VERSION
       version 0.021

DESCRIPTION
       This is a base class for any file format that exposes a spreadsheet API compatible with Spreadsheet::ParseExcel.

ATTRIBUTES
       See attributes from parent class: Data::TableReader::Decoder.

   workbook
       This is an instance of Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX, or Spreadsheet::XLSX (which all happen to have the same API).  Subclasses can lazy-build this from the "file_handle".

   sheet
       This is either a sheet name, a regex for matching a sheet name, or a parser's worksheet object.  It is also optional; if not set, all sheets will be iterated.

   xls_formatter
       An optional object that is passed to Excel parsers Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX and Spreadsheet::ParseExcel. It governs how raw data in cells is formatted into values depending on the type of the cell.
       The parsers create one of their own if none is provided, usually Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::FmtDefault.

       Note that it does not work for Spreadsheet::XLSX, which hardcodes the formatter as Spreadsheet::XLSX::Fmt2007.
