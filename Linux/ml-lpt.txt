NAME
       ml-ulex - a Unicode-compatible lexical analyser generator

SYNOPSIS
       ml-ulex [OPTIONS] file

DESCRIPTION
       Ml-ulex is a lexer generator that supports Unicode characters (in UTF-8 representation) and an extended form of regular expressions.

OPTIONS
       --dot
           generate DOT output (http://www.graphviz.org). The generated file will be named file.dot, where file is the input file.

       --match
           enter interactive matching mode. This will allow interactive testing of the machine; presently, only the INITIAL start state is available for testing (see the User Guide for details on
           start states).

       --ml-lex-mode
           operate in ml-lex compatibility mode.

       --table-based
           generate a table-based lexer.

       --fn-based
           generate a lexer that represents states as functions and transitions as tail calls.

       --minimize
           generate a minimal machine. Note that this is slow, and is almost never necessary.

       --strict-sml
           generate strict SML (i.e., do not use SML/NJ extensions). This flag is useful if you want to use the output with a different SML system.
