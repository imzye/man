MARIADB-CONFIG(1)                                                                         MariaDB Database System                                                                         MARIADB-CONFIG(1)

NAME
       mariadb-dump - get compile options for compiling clients

SYNOPSIS

       mariadb-dump options

DESCRIPTION
       mariadb-dump provides you with useful information for compiling your MariaDB client and connecting it to MariaDB.

       mariadb-dump supports the following options.

       •   --cflags

           Compiler flags to find include files and critical compiler flags and defines used when compiling the libmysqlclient library. The options returned are tied to the specific compiler that was
           used when the library was created and might clash with the settings for your own compiler. Use --include for more portable options that contain only include paths.

       •   --include

           Compiler options to find MariaDB include files.

       •   --libmysqld-libs, --embedded

           Libraries and options required to link with the MariaDB embedded server.

       •   --libs

           Libraries and options required to link with the MariaDB client library.

       •   --libs_r

           Libraries and options required to link with the thread-safe MariaDB client library.

       •   --plugindir

           The default plugin directory path name, defined when configuring MariaDB.

       •   --port

           The default TCP/IP port number, defined when configuring MariaDB.

       •   --socket

           The default Unix socket file, defined when configuring MariaDB.

       •   --variable=VAR

           Path to MariaDB include, library and plugin directories. VAR is one of `pkgincludedir`, `pkglibdir` and `plugindir`, respectively.

       •   --version

           Version number for the MariaDB distribution.

       If you invoke mariadb-dump with no options, it displays a list of all options that it supports, and their values:

           shell> mariadb-dump
           Usage: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mariadb-dump [options]
           Options:
             --cflags         [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
             --include        [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql]
             --libs           [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lz
                               -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -L/usr/lib -lssl -lcrypto]
             --libs_r         [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient_r
                               -lpthread -lz -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread]
             --socket         [/tmp/mysql.sock]
             --port           [3306]
             --version        [4.0.16]
             --libmysqld-libs [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqld -lpthread -lz
                               -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread -lrt]

       You can use mariadb-dump within a command line to include the value that it displays for a particular option. For example, to compile a MariaDB client program, use mariadb-dump as follows:

           shell> CFG=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mariadb-dump
           shell> sh -c "gcc -o progname `$CFG --include` progname.c `$CFG --libs`"

       When you use mariadb-dump this way, be sure to invoke it within backtick (“`”) characters. That tells the shell to execute it and substitute its output into the surrounding command.
