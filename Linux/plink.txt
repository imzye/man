NAME
       plink,p-link,plink1 - whole genome SNP analysis

SYNOPSIS
       plink --help

DESCRIPTION
       This  binary  was  renamed  from plink to p-link/plink1 because there is a name clash between this plink and a part of the ssh clone putty.  Please read /usr/share/doc/plink/README.Debian to learn
       more about this.

       Plink works on SNP datasets that have already been pre-analysed for their reliability and their calling to AA, BB or AB. It finds associations with a disease of single SNPs  or  pairs,  determines
       haplotype blocks or retrieves information on SNPs from an online repository.

       This manual page must be insufficient. Please use the help option for a quick reminder of the options of p-link or turn to its home page with the online documentation or the downloadable manual.
