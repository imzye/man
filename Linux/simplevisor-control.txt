SIMPLEVISOR-CONTROL(1)                                                                    simplevisor-control man page                                                                   SIMPLEVISOR-CONTROL(1)

NAME
       simplevisor-control - run simplevisor as a service

SYNOPSIS
       simplevisor-control command [path]

DESCRIPTION
       The simplevisor-control script can be used to run simplevisor as a service.

       If this script is used the pidfile value specified in the simplevisor configuration file will be ignored.

OPTIONS
       command run "simplevisor-control help" to list the available commands

       path look at simplevisor man page for path behavior.

EXAMPLES
       On Linux you can look at the script shipped in the examples folder which is called simplevisor-new-instance, it creates folders and the configuration to run a simplevisor instance.

           mkdir -p /var/lib/myinstance/bin
           mkdir -p /var/lib/myinstance/data
           mkdir -p /var/lib/myinstance/etc

       Create a file /var/lib/myinstance/bin/service with content and make it executable:

           #!/bin/sh
           #
           # init script that can be symlinked from /etc/init.d
           #

           # chkconfig: - 90 15
           # description: my simplevisor instance

           . "/var/lib/myinstance/etc/simplevisor.profile"
           exec "/usr/bin/simplevisor-control" ${1+"$@"}

       /var/lib/myinstance/etc/simplevisor.profile could look like:

           # main
           export SIMPLEVISOR_NAME=myinstance
           # if you want to run it as another user:
           #export SIMPLEVISOR_USER=games
           export SIMPLEVISOR_CONF=/var/lib/myinstance/etc/simplevisor.conf
           export SIMPLEVISOR_PIDFILE=/var/lib/myinstance/data/simplevisor.pid
           export SIMPLEVISOR_LOCKFILE=/var/lib/myinstance/data/simplevisor.lock

       Create /var/lib/myinstance/etc/simplevisor.conf according to simplevisor documentation.

       For Red Hat or Fedora you can symlink service script:

           ln -s /var/lib/myinstance/bin/service /etc/init.d/myinstance

       And use it as a normal service:

           /sbin/service myinstance start|stop|status|restart|check
