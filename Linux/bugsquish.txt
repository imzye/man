NAME
       bugsquish -  Bugs are trying to suck blood out of your arm!

SYNOPSIS
       bugsquish [--disable-sound] [--fullscreen] [--low] | [--help | --usage]

DESCRIPTION
       This   manual   page   was   written   for   the   Debian   GNU/Linux   distribution   because   the   original   program   does  not  have  a  manual  page.   Instead,  it  has  documentation  in
       /usr/share/doc/bugsquish/README.txt.gz

       "Bug Squish" is an action game not unlike light gun arcade games, but
        played with a mouse.

OPTIONS
       --disable-sound
              If sound support was compiled in, this will disable it for this session of the game.  --fullscreen Run in fullscreen mode.  --low Disable some features so that the game might run better  on
              low-end  hardware.   Titlescreen ballons and game backgrounds are disabled, and the game screen refreshes every 1/15th of a second instead of 1/30th of a second.  --help Display a help mes‐
              sage summarizing command-line options, copyright, and game controls.  --usage Display a brief message summarizing command-line options.  Quitting To quit the current  game,  you  can  press
              [ESCAPE].
