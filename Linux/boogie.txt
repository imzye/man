NAME
       boogie - compiler for the Boogie programming language

SYNOPSIS
       boogie [options] file.bpl ...

DESCRIPTION
       boogie is a compiler for Microsoft Research's Boogie programming language, an imperative compiler intermediate language with built-in specification constructs.  The integrated static analyzer
       can verify functional correctness as part of the compilation process.

OPTIONS
       boogie accepts a number of different types of options.

   File macros
       A number of boogie options accept a file argument, which may contain the following macros:

       @FILE@ Expands to the last filename specified on the command line.

       @PREFIX@
              Expands to the concatenation of strings given by /logPrefix options.

       @TIME@ Expands to the current time.

   General options
       /env:n Control printing of command-line arguments.  Accepted values for n are:

              0      Suppress printing of command-line arguments.

              1      (default) Print command-line arguments during BPL print and prover log.

              2      Print command-line arguments during BPL print and prover log, and also to standard output.

       /noLogo
              Suppress printing of the version number and copyright message.

       /wait  Wait for a carriage return from the keyboard before exiting.

       /xml:file
              Also produce output in XML format to file.

   Boogie options
       Multiple .bpl files supplied on the command line are concatenated into one Boogie program.

       /enhancedErrorMessages:n
              Control printing of enhanced error messages.  Accepted values for n are:

              0      (default) Do not print enhanced error messages.

              1      Print Z3 error model enhanced error messages.

       /loopUnroll:n
              Unroll loops, following up to n back edges (and then some).

       /mv:file
              Save the model in BVD format to the specified file.

       /noResolve
              Parse only.

       /noTypecheck
              Parse and resolve only.

       /overlookTypeErrors
              Skip any implementation with resolution or type checking errors.

       /print:file
              Print Boogie program to the specified file after parsing it.  Specify /print:- to print to standard output.

       /printCFG:prefix
              Print the control flow graph of each implementation in dot(1) format to files named prefix.procedurename.dot.

       /printDesugared
              With /print, desugar calls.

       /printModel:n
              Control printing of Z3's error model.  Accepted values for n are:

              0      (default) Do not print Z3's error model.

              1      Print Z3's error model.

              2      Print Z3's error model and reverse mappings.

              3      Print Z3's error model in a more human-readable way.

       /printModelToFile:file
              With /print, print Z3's error model to file instead of standard output.

       /printUnstructured
              With /print, desugar all structured statements.

       /printWithUniqueIds
              Print augmented information that uniquely identifies variables.

       /proc:p
              Only  check  procedures matched by the pattern p.  This option may be specified multiple times to match multiple patterns.  The pattern p matches the whole procedure name (e.g., a pat‐
              tern "foo" will only match a procedure called "foo", not one called "fooBar").  The pattern p may contain * wildcards which match any character zero or more times.   For  example,  the
              pattern "ab*d" would match "abd", "abcd", and "abccd", but not "Aabd" or "abdD".  The pattern "*ab*d*" would match "abd", "abcd", "abccd", "Abd", and "abdD".

       /soundLoopUnrolling
              Enable sound loop unrolling.

       /useBaseNameForFileName
              When parsing, use the base name of the file for tokens instead of the path supplied on the command line.

   Inference options
       /checkInfer
              Instrument inferred invariants as asserts to be checked by the theorem prover.

       /contractInfer
              Perform procedure contract inference.

       /infer[:domains]
              Use abstract interpretation to infer invariants.  domains may be any of the following:

              c      constant propagation

              d      dynamic type

              i      intervals

              j      stronger intervals (cannot be combined with other domains)

              n      nullness

              p      polyhedra for linear inequalities

              t      trivial bottom/top lattice (cannot be combined with other domains)

              You may also specify the following options as pseudo-domains:

              s      debug statistics

              0...9  number of iterations before applying a widen (default: 0)

              The default is /infer:i.  With /infer (and no domains), all domains will be used.

       /instrumentInfer:flag
              Control when inferred invariants are instrumented.  Accepted values for flag are:

              h      (default) Instrument inferred invariants only at the beginning of loop headers.

              e      Instrument inferred invariants at the beginning and end of every block.  This mode is intended for use in debugging abstract domains.

       /noinfer
              Turn off the default inference, and override any previous /infer flags.

       /printInstrumented
              Print Boogie program after it has been instrumented with invariants.

   Debugging and tracing options
       /break Launch and break into the debugger.

       /log[:method]
              Print debug output during translation.

       /trace Blurt out various debug trace information.  Implies /tracePOs.

       /tracePOs
              Output information about the number of proof obligations.

       /traceTimes

   Verification condition generation options
       /alwaysAssumeFreeLoopInvariants
              Include  free  loop  invariants  as assumptions in checking contexts.  Usually, a free loop invariant (or assume statement in that position) is ignored in checking contexts (like other
              free things).

       /causalImplies
              Translate Boogie's A ==> B into prover's A ==> A && B.

       /coalesceBlocks:n
              Control when to coalesce blocks.  Accepted values for n are:

              1      (default) Coalesce blocks.

       /fixedPointEngine:engine
              Use the specified fixed point engine for inference.

       /inferLeastForUnsat:prefix
              Infer the least number of constants (whose names are prefixed by prefix) that need to be set to true for the program to be correct.  Implies /stratifiedInline:1.

       /inline:strategy
              Use the specified inlining strategy for procedures with the :inline attribute.  Accepted strategies are none, assume (the default), assert, and spec.

       /lazyInline:1
              Use the lazy inlining algorithm.

       /liveVariableAnalysis:n
              Control when and how to perform live variable analysis.  Accepted values for n are:

              1      (default) Perform live variable analysis.

              2      Perform interprocedural live variable analysis.

       /monomorphize
              Do not abstract map types in the encoding.  This is an experimental feature which will not do the right thing if the program uses polymorphism.

       /noVerify

              0      Do not remove empty blocks.

              1      (default) Remove empty blocks.

       /smoke Run the soundness smoke test: try to stick assert false; in some places in the BPL and see if we can still prove it.

       /smokeTimeout:n
              Set the timeout, in seconds, for a single theorem prover invocation during the smoke test.  By default, n is 10.

       /stratifiedInline:1
              Use the stratified inlining algorithm.

       /subsumption:n
              Control when subsumption is applied to asserted conditions.  Accepted values for n are:

              0      Never apply subsumption.

              1      Do not apply subsumption for quantifiers.

              2      (default) Always apply subsumption.

              b      flat block

              d      (default) DAG

              l      local

              m      nested block reach

              n      nested block

              r      flat block reach

              s      structured

       /verifySeparately
              Verify each input program separately.

       /verifySnapshots:n
              Verify several program snapshots (named filename.v0.bpl to filename.vN.bpl), possibly using verification result caching.  Accepted values for n are:

              0      (default) Do not use any verification result caching.

              1      Use basic verification result caching.

              2      Use advanced verification result caching.

              3      Use advanced verification result caching, and report errors according to the new source locations for errors and their related locations (but not  /errorTrace  and  CaptureState
                     locations).

   Verification condition splitting
       /vcsCores:n
              Try to verify n verification conditions at once.  Defaults to 1.

       /vcsDumpSplits
              For the nth split, dump split.n.dot and split.n.bpl.  Note that this affects error reporting.

       /vcsFinalAssertTimeout:n
              Set the timeout, in seconds, for the single last assertion in keep-going mode.  By default, n is 30.

       /vcsKeepGoingTimeout:n
              Set the timeout, in seconds, for a single theorem prover invocation in keep-going mode, except for the final single-assertion case.  By default, n is 1.

       /vcsLoad:f
              Like /vcsCores:n, where n is the machine's processor count multiplied by f and rounded to the nearest integer.  f must be in the range [0.0, 3.0].  This will never set n less than 1.

       /vcsMaxCost:f
              Verification  conditions  will  not  be  split unless the cost of a verification condition exceeds f.  f defaults to 2000.0.  This does not apply in the keep-going mode after the first
              round of splitting.

       /vcsMaxKeepGoingSplits:n
              If n is set to more than 1, this activates keep-going mode, where after the first round of splitting, verification conditions that time out are split into n pieces  and  retried  until
              either  proving  them is successful or there is only one assertion on a single path and it times out.  (In such a case, boogie reports an error for that assertion).  By default, n is 1
              (that is, keep-going mode is disabled).

       /vcsMaxSplits:n
              Set the maximal number of verification conditions generated per method.  In keep-going mode, this only applies to the first round.  By default, n is 1.

       /vcsPathCostMult:f1, /vcsAssumeMult:f2
              Controls the cost of a block.  Block cost is computed according to the formula

                  (assert-cost + f2 × assume-cost) × (1 + f1 × entering-paths)

              where f1 defaults to 1.0 and f2 defaults to 0.01.  The cost of a single assertion or assumption is always 1.0.

       /vcsPathJoinMult:f
              Sets a scale factor which boogie will multiply by the number of paths in a block if more than one path join at a block.  This is intended to reflect the fact that the prover will learn
              something on one path before proceeding to the next.  By default, f is 0.8.

       /vcsPathSplitMult:f
              If the best path split of a verification condition of cost A is into verification conditions of cost B and C, then the split is applied if A ≥ f × (B + C).  Otherwise, assertion split‐
              ting will be applied.  By default, f is 0.5 (that is, always do path splitting if possible).  Increase f to do less path splitting and more assertion splitting.

   Prover options
       /errorLimit:n
              Limit the number of errors produced for each procedure.  By default, n is 5, but some provers may only support 1.

       /errorTrace:n
              Control whether or not trace labels appear in the error output.  Accepted values for n are:

              0      Print no trace labels in the error output.

              1      (default) Print useful trace labels in error output.

              2      Print all trace labels in error output.

       /logPrefix:prefix
              Define the expansion of the macro @PREFIX@.

       /p:key[:value], /proverOpt:key[:value]
              Provide a prover-specific option.

       /platform:ptype,location
              Set the platform type and location.  ptype may be v11, v2, or cli1, and location should be the platform libraries directory.

       /prover:p
              Use theorem prover p.  p may be a full path to a prover DLL, or it may be one of the following standard provers:

              ContractInference

              Simplify
                     This implies /vc:n and /vcBrackets:1.

              SMTLib (default) Use the SMTLib2 format, and call Z3.

              Z3     Z3 with the Simplify format.

              Z3api  Z3 with the managed (CLI) API.

       /proverLog:file
              Log input for the theorem prover.

              In addition to the standard file name macros, file can use the @PROC@ macro, which causes boogie to generate one prover log file per verification condition,  expanding  @PROC@  to  the
              name of the procedure that the verification condition is for.

       /proverLogAppend
              Append (do not overwrite) the specified prover log file.

       /proverMemorylimit:n
              Limit the prover to n megabytes of virtual memory before forcing it to restart.  n defaults to 100.

       /proverShutdownLimitn
              Set the time, in seconds, between closing the stream to the prover and killing the prover process.  n defaults to 0.

       /proverWarnings:n
              Control warning output from the prover.  Accepted values for n are:

              0      (default) Don't print warning output from the prover.

              1      Print warnings to standard output.

              2      Print warnings to standard error.

       /restartProver
              Restart the prover after each query.

       /timeLimit:n
              Limit the number of seconds spent trying to verify each procedure.

       /vcBrackets:n
              Control whether or not odd-charactered identifier names will be bracketed with pipe characters ('|').  Accepted values for n are:

              0      (default) Do not bracket odd-charactered identifier names.

              1      Bracket odd-charactered identifier names.

   Prover options (Simplify)
       /simplifyMatchDepth:n
              Set Simplify's matching depth limit.

   Prover options (Z3)
       /useArrayTheory
              Use Z3's native array theory, as opposed to axioms.  Implies /monomorphize.

       /useSmtOutputFormat
              Output a model in SMTLib2 format.

       /z3exe:path
              Set the path to the Z3 executable.  On Debian systems, this defaults to /usr/bin/z3.

       /z3lets:n
              Configure use of LETs in Z3.  Accepted values for n are:

              0      Do not use LETs.

              1      Use only LET TERM.

              2      Use only LET FORMULA.

              3      (default) Use any LET.

       /z3multipleErrors
              Report multiple counterexamples for each error.

       /z3opt:option
              Set an additional Z3 option.

       /z3types
              Generate a multi-sorted verification condition that makes use of Z3 types.
