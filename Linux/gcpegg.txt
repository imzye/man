       GNU/Linux to provide the briefest of overviews.

COMMANDS
       The eggsh program is the main data collection and transmission program.  It is launched at boot and runs persistently.  Is is configured using the /etc/eggrc file.

       The gcpbasket command is the data collector, and is not normally needed by an EGG site.
