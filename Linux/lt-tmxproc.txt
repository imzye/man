NAME
     lt-tmxproc — translation stream processor for Apertium

SYNOPSIS
     lt-tmxproc fst_file [input_file [output_file]]

DESCRIPTION
     lt-tmxproc is the application responsible for preprocessing the translation stream in Apertium using a compiled translation memory.

     It accomplishes these tasks by reading binary files containing a compact and efficient representation of dictionaries (a class of finite-state transducers called augmented letter transducers).  These
     files are generated by lt-tmxcomp(1).

FILES
     input_file
             The input compiled dictionary.
