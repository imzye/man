NAME
       Psignifit - A program for fitting and testing hypotheses about psychometric functions.

DESCRIPTION
       Psignifit allows fitting of psychometric functions to datasets while maintaining full control over a large number of parameters. Data can either be read from
       text files or passed through a pipe.
       Psignifit performs the calculation of confidence intervals as well as goodness-of-fit tests.  Psignifit accepts input in a number of different ways:

       From named text files:
              psignifit <data> <preferences>

       Entirely from the console:
              psignifit (...)
              (enter data and preferences from the console and then send an EOF character - Ctrl-D in most UNIX shells)

       Partly from named text files, partly from the console:
              psignifit <data> <preferences> -

       Through a pipe:
              cat <data + preferences> | psignifit

       Or via a mixture of piped input on stdin and files named on the command line:
              echo "#random_seed 12345" | cat <preferences> | psignifit <data> -

       For more documentation see the files in the /usr/share/doc/psignifit directory or visit http://bootstrap-software.org/psignifit/
