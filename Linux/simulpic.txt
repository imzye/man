NAME
       simulpic - Microchip PIC 16F84 simulator

SYNOPSIS
       simulpic

DESCRIPTION
       simulpic is a program that simulates the behaviour of a Microchip 16F84 microcontroller.

       The program presents a command line interface and accepts the following commands:

       h      Give a summary of all the commands

       l <filename>
              Read program memory from IHX8M-format file <filename>

       dr     View registers

       dg     View general registers

       dee    View EEPROM data memory

       dpm    View program memory

       dp     View IO pins state

       ds     View stack

       d [<address>]
              Disassemble from <address> (or PC)

       s [<number>]
              Execute <number> steps

       g <time>
              Execute until <time>

       bp [<address>]
              Set/clear breakpoint

       pa ppppp
              Set RA io_port state (p = 0, 1, -, u)

       pb ppppp
              Set RB io_port state (p = 0, 1, -, u)

       pm p   Set MCLR state (p = 0, 1)

       io [<filename>]
              Open inputs file

       ic     Close inputs file

       ro [<filename>]
              Open report file

       rc     Close report file

       eo [<filename>]
              Open graphic file

       ec     Close graphic file

       st     Set sampling frequency (# instr.) for graphics file

       f      Set clock frequency

       por    Power-on reset

       q      Quit
