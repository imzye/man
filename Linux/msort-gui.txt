NAME
       msort-gui - frontend for msort utility

SYNOPSIS
       msort-gui

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the frontend for msort utility.  It doesn't have any command line options, just run it and it'll appear on your screen.
       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.
