NAME
       HTML::ElementTable - Perl extension for manipulating a table composed of HTML::Element style components.

SYNOPSIS
         use HTML::ElementTable;
         # Create a table 0..10 x 0..12
         $t = new HTML::ElementTable maxrow => 10, maxcol => 12;

         # Populate cells with coordinates
         $t->table->push_position;

         # Manipulate <TABLE> tag
         $t->attr('cellspacing',0);
         $t->attr('border',1);
         $t->attr('bgcolor','#DDBB00');

         # Manipulate entire table - optimize on <TR> or pass to all <TD>
         $t->table->attr('align','left');
         $t->table->attr('valign','top');

         # Manipulate rows (optimizes on <TR> if possible)
         $t->row(0,2,4,6)->attr('bgcolor','#9999FF');

         # Manipulate columns (all go to <TD> tags within column)
         $t->col(0,4,8,12)->attr('bgcolor','#BBFFBB');

         # Manipulate boxes (all go to <TD> elements
         # unless it contains full rows, then <TR>)
         $t->box(7,1 => 10,3)->attr('bgcolor','magenta');
         $t->box(7,7 => 10,5)->attr('bgcolor','magenta');
         $t->box(8,9 => 9,11)->attr('bgcolor','magenta');
         $t->box(7,10 => 10,10)->attr('bgcolor','magenta');

         # individual <TD> or <TH> attributes
         $t->cell(8,6)->attr('bgcolor','#FFAAAA');
         $t->cell(9,6)->attr('bgcolor','#FFAAAA');
         $t->cell(7,9, 10,9, 7,11, 10,11)->attr('bgcolor','#FFAAAA');

         # Take a look
         print $t->as_HTML;

DESCRIPTION
       HTML::ElementTable provides a highly enhanced HTML::ElementSuper structure with methods designed to easily manipulate table elements by using coordinates. Elements can be manipulated in bulk by
       individual cells, arbitrary groupings of cells, boxes, columns, rows, or the entire table.

PUBLIC METHODS
       Table coordinates start at 0,0 in the upper left cell.

       CONSTRUCTORS

       new()
       new(maxrow => row, maxcol => col)
           Return a new HTML::ElementTable object. If the number of rows and columns were provided, all elements required for the rows and columns will be initialized as well. See extent().

       new_from_tree($tree)
           Takes  an existing top-level HTML::Element representing a table and converts the entire table structure into a cohesive HTML::ElementTable construct. (this is potentially useful if you want to
           use the power of this module for editing HTML tables in situ within an HTML::Element tree).

       TABLE CONFIGURATION

       extent()
       extent(maxrow, maxcolumn)
           Set or return the extent of the current table. The maxrow and maxcolumn parameters indicate the maximum row and column coordinates you desire in the table. These are  the  coordinates  of  the
           lower right cell in the table, starting from (0,0) at the upper left.  Providing a smaller extent than the current one will shrink the table with no ill effect, provided you do not mind losing
           the information in the clipped cells.

       maxrow()
           Set or return the coordinate of the last row.

       maxcol()
           Set or return the coordinate of the last column.

       ELEMENT ACCESS

       Unless accessing a single element, most table element access is accomplished through globs, which are collections of elements that behave as if they were a single element object.

       Whenever  possible, globbed operations are optimized into the most appropriate element. For example, if you set an attribute for a row glob, the attribute will be set either on the <TR> element or
       the collected <TD> elements, whichever is appropriate.

       See HTML::ElementGlob(3) for more information on element globs.

       cell(row,col,[row2,col2],[...])
           Access an individual cell or collection of cells by their coordinates.

       row(row,[row2,...])
           Access the contents of a row or collection of rows by row coordinate.

       col(col,[col2,...])
           Access the contents of a column or collection of columns by column coordinate.

       box(row_a1,col_a1,row_a2,col_a2,[row_b1,col_b1,row_b2,col_b2],[...])
           Access the contents of a span of cells, specified as a box consisting of two sets of coordinates. Multiple boxes can be specified.

       table()
           Access all cells in the table. This is different from manipulating the table object itself, which is reserved for such things as CELLSPACING and other attributes specific to the  <TABLE>  tag.
           However, since table() returns a glob of cells, if the attribute is more appropriate for the top level <TABLE> tag, it will be placed there rather than in each <TR> tag or every <TD> tag.

       ELEMENT/GLOB METHODS

       The interfaces to a single table element or a glob of elements are identical. All methods available from the HTML::ElementSuper class are also available to a table element or glob of elements. See
       HTML::ElementSuper(3) for details on these methods.

       Briefly, here are some of the more useful methods provided by HTML::ElementSuper:

       attr()
       push_content()
       replace_content()
       wrap_content()
       clone([element])
       mask([mode])

       TABLE SPECIFIC EXTENSIONS

       blank_fill([mode])
           Set  or  return  the  current fill mode for blank cells. The default is 0 for HTML::Element::Table elements. When most browsers render tables, if they are empty you will get a box the color of
           your browser background color rather than the BGCOLOR of that cell. When enabled, empty cells are provided with an '&nbsp;', or invisible content, which  will  trigger  the  rendering  of  the
           BGCOLOR for that cell.

NOTES ON GLOBS
       Globbing  was  a  convenient  way  to  treat  arbitrary collections of table cells as if they were a single HTML element. Methods are generally passed blindly and sequentially to the elements they
       contain.

       Most of the time, this is fairly intuitive, such as when you are setting the attributes of the cells.

       Other times, it might be problematic, such as with push_content(). Do you push the same object to all of the cells? HTML::Element based classes only support one parent, so this breaks if  you  try
       to push the same element into multiple parental hopefuls. In the specific case of push_content() on globs, the elements that eventually get pushed are clones of the originally provided content. It
       works, but it is not necessarily what you expect. An incestuous HTML element tree is probably not what you want anyway.

       See HTML::ElementGlob(3) for more details on how globs work.
