NAME
       qttinysa - PC Interface for TinySA and TinySA Ultra Spectrum Analysers

SYNOPSIS
       qttinysa no options available

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the qttinysa Spectrum Analyzer GUI.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       qttinysa is a program that attempts to replicate some of the TinySA Ultra and TinySA on-screen commands on the PC - except for the on-screen commands related to generator control.

OPTIONS
       The program does not have any command line options.

FILES
       The program does not have any configuration files.

ENVIRONMENT
DIAGNOSTICS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

          A  TinySA Device was not found.  Found TinySA on :   A TinySA Device was found Serial Port Exception :   There was a exception while communicating over the serial port.  Database file missing :
          The internal database file was not found.

       qttinysa provides some return codes, that can be used in scripts:

       Code Diagnostic

BUGS
       The program is currently limited to only work with python3 and PyQT5.
