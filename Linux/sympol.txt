NAME
       sympol - symmetric polyhedra tool

SYNOPSIS
       sympol [OPTIONS] [INPUT_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       SymPol computes restricted automorphisms of polyhedra and performs polyhedral description conversion up to a given or computed symmetry group.

       SymPol  mostly uses the .ine/.ext file format used by cddlib and lrslib; (http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrslib/USERGUIDE.html#File%20Formats).  However, unlike cddlib, SymPol requires that every in‐
       equality (H-representation) or vertex and ray (V-representation) occupy a single line.  In addition, SymPol offers an extension to the format

       The extension permits the inclusion of the automorphism group of a polyhedron, or parts of it, in the file.  It is given after the end of the H- or V-representation of a permutation group, as follows.

       permutation group
       p
        { list of #p group generators }
       q
        { #q base points separated by whitespace }

       The p group generators are to be given in cycle form, where commas separate cycles.  The value q may be set to zero if no base of the group is known.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show a help message.

       -v, --verbose[=N]
              Set the verbosity level, 0 by default.  If N is omitted, 1 is assumed.

       -t, --time
              Enable time measurement.

       -i, --input-file FILE
              Read an input file (.ine or .ext).  The file can also be listed last on the command line.

       --automorphisms-only
              Compute only restricted automorphisms and then exit.

       --no-automorphisms
              Ignores the given symmetry group and does not attempt to compute restricted automorphisms.

       --bliss
              Use bliss graph automorphism tool to compute restricted automorphisms (default if bliss is available).

       --permlibmatrix
              Use PermLib matrix automorphism search to compute restricted automorphisms.

       --eigen
              Use floating point arithmetic based on Eigen to compute restricted automorphisms.

       -e, --estimation-only
              Compute only LRS estimation and then exit.

       -d, --direct
              Compute dual description directly.

       -a, --adm
              Use one level of adjacency decomposition, solve subproblems directly.

       --idm-adm-level idm-level adm-level
              Use a combined IDM/ADM strategy with the indicated levels.

       --adm-idm-level adm-level idm-level
              Use a combined ADM/IDM strategy with the indicated levels.

       --adm-estimate threshold
              Use adjacency decomposition method up to the given estimate threshold.

       --adm-dim threshold
              Use adjacency decomposition method up to the given dimension threshold.

       --adm-incidence threshold
              Use adjacency decomposition method up to the given incidence number threshold.

       --idm-adm idm-threshold adm-threshold
              Use a combined IDM/ADM strategy with the indicated thresholds.

       --cdd  Use cdd for core dual description conversion (EXPERIMENTAL).

       --adjacencies
              Record facet adjaencies.  Requires ADM method at level 0.

PARAMETERS
       --conf-lrs-estimates=N

       --conf-lrs-estimate-maxdepth=N
              The maximal allowed depth of LRS estimates (default: 3).

       --conf-compute-invariants=N
              The maximal degree of permutation group invariant polynomials to use (default: 0).
