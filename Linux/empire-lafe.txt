NAME
       lafe - Latency Free Empire client

SYNOPSIS
       lafe country [password [host [port]]]

DESCRIPTION
       lafe  is an empire client optimized for high latency links.  You can type in, edit, and send several commands before the server replies with output from the first command.  This allows you to
       make better use of the existing bandwidth than most other clients.  pei and eif are particularly susceptible to latency, as they require a complete exchange of data  before  prompting  again.
       lafe  could  also  be  called  LAg  Free Empire.  Empire 2 asynch features are supported.  Empire 3 C_SYNC isn't supported, as this is a rather dumb client (in between emp_client and eif) and
       C_SYNC was removed from Empire 4 (Wolfpack).  Readline is supported, and at the moment required.  If you want lafe without readline, use emp_client instead.

   Parameters
       country   If the only parameter this is use as a key to look up the game name as specified by the addgame commands in the $HOME/.laferc file.  Otherwise it is used as the country name on  the
                 server.  Defaults to 'visitor' if unspecified.

       password  defaults to 'visitor' if unspecified.

       host      defaults to 149.84.128.9 if unspecified.

       port      defaults to 6667 if unspecified.

   Local commands
       help      print syntax summary of local commands.

       addgame   game country password host port logfile directory
                 add a game definition for the "lafe game" startup method.

       execute   Handles exec scripts locally

       runfeed   Runs the argument as a shell command, and sends the output to the server shell Run the argument as a shell script

       alias     Print, delete, or define an alias.  Use single quotes around the alias definition to protect $*, $1, $2, ...

       setvar    Set, delete, or print local variables.

       shell     Run parameters in a subshell.

       history   print the previous commands.

       verbose   toggle verbosity of message.  "verbose on" if you want all the error messages, C_SYNC messages, etc.  Off by default.

       waitsync  Wait for all responses from server before proceeding.  Useful in scripts before a runfeed or shell command.

ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables are supported for backward compatibility with emp_client.  This information is best placed in the $HOME/.laferc file using the addgame command.

       EMPIREHOST      hostname of server

       EMPIREPORT      TCP/IP port number of server

       COUNTRY         Country name to log in as

       REPRESENTATIVE  Password for country

FILES
       $HOME/.laferc contains any valid local commands to run before connecting to a server.

BUGS
       Output  redirection  does  not work with aliases and internal commands.  Simultaneous connection to multiple servers is not yet supported.  Version 1.0 addresses both of these issues, but has
       stalled due to lack of time.

       When typing well ahead of the server, lafe must guess whether a local command should be parsed locally or forwarded to the server (as part of a telegram  for  instance).   It  guesses  local,
       which is not always correct.  This is the price you pay for speed.
