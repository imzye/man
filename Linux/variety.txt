NAME
       variety - Variety Wallpaper Changer

SYNOPSIS
       variety [options] [files or urls]

DESCRIPTION
       Passing local files will add them to Variety's queue.  Passing remote URLs will make Variety fetch them to Fetched folder and place them in the queue.

       To set a specific wallpaper: variety --set /some/local/image.jpg

       --profile=PROFILE
              Profile  name  or  full  path to the configuration folder Variety should use. If not specified, this is ~/.config/variety/. If just a name is used instead of a full path, the profile folder
              will be ~/.config/variety-profiles/<name>. Use only when initially starting Variety - changing the profile path requires restart. Several instances of Variety can be started when using dif‐
              ferent profiles, each with its own separate configuration. This can be used for example to control several different screens or workspaces under desktop environments like XFCE  which  allow
              this. To pass commands to a running instance, pass the same --profile argument as the one it was started with in subsequent commands.
