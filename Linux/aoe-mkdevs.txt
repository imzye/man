NAME
       aoe-mkdevs - create special device files for aoe driver

SYNOPSIS
       aoe-mkdevs {device-dir}
       env n_partitions=1 aoe-mkdevs {device-dir}

DESCRIPTION
       The aoe-mkdevs command is deprecated in favor of udev.  Systems with udev do not need to use the aoe-mkdevs or aoe-mkself commands, because udev will create device nodes as needed.

       Systems without udev use aoe-mkdevs to create the character special files necessary to control the aoe driver.  The aoe-mkdevs command uses aoe-mkshelf to also create block special files.

       The  aoe  drivers  after  version 49 support dynamic minor device numbers so that a greater number of devices can be supported.  The aoe-mkdevs command is incompatible with dynamic device numbers.  If
       your system lacks udev, and you are using an aoe driver version 50 or above, use the aoe_dyndevs=0 module option to force the aoe driver to use static device numbers.

       If you are not using dynamic device numbers, and you built your aoe driver to support only one partition per device (whole-disk partitions), then the device files must match, and you  should  use  the
       n_partitions environment variable described below.

   Arguments
       device-dir
              This should be the name of the directory where the special device files will be created.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       If the n_partitions variable is set in the environment, it will override the default number of partitions per aoe disk, namely 16.

EXAMPLE
       In  this  example, the root user on a host named nai creates special files for using the aoe disks in shelf 7.  After remembering that the driver doesn't have partition support, this sysadmin gets rid
       of the mismatching device nodes and calls aoe-mkdevs again with n_partitions set to 1.

              nai:~# rm -rf /dev/etherd
              nai:~# aoe-mkdevs /dev/etherd
              nai:~# ls /dev/etherd | wc -l
              1603
              nai:~# rm -rf /dev/etherd
              nai:~# n_partitions=1 aoe-mkdevs /dev/etherd
              nai:~# ls /dev/etherd | wc -l
              103
