NAME
       binfmtgcj-interpreter - binfmt_misc gcj handler

SYNOPSIS
       binfmtgcj-interpreter GCJ-java-source-file-name [command-line opions ...]

DESCRIPTION
       binfmtgcj-interpreter compiles a Java source file specified on the command-line using the GCJ compiler, and executes the resulting file.

       It is designed to be used as a handler for binfmt_misc handler, which is a system used in Linux for handling arbitrary files as executables.

       The command-line options are passed on to the compiled binary.

FILE MAGIC
       There is a requirement for C source files to have the magic characters //BINFMTGCJ: at the beginning of the file.

       That line also is used to specify the additional command-line options for C compiler.

ENVIRONMENT
       GCJ    The compiler used.  The default is to use gcj

       BINFMTCTMPDIR

              Temporary directory used for binary and execution.

              Falls back to $TMPDIR $TEMPDIR or /tmp

       BINFMTC_DEBUG
              enables debug output if set.

       BINFMTC_GCJ_OPTS
              Additional GCJ options.  Use BINFMTC_DEBUG to verify the options being passed on to gcc.

              The default is  -O2 -Wall
