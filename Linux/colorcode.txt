NAME
       colorcode - advanced clone of the MasterMind code-breaking game

SYNOPSIS
       colorcode

DESCRIPTION
       colorcode is an advanced and highly configurable MasterMind code-breaking game clone. The program accepts setting the number of slots (from 2 to 5), the number of colors (from 2 to 10) and setting
       if colors might be repeated in the secret code (that is, if doubles are allowed or not). The game has 5 built-in levels, from level 1 (beginner: 2 slots and 2 colors with doubles allowed) to level
       5 (hard: 5 slots and 10 colors with doubles allowed). ColorCode can make guesses in place of the user.
