NAME
       gedit - a general-purpose text editor

SYNOPSIS
       gedit [OPTION...] [FILE...] [+LINE[:COLUMN]]
       gedit [OPTION...] -

DESCRIPTION
       gedit is an easy-to-use and general-purpose text editor. Its development started in 1998, at the beginnings of the GNOME project, with a good integration with that desktop environment.

       You can use it to write simple notes and documents, or you can enable more advanced features that are useful for software development.

OPTIONS
       --encoding
              Set the character encoding to be used for opening the files listed on the command line.

       --list-encodings
              Display list of possible values for the encoding option and exit.

       --new-window
              Create a new toplevel window in an existing instance of gedit.

       --new-document
              Create a new document in an existing instance of gedit.

       -s, --standalone
              Run gedit in standalone mode.

       -w, --wait
              Open files and block the gedit process.

       --help Prints the command line options.

       --version
              Output version information and exit.

       FILE   Specifies  the file to open when gedit starts. If this is not specified, gedit will load a blank file with an "Unsaved Document" label. Multiple files can be loaded if they are separated by
              spaces.  gedit also supports handling of remote files. For example, you can pass the location of a webpage to gedit , like "http://www.gnome.org", or load a file from  a  FTP  server,  like
              "ftp://ftp.gnome.org/robots.txt".

       -      gedit will read from stdin

       +LINE  For the first file, go to the line specified by LINE (do not insert a space between the "+" sign and the number).  If LINE is missing, go to the last line.

       COLUMN For the first file, go to the column specified by COLUMN.  If COLUMN is missing, go to the first column.
