DESCRIPTION
       ncpdq packs or re-shapes variables in input-file and stores them in output-file.  Which variables to pack/unpack are determined by the packing policy encoded in the pck_plc argument to the -P  switch.
       Valid  pck_plc options are all_new, all_xst, xst_new, and upk.  The numeric type of variable to pack or re-pack a variable to is determined by the packing map encoded in the pck_map argument to the -M
       switch.  Valid pck_map options are flt_byt, flt_sht, hgh_byt, hgh_sht, and nxt_lsr.

       ncpdq re-shapes variables in input-file by re-ordering and/or reversing dimensions specified in the dimension list.  The dimension list is a comma separated list of dimension  names,  optionally  pre‐
       fixed  by  negative signs, that follow the -a switch.  To re-order variables by a subset of their dimensions, specify these dimensions in a comma-separated list following -a, e.g., -a lon,lat.  To re‐
       verse a dimension, prefix its name with a negative sign in the dimension list, e.g., -a -lat.  Re-ordering and reversal may be performed simultaneously, e.g., -a lon,-lat,time,-lev.

       Users may specify any permutation of dimensions, including permutations which change the record dimension identity.  The record dimension is re-ordered like any other dimension.  The record  dimension
       is always the most slowly varying dimension in a record variable.  The specified re-ordering will fail if it requires creating more than one record dimension amongst all the output variables.
