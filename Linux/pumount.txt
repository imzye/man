pumount(1)                  General Commands Manual                 pumount(1)

NAME
       pumount - umount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal user

SYNOPSIS
       pumount [ options ] device

DESCRIPTION
       pumount  is  a wrapper around the standard umount program which permits
       normal users to umount removable devices without a matching  /etc/fstab
       entry.

       pumount  also  supports  encrypted  devices which use dm-crypt and have
       LUKS metadata. If a LUKS-capable cryptsetup is installed, pumount  will
       umount  the  mapped  device  instead  and  call cryptsetup to close the
       decrypted device afterwards.

       pumount expects the device as  its  only  argument.  This  will  umount
       device from a directory below /media if policy is met (see below).

       Please  note  that,  as  with  pmount,  you can use labels and uuids as
       described in fstab (5) for devices  present  in  /etc/fstab.   In  this
       case,  the device name need to match exactly the corresponding entry in
       /etc/fstab, including the LABEL= or UUID= part.

OPTIONS
       -l, --lazy
              Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem  hierar‐
              chy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as
              it is not busy anymore.   (Requires  kernel  2.4.11  or  later.)
              IMPORTANT NOTES This option should not be used unless you really
              know what you are doing, as chances are high that it will result
              in data loss on the removable drive. Please run pumount manually
              and wait until  it  finishes.  In  addition,  pumount  will  not
              luksClose a device which was unmounted lazily.

       --luks-force
              Normally,  pumount  will  not  luksClose  (see  cryptsetup(1)) a
              device pmount  did  not  open.  However,  you  can  bypass  this
              restriction with this flag. You probably will need it if you did
              mess around with the /var/lock/pmount_luks directory.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit successfully.

       -d, --debug
              Enable verbose debug messages.

       --version
              Print the current version number and exit successfully.

POLICY
       The umount will succeed if all of the following conditions are met:

       · device is a block device in /dev/ (it does not need to exist if -l is
         supplied)

       · device  is  not  in  /etc/fstab  (if  it  is, pmount executes  umount
         device as the calling user to handle this transparently)

       · device is mounted according to /etc/mtab and  /proc/mounts  with  the
         calling user's uid

       · mount point is in /media

PUMOUNT AND MISSING DEVICES
       pumount now supports unmounting devices that have gone missing for some
       reason, such as a brutal removal of the device,  or  a  kernel/hardware
       problem. Just specify the mount point as argument for pumount.
