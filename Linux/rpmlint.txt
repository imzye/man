NAME
       rpmlint - check common problems in rpm packages

SYNOPSIS
       rpmlint [OPTION]... [FILE|PACKAGE]...

DESCRIPTION
       rpmlint is a tool for checking common errors in rpm packages.  It can be used to test individual packages and spec files before uploading or to check an entire distribution.  By default all applicable
       checks are processed but specific checks can be performed by using command line parameters.

       FILE can be a rpm package file, a spec file, or a directory.  In case of a directory, it is recursively searched for rpm and spec files to check.  The special value - results in standard  input  being
       read and treated as (single) spec file content.  PACKAGE is the name of an installed package or a glob(7) pattern to match installed packages, unless a file by that name exists.

       -i, --info
              Display explanations for reported messages.

       -I, --explain=messageid
              Display explanations for the specified message identifiers and exit.  This option may be given multiple times.

       -c, --check=check
              Run only the specified check.  This option may be given multiple times to specify multiple checks to run.  check is the name of the Python module (as it would be given to Python's import state‐
              ment) containing the check.

       -a, --all
              Check all installed packages.

       -C, --checkdir=dir
              Insert dir to the front of the list of paths to load checks from, unless it is already in the list.  The default list of check dirs typically contains only /usr/share/rpmlint.   Directories  in
              the check dirs list are also inserted to the front of the list of paths to load Python modules from when the check process begins.

       -h, --help
              Display summary of command line options and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Operate in verbose mode.

       -E, --extractdir=dir
              Base directory for extracted temporary files, default is what Python's tempfile.gettempdir() returns.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -n, --noexception
              Ignore output filters.

       --rawout=file
              Write unfiltered output to file.

       -f, --file=conffile
              Load user configuration from the specified file, default is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rpmlint (~/.config/rpmlint if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is empty or not set).

       -o, --option=value
              Override  a configuration option.  value is a whitespace separated string, first word of which is the option name to set, and the Python eval() return value for the rest is set as the value for
              the option.  Passing only an option name is treated as if None was passed as its value.  See the file "config" shipped with rpmlint for the list of configuration options and their  types.   For
              example:
               -o "NetworkEnabled True"
               -o "Distribution 'My favorite distro'"
               -o "MaxLineLength 80"
               -o "ValidShells ('/bin/sh', '/bin/bash')"

CAVEATS
       All  checks  do  not  apply  to all argument types.  For best check coverage, run rpmlint on all source and binary packages your build produces.  The set of checks rpmlint runs on source packages is a
       superset of the one for plain specfiles, the set of checks run for installed binary packages is a superset of the one for uninstalled binary package files, and the source and binary package check sets
       are quite different.

FILES
       /usr/share/rpmlint/config, /usr/share/rpmlint/config.*
              Built-in configuration.  When invoked as someprefix-rpmlint, /usr/share/rpmlint/config.someprefix is used if it exists, otherwise /usr/share/rpmlint/config.

       /etc/rpmlint/*config
              System wide configuration.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rpmlint or ~/.config/rpmlint
              User configuration.

EXIT CODES
       0      No errors.

       1      Unspecified error.

       2      Interrupted.

       64     One or more error message printed.

       66     Badness threshold exceeded.
