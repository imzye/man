NAME
       Log::Dispatch::Array - log events to an array (reference)

VERSION
       version 1.005

SYNOPSIS
         use Log::Dispatch;
         use Log::Dispatch::Array;

         my $log = Log::Dispatch->new;

         my $target = [];

         $log->add(Log::Dispatch::Array->new(
           name      => 'text_table',
           min_level => 'debug',
           array     => $target,
         ));

         $log->warn($_) for @events;

         # now $target refers to an array of events

DESCRIPTION
       This provides a Log::Dispatch log output system that appends logged events to an array reference.  This is probably only useful for testing the logging of your code.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

METHODS
   new
        my $table_log = Log::Dispatch::Array->new(\%arg);

       This method constructs a new Log::Dispatch::Array output object.  Valid arguments are:

         array - a reference to an array to append to; defaults to an attr on
                 $table_log

   array
       This method returns a reference to the array to which logging is being performed.

   log_message
       This is the method which performs the actual logging, as detailed by Log::Dispatch::Output.
