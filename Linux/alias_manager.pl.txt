NAME
       alias_manager, alias_manager.pl - Manage Sympa aliases (Obsoleted)

OBSOLETED
       alias_manager.pl was obsoleted as of Sympa 6.2.24, and will be removed in the future.  To manage aliases based on template, setting ""alias_manager Template"" in sympa.conf or robot.conf is
       recommended.

SYNOPSIS
       "alias_manager.pl" "add" listname domain [ file ]

       "alias_manager.pl" "del" listname domain [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Alias_manager is a program that helps in installing aliases for newly created lists and deleting aliases for closed lists.

       Alias management is performed only if it was setup in /etc/sympa/sympa.conf ("sendmail_aliases" configuration parameter).

       Administrators using MTA functionalities to manage aliases (i.e.  virtual_regexp and transport_regexp with postfix) can disable alias management by setting "sendmail_aliases" configuration parameter
       to "none".

OPTIONS
       "add" listname domain [ file ]
           Add the set of aliases for the mailing list listname in the domain domain.

       "del" listname domain [ file ]
           Remove the set of aliases for the mailing list listname in the domain domain.

FILES
       $SENDMAIL_ALIASES sendmail aliases file.
