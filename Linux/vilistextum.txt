NAME
       vilistextum - html to ascii converter

SYNOPSIS
       vilistextum [OPTIONS] [inputfile |-] [outputfile | -]

DESCRIPTION
       vilistextum is a html to ascii converter specifically programmed to get the best out of incorrect html.

OPTIONS
       inputfile,- resp. outputfile,-
              replace inputfile with '-' for reading from standard input, likewise outputfile with '-' for writing to standard output.

       -a, --no-alt
              don't output anything for IMG tags even if they have an ALT attribute. Implies --no-image.

       -c, --convert-tags
              some tags will be converted to special characters.

       -e, --errorlevel NUMBER
              increase level of verbosity for error messages (0: No error messages).

       -i, --defimage STRING
              IMG tags without alt attribute are output as [STRING].

       -l, --links
              numbers the links in the document and creates footnotes of each link at the end of the file.

       -k, --links-inline
              print the links directly after the html tag.

       -m, --dont-convert-characters
              don't convert the entities from windows1252 (&#128;-&#159; and their proper entity names)

       -n, --no-image
              don't output [Image] for IMG tags that have no ALT attribute.

       -p, --palm
              output text more suitable for reading on a PDA.

       -r, --remove-empty-alt
              if there is an empty ALT attribute in a IMG tag (eg <IMG href="..." alt="">), don't output '[]'.

       -s, --shrink-lines [NUMBER]
              if there are more than NUMBER empty lines, output only NUMBER. Default: 1.

       -t, --no-title
              don't output title.

       -w, --width NUMBER
              maximum line width.

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              output version information and exit

MULTIBYTE OPTIONS (Only available if compiled with multibyte support)
       -u, --output-utf-8
              instead of the character set of the html document, everything will be output as utf-8.

       -x, --translit
              use the //TRANSLIT feature of libiconv. Consult the iconv manual for details.

       -y, --charset CHARSET
              if the HTML document doesn't provide a character set in the meta tags, use CHARSET.

LIMITATIONS
       The rendering of tables is not very good.

       The handling of OL is incomplete. The program treats it as UL and more than 10 nested lists confuse it.

       Text is never justified.
