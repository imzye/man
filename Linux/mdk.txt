NAME
       mixasm — the MIX virtual machine assembler

SYNOPSIS
       mixasm [-n | --ndebug] [-l | --list list-file] [-o | --output output-file] MIX_FILE
       mixasm [-h | --help] [-u | --usage] [-v | --version]

DESCRIPTION
       The  mixasm utility is an assembler for the MIX virtual machine.  The MIX is Donald Knuth's mythical computer, described in the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming, which is programmed
       using MIXAL, the MIX assembly language.

ENVIRONMENT
       The operation of the mixasm utility is not affected by its environment.

EXIT STATUS
       The mixasm utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       Compile a MIX assembly language file:

             mixasm primes.mixal

       Load a MIXAL program and run it in the MIX virtual machine:

             mixvm -r hello.mix
