NAME
       moglistkeys -- Lists keys out of a MogileFS domain

SYNOPSIS
           $ moglistkeys --trackers=host --domain=foo --key_prefix="/foo/bar/"

DESCRIPTION
       If you store your MogileFS keys in a logical "structure", you may use this tool to view lists of subsets of keys. Note that this is not going to be equivalent to "cd" and "ls" tools, as listing "foo/"
       will list everything underneath, so it's more akin to "ls -R"

OPTIONS
       --trackers=host1:7001,host2:7001
           Use these MogileFS trackers to negotiate with.

       --domain=<domain>
           Set the MogileFS domain to use.

       --key_prefix="/foo/bar/"
           Search for keys starting with this prefix. Can be an arbitrary string.
