Daemon::Generic::While1(3pm)                                                        User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                        Daemon::Generic::While1(3pm)

NAME
        Daemon::Generic::While1 - Daemon framework with default while(1) loop

SYNOPSIS
        @ISA = qw(Daemon::Generic::While1);

        sub gd_run_body {
               # stuff
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a slight variation on Daemon::Generic: a default "gd_run()" provided.  It has a while(1) loop that calls "gd_run_body()" over and over.  It checks for reconifg and and terminate events and
       only actions them between calls to "gd_run_body()".

       Terminate events will be forced through after $Daemon::Generic::force_quit_delay seconds if "gd_run_body()" doesn't return quickly enough.

SUBCLASS METHODS REQUIRD
       The following method is required to be overridden to subclass Daemon::Generic::While1:

       gd_run_body()  This method will be called over and over.  This method should include a call to sleep(1) (or a bit more).  Reconfig events will not interrupt it.  Quit events will only interrupt it
                      after 15 seconds.

ADDITIONAL METHODS
       The following additional methods are available for your use (as compared to Daemon::Generic):

       gd_sleep($period)
                      This will sleep for $period seconds but in one-second intervals so that if a SIGINT or SIGHUP arrives the sleep period can end more quickly.

                      Using this makes it safe for "gd_run_body()" to sleep for longer than $Daemon::Generic::force_quit_delay seconds at a time.

ADDITIONAL MEMBER DATA
       The following additional bits of member data are defined:

       gd_sigint      The time at which an (unprocessed) SIGINT was received.

       gd_sighup      The time at which an (unprocessed) SIGHUP was received.
