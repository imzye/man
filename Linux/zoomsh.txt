NAME
       zoomsh - ZOOM shell

SYNOPSIS
       zoomsh [-a apdufile] [-e] [-v loglevel] [commands...]

DESCRIPTION
       zoomsh is a ZOOM client with a simple command line interface. The client demonstrates the ZOOM API and is useful for testing targets.

       You may pass one or more commands to zoomsh. These commands are invoked first.

OPTIONS
       -a apdufile
           Logs protocol packages into apdufile (APDU log).

       -e
           Makes zoomsh stop processing commands as soon as an error occur. The exit code of zoomsh is 1 if error occurs; 0 otherwise.

       -v loglevel
           Sets YAZ log level to loglevel.

EXAMPLES
       If you start the yaz-ztest in one console you can use the ZOOM shell as follows:

           $ zoomsh
           ZOOM>connect localhost:9999
           ZOOM>search computer
           localhost:9999: 7 hits
           ZOOM>show 0 1
           1 Default USmarc
           001    11224466
           003 DLC
           005 00000000000000.0
           008 910710c19910701nju           00010 eng
           010    $a    11224466
           040    $a DLC $c DLC
           050 00 $a 123-xyz
           100 10 $a Jack Collins
           245 10 $a How to program a computer
           260 1  $a Penguin
           263    $a 8710
           300    $a p. cm.
           ZOOM>quit

       You can also achieve the same result by passing the commands as arguments on a single command line:

       $ zoomsh "connect localhost:9999" "search computer""show 0 1" quit

           Connects to the target given by zurl.

           Closes connection to target given by zurl or all targets if zurl was omitted.

       show [start [count]]
           Displays count records starting at offset given by start. First records has offset 0 (unlike the Z39.50 protocol).

       quit
