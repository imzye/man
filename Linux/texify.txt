NAME
       texify - format code for use with LaTeX

SYNOPSIS
       texify<input-type> [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       texify  translates  source code written in any of several different languages to latex(1) source files.  The purpose is to make source code embedded in documents more readable, by providing syntax
       highliting.

OPTIONS
       -i FILE
              Read from FILE instead of standard input.

       -o FILE
              Write to FILE instead of standard output.

       -l LENGTH
              Limit line length to LENGTH.

       -t LENGTH
              Make a tab correspond to LENGTH spaces. Default is 6.

       -num INTERVAL
              Prefix output lines with the corresponding line number from the input, skipping INTERVAL lines between each time a prefix is added.  An interval of 1 will ensure that  every  line  is  pre‐
              fixed.

       -numsize \texsize
              Replace the TeX code used to set the size of the line numbers.  The default is \footnotesize.

       This manual page was written for the Debian operating system because the original program does not have a manual page.

EXAMPLES
       Say you want to format a Java source file.  Just type:
              texifyjava < input.java > output.tex

       You can also format the output of some program without storing its output in a temporary file.  If you want to format the output of a PostgreSQL database dump, just type:
              pg_dump foobar | texifysql > output.tex
