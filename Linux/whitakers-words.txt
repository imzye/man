NAME
       whitakers-words - latin parser and translator

SYNOPSIS
       whitakers-words ...

DESCRIPTION
       whitakers-words is designed to manipulate latin words, in any form they might be seen in a text. It will spot prefixes, U/V switches, suffixes, and many
       other possible mustations.

       To use whitakers-words, simply call the executable. An onscreen help will appear describing the basic program usage. Enter in the Latin word(s) you wish to
       translate, and words will output an analysis for each of them.

OUTPUT
       The table shows the breakdown of the word into it’s parts, the type of word (eg, V for Verb, PRON for Pronoun), and its conjugation or declension. It then
       displays the case (for verbs, this is the tense, voice, and mood). It then shows the person (ie, Singluar, or Plural), and the gender (eg, Masculine).
       Underneath that, information on the stem is shown, and beneath that, possible translations.

       If the word is ambiguous in Whitaker’s processing, each possible breakdown will be shown. The ones that share a stem will be listed together, with one set of
       translations. The ones that involve different stems will be shown in new sections.

       Multiple words entered on one line are separated and processed in order. If whitakers-words notices a prefix or a suffix, it will treat it as a separate
       word.

       To read more about whitakers-words, see the Readme installed at /usr/share/doc/whitakers-words/Readme.md, or the help displayed at program start.

       Whitaker’s word is an old program, and the best documentation for its behavior is its' ADA source.
