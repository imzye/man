NAME
       miniunzip - uncompress and examine ZIP archives

SYNOPSIS
       miniunzip [-exvlo] zipfile [ files_to_extract ] [-d tempdir]

DESCRIPTION
       minizip  is  a simple tool which allows the extraction of compressed file archives in the ZIP format used by the MS-DOS utility PKZIP.  It was written as a demonstration of the zlib(3) library and
       therefore lack many of the features of the unzip(1) program.

OPTIONS
       A number of options are supported.  With the exception of -d tempdir these must be supplied before any other arguments and are:

       -l , --v
              List the files in the archive without extracting them.

       -o     Overwrite files without prompting for confirmation.

       -x     Extract files (default).

       The zipfile argument is the name of the archive to process. The next argument can be used to specify a single file to extract from the archive.

       Lastly, the following option can be specified at the end of the command-line:

       -d tempdir
              Extract the archive in the directory tempdir rather than the current directory.

SEE ALSO
       minizip(1), zlib(3), unzip(1).
