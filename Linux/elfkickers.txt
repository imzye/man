NAME
       elftoc - translate an ELF file into a C struct

SYNOPSIS
       elftoc [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       elftoc  takes  as input an ELF file, and translates its content into a C source file describing a struct with an initialized value that matches the ELF file's memory image. Where possible, literal
       values are replaced with preprocessor symbols and sizeof-based calculations.

OPTIONS
       -e, --force-end
              Force inclusion of a final _end field in the C struct. By default, an _end field is only included if the padding causes the struct to be larger than the original ELF file. With this option,
              a struct with no extra padding will provide an _end field defined as a zero-length array.

       -E, --exclude-end
              Do not include a final _end field, even if padding is present at the end of the C struct.

       -w, --width=N
              Set the maximum line width in the output to N.  The default maximum line width is 80.

       -i, --indent=N
              Set the number of spaces to indent to N.  The default indentation amount is 2.

       -s, --structname=NAME
              Set the name of the C struct in the generated source code to NAME.  By default the struct's name is "elf".

       -v, --varname=NAME
              Set the name of the variable in the generated source code to NAME.  By default the variable's name is "foo".

       -m, --allow-misaligned
              A misaligned section in the ELF file would cause padding bytes to be inserted in the C struct. To avoid this, elftoc represents misaligned sections as uninterpreted byte arrays,  regardless
              of their original type. This option suppresses this behavior, so that misaligned sections retain their actual type, even when this creates an incorrect image in the C struct.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress warning messages regarding invalid and contradictory values in the ELF file.

       -o, --output=FILENAME
              Write the C source code to FILENAME instead of to standard output.

       --help Display help and exit.

       --version
              Display version information and exit.
