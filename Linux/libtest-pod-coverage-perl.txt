Test::Pod::Coverage(3pm)                                                            User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                            Test::Pod::Coverage(3pm)

NAME
       Test::Pod::Coverage - Check for pod coverage in your distribution.

VERSION
       Version 1.10

SYNOPSIS
       In one of your dist's test files (eg "t/pod-coverage.t"):

           use Test::Pod::Coverage tests=>1;
           pod_coverage_ok( "Foo::Bar", "Foo::Bar is covered" );

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Pod::Coverage is used to create a test for your distribution, to ensure that all relevant files in your distribution are appropriately documented in pod.

       Can also be called with Pod::Coverage parms.

           use Test::Pod::Coverage tests=>1;
           pod_coverage_ok(
               "Foo::Bar",
               { also_private => [ qr/^[A-Z_]+$/ ], },
               "Foo::Bar, with all-caps functions as privates",
           );

       The Pod::Coverage parms are also useful for subclasses that don't re-document the parent class's methods.  Here's an example from Mail::SRS.

           pod_coverage_ok( "Mail::SRS" ); # No exceptions

           # Define the three overridden methods.
           my $trustme = { trustme => [qr/^(new|parse|compile)$/] };
           pod_coverage_ok( "Mail::SRS::DB", $trustme );
           pod_coverage_ok( "Mail::SRS::Guarded", $trustme );
           pod_coverage_ok( "Mail::SRS::Reversable", $trustme );
           pod_coverage_ok( "Mail::SRS::Shortcut", $trustme );

       Alternately, you could use Pod::Coverage::CountParents, which always allows a subclass to reimplement its parents' methods without redocumenting them.  For example:

           my $trustparents = { coverage_class => 'Pod::Coverage::CountParents' };
           pod_coverage_ok( "IO::Handle::Frayed", $trustparents );

       (The "coverage_class" parameter is not passed to the coverage class with other parameters.)

       If you want POD coverage for your module, but don't want to make Test::Pod::Coverage a prerequisite for installing, create the following as your t/pod-coverage.t file:

           use Test::More;
           eval "use Test::Pod::Coverage";
           plan skip_all => "Test::Pod::Coverage required for testing pod coverage" if $@;

           plan tests => 1;
           pod_coverage_ok( "Pod::Master::Html");

       Finally, Module authors can include the following in a t/pod-coverage.t file and have "Test::Pod::Coverage" automatically find and check all modules in the module distribution:

           use Test::More;
           eval "use Test::Pod::Coverage 1.00";
           plan skip_all => "Test::Pod::Coverage 1.00 required for testing POD coverage" if $@;
           all_pod_coverage_ok();

FUNCTIONS
       All functions listed below are exported to the calling namespace.

   all_pod_coverage_ok( [$parms, ] $msg )
       Checks that the POD code in all modules in the distro have proper POD coverage.

       If the $parms hashref if passed in, they're passed into the "Pod::Coverage" object that the function uses.  Check the Pod::Coverage manual for what those can be.

       The exception is the "coverage_class" parameter, which specifies a class to use for coverage testing.  It defaults to "Pod::Coverage".

   pod_coverage_ok( $module, [$parms, ] $msg )
       Checks that the POD code in $module has proper POD coverage.

       If the $parms hashref if passed in, they're passed into the "Pod::Coverage" object that the function uses.  Check the Pod::Coverage manual for what those can be.

       The exception is the "coverage_class" parameter, which specifies a class to use for coverage testing.  It defaults to "Pod::Coverage".

   all_modules( [@dirs] )
       Returns a list of all modules in $dir and in directories below. If no directories are passed, it defaults to blib if blib exists, or lib if not.

       Note that the modules are as "Foo::Bar", not "Foo/Bar.pm".

       The order of the files returned is machine-dependent.  If you want them sorted, you'll have to sort them yourself.
