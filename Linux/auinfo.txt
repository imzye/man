NAME
       auinfo - show information about a Network Audio System server

SYNOPSIS
       auinfo [-audio servername]

DESCRIPTION
       The auinfo program provides information describing a Network Audio System server.  It lists the capabilities of the server, the devices that are attached to it, the data formats that are accepted, and
       any predefined sounds that have been stored in the server.

EXAMPLE
       The following example shows the output produced by auinfo when connected to an NCD MCX(tm) display station:
