NAME
       odflint - Check ODF file for problems

SYNOPSIS
       odflint path

DESCRIPTION
       odflint is a program that will check an ODF file and give warning if it finds something suspect. It is not able to make a full validation due to the complexity of the schema.

       “Path” is assumed to be an OpenDocument file of text, spreadsheet or presentation type.

EXAMPLE
           odflint odf-file

BUGS
       Validates all versions of ODF as if they are version 1.1. You´ll therefore get some false positives if you check files that aren´t generated by odfpy scripts.
