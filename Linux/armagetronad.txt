NAME
       armagetronad - a 3D Tron-like high speed game

SYNOPSIS
       armagetronad [-h, --help] [-v, --version] [--doc] [-f, --fullscreen] [-w, --window, --windowed] [--fastforward] [--benchmark] [--record] [--playback]

DESCRIPTION
       The rules are simple: you ride a lightcycle (a kind of motorbike that can only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be stopped). Avoid running into a wall. Make your opponent
       run into a wall.  This idea comes from the 1982 Disney movie "Tron".

       One  thing  is  different  than in other Tron clones: you can accelerate.  However, there is a catch. The only way to accelerate is to drive close to player walls. This allows for some interesting
       tactics. Every time you make a turn, you lose 5% of your speed -- so don't be too nervous, speed is your only resource against other players!

       First thing you shold do is go into the "Player Menu" to set your name and your keyboard and mouse configuration. Then, go into the "Game Menu" and start a single player game against one AI  oppo‐
       nent (the game mode does not really matter here). Then, get some friends together and try the multiplayer modes!

       SHIFT-ESC is the "boss key" and quits Armagetron as fast as possible.
