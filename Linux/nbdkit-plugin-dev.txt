NAME
       nbdkit-example1-plugin - minimal nbdkit plugin

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit example1

DESCRIPTION
       "nbdkit-example1-plugin" is a minimal nbdkit(1) plugin.

       It serves, readonly, from memory, a static blob of data which looks a little bit like a 100 MB disk image that contains a single empty partition.

       Mainly this is useful for testing nbdkit and as an example for writing nbdkit plugins (nbdkit-plugin(3)).

FILES
       $plugindir/nbdkit-example1-plugin.so
           The plugin.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $plugindir.

VERSION
       "nbdkit-example1-plugin" first appeared in nbdkit 1.0.
