NAME
       HTML::Template::Pro - Perl/XS module to use HTML Templates from CGI scripts

SYNOPSIS
       It is moved out and split.

       See "SYNOPSIS" in HTML::Template::SYNTAX for introduction to HTML::Template and syntax of template files.

       See "SYNOPSIS" in HTML::Template::PerlInterface for perl interface of HTML::Template, HTML::Template::Expr and HTML::Template::Pro.

DESCRIPTION
       Original HTML::Template is written by Sam Tregar, sam@tregar.com with contributions of many people mentioned there.  Their efforts caused HTML::Template to be mature html tempate engine which
       separate perl code and html design.  Yet powerful, HTML::Template is slow, especially if mod_perl isn't available or in case of disk usage and memory limitations.

       HTML::Template::Pro is a fast lightweight C/Perl+XS reimplementation of HTML::Template (as of 2.9) and HTML::Template::Expr (as of 0.0.7).  It is not intended to be a complete replacement, but to
       be a fast implementation of HTML::Template if you don't need querying, the extended facility of HTML::Template.  Designed for heavy upload, resource limitations, abcence of mod_perl.

       HTML::Template::Pro has complete support of filters and HTML::Template::Expr's tag EXPR="<expression>", including user-defined functions and construction <TMPL_INCLUDE EXPR="...">.

       HTML::Template work cycle uses 2 steps. First, it loads and parse template.  Then it accepts param() calls until you call output().  output() is its second phase where it produces a page from the
       parsed tree of template, obtained in the 1st step.

       HTML::Template::Pro loads, parse and outputs template on fly, when you call $tmpl->output(), in one pass. The corresponding code is written in C and glued to Perl using Perl+XS. As a result,
       comparing to HTML::Template in ordinary calls, it runs 10-25 times faster. Comparing to HTML::Template with all caching enabled under mod_perl, it still 1-3 times faster. At that HTML::Template
       caching requires considerable amount of memory (per process, shareable, or on disk) to be permanently filled with parsed trees, whereas HTML::Template::Pro don't consumes memory for caches and use
       mmap() for reading templates on disk.

       Introduction to HTML::Template and syntax of template files is described in HTML::Template::SYNTAX.  Perl interface of HTML::Template and HTML::Template::Pro is described in
       HTML::Template::PerlInterface.
