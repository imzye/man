NAME
       tpm_restrictsrk - restrict the ability to access the Storage Root Key

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_restrictsrk [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm_restrictsrk reports the status of who can access the Storage Root Key.  This is the default behavior and also available with the --status option.  This operation will be in effect until the owner
       is cleared and prompts for the owner passord.  With the --restrict option, the ability to access the Storage Root Key is resticted to the owner.  The command prompts for the owner password to complete
       the operation.  The --allow and --restrict options are mutually exclusive and the last one on the command line will be carried out.

       -s, --status
