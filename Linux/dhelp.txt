NAME
       dhelp_parse - Debian online help parser

SYNOPSIS
       dhelp_parse [ -r | -i | -a doc-base_file | -d doc-base_file ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is used by package developers to register the documents included in a package.

       In most cases it is called by install-docs (see doc-base package), which in turn is called from the postinst and prerm scripts of a Debian package.

       An index of the registered documents is written in the directory /usr/share/doc/HTML

OPTIONS
       -h,--help
              Displays the help page.

       -a     Adds the documentation found in the given doc-base files to the dhelp database.

       -d     Deletes the documentation found in the given doc-base files from the dhelp database.

       -i     Does an incremental update of the documents index for all documentation added with the -a switch after the last index update.

       -r     Ignored, kept for compatibility.

PACKAGE DEVELOPERS
       You should usually rely on install-docs to do the work for you, but if for some reason you want to use dhelp_parse directly (not recommended!), you have to call it like this:

   postinst
       if [ -x /usr/sbin/dhelp_parse ]; then
         dhelp_parse -a /var/lib/doc-base/documents/foo
       fi

   prerm
       if [ -x /usr/sbin/dhelp_parse ]; then
         dhelp_parse -d /var/lib/doc-base/documents/foo
       fi

       Note that /var/lib/doc-base/documents/foo has to be a valid doc-base file (see doc-base documentation).
