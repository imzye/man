DESCRIPTION
       This script uses Bio::SeqFeature::Tools::Unflattener and Bio::Tools::GFF to convert GenBank flatfiles to GFF3 with gene containment hierarchies mapped for optimal display in gbrowse.

       The input files are assumed to be gzipped GenBank flatfiles for refseq contigs.  The files may contain multiple GenBank records.  Either a single file or an entire directory can be processed.  By
       default, the DNA sequence is embedded in the GFF but it can be saved into separate fasta file with the --split(-y) option.

       If an input file contains multiple records, the default behaviour is to dump all GFF and sequence to a file of the same name (with .gff appended).  Using the 'nolump' option will create a separate
       file for each genbank record.  Using the 'split' option will create separate GFF and Fasta files for each genbank record.

   Notes
       'split' and 'nolump' produce many files

       In cases where the input files contain many GenBank records (for example, the chromosome files for the mouse genome build), a very large number of output files will be produced if the 'split' or
       'nolump' options are selected.  If you do have lists of files > 6000, use the --long_list option in bp_bulk_load_gff.pl or bp_fast_load_gff.pl to load the gff and/ or fasta files.

       Designed for RefSeq

       This script is designed for RefSeq genomic sequence entries.  It may work for third party annotations but this has not been tested.  But see below, Uniprot/Swissprot works, EMBL and possibly
       EMBL/Ensembl if you don't mind some gene model unflattener errors (dgg).

       G-R-P-E Gene Model

       Don Gilbert worked this over with needs to produce GFF3 suited to loading to GMOD Chado databases.  Most of the changes I believe are suited for general use.  One main chado-specific addition is the
         --[no]cds2protein  flag

       My favorite GFF is to set the above as ON by default (disable with --nocds2prot) For general use it probably should be OFF, enabled with --cds2prot.

       This writes GFF with an alternate, but useful Gene model, instead of the consensus model for GFF3

         [ gene > mRNA> (exon,CDS,UTR) ]

       This alternate is

         gene > mRNA > polypeptide > exon

       means the only feature with dna bases is the exon.  The others specify only location ranges on a genome.  Exon of course is a child of mRNA and protein/peptide.

       The protein/polypeptide feature is an important one, having all the annotations of the GenBank CDS feature, protein ID, translation, GO terms, Dbxrefs to other proteins.

       UTRs, introns, CDS-exons are all inferred from the primary exon bases inside/outside appropriate higher feature ranges.   Other special gene model features remain the same.

       Several other improvements and bugfixes, minor but useful are included

         * IO pipes now work:
           curl ftp://ncbigenomes/... | bp_genbank2gff3 --in stdin --out stdout | gff2chado ...

         * GenBank main record fields are added to source feature, e.g. organism, date,
           and the sourcetype, commonly chromosome for  genomes, is used.

         * Gene Model handling for ncRNA, pseudogenes are added.

         * GFF header is cleaner, more informative.
           --GFF_VERSION flag allows choice of v2 as well as default v3

         * GFF ##FASTA inclusion is improved, and
           CDS translation sequence is moved to FASTA records.

         * FT -> GFF attribute mapping is improved.

         * --format choice of SeqIO input formats (GenBank default).
           Uniprot/Swissprot and EMBL work and produce useful GFF.

         * SeqFeature::Tools::TypeMapper has a few FT -> SOFA additions
             and more flexible usage.

TODO
   Are these additions desired?
        * filter input records by taxon (e.g. keep only organism=xxx or taxa level = classYYY
        * handle Entrezgene, other non-sequence SeqIO structures (really should change
           those parsers to produce consistent annotation tags).
