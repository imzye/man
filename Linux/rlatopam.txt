       files.

SYNOPSIS
       rlatopam

       [rlafile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       rlatopam converts an Alias RLA (run-length encoded type A) or RPF (rich
       pixel  format)  image  to a PAM image file.  The output PAM file can be
       grayscale or RGB, with or without a transparency channel.

       rlafile is the file name of the input file.  If you omit  this  parame‐
       ter, rlatopam reads the image from Standard Input.

       There is no program in Netpbm that converts the other direction.x
