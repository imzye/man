NAME
     unzck — decompress a file in the zchunk format

SYNOPSIS
     unzck [-c | --stdout] [--dict] [-v | --verbose] file
     unzck -? | --help
     unzck --usage
     unzck --version

DESCRIPTION
     The unzck utility extracts the original file from a zchunk-compressed one.

     NOTE: The unzck utility will place the new file without the .zck extension in the current working directory, not in the directory where the original file resides.

     The unzck utility accepts the following optional arguments:

     -c, --stdout
             Extract the data to the standard output stream, do not write it to a file.

     --dict  Only extract the zstd compression dictionary.

     -v, --verbose
             Verbose operation; display some diagnostic output.

     -?, --help
             Display program usage information and exit.

     --usage
             Display brief program usage information and exit.

     --version
             Display program version information and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     The unzck utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Create (in the current directory) an uncompressed words file from a compressed one:

           unzck /mnt/xfer/words.zck

     Do not create the words file, but send the contents to the standard output stream:

           unzck -c /mnt/xfer/words.zck
