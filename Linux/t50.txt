NAME
       T50 - network packet injector

SYNOPSIS
       t50 [options] [--] host[/CIDR]

DESCRIPTION
       Experimental mixed packet injector tool.

       This is NOT a DoS tool, but a tool to inject packets using various protocols.

OPTIONS
       host[/CIDR]
              The  host address is the target of T50. It can be informed in one of two formats: IP address or URI name. This address can be informed as a range of IPs (by omitting one or mode octects) or
              using a CIDR separating the IP (full or partial) or URI with "/##", for instance: "192.168/16" or "host.com.local/22". When using a partial IP address T50 will calculate CIDR  automatically
              (8, 16 or 24 bits, if the first, second or third octect [from right to left] are omitted, respectively).

              Notice that, sometimes, the "host[/CIDR]" argument is misinterpreted as an option. When this happens, you can use the pseudo option '--' before the host address:

              # t50 --flood -- 192.168.1.32/27

              Also, to avoid this error you can provide the host address as the first argument.

              Notice, also, ONLY IPv4 addresses are allowed. T50 don't provide IPv6 support yet.

       --threshold NUM
              Number of packets to inject (default 1000).

       --flood
              Keep injecting packets until user terminates the process (^C). Cannot be used with --threshold.

       -B, --bogus-csum
              Use a bogus "random " checksum instead of calculating the actual packet checksum.

       --turbo
              Inject packets faster (creates a child process).

       --shuffle
              When used with T50 "protocol", it will shuffle the available protocols. Otherwise they will be sent in the same order as listed with --list-protocols option.  This option will not work with
              any other "protocol".

       -s, --saddr ADDR
              IP header source address (default RANDOM).

       -p, --protocol protoname
              Select  an  specific  protocol to use (default: TCP. Use --list-protocols to see all protocols available). Use T50 if you want to inject all available protocols.  The "protocolname" is case
              insensitive.

       -h, --help
              Display all available options and their defaults.

       -v, --version
              Display t50 version.

       -l, --list-protocols
              Lists all available protocols T50 can provide.

EXAMPLES
       See all available protocols:

              [INFO]  List of supported protocols (--protocol):
                 1 - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
                 2 - IGMPv1 (Internet Group Message Protocol v1)
                 3 - IGMPv3 (Internet Group Message Protocol v3)
                 4 - TCP  (Transmission Control Protocol)
                 5 - EGP  (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
                 6 - UDP  (User Datagram Protocol)
                 7 - RIPv1  (Routing Internet Protocol v1)
                 8 - RIPv2  (Routing Internet Protocol v2)
                 9 - DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol)
                 10 - RSVP  (Resource Reservation Protocol)
                 11 - IPSEC (Internet Security Protocl (AH/ESP))
                 12 - EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
                 13 - OSPF  (Open Shortest Path First)

       Send 500 packets to a single target:

              # t50 192.168.0.100 --threshold 500

       Flooding targets from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254 (notice the partial IP) with TCP packets:

              # t50 192.168.0 --flood

       Flooding targets from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.255.254 with all protocols T50 can provide in a random order using "Turbo" mode.

              # t50 192.168 --flood -p t50 --shuffle --turbo

NOTES
       Root privilege is mandatory to run t50.

       There are lots of options. Please, use -h or --help to see them and their default values.

BUGS
       As noted before, the "host[/CIDR]" argument sometimes is misinterpreted as an option.  This bug was introduced when the argument parser was changed to support flexible host "names".  Someday  I'll
       correct this (Frederico).
