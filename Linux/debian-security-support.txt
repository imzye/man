CHECK-SUPPORT-STAT(1)                                                                                                                                                                 CHECK-SUPPORT-STAT(1)

NAME
       check-support-status - check installed packages for security support (debian-security-support)

VERSION
       Version 1:13+2025.07.16

SYNOPSIS
       Search for packages whose support is limited, has already ended or will end earlier than the distribution’s end of life:

           check-support-status

       Search for packages with ended support from a custom list, reporting each package only once:

           check-support-status \
               --type ended \
               --status-db /path/to/status-db \
               --list /path/to/security-support-ended

OPTIONS
       --list FILE
           Use the given file as the database of packages whose support ends at a particular date or that is limited by specific conditions. The file format is plain text in columns, separated by one or
           more whitespace characters.

           For --type earlyend:

           •   source package name

           •   last package version that will be supported

           •   the date support will end

           •   the rest (optional): details, and/or a URL for further information.

           For --type ended:

           •   source package name

           •   last package version that is supported

           •   the date support was ended

           •   the rest (optional): details, and/or a URL for further information.

           For --type limited:

           •   source package name

           •   the rest (optional): details, and/or a URL for further information.

           If no "--list" is provided, the script is run for limited and date-defined end of support, using the lists shipped in the package.

           By default, check-support-status evaluates the status of the packages according to the Debian version where it runs upon. This behavior can be modified using the DEBIAN_VERSION environment
           variable, e.g.

               DEBIAN_VERSION=9 check-support-status

       --no-heading
           Skips printing a headline.

       --status-db FILE
           Use the given file to record alerts so each affected package is reported only once.

           Default: No records, any affected package will be reported every time.

       --except PACKAGES
           Do not alert for the given binary packages (comma-separated list).

           Default: Alert for all packages (no exceptions).

       --type TYPE
           One of the following:

           •   "earlyend": Alert for packages whose support will end earlier than the distribution’s.

           •   "ended": Alert for packages where security support has ended.

           •   "limited": Alert for packages where security support is limited.

       --version, --Version, -V
           Show the version number and exit.

BUGS
       Installations with mixed distributions like half-stable, half-testing are not supported.
