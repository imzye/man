NAME
       mk-configure - lightweight replacement for GNU autotools

DESCRIPTION
       mk-configure is a collection of include files for bmake (portable version of NetBSD make) and a number of executables. It is intended to simplify crossplatform development and software building.

       There  are  only a few top-level makefiles: mkc.init.mk, mkc.mk, mkc.configure.mk, mkc.minitest.mk.  Everything else (mkc_imp.*.mk files) is included implicitely. Do not use mkc_imp.*.mk files di‐
       rectly! If you do, I cannot guarantee backward compatibility.  mkc.configure.mk is included automatically by mkc.mk, but can be included explicitely.  mkc.minitest.mk provides  a  trivial  support
       for  regression  tests  and  should be included explicitely.  Usually mk-c makefiles consist of variables assignments and inclusion of mkc.mk in the and.  One can also use mkc.prog.mk, mkc.lib.mk,
       mkc.files.mk, mkc.subdir.mk and mkc.subprj.mk instead of mkc.mk.  The latter activates mkc.lib.mk if variable LIB is set, mkc.prog.mk if variables PROG or PROGS are set, mkc.subprj.mk if  variable
       SUBPRJ is set, mkc.subdir.mk if variable SUBDIR is set, and mkc.files.mk otherwise.

       To  get  system-wide configuration parameters, mkc.init.mk loads "${MAKECONF}" file if it exists.  Otherwise, it loads /etc/mkcmake.conf if it exists.  If neither ${MAKECONF} nor /etc/mkcmake.conf
       exist, it tries to load /etc/mk.conf file.  If "${SRCTOP}/Makefile.common" file exists it is also included by all subprojects.  Unless SRCTOP variable is set, "../Makefile.inc" is also included if
       exists.  These files may define any of the variables described below.  Compiler-specific defaults are also loaded from "~/.mkcmake" or system directories. This compiler-specific defaults  are  de‐
       termined at build time or with the help of mkc_compiler_settings utility.

       Below  in  square brackets the default value for variables are specified.  In triangle brackets -- typical way of use, where I means "Initialized by mk-configure", Iu means "Initialized by mk-con‐
       figure but may be overriden by user", Im means "Initialized by mk-configure but may be set in Makefile", U means "Usually set by user", M means "May be set or changed in project's Makefile" and Mu
       means "May be set in project's Makefile but may be initialized or overriden by user".

   Targets
       Mk-configure provides the following targets:

       all    build everything.

       clean  clean temporary files and directories with the help of ${CLEANFILES_CMD} and ${CLEANDIRS_CMD} commands.

       cleandir
              remove all of the files removed by the target clean, as well as cache files created by mkc.configure.mk.

       installdirs
              create target directories.

       install
              install programs, libraries, files, include files, manual pages etc.  to the target directories with the help of ${INSTALL} program.

       uninstall
              remove installed files with the help of ${UNINSTALL} command.

       configure
              check for MKC_ERR_MSG variable and fails if it set printing an error message

       depend create .depend_${.CURDIR:T} file containing list of dependencies (see mkdep(1)).

       filelist
              output a list of destination files of the project, one per line, e.g.

                /usr/local/bin/hello
                /usr/local/man/man1/hello.1

       obj    if MKOBJDIR is "yes", creates object directories (${.OBJDIR}) according to MAKEOBJDIR and MAKEOBJPREFIX variables. Current umask is used for this.

       mkgen  See mkc_imp.foreign_autotools.mk.

       bin_tar, bin_targz, bin_tarbz2, bin_zip, bin_deb
              build software, install it to a temporary directory (using DESTDIR) and create .tar/.tar.gz/.tar.bz2/.zip/.deb archive containing all installed files.  The  target  bin_deb  expects  debian
              control files in DEBIAN subdirectory, see examples/files for the sample.

       NOTE: Commands associated with targets all, install, clean, cleandir, depend, test, installdirs, uninstall, configure and filelist in Makefile override the standard behaviour.

       NOTE: All targets in this list have pre_*, do_* and post_* counterparts. See ALLTARGETS for details.

   mkc.init.mk
       This file is included by mkc.mk and mkc.configure.mk automatically but can be used by users directly.  mkc.init.mk uses the following variables.

              If set, keep an error message.  <I M> []

       MKC_REQD
              Minimal required version of mk-configure.  If required version is not found, mkcmake fails. This variable should be set before mkc.init.mk is included, directly or indirectly.  <M>

       MKC_VERSION
              Version of mk-configure.  This variable is always set to non-empty value when mkc.*.mk include files are used, so you can use it to initialize mk-c variables in mk.conf. For example:

              /etc/mk.conf:
                 ...
                 .ifdef MKC_VERSION
                 COPTS?=      -O2 -Werror
                 SHRTOUT=    yes
                 .endif # MKC_VERSION

              <I>

       MKCOMPILERSETTINGS
              At  build  time mk-configure detects some compilers capabilities and saves them to system-wide mkc_imp.cc_${CC_TYPE}-${CC_VERSION}.mk (for C compiler) and mkc_imp.cxx_${CXX_TYPE}-${CXX_VER‐
              SION}.mk (for C++ compiler) files. At run time mk-configure loads these files if necessary. If they are absent, that is, if you use compilers unknown to mk-configure, it exits  with  error.
              If  order to fix this, you have to run mkc_compiler_setting(1) utility manually. This utility generates similar files in ${HOME}/.mkcmake directory.  However, if MKCOMPILERSETTINGS variable
              is set to yes, mkc_compiler_setting(1) is run automaticlly and mk-configure loads the generated files.  <Iu> [no]

       MKDEP  mkdep(1) tool.  <Iu>

       MKDIR  mkdir(1) tool.  <Iu> [mkdir]

       MKINSTALL

       MKINSTALLDIRS
              If "yes", install target directories (target installdirs) before installing files (target install).  <Iu> [yes]

       MKOBJDIR
              If "yes", the target "obj" creates object directories, if "auto", object directories are created automatically. Otherwise object directories are not created.  <Iu> [auto]

       NM     List symbols from object files.  <Iu> [nm]

       OBJCOPY
              Copy and translate object files.  <Iu> [objcopy]

       OBJDUMP
              Display information from object files.  <Iu> [objdump]

       OBJTOP Top-level object directory which defaults to ${.OBJDIR} if ${.MAKE.LEVEL} is 0.  <I>

       PREFIX Target directory.  <U> [/usr/local]

       PROJECTNAME
              The name of a project. By default it is set to ${PROG}, ${LIB} or ${.CURDIR:T}.  For a top-level project using either mkc.subdir.mk or mkc.subprj.mk it makes sense to set this variable  ex‐
              plicitely in project's Makefile.  This variable is initialized before including mk.conf, so you can use it to change build options, e.g. during development process.

              /etc/mk.conf:
                 ...
                 .ifdef MKC_VERSION
                 ...
                 .if ${PROJECTNAME} == "foo"
                 SHRTOUT=    yes
                 PROG.gcc=   /usr/bin/gcc
                 CC_TYPE=    gcc
                 COPTS=      -O0 -g
                 .endif
                 .endif # MKC_VERSION

              <Im>

       RANLIB Generate index to archive.  <Iu> [ranlib]

       RM     rm(1) tool.  <Iu> [rm]

              Target directory for administration utilities.  <Iu> [${PREFIX}/sbin]

       SHAREDSTATEDIR
              Target directory for modifiable architecture-independent data files.  <Iu> [${PREFIX}/com]

       SHRTOUT
              If not "no", output messages about compiling, linking and creating libraries are shortened and formatted.  <Iu> [no]

       SIZE   List section sizes and total size.  <Iu> [size]

       SRC_PATHADD
              List of directories added to .PATH.  <Im> []

       SRCTOP Top-level project's directory which defaults to ${.CURDIR} if ${.MAKE.LEVEL} is 0.  If set, "../Makefile.inc" is not included. Also, the following command
                 mkcmake -C subproject target
              will be translated to
                 cd ${SRCTOP}; mkcmake target-subproject <Iu>

       STRIP  Discard symbols from object files.  <Iu> [strip]

       STRIPFLAG
              The flag passed to the install program to cause the binary to be stripped.  <Iu>

       SYSCONFDIR
              Target directory for configuration files.  <Iu> [${PREFIX}/etc]

       TAR    tar archiver.  <Iu> [tar]

       TSORT  Topological sort of a directed graph.  <Iu> [tsort -q]

       UNINSTALL
              Command for removing files used by target "uninstall".  <Iu> [${RM} -f]

       USE_SSP
              If "yes", enables stack protection code, which detects stack overflows and aborts the program. This enhances security but imposes some performance penalty.  <U>

       VARDIR Target directory for modifiable single-machine data files.  <Iu> [${PREFIX}/var]

       WARNERR
              If "yes", force warnings to be reported as errors.  At the moment this is supported for GCC, clang, Intel C/C++ and Sun's C/C++ compilers.  <Iu> [yes if WARNS=4, no otherwise ]

       WARNS  Crank up warning options; the distinct levels are (the higher the more strict):

                  WARNS=0
                  WARNS=1
                  WARNS=2
                  WARNS=3
                  WARNS=4

              At the moment WARNS is supported for GCC and HP-UX C/C++ only.  WARNS=0 means disabling all warnings if such feature is provided by compiler and mk-configure.  <Mu> [0]

       YACC   LALR(1) parser generator.  <Iu> [yacc]

       YFLAGS Options to ${YACC}.  <Iu> []

       YPREFIX
              If defined, add "-p ${YPREFIX}" to YFLAGS.

       ZIP    zip copression tool.  <Iu> [zip]

   mkc.files.mk
       The include file mkc.files.mk handles the FILES variable and is included from mkc.lib.mk and mkc.prog.mk.  List of supported variables:

       CLEANDIRDIRS

       DPLIBDIRS
              See LIBDEPS in section mk.subprj.mk.

       EXPORT_DYNAMIC
              If  "yes", add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table, that is make all symbols visible from dynamic objects at run time (e.g. dlopen-ed objects), otherwise only symbols referenced by some
              object file will be exported.  <M> [no]

       LDADD  Additional objects.  Usually used for libraries.  For example, to link with the compatibility and utility libraries, use:

                  LDADD+=  -lutil -lcompat

              <U>

       LDADD0 The same as LDADD but LDFLAGS0 and LDADD0 are passed to the linker before LDFLAGS and LDADD.  <M>

       LDADD_<project>
              Similar to LDADD but for project ${PROJECTNAME}.

       LDFLAGS
              Additional linker flags. Often used for specifying library directories.

                  LDFLAGS+=  -L/opt/company/software/lib

              <Mu I>

       LDFLAGS0
              The same as LDFLAGS but LDFLAGS0 and LDADD0 are passed to the linker before LDFLAGS and LDADD.  Normally, LDFLAGS0 and LDADD0 should be modified in makefiles and should not be set from  en‐
              vironment by user.  <M>

       LDFLAGS_<project>
              Similar to LDFLAGS but for project ${PROJECTNAME}.

       MKPIE  If "yes", create Position Independent Executable (PIE), otherwise create a regular executable.  <Mu> [no]

       MKSHARE

       SRCS   List of source files to build the program.  If SRCS is not
               defined, it's assumed to be ${PROG}.c.  <M>

       SRCS.<prog>
              List of source files to build the program prog listed in PROGS.  If SRCS.<prog> is not defined, it's assumed to be prog.c.  <M>

       USE_RELRO
              If  "yes",  enables  a  technique  to harden the data sections of an ELF binary/process.  For security reasons it makes sense to set it to YES, it may slow down application startup, though.
              <Iu> [no]

       mkc.prog.mk includes mkc.files.mk and therefore supports all variables supported by it.

       The order of options passed to the C compiler: CPPFLAGS0, CPPFLAGS, CPPFLAGS_<project>, CFLAGS.ssp, CFLAGS.pie, CFLAGS.warns, CFLAGS, CFLAGS_<project>,  CFLAGS.pic  (for  shared  objects),  COPTS,
       COPTS_<project>

       jects), COPTS, COPTS_<project>

   mkc.lib.mk
       The include file mkc.lib.mk has support for building a static and dynanic library or DLL.  mkc.lib.mk uses the following variables:

       DPINCDIRS
              See LIBDEPS in section mk.subprj.mk.

       DPLDADD
              See LIBDEPS in section mk.subprj.mk.

       DPLIBDIRS
              See LIBDEPS in section mk.subprj.mk.

       EXPORT_SYMBOLS
              Only symbols listed in a specified file (one symbol per line) are exported. Empty lines and comments started with # symbol are ignored. This variable has no effect on  some  platforms.   By
              default all symbols are exported.  <M> []

       LDADD LDADD_<project>
              Additional objects. See mkc.prog.mk

       LDFLAGS LDFLAGS_<project>

       LIBMODE
              Library mode.  <Iu> [${NONBINMODE}]

       LIBOWN Library owner. If bmake is run by an unprivileged user, it defaults to `id -u`.  <Iu>

       MAN    The manual pages to be installed (use a .1 - .9 suffix).  <M>

       MKDLL  If "yes", build and install the dynamically loaded library (<lib>.so) instead of shared library. If "only", do not make static library.  <M> [no]

       MKSHLIB
              If not "no", build and install shared library provided that SHLIB_MAJOR is defined.  <IMu> [yes] (for MACHINE_ARCHs that support it)

       MKSTATICLIB
              If not "no", build and install static library.  <IMu> [yes]

       MKPICLIB
              If not "no", build and install *_pic.a library.  <IMu> [no]

       MKPROFILELIB
              If "no", don't build or install the profiling (*_p.a) libraries.  <Iu> [no]

       SHLIBMODE
              Shared library mode.  <Iu>

       SHLIB_MAJOR
              Major shared library number. If unset, shared library is not built.  <M>

              Minor shared library number.  <M> [0]

       SHLIB_TEENY
              Minor shared library number.  <M> []

       SRCS   List of source files to build the library.  Suffix types
               .s, .c, and .f are supported.  Note, .s files are preferred
               to .c files of the same name.  <M>

       Static  libraries are ranlib'd when made.  mkc.lib.mk includes mkc.files.mk and therefore supports all its variables as well.  After creaion of libraries ${.CURDIR:T}.done file is created and used
       for handling inter-project (See LIBDEPS variable) dependencies.

       The order of options passed to the C and C++ compilers are the same as in mkc.prog.mk.

   mkc.subprj.mk
       The include file mkc.subprj.mk handles subprojects (subdirectories) organized as a dependency graph.  It provides all targets provided by mkc.prog.mk.  Variable SUBPRJ contains a list of pairs de‐
       pdir:dir which mean that subproject dir depends on depdir.  mkcmake all command will build all subprojects listed in SUBPRJ in a correct order (starting with subprojects having no dependencies and
       so on).  There is also a target which allows the command bmake <subdir> where <subdir> is any directory listed in the variable SUBPRJ.  The following targets are also  provided:  <target>-<subdir>
       where  <target>  is  either  of  the  following:  all,  clean, cleandir, depend, installdirs, install, uninstall and filelist.  Also provided are: targets nodeps-<target>-<subdir> and subdir-<tar‐
       get>-<subdir>.  Difference between <target>-<subdir> and nodeps-<target>-<subdir> is that mkcmake <target>-<subdir> runs the specified <target> for <subdir> and all its dependencies while  mkcmake
       nodeps-<target>-<subdir> -- only for <subdir>. A target subdir-<target>-<subdir> is a synonym for nodeps-<target>-<subdir> See examples/hello_dictd subdirectory for the sample of use.

       mkc.subprj.mk provides the following variables:

       ALLTARGETS
              A  list of targets for which pre_*, do_* and post_* counterparts exist, for example, pre_all, do_all and post_all. pre_* target runs before do_* target which in turn runs before post_*. Un‐
              less action is provided for do_* targets they implement the standard behaviour of mk-configure.  No action is provided for targets pre_* and post_*, so they are for user's  extensions.  The
              standard behaviour for ${ALLTARGETS} may also be extended by adding new prerequisites to targets do_*.

       COMPATLIB
              Subproject's basename for compatibility library.  If this variable is set, MKC_SOURCE_FUNCLIBS and FEATURES do not change SRCS for subprojects other than ${COMPATLIB}.  <M> []

       EXPORT_VARNAMES
              List of variables to export before running make for subdirectories.  <Mu> [MKC_CACHEDIRSRCTOPOBJTOPSTATICLIBSCOMPATLIB]

       INTERNALLIBS
              A list of subprojects (basenames) with internal libraries.  These libraries are static and not installed by target "install".  <M> []

       LIBDEPS
              A  list of library dependencies. Each token is a colon-separated pair.  Its first component is a library subproject (dependency), the second one is the subproject for library or executable.
              The value of this variable is automatically added to SUBPRJ. Library dependencies listed in LIBDEPS automatically change CPPFLAGS0, LDFLAGS0 and LDADD0 of approptiate subprojects.  <M> Sup‐
              pose, we have <library:program> pair in LIBDEPS, also suppose that variable library is set to "library" subdirectory and variable program is set  to  "program"  subdirectory.   ${SRCDIR_li‐
              brary}/linkme.mk  file  is  automatically  included  from ${SRCDIR_program}/Makefile if it exists. In this file DPLDADD [${library:T:S/^lib//}], DPLIBDIRS [${OBJDIR_${library:S,/,_,g}}] and
              DPINCDIRS [${SRCDIR_${library:S,/,_,g}} ${OBJDIR_${library:S,/,_,g}}], may be set to non-default values. These three variables then changes LDADD0, LDFLAGS0 and  CPPFLAGS0  respectively  in
              subproject "program".  The dependency graph specified by variable LIBDEPS is available to all subproject via environment.

       MKRELOBJDIR
              If "yes", object directories ${OBJTOP}/dir are used. Unlike MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX object directories do not contain top-level ${.CURDIR} in paths.  <Iu> [no]

       NODEPS This variable specifies a list of patterns that describes edges from dependency graph in targdep-prjdep:targ-prj or targ-prj:targ formats to be excluded from dependency graph.  <M> []

       NOEXPORT_VARNAMES
              List of variables excluded from EXPORT_VARNAMES.  <Mu> []

       NOSUBDIR
              If for some reason you want to exclude some subdirectories from build, list them in this variable.  <U> []

       OBJDIR_<dir>
              Value  of  ${.OBJDIR} inside dir subdirectory. Slash symbols inside <dir> are replaced with underlines.  In addition, OBJDIR_<dir:T> variable is set to ${OBJDIR_<dir>} if ${SHORTPRJNAME} is
              "yes".

       SHORTPRJNAME
              If "yes", special targets with last component of the subprojects are provided.  <Im> [yes]

       SRCDIR_<dir>
              Value of ${.CURDIR} inside dir subdirectory. Slash symbols inside <dir> are replaced with underlines.  In addition, SRCDIR_<dir:T> variable is set to ${SRCDIR_<dir>} if  ${SHORTPRJNAME}  is
              "yes".

       STATICLIBS
              A list of subprojects (basenames) with static libraries. If dependency is mentioned in this variable, the suffix _pic is automatically added for PIE-executables or shared libraries that de‐
              pend on this library.  This variable is automatically passed to subprojects via environment.  <Mu> []

       SUBPRJ List  of  subprojects  (subdirectories)  and dependencies. If the subdirectory doesn't exist the subproject becomes "virtual" and may be used to group several subprojects into a new virtual
              one.  <M>

       SUBPRJ_DFLT
              List of projects built and installed by default.  The default is all projects listed in SUBPRJ.  <IMu>

       SUBPRJSRCTOP
              This variables contains ${.CURDIR} directory and is passed to subprojects.  <I> [${.CURDIR}]

       TARGETS
              A list of recursive targets. "Recursive" means that the target will be called for all subproject recursively (See mkc.subprj.mk and mkc.subdir.mk).  <Im> [all, install,  installdirs,  unin‐
              stall,  clean,  cleandir,  depends, test, configure, filelist, obj] By setting this variable in the Makefile one can add new targets for special purposes, for example, static code analysis,
              partial builds etc.

       mkc.subprj.mk provides the following targets:

       <subdir> and <subdir:T>
              <subdir> is a subdirectory listed in SUBDIR or SUBPRJ.  This target is equivalent to all-<subdir>.  <subdir:T> means the last component of the directory and is created if ${SHORTPRJNAME} is
              "yes".

       <target>-<subdir>
              Runs the specified <target> for the specified <subdir>.  The target <target>-<subdir:T> is provided if ${SHORTPRJNAME} is "yes".

       subdir-<target>-<subdir> and nodeps-<target>-<subdir>
              Runs the specified <target> for the specified <subdir> without dependencies.  Targets subdir-<target>-<subdir:T> and nodeps-<target>-<subdir:T> are provided if ${SHORTPRJNAME} is "yes".

       print_deps
              Outputs the dependency graph on targets in tsort(1) format taking NODEPS and NOSUBDIR variables into account.

   mkc.subdir.mk
       The include file mkc.subdir.mk contains the default targets for building subdirectories.  It provides the same targets as mkc.prog.mk.  For all of the directories listed in  the  variable  SUBDIR,
       the specified directory will be visited and the target made.  There is also a default target which allows the command bmake <subdir> where <subdir>
        is  any  directory listed in the variable SUBDIR.  As a special case, the use of a token .WAIT as an entry in SUBDIR acts as a synchronization barrier when multiple make jobs are run; subdirs be‐
       fore the .WAIT must complete before any subdirs after .WAIT are started.  See bmake(1) for some caveats on use of .WAIT and other special sources. SUBDIR variable is provided as well as all  vari‐
       ables provided by mkc.subprj.mk except SUBPRJ.

       SUBDIR List of subdirectories <M> mkc.subprj.mk

   mkc.configure.mk
       mkc.configure.mk  is an auxiliary include file for checking platform's features like headers, function or variable declarations, function implementation in a particular libraries, data types sizes
       etc.  This include file is included by mkc.prog.mk and mkc.lib.mk automatically but in some cases it makes sense to include it  explicitly.   mkc.configure.mk  itself  includes  mkc.init.mk,  then
       mkc.conf.mk , and finally internal include file which updates CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, LDADD and SRCS.  mkc.configure.mk supports the following variables.

       MKCHECKS
              If "no", none of the checks are performed. It is set to "yes" unless target is "clean" and "cleandir".

       MKC_CACHEDIR
              Directory where intermediate and cache files are created.  It defaults to ${.OBJDIR}.  By default MKC_CACHEDIR variable is exported for subprojects.  As a result cache files for subprojects
              are created in the top-level directory.  If cache directory doesn't exist, it is created automatically.

       MKC_CHECK_BUILTINS
              mk-configure  provides  a  number of built-in custom checks, that is, source files to compile or scripts to run in order to check for something.  Checks listed in MKC_CHECK_BUILTINS will be
              run.
              Avalable values:

              prog_flex, prog_bison, prog_gawk, prog_gm4, prog_gmake
                     Find flex, bison, GNU awk, GNU m4 or GNU make respectively by analysing program's help and/or version messages. If found, BUILTIN.prog_<progname> is set to the path, otherwise it  is
                     set to empty string. Note that gawk may be found as awk, bison as yacc, gm4 as m4, flex as lex and gmake as make.

              prog_mkdep, prog_nbmkdep
                     Find traditional BSD mkdep(1) or recent NetBSD version of it respectively.

              endianness
                     BUILTIN.endianness variable is set to either little, big or unknown depending on a hardware.

       MKC_CHECK_CC_OPTS
              A  list of C compiler options to check.  If ${CC} -c support the specified option, variable HAVE_CC_OPT.<option:S/=/_/g> is set to 1 and 0 otherwise.  Double underline in the option is con‐
              sidered as a single space character.

              Ex.
                MKC_CHECK_CC_OPTS = -Wall -errwarn=%all --param__ssp-buffer-size=1
              Res.
               HAVE_CC_OPT.-Wall=1
               HAVE_CC_OPT.-errwarn_%all=0
               HAVE_CC_OPT.--param__ssp-buffer-size_1=1

       MKC_CHECK_CCLD_OPTS
              Same as MKC_CHECK_CC_OPTS except that option "-c" is not passed to the compiler, so, executable is created.  As a result HAVE_CCLD_OPT.<option:S/=/_/g> is set to 1 or 0.

       MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM
              A list of custom checks (list of names).  MKC_CUSTOM_FN.<custom_check_name> is a "C" or "C++" source filename or an executable program for your custom check, e.g., filename.c,  filename.cc,
              subdir/filename.cxx,  filename.C,  filename.cpp or subdir/executable_script.  mk-configure tries to compile or run the specified file and sets CUSTOM.<custom_check_name> variable to 1, 0 or
              other value.  If MKC_CUSTOM_FN.<custom_check_name> is unset, it defaults to custom_check_name.c.  Also -DCUSTOM_<CUSTOM_CHECK_NAME>=1 is added to CPPFLAGS if the specified  check  succeeded
              unless  MKC_NOAUTO  is  set  to  1  and  MKC_CUSTOM_NOAUTO.<custom_check_name>  is  set  to  "yes".  Here <CUSTOM_CHECK_NAME> is uppercase for <custom_check_name>.  If MKC_CUSTOM_LINK.<cus‐
              tom_check_name> is "yes", then C or C++ source file is compiled and linked into executable.  Also,  CPPFLAGS,  CFLAGS,  CXXFLAGS,  LDFLAGS,  LDADD,  MKC_CUSTOM_CPPFLAGS.<custom_check_name>,
              MKC_CUSTOM_CFLAGS.<custom_check_name>,  MKC_CUSTOM_CXXFLAGS.<custom_check_name>, MKC_CUSTOM_LDFLAGS.<custom_check_name> and MKC_CUSTOM_LDADD.<custom_check_name> flags are passed to the com‐
              piler. Normally cache file name contains <custom_check_name> unless MKC_CUSTOM_CACHE.<custom_check_name> is set to something else.

               Ex.  MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM+=               nested_funcs
                    MKC_CUSTOM_FN.nested_funcs=      nested_funcs.c
                    MKC_CUSTOM_FN.script_check=      checks/script_check
               Res. CUSTOM.nested_funcs=        1
                    CUSTOM.script_check=        0
                    CFLAGS+= -DCUSTOM_NESTED_FUNCS=1

              Note that script for the check should be an executable file.

       MKC_CHECK_CXX_OPTS
              Same as MKC_CHECK_CC_OPTS but for C++ compiler.  As a result HAVE_CXX_OPT.<option:S/=/_/g> is set to 1 or 0.

       MKC_CHECK_CXXLD_OPTS
              Same as MKC_CHECK_CCLD_OPTS but for C++ compiler.  As a result HAVE_CXXLD_OPT.<option:S/=/_/g> is set to 1 or 0.

       MKC_CHECK_DEFINES
              List of define:header to check. <header> part is optional.

              As a result of the check bmake's variable HAVE_DEFINE.<define>.<header> (or HAVE_DEFINE.<define>) is set to either 0 or 1.
              <header>: tr|./|__|g
              Also -DHAVE_DEFINE_<DEFINE>_<HEADER>=1 or   -DHAVE_DEFINE_<DEFINE>=1 is added to CPPFLAGS if the specified define was detected unless MKC_NOAUTO is set to 1.
              <HEADER>: tr|a-z./|A-Z__|g
              <DEFINE>: tr|a-z|A-Z|g

               Ex:  MKC_CHECK_DEFINES += RTLD_LAZY:dlfcn.h __GNUC__ _MSC_VER_
               Res: HAVE_DEFINE.RTLD_LAZY.dlfcn_h = 1

       MKC_CHECK_FUNCLIBS
              List of <function>:<library> pairs to check, <library> part is optional. If <library> is present, presense of <function> in libc is also checked automatically.

              As a result of the check bmake's variable HAVE_FUNCLIB.<function>.<library> (or HAVE_FUNCLIB.<function>) is set to either 0 or 1.

              If <function> is found in <library> but not in libc or <function> is "main" and is found in <library>, "-l<library>" is automatically added to LDADD unless <function>:<library> is listed in
              MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS or MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS is equal to 1 or MKC_NOAUTO is set to 1

              Also  -DHAVE_FUNC<N>_<FUNC>_<HEADER>=(0  or  1)  (or    -DHAVE_FUNC<N>_<FUNC>=(0  or  1))  is  added  to  CPPFLAGS  if  the specified function was detected unless MKC_NOAUTO is set to 1. If
              MKC_FUNC_OR_DEFINE.<func> is "yes", equivalent define leads to the same results.
              <HEADER>: tr|a-z./|A-Z__|g

       MKC_CHECK_PROGS
              List  of  <progname>s to check.  As a result of the check bmake's variable HAVE_PROG.<progname> is set to either 1 (true) or 0 (false).  Also PROG.<progname> is set to a full path of a pro‐
              gram or to an empty string.

              If MKC_PROG.id.<progname> is set to, e.g, <prog_id>, then HAVE_PROG.<prog_id> and PROG.<prog_id> are set.  MKC_PROG.id.<progname> also changes cache file names.

       MKC_CHECK_PROTOTYPES
              A list of checks (list of names) for C function prototypes.  MKC_PROTOTYPE_FUNC.<name> is a C function prototype.  MKC_PROTOTYPE_HEADERS.<name> is a list of headers separated  by  space  or
              comma.   mk-configure  verifies that the specified prototype is correct and if so, HAVE_PROTOTYPE.<name> bmake variable is set to 1 and -DHAVE_PROTOTYPE_<NAME>=1 is added to CPPFLAGS unless
              MKC_NOAUTO is set to 1.  Otherwise, HAVE_PROTOTYPE.<name> variable is set to 0.

              As a result of the check bmake's variable SIZEOF.<type>.<header> (or SIZEOF.<type>) is set to the data type size or string "failed".
              <type>: tr|*-|P_|g
              <header>: tr|/.|__|g
              Also -DSIZEOF_<TYPE>_<HEADER>=<failed|1|2|...> (or -DSIZEOF_<TYPE>=<failed|1|2|...>) is added to CPPFLAGS if sizeof() check was successful unless MKC_NOAUTO is set to 1

       MKC_FEATURES
              This is a list of "features" required by project. In general, a feature is something that has problems with portability. This may be a function name or header missing on some platforms, for
              example.  What developer needs to do is to add FEATURENAME to MKC_FEATURES variable and add #include <mkc_FEATURENAME.h> where it is needed. Internally, system requiremets  are  checked  in
              the  automatically  included  mkc_imp.f_FEATURENAME.mk file and all required actions (includes, define checks etc.)  are made in mkc_FEATURENAME.h header file.  Currently the following fea‐
              tures are provided:

              arc4random
                     This feature provides arc4random(3), arc4random_buf(3) and arc4random_uniform(3) functions available in BSDs.  If these functions are absent on your system, install libbsd library.

              bswap  This feature provides bswap16(3), bswap32(3) and bswap64(3) functions available in *BSD.

              dprintf
                     This feature provides dprintf(3).

              efun   This feature provides esetfunc(3), efopen(3), ecalloc(3), emalloc(3), erealloc(3), ereallocarr(3), estrdup(3), estrndup(3), estrlcpy(3), estrlcat(3), easprintf(3), estrtoi(3),  estr‐
                     tou(3) and evasprintf(3) functions from NetBSD.

              err    This feature provides err(3), errx(3), verr(3) and verrx(3) BSD-isms.

              errc   This feature provides errc(3) and verrc(3) BSD-isms.

              fgetln This feature provides fgetln(3) BSD-ism.

              fparseln
                     This feature provides fparseln(3) BSD-ism.

              fts    This  feature  provides  fts_open(3),  fts_read(3)  etc. functions available on BSDs and Linux. If it is absent on your system, you have to install libfts (both headers and library).
                     libfts is a part of musl project.

              getdelim
                     This feature provides getdelim(3) from POSIX.

              getline
                     This feature corresponds to getline(3) function which is a part of POSIX2008 unavailable on some systems. mkc_imp.f_getline.mk checks whether  getline  declaration  is  available  in
                     stdio.h and implementation is available in libc. If not, getline.c provided by mk-configure is added to SRCS and declaration is provided in mkc_getline.h header.

              humanize_number
                     This feature provides humanize_number(3) function from NetBSD.

              libdl  This  feature  checks  whether  libdl library is available and dlopen(3) is declared in dlfcn.h.  If yes, -ldl is added to LDADD. mkc_libdl.h provides declarations for dlopen(3), dl‐
                     sym(3), dlclose(3) etc.

              libl   Adds -ll or -lfl to LDADD depending on which one is available. One can use this feature instead of LIBLEX variable.

              libm   This feature checks whether libm is available and if yes, adds -lm to LDADD.  Most UNIX-like systems have libm but Haiku, for example, does not. mkc_imp.f_libm.mk checks whether libm
                     library is available and if yes, -lm is added to LDADD.

              macro  This feature provides the following macro stolen from NetBSD.  __aligned(x) defined as  __attribute__((aligned(x)))  if  supported  by  compiler,  __always_inline  defined  as  __at‐
                     tribute__((always_inline)) if supported by compiler, __arraycount(a) defined as (sizeof(__a)/sizeof(__a[0])) , __constfunc defined as __attribute__((const)) if supported by compiler,
                     __dead  defined  as __attribute__((noreturn)) if supported by compiler, MIN(a,b) and MAX(a,b), __pure defined as __attribute__((pure)) if supported by compiler, __printflike(n,m) de‐
                     fined as __attribute__((format (printf, n, m))) if supported by compiler.

              posix_getopt
                     It is well-known that glibc getopt(3) does not conform to POSIX by default.  This feature provides POSIX-ly correct getopt.

              progname
                     This feature provides getprogname(3) and setprogname(3) functions available in *BSD.

              pwdgrp This feature provides user_from_uid(3), uid_from_user(3), group_from_gid(3), gid_from_group(3) functions from *BSD.

              raise_default_signal
                     This feature provides function raise_default_signal(3) from NetBSD.

              RB SPLAY
                     BSD systems provide sys/tree.h header where RB_* and SPLAY_* macroses are defined for red-black tree and splay. These features check whether sys/tree.h and appropriate  macroses  are
                     available. If yes, mkc_RB.h and mkc_SPLAY.h include system-wide sys/tree.h, otherwise NetBSD version of sys/tree.h provided by mk-configure is included.

              reallocarr
                     This feature provides reallocarr(3) function from NetBSD.

              reallocarray
                     This feature provides reallocarray(3) function from OpenBSD.

              shquote
                     This feature provides shquote(3) function from NetBSD.

              SLIST SIMPLEQ STAILQ LIST TAILQ CIRCLEQ
                     BSD  systems provide sys/queue.h header where SLIST_* etc. macroses are defined for lists and queues. These features check whether sys/queue.h and appropriate macroses are available.
                     If yes, mkc_SLIST.h and others include system-wide sys/queue.h, otherwise NetBSD version of sys/queue.h provided by mk-configure is included.

              strlcat
                     This feature corresponds to strlcat(3) function available on almost all systems except glibc-based Linux-es. mkc_imp.f_strlcat.mk checks whether strlcat declaration is  available  in
