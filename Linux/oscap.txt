COMMON OPTIONS FOR ALL MODULES
       --verbose VERBOSITY_LEVEL
              Turn  on  verbose  mode  at  specified  verbosity  level.   VER‐
              BOSITY_LEVEL is one of: DEVEL, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.

       --verbose-log-file FILE
              Set filename to write additional information.

INFO OPERATIONS
       [options] any-scap-file.xml
              This  module  prints  information  about  SCAP content in a file
              specified on a command line. It determines  SCAP  content  type,
              specification  version,  date of creation, date of import and so
              on. Info module doesn't require any additional operation switch.

              For XCCDF or SCAP source data  stream  files,  the  info  module
              prints  out  IDs  of incorporated profiles, components, and data
              streams. These IDs can be used to specify the target for evalua‐
              tion.  Use  options  --profile,  --xccdf-id  (or --oval-id), and
              --datastream-id respectively.

              --fetch-remote-resources
                     Allow download of remote components referenced from  data
                     stream.

              --profile PROFILE
                     Show info of the profile with the given ID.

              --profiles
                     Show  profiles  from  the  input file in the <id>:<title>
                     format, one line per profile.

XCCDF OPERATIONS
       eval [options] INPUT_FILE [oval-definitions-files]
              Perform evaluation of XCCDF document file given  as  INPUT_FILE.
              Print  result  of  each  rule to standard output, including rule
              title, rule id and security identifier(CVE, CCE). Optionally you
              can give an SCAP source data stream as the INPUT_FILE instead of
              an XCCDF file (see --datastream-id).

              oscap returns 0 if all rules pass. If there is an  error  during
              evaluation,  the return code is 1. If there is at least one rule
              with either fail or unknown result, oscap finishes  with  return
              code 2.

              Unless  --skip-validation (--skip-valid) is used, the INPUT_FILE
              is validated using XSD schemas (depending on  document  type  of
              INPUT_FILE) and rejected if invalid.

              You  may  specify  OVAL  Definition files as the last parameter,
              XCCDF evaluation will then proceed  only  with  those  specified
              files. Otherwise, when oval-definitions-files parameter is miss‐
              ing, oscap tool will try to load all OVAL Definition files  ref‐
              erenced  from  XCCDF  automatically  (search in the same path as
              XCCDF).

              --profile PROFILE
                     Select a  particular  profile  from  XCCDF  document.  If
                     "(all)"  is  given  a  virtual  profile  that selects all
                     groups and rules will be used.

              --rule RULE
                     Select a particular rule from XCCDF document.  Only  this
                     rule will be evaluated. Rule will use values according to
                     the selected profile. If no profile is selected,  default
                     values are used.

              --tailoring-file TAILORING_FILE
                     Use  given  file for XCCDF tailoring. Select profile from
                     tailoring file to apply using --profile. If  both  --tai‐
                     loring-file  and  --tailoring-id are specified, --tailor‐
                     ing-file takes priority.

              --tailoring-id COMPONENT_REF_ID
                     Use tailoring component in input source data  stream  for
                     XCCDF  tailoring.  The tailoring component must be speci‐
                     fied by its Ref-ID (value of component-ref/@id  attribute
                     in input source data stream). Select profile from tailor‐
                     ing component to apply using --profile. If both --tailor‐
                     ing-file  and  --tailoring-id are specified, --tailoring-
                     file takes priority.

              --cpe CPE_FILE
                     Use given CPE dictionary or language (auto-detected)  for
                     applicability  checks.  (Some  CPE  names are provided by
                     openscap, see oscap --version for inbuilt CPE names)

              --results FILE
                     Write XCCDF results into FILE.

              --results-arf FILE
                     Writes results to a given FILE in Asset Reporting Format.
                     It is recommended to use this option instead of --results
                     when dealing with data streams.

              --stig-viewer FILE
                     Writes XCCDF results into FILE. The rule  result  IDs  in
                     FILE  are modified according to STIG references in evalu‐
                     ated content. The FILE can be simply imported  into  DISA
                     STIG Viewer. See https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/srg-stig-
                     tools/ for information about DISA STIG Viewer.

              --thin-results
                     Thin Results provides only minimal amount of  information
                     in  OVAL/ARF  results.  The  option  --without-syschar is
                     automatically enabled when you use Thin Results.

              --without-syschar
                     Don't provide system characteristics in  OVAL/ARF  result
                     files.

              --report FILE
                     Write HTML report into FILE.

              --oval-results
                     Generate  OVAL Result file for each OVAL session used for
                     evaluation. File  with  name  'original-oval-definitions-
                     filename.result.xml'  will  be  generated for each refer‐
                     enced OVAL file in current working directory.  To  change
                     the  directory  where OVAL files are generated change the
                     CWD using the `cd` command.

              --check-engine-results
                     After evaluation is finished, each  loaded  check  engine
                     plugin  is asked to export its results. The export itself
                     is plugin specific, please refer to documentation of  the
                     plugin for more details.

              --export-variables
                     Generate  OVAL Variables documents which contain external
                     variables' values that were provided to the OVAL checking
                     engine  during evaluation. The filename format is 'origi‐
                     nal-oval-definitions-filename-session-index.variables-
                     variables-index.xml'.

              --datastream-id ID
                     Uses a data stream with that particular ID from the given
                     data stream collection.  If  not  given  the  first  data
                     stream  is  used.  Only  applies  if you give source data
                     stream in place of an XCCDF file.

              --xccdf-id ID
                     Takes component ref with given ID from  checklists.  This
                     allows  to  select  a  particular XCCDF component even in
                     cases where there are 2 XCCDFs in  one  data  stream.  If
                     none  is  given,  the first component from the checklists
                     element is used.

              --benchmark-id ID
                     Selects a component ref from any data stream that  refer‐
                     ences  a component with XCCDF Benchmark such that its @id
                     attribute matches given string exactly. Please note  that
                     this is not the recommended way of selecting a component-
                     ref. You are advised to use  --xccdf-id  AND/OR  --datas‐
                     tream-id  for more precision. --benchmark-id is only used
                     when both --xccdf-id and --datastream-id are not  present
                     on the command line!

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

              --skip-signature-validation
                     Do  not  validate  digital signatures in digitally signed
                     SCAP source data streams.

              --enforce-signature
                     Process only digitally signed SCAP source  data  streams.
                     Data  streams  without  a  signature would be rejected if
                     this switch is used.

              --fetch-remote-resources
                     Allow download of remote  OVAL  content  referenced  from
                     XCCDF by check-content-ref/@href.

              --remediate
                     Execute XCCDF remediation in the process of XCCDF evalua‐
                     tion. This option automatically executes content of XCCDF
                     fix  elements  for  failed  rules, and thus this shall be
                     avoided unless for trusted content. Use of this option is
                     always at your own risk.

       remediate [options] INPUT_FILE [oval-definitions-files]
              This  module provides post-scan remediation. It assumes that the
              INPUT_FILE is result of `oscap xccdf eval` operation. The  input
              file must contain TestResult element. This module executes XCCDF
              fix elements for  failed  rule-result  contained  in  the  given
              TestResult. Use of this option is always at your own risk and it
              shall be avoided unless for trusted content.

              --result-id ID
                     ID of the XCCDF TestResult element which shall  be  reme‐
                     died.  If  this option is missing the last TestResult (in
                     top-down processing) will be remedied.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

              --fetch-remote-resources
                     Allow download of remote  OVAL  content  referenced  from
                     XCCDF by check-content-ref/@href.

              --cpe CPE_FILE
                     Use  given CPE dictionary or language (auto-detected) for
                     applicability checks.

              --results FILE
                     Write XCCDF results into FILE.

              --results-arf FILE
                     Writes results to a given FILE in Asset Reporting Format.
                     It is recommended to use this option instead of --results
                     when dealing with data streams.

              --stig-viewer FILE
                     Writes XCCDF results into FILE. The rule  result  IDs  in
                     FILE  are modified according to STIG references in evalu‐
                     ated content. The FILE can be simply imported  into  DISA
                     STIG Viewer. See https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/srg-stig-
                     tools/ for information about DISA STIG Viewer.

              --report FILE
                     Write HTML report into FILE.

              --oval-results
                     Generate OVAL Result file for each OVAL session used  for
                     evaluation.  File  with  name 'original-oval-definitions-
                     filename.result.xml' will be generated  for  each  refer‐
                     enced OVAL file.

              --check-engine-results
                     After  evaluation  is  finished, each loaded check engine
                     plugin is asked to export its results. The export  itself
                     is  plugin specific, please refer to documentation of the
                     plugin for more details.

              --export-variables
                     Generate OVAL Variables documents which contain  external
                     variables' values that were provided to the OVAL checking
                     engine during evaluation. The filename format is  'origi‐
                     nal-oval-definitions-filename-session-index.variables-
                     variables-index.xml'.

              --progress
                     Switch to sparse output suitable for progress  reporting.
                     Format of the output is "$rule_id:$result\n".

       resolve -o output-file xccdf-file
              Resolve  an  XCCDF file as described in the XCCDF specification.
              It will flatten inheritance hierarchy of XCCDF profiles, groups,
              rules,  and values. Result is another XCCDF document, which will
              be written to output-file.

              --force
                     Force resolving XCCDF document  even  if  it  is  already
                     marked as resolved.

       validate [options] xccdf-file
              Validate  given  XCCDF  file  against  a XML schema. Every found
              error is printed to the standard error. Return code is 0 if val‐
              idation  succeeds, 1 if validation could not be performed due to
              some error, 2 if the XCCDF document is not valid.

              --skip-schematron
                     Turn off Schematron-based validation. It is able to  find
                     more  errors  and  inconsistencies  but  is  much slower.
                     Schematron is available only for XCCDF version 1.2.

       export-oval-variables [options] xccdf-file [oval-definitions-files]
              Collect all the XCCDF values that would be used by  OVAL  during
              evaluation  of  a certain profile and export them as OVAL exter‐
              nal-variables document(s). The  filename  format  is  'original-
              oval-definitions-filename-session-index.variables-variables-
              index.xml'.

              --profile PROFILE
                     Select a particular profile from XCCDF document.

              --fetch-remote-resources
                     Allow download of remote  OVAL  content  referenced  from
                     XCCDF by check-content-ref/@href.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

              --datastream-id ID
                     Uses a data stream with that particular ID from the given
                     data stream collection.  If  not  given  the  first  data
                     stream  is  used. Only applies if you give an SCAP source
                     data stream in place of an XCCDF file.

              --xccdf-id ID
                     Takes component ref with given ID from  checklists.  This
                     allows  to  select  a  particular XCCDF component even in
                     cases where there are 2 XCCDFs in one data stream.

              --benchmark-id ID
                     Selects a component ref from any data stream that  refer‐
                     ences  a component with XCCDF Benchmark such that its @id
                     attribute matches given string exactly. Please note  that
                     this is not the recommended way of selecting a component-
                     ref. You are advised to use  --xccdf-id  AND/OR  --datas‐
                     tream-id  for more precision. --benchmark-id is only used
                     when both --xccdf-id and --datastream-id are not  present
                     on the command line!

              --cpe CPE_FILE
                     Use  given CPE dictionary or language (auto-detected) for
                     applicability checks. The variables documents are created
                     only for xccdf:Rules which are applicable.

       generate [options] <submodule> [submodule-specific-options]
              Generate  another  document  from an XCCDF file such as security
              guide or result report.

              --profile ID
                     Apply profile with given ID to the Benchmark before  fur‐

              guide [options] xccdf-file
                     Generate a HTML document containing a security guide from
                     an XCCDF Benchmark. Unless the --output option is  speci‐
                     fied  it  will be written to the standard output. Without
                     profile  being  set  only  groups  (not  rules)  will  be
                     included in the output.

                     --output FILE
                            Write  the  guide to this file instead of standard
                            output.

                     --hide-profile-info
                            This option has no effect and  is  kept  only  for
                            backward compatibility purposes.

                     --benchmark-id ID
                            Selects  a  component ref from any datastream that
                            references a component with XCCDF  Benchmark  such
                            that   its  @id  attribute  matches  given  string
                            exactly.

                     --xccdf-id ID
                            Takes component ref with given ID from checklists.
                            This allows to select a particular XCCDF component
                            even in cases where there are 2 XCCDFs in one data
                            stream. If none is given, the first component from
                            the checklists element is used.

                     --tailoring-file TAILORING_FILE
                            Use given file for XCCDF tailoring. Select profile
                            from  tailoring  file to apply using --profile. If
                            both --tailoring-file and --tailoring-id are spec‐
                            ified, --tailoring-file takes priority.

                     --tailoring-id COMPONENT_REF_ID
                            Use  tailoring  component  in  input  source  data
                            stream for XCCDF tailoring. The  tailoring  compo‐
                            nent  must  be  specified  by its Ref-ID (value of
                            component-ref/@id attribute in input  source  data
                            stream).  Select  profile from tailoring component
                            to apply using --profile. If both --tailoring-file
                            and --tailoring-id are specified, --tailoring-file
                            takes priority.

                     --skip-signature-validation
                            Do not validate digital  signatures  in  digitally
                            signed SCAP source data streams.

              --enforce-signature
                     Process  only  digitally signed SCAP source data streams.
                     Data streams without a signature  would  be  rejected  if
                     this switch is used.

              report [options] xccdf-file
                     Generate  a  HTML document containing results of an XCCDF
                     Benchmark execution. Unless the --output option is speci‐
                     fied it will be written to the standard output.

                     --output FILE
                            Write  the report to this file instead of standard
                            output.

                     --result-id ID
                            ID of the XCCDF TestResult from which  the  report
                            will be generated.

                     --oval-template template-string
                            To  use the ability to include additional informa‐
                            tion from OVAL in xccdf result  file,  a  template
                            which  will  be  used  to  obtain OVAL result file
                            names has to be specified.  The  template  can  be
                            either  a filename or a string containing wildcard
                            character (percent sign  '%').  Wildcard  will  be
                            replaced by the original OVAL definition file name
                            as referenced from the XCCDF file. This way it  is
                            possible  to  obtain  OVAL  information  even from
                            XCCDF documents referencing several OVAL files. To
                            use this option with results from an XCCDF evalua‐
                            tion, specify %.result.xml as  a  OVAL  file  name
                            template.

                     --sce-template template-string
                            To  use the ability to include additional informa‐
                            tion from SCE in XCCDF  result  file,  a  template
                            which will be used to obtain SCE result file names
                            has to be specified. The template can be either  a
                            filename or a string containing wildcard character
                            (percent sign '%'). Wildcard will be  replaced  by
                            the  original  SCE  script file name as referenced
                            from the XCCDF file. This way it  is  possible  to
                            obtain  SCE  information even from XCCDF documents
                            referencing several SCE files. To use this  option
                            with  results  from  an  XCCDF evaluation, specify
                            %.result.xml as a SCE file name template.

              fix [options] xccdf-file
                     Generate a script that shall bring the system to a  state
                     of  compliance  with  given  XCCDF Benchmark. There are 2
                     possibilities  when  generating  fixes:   Result-oriented
                     fixes  (--result-id)  or  Profile-oriented  fixes (--pro‐
                     file). Result-oriented takes  precedences  over  Profile-
                     oriented,  if  result-id  is given, oscap will ignore any
                     profile provided.

                     Result-oriented fixes are generated using result-id  pro‐
                     vided  to  select  only the failing rules from results in
                     xccdf-file, it skips all other rules.

                     Profile-oriented fixes  are  generated  using  all  rules
                     within  the provided profile. If no result-id/profile are
                     provided, (default) profile  will  be  used  to  generate
                     fixes.

                     --fix-type TYPE
                            Specify  fix  type. There are multiple programming
                            languages in which the fix script  can  be  gener‐
                            ated.  TYPE  should be one of: bash, ansible, pup‐
                            pet, anaconda,  ignition,  kubernetes,  blueprint.
                            Default is bash. This option is mutually exclusive
                            with --template, because fix type  already  deter‐
                            mines the template URN.

                     --output FILE
                            Write  the report to this file instead of standard
                            output.

                     --result-id ID
                            Fixes will be generated for failed rule-results of
                            the specified TestResult.

                     --template ID|FILE
                            Template  to be used to generate the script. If it
                            contains a dot '.' it is interpreted as a location
                            of  a file with the template definition. Otherwise
                            it identifies a template from standard  set  which
                            currently includes: bash (default if no --template
                            switch present). Brief explanation of the  process
                            of  writing  your own templates is in the XSL file
                            xsl/legacy-fix.xsl in the openscap data directory.
                            You  can  also take a look at the default template
                            xsl/legacy-fixtpl-bash.xml.

                     --xccdf-id ID
                            Takes component ref with given ID from checklists.
                            This allows to select a particular XCCDF component
                            even in cases where there are 2 XCCDFs in one data
                            stream. If none is given, the first component from
                            the checklists element is used.

                     --benchmark-id ID
                            Selects a component ref from any data stream  that
                            references  a  component with XCCDF Benchmark such
                            that  its  @id  attribute  matches  given   string
                            exactly.

                     --tailoring-file TAILORING_FILE
                            Use given file for XCCDF tailoring. Select profile
                            from tailoring file to apply using  --profile.  If
                            both --tailoring-file and --tailoring-id are spec‐
                            ified, --tailoring-file takes priority.

                     --tailoring-id COMPONENT_REF_ID
                            Use  tailoring  component  in  input  source  data
                            stream  for  XCCDF tailoring. The tailoring compo‐
                            nent must be specified by  its  Ref-ID  (value  of
                            component-ref/@id  attribute  in input source data
                            stream). Select profile from  tailoring  component
                            to apply using --profile. If both --tailoring-file
                            and --tailoring-id are specified, --tailoring-file
                            takes priority.

                     --skip-signature-validation
                            Do  not  validate  digital signatures in digitally
                            signed SCAP source data streams.

              --enforce-signature
                     Process only digitally signed SCAP source  data  streams.
                     Data  streams  without  a  signature would be rejected if
                     this switch is used.

              custom --stylesheet xslt-file [options] xccdf-file
                     Generate a custom output (depending on given  XSLT  file)
                     from an XCCDF file.

                     --stylesheet FILE
                            Specify an absolute path to a custom stylesheet to
                            format the output.

                     --output FILE
                             Write the document into file.

OVAL OPERATIONS
       eval [options] INPUT_FILE
              Probe the system and evaluate all definitions from OVAL  Defini‐
              tion  file.  Print result of each definition to standard output.
              The return code is 0 after a  successful evaluation.  On  error,
              value 1 is returned.

              INPUT_FILE  can  be  either  OVAL Definition File or SCAP source
              data stream, it depends on used options.

              Unless --skip-validation (--skip-valid) is used, the  INPUT_FILE
              is  validated  using  XSD schemas (depending on document type of
              INPUT_FILE) and rejected if invalid.

              --id DEFINITION-ID
                     Evaluate ONLY specified OVAL Definition from OVAL Defini‐
                     tion File.

              --variables FILE
                     Provide  external  variables  expected by OVAL Definition
                     File.

              --directives FILE
                     Use OVAL Directives content to  specify  desired  results
                     content.

              --without-syschar
                     Don't provide system characteristics in result file.

              --results FILE
                     Write OVAL Results into file.

              --report FILE
                     Create human readable (HTML) report from OVAL Results.

              --datastream-id ID
                     Uses a data stream with that particular ID from the given
                     data stream collection.  If  not  given  the  first  data
                     stream  is  used.  Only  applies  if you give source data
                     stream in place of an OVAL file.

              --oval-id ID
                     Takes component ref  with  given  ID  from  checks.  This
                     allows  to  select  a  particular  OVAL component even in
                     cases where there are 2 OVALs in one data stream.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

              --fetch-remote-resources
                     Allow download of remote components referenced from  data
                     stream.

       collect [options] definitions-file
              Probe  the  system  and  gather  system  characteristics for all
              objects in OVAL Definition file.

              --id OBJECT-ID
                     Collect system characteristics ONLY  for  specified  OVAL
                     Object.

              --variables FILE
                     Provide external variables expected by OVAL Definitions.

              --syschar FILE
                     Write OVAL System Characteristic into file.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

       analyse [options] --results FILE definitions-file syschar-file
              In this mode, the oscap tool does not perform data collection on
              the local system, but relies upon the input file, which may have
              been  generated  on another system. The output (OVAL Results) is
              printed to file specified by --results parameter.

              --variables FILE
                     Provide external variables expected by OVAL Definitions.

              --directives FILE
                     Use OVAL Directives content to  specify  desired  results
                     content.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

       validate [options] oval-file
              Validate given OVAL file against a XML schema. Every found error
              is printed to the standard error. Return code is 0 if validation
              succeeds,  1  if  validation  could not be performed due to some
              error, 2 if the OVAL document is not valid.

              --definitions, --variables, --syschar, --results --directives
                     Type of the OVAL document is  automatically  detected  by
                     default.  If  you want enforce certain document type, you
                     can use one of these options.

              --skip-schematron
                     Turn off Schematron-based validation. It is able to  find
                     more errors and inconsistencies but is much slower.

       generate <submodule> [submodule-specific-options]
              Generate another document from an OVAL file.

              Available submodules:

              report [options] oval-results-file
                     Generate  a  formatted HTML page containing visualisation
                     of an OVAL results file. Unless the  --output  option  is
                     specified it will be written to the standard output.

                     --output FILE
                            Write  the report to this file instead of standard
                            output.

CPE OPERATIONS
       check name
              Check whether name is in correct CPE format.

       match name dictionary.xml
              Find an exact match of CPE name in the dictionary.

       validate cpe-dict-file
              Validate given CPE dictionary file against a XML  schema.  Every
              found  error  is printed to the standard error. Return code is 0
              if validation succeeds, 1 if validation could not  be  performed
              due to some error, 2 if the XCCDF document is not valid.

CVSS OPERATIONS
       score cvss_vector
              Calculate  score  from a CVSS vector. Prints base score for base
              CVSS vector, base and temporal score for temporal  CVSS  vector,
              base and temporal and environmental score for environmental CVSS
              vector.

       describe cvss_vector
              Describe individual components of a CVSS vector in a human-read‐
              able format and print partial scores.

       CVSS vector consists of several slash-separated components specified as
       key-value pairs. Each key can be specified at  most  once.  Valid  CVSS
       vector  has  to contain at least base CVSS metrics, i.e. AV, AC, AU, C,
       I, and A. Following table summarizes the components and possible values
       (second  column  is  metric category: B for base, T for temporal, E for
       environmental):

DS OPERATIONS
       sds-compose [options] SOURCE_XCCDF TARGET_SDS
              Creates  an SCAP source data stream from the XCCDF file given in
              SOURCE_XCCDF and stores the result in  TARGET_SDS.  Dependencies
              like  OVAL  files  are automatically detected and bundled in the
              created source data stream.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

       sds-add [options] NEW_COMPONENT EXISTING_SDS
              Adds given NEW_COMPONENT file to the existing source data stream
              (EXISTING_SDS).  Component file might be OVAL, XCCDF or CPE Dic‐
              tionary file. Dependencies like  OVAL  files  are  automatically
              detected and bundled in target source data stream.

              --datastream-id DATASTREAM_ID
                     Uses a data stream with that particular ID from the given
                     data stream collection.  If  not  given  the  first  data
                     stream is used.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

       sds-split [options] SOURCE_DS TARGET_DIR
              Splits  given  source data stream into multiple files and stores
              all the files in TARGET_DIR.

              --datastream-id DATASTREAM_ID
                     Uses a data stream with that particular ID from the given
                     data  stream  collection.  If  not  given  the first data
                     stream is used.

              --xccdf-id XCCDF_ID
                     Takes component ref with given ID from  checklists.  This
                     allows  to  select  a  particular XCCDF component even in
                     cases where there are 2 XCCDFs in one data stream.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

              --fetch-remote-resources
                     Allow download of remote components referenced from  data
                     stream.

       sds-validate SOURCE_DS
              Validate  given  source  data  stream file against a XML schema.
              Every found error is printed to the standard error. Return  code
              is  0  if validation succeeds, 1 if validation could not be per‐
              formed due to some error, 2 if the source  data  stream  is  not
              valid.

       rds-create   [options]   SDS   TARGET_ARF  XCCDF_RESULTS  [OVAL_RESULTS
       [OVAL_RESULTS ..]]
              Takes given source data stream, XCCDF and OVAL results and  cre‐
              ates  a result data stream (in Asset Reporting Format) and saves
              it to file given in TARGET_ARF.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

       rds-split [options] [--report-id REPORT_ID] RDS TARGET_DIR
              Takes given result data stream (also called ARF = asset  report‐
              ing  format)  and splits given report and its respective report-
              request to given target directory. If no report-id is given,  we
              assume  user wants the first applicable report in top-down order
              in the file.

              --skip-valid, --skip-validation
                     Do not validate input/output files.

       rds-validate SOURCE_RDS
              Validate given result data stream file  against  a  XML  schema.
              Every  found error is printed to the standard error. Return code
              is 0 if validation succeeds, 1 if validation could not  be  per‐
              formed  due  to  some  error, 2 if the result data stream is not
              valid.

CVE OPERATIONS
       validate cve-nvd-feed.xml
              Validate given CVE data feed.

       find CVE cve-nvd-feed.xml
              Find given CVE in data feed and report base score, vector string
              and vulnerable software list.

EXIT STATUS
       Normally, the exit status is 0 when operation finished successfully and
       1 otherwise. In cases when oscap performs evaluation of the  system  it
       may  return  2  indicating success of the operation but incompliance of
       the assessed system.

EXAMPLES
       Evaluate XCCDF content using CPE dictionary and produce HTML report. In
       this  case  we  use  United  States  Government  Configuration Baseline
       (USGCB) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Desktop.

               oscap xccdf eval --fetch-remote-resources --oval-results \
                       --profile united_states_government_configuration_baseline \
                       --report usgcb-rhel5desktop.report.html \
                       --results usgcb-rhel5desktop-xccdf.xml.result.xml \
                       --cpe usgcb-rhel5desktop-cpe-dictionary.xml \
