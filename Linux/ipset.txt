NAME
       ipset-translate — translation tool to migrate from ipset to nftables

DESCRIPTION
       This tool allows system administrators to translate a given IP sets file to nftables(8).

       The only available command is:

       • ipset-translate restore < file.ipt

USAGE
       The ipset-translate tool reads an IP sets file in the syntax produced by ipset(8) save. No set modifications occur, this tool is a text converter.

EXAMPLES
       Basic operation examples.

       Single command translation, assuming the original file:

       create test1 hash:ip,port family inet counters timeout 300 hashsize 1024 maxelem 65536 bucketsize 12 initval 0xb5c4be5d
       add test1 1.1.1.1,udp:20
       add test1 1.1.1.1,21
       create test2 hash:ip,port family inet hashsize 1024 maxelem 65536 bucketsize 12 initval 0xb5c4be5d

       which results in the following translation:

       root@machine:~# ipset-translate restore < file.ipt
       add set inet global test1 { type ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service; counter; timeout 300s; size 65536; }
       add element inet global test1 { 1.1.1.1 . udp . 20 }
       add element inet global test1 { 1.1.1.1 . tcp . 21 }
       add set inet global test2 { type ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service; size 65536; }

LIMITATIONS
       A few IP sets options may be not supported because they are not yet implemented in nftables(8).

       Contrary  to nftables(8), IP sets are not attached to a specific table.  The translation utility assumes that sets are created in a table whose name is global and family is inet. You might want to
       update the resulting translation to use a different table name and family for your sets.
