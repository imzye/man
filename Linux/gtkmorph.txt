NAME
       gtkmorph - image warping and dissolving (morphing) for GTK toolkit

SYNOPSIS
       gtkmorph

DESCRIPTION
       gtkmorph is a digital image warping and dissolving program, also known as a "morphing" program.  The primary use of gtkmorph is to generate and modify meshes
       which control the shape of an image.  gtkmorph also has the capacity to dissolve images together, and to generate a sequence of warped and dissolved  images.
       When  this  sequence  is  made into a movie, it is called a "morph".  gtkmorph will  write images in .ppm format and load them in any format supported by the
       gdk-pixbuf library; this includes JPEG, PNG,  and TIFF.

       gtkmorph uses a library called libmorph which can be used separately in the creation of other morphing programs.
