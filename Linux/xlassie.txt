NAME
       xlassie - mailbox counter for X

SYNOPSIS
       xlassie [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The xlassie program is a replacement for the standard X mail notification tool, XBiff. It has several useful enhancements over XBiff.

         * Counts the number of new messages you have
         * Can query remote mail on a POP3 server or on an IMAP server
         * Can count local mail with an mbox or a maildir style spool
         * Uses less memory than XBiff (or any other X mail checker)
         * Can run a command when clicked on, and/or when new mail arrives
         * Can toggle an LED indicating availability of mail
         * Supports both the KDE and the WindowMaker applet protocols
         * Runs as a standard X application

       When the count is 0 (no mail) it is displayed in a less obtrusive color.  When mail arrives a beep is emitted, and the updated unread message count is displayed.

       When xlassie is running, the following interactive commands are available:

           q             Quit gracefully.
           mouse click   Spawn 'clickcommand' (if any), otherwise update mail
           count.

X RESOURCES
       When  reading  X resources, two class names xlassie and xbiff are recognized (in that order) unless the -name is used.  The class name xbiff allows resources common to both xbiff and xlassie to be
       easily configured, while the class name xlassie allows resources unique to this program.  If no resources are specified, suitable defaults will be used.  Command-line  arguments  can  be  used  to
       override resource settings.  The following resources are allowed (e.g, "xlassie.RESOURCE"):

       name: name
              Use the specified name as a class name for this application (default: xlassie).

       background: color
              Use the specified color as this application's background color.  The 'bg' resource is also recognized (default: White).

       foreground: color
              Use the specified color as this application's foreground color.  The 'fg' resource is also recognized (default: Black).

       hightlight: color
              Use the specified color as this application's foreground color when there is non-zero mail. The 'hilight' resource is also recognized (default: Red).

       update: number
              Use the specified number to note how many seconds should be used to check mail every (default: 5 seconds local, 60 seconds remote).

       bell: boolean
              Use the specified boolean value to affect the ringing of the system bell when mail is received (default: False).

       led: number
              Use the specified number to light the LED specified if mail exists (default: 1).

       font: fontname
              Use the specified fontname as the application's font. The 'fn' resource is also recognized.

       geometry: geometry
              Use the specified X window geometry.

       shape: boolean
              Use the specified boolean value to affect shaped window creation (default: False).

       spool: filename
              Use the specified filename as the mail spool or maildir directory.

       mailcommand: command
              Use  the  specified command to execute on new mail arrival. The 'mailcmd' resource is also recognized. If you have a %d in the command, it will get replaced with the number of new messages.
              Remember to put quotes around the command if it's longer than one word.  If you want the command to run the background, put a '&' at the end.

       clickcommand: command
              Use the specified command to execute when application is clicked on.  The 'clickcmd' resource is also recognized (default: CHECK_MAILBOX).

       pop3: server
              Use the specified pop3 server rather than local mail spool.

       apop3: server
              Use the specified pop3 server rather than local mail spool but while using a different access method.  This option is useful when -pop3 doesn't find the correct number.

       imap: server
              Use the specified imap server rather than local mail spool.

       username: name
              Use the specified login name for pop3/imap server access when different from local username.

       password: password
              Use the specified login password for pop3/imap server access.

       offline: boolean
              Use the specified boolean value to affect whether access is continued in the case a remote server is unreachable (default: False).

       wmaker: boolean

       nokde: boolean
              Use the specified boolean value to affect the inability to get swallowed into a KDE dock (default: False).

       nowmaker: boolean
              Use the specified boolean value to affect the inability to get swallowed into a WindowMaker dock (default: False).
