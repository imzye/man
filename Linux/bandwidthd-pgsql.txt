NAME
       bandwidthd.conf - configuration file for bandwidthd

DESCRIPTION
       The file, /etc/bandwidthd/bandwidthd.conf, is read by bandwidthd when started. It contains a small set of tunable options for bandwidthd features that can be adjusted.

OPTIONS
       subnet <network> <netmask>
              Subnet to log traffic for.

       dev <device>
              Device to listen on.

       skip_intervals <n>
              Number on intervals (2.5 minute) to skip between graphing.  Default 0.

       graph_cutoff <kilobytes-minimum>
              Number of kilobytes required before drawing a graph for a host.  Default 1024.

       promiscuous <bool>
              Put device in promisc ("eavesdropping") mode.  Default true.

       output_cdf <bool>
              Write logfiles for analyzed traffic.  Default false.

       recover_cdf <bool>
              Recover from logfiles after restart.  Default false.
              Warning: This can take very long time if the logfiles are big.
              Enabling this and having bandwidthd start on system start might be a bad idea.  It will delay your possibilities to log in locally since it's not done in the background.

       filter <pcap-filter-rule>
              Pcap filter rule to use. Always include "ip" to avoid weird problems.  Default "ip".

       graph <bool>
              Write graphs and html for analyzed traffic.  Default true.

       meta_refresh <seconds>
              Number of seconds before html-page reloads. 0 to disable.  Default 150.
