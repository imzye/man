NAME
       dl10n-spider -- crawl translator mailing lists (and BTS) for status updates

SYNOPSIS
       dl10n-spider [options] lang+

DESCRIPTION
       This script parses the debian-l10n-<language> mailing list archives. It looks for emails which title follow a specific format indicating what the author intend to translate, or the current
       status of his work on this translation.

       Those informations are saved to a dl10n database which can then be used to build a l10n coordination page or any other useless statistics.

   get_header(HTML)
       get_header extract the email header from the html page. This header starts at <!--X-Head-of-Message--> and stops at <!--X-Head-of-Message-End-->. As it contains html tags, they are also
       removed.

       It gets a reference to an array of line (HTML) containing the html code of the page.

       It returns a reference to an array containing the email header lines.

   get_message(LANGUAGE, YEAR, MONTH, MESSAGE)
       get_message requests message to the archives of a l10n mailling.

       It gets the language string (LANGUAGE), year (YEAR), month (MONTH) and message number (MESSAGE) integers.

       It return a reference to an array containing the html lines or 'undef' if an error occured.

   get_indexpage
       retrieves all messages numbers and subjects from a page of messages sorted by date. It return a hash table with message number as keys and subject as values (this is really quicker than
       retrieving each message).
