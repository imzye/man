IRRECORD(1)                      User Commands                     IRRECORD(1)

NAME
       irrecord - IR-codes recording tool for usage with LIRC

SYNOPSIS
       irrecord [-f] [-n] [-H driver] [-d device] [file]

       irrecord -a <file>

       irrecord -l

       irrecord --help | --version

DESCRIPTION
       This  program will record the signals from your remote control and cre‐
       ate a config file for lircd.  Although a good deal of effort is put  in
       this  program  it  is often not possible to automatically recognize all
       features of a remote control. See USAGE NOTES below.

       If file is not specified it defaults to "irrecord.lircd.conf"

       If file already exists and contains a valid config  irrecord  will  use
       the  protocol  description  found there and will only try to record the
       buttons.

OPTIONS
       -a --analyse
              Analyse a raw_codes config file, trying to convert it to a regu‐
              lar configuration.

       -u --update
              Add new buttons to an existing config file. No protocol informa‐
              tion is updated.

       -f --force
              Force raw mode. Use this if recording fails otherwise. This cre‐
              ates  a  raw codes configuration file which can be used as-is or
              converted using the -a option.

       -n --disable-namespace
              Disable namespace checks.

       -l --list-namespace
              List valid button names.

       -H --driver=driver
              Use given driver. -H help lists available drivers.

       -d --device=device
              Read from given device.  Use  mode2(1)  --list-devices  to  list
              available devices for a driver.

       -U --plugindir=directory
              Load drivers from directory. See DRIVER LOADING.

       -k --keep-root
              Don't  drop root privileges after opening device. See RUNNING AS
              ROOT.

       -A, --driver-options key:value[|key:value...]
              Set one or more options for the driver. The argument is  a  list
              of  key:value  pairs  delimited  by '|'. The key can not contain
              spaces, but such are allowed in the value part. Certain  charac‐
              ters  including  '#'  and ';' are used as comment markers in the
              config file and are not allowed anywhere.

       -D --loglevel=level
              Determine the amount of logging information. [level]  can  be  a
              symbolic  syslog  level:  'error','warning,  'info', 'notice' or
              'debug'. lirc also  defines  three  additional  levels  'trace',
              'trace1'  and  'trace2' which gives even more messages ('trace2'
              bringing the most). However,  in  the  log  these  messages  are
              marked  as  'debug'.   The  level  can also be an integer in the
              range 3 (almost no messages) to 10.

       -O, --options-file <path>
              File containing default values for all options. A relative  path
              is interpreted from current directory. See [FILES] below.

       -h --help
              Display this message.

       -v --version
              Display version.

USAGE NOTES
       The  primary options are --driver and usually also --device (some driv‐
       ers does not need --device). These could be verified using mode2(1)  if
       irrecord runs into trouble.

       When  driver  and  device  is  known  it  saves  some  work  to  update
       lirc_options.conf with the new values. irrecord uses the  [lircd]  sec‐
       tion  as  a fallback, so with a proper lirc_options.conf irrecord could
       be run without command line options.

       Using an existing file as a template  can  sometimes  be  required  for
       irrecord  to  work.  If  using one of the generic templates it can also
       provide better timing. See PROTOCOL PARAMETERS AND TEMPLATES.

       If the program fails to recognize the protocol of  the  remote  control
       you  could  use  the --force option to at least create a config file in
       raw mode.

REPEAT MASKS
       After recording some buttons with irrecord, you should check the repeat
       masks.  These  are  needed  in order to handle repeated button presses,
       which are very common

       Using the config file, start lircd and irw. Keeping  a  button  pressed
       down, you should see something like:<

               0000000000f40bf0 00 KEY_1 ANIMAX
               0000000000f40bf0 01 KEY_1 ANIMAX
               0000000000f40bf0 02 KEY_1 ANIMAX
               0000000000f40bf0 03 KEY_1 ANIMAX
               0000000000f40bf0 04 KEY_1 ANIMAX
               0000000000f40bf0 05 KEY_1 ANIMAX

       Note  how the second field gets incremented. This must work for correct
       operation.

PROTOCOL PARAMETERS AND TEMPLATES.
       irrecord actually works in two phases. In the first, it tries to  iden‐
       tify  the protocol used by the remote. Although this often  works quite
       well, there are advantages using an existing file as a template.

       One reason to use a template is when irrecord fails  to  recognize  the
       protocol  in the beginning. In such cases, try to find an existing con‐
       figuration from the same vendor using something like:

               $ irdb-get find motorola
                 # lots of remotes listed...
               $ irdb-get download motorola/VIP_1200.lircd.conf  # Pick any
               $ cp VIP_1200.lircd.conf my_remote.lircd.conf
               $ irrecord my_remote.lircd.conf

       Invoking irrecord this way re-uses the existing protocol which  usually
       works (vendors seldom changes protocol parameters).

       Another  reason  to  use  an existing file is to get more exact timing,
       important when planning to also transmit (blast). In such cases,  using
       a  generic  template  found  using irdb-get find generic has advantages
       since the timing values here are hand-crafted from  specifications.  To
       use these, you need to know which protocol your remote uses, though.

       If decoding of IR commands does not work reliably you can try to modify
       the eps and aeps values in the lircd config file to adjust  the  toler‐
       ance  of signal lengths. aeps is an absolute value while eps is a rela‐
       tive value expressed in percent. See lircd.conf(5)

TROUBLESHOOTING
   Multiple-personalities remotes
       Some remotes actually emulates two or more remotes. irrecord runs  into
       trouble  if   buttons  from  different logical remotes are mixed in the
       same run, in particular in the  initial  protocol  identification.  For
       such  devices,  irrecord  must be invoked once for every logical device
       using only buttons from this device during the run.

   Un-printable garbage when using default driver
       If there is various non-printable garbage on the  screen  when  running
       irrecord when using the default driver the rc protocol needs to be set.
       With a single device the protocol can be set and inspected using

               sudo sh -c "echo 'lirc' > /sys/class/rc/rc0/protocol"
               cat /sys/class/rc/rc0/protocol

   Physical disturbances
       As for physical disturbances, the primary source is fluorescent  light.
       You  should  not  have any such light around when using irrecord.  It's
       also important to have a suitable distance between the remote  and  the
       capture  device,  which often is smaller than in typical, normal usage.
       However, making the distance too small might cause other problems.   At
       a first try use a foot or two.

DRIVER LOAD PATH
       Drivers  are  loaded  dynamically.  This is done from a traditional *ux
       ´:´-separated path where each component in the path is searched  (lead‐
       ing part first, trailing last).

       The path used for this is determined by (falling priority):

       - The --plugindir option.

       - The    'plugindir'   entry   in    the   [lircd]   section   of   the
         lirc_options.conf file.

       - The environment variable LIRC_PLUGINDIR.

       - A hardcoded default (/usr/lib64/lirc/plugins).

RUNNING AS ROOT
       In many cases irrecord needs to run  as  root  to  access  devices  not
       available  to regular users. On the other hand, running as root creates
       problems such as log files owned by root, security concerns etc.

       In order to cope with this, irrecord by default drops  root  privileges
       after opening the input device. This support is based on that root per‐
       missions are accquired using sudo(1) e. g., using

               $ sudo irrecord --device /dev/lirc0 --driver default

       If not using sudo, the same behaviour could be accomplished  using  the
       SUDO_USER environment variable e. g.,

               # SUDO_USER=$LOGNAME irrecord --device /dev/lirc0 --driver default

       The  --keep-root  option will make irrecord to keep root privileges for
       the complete run.

FILES
       /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf
           The options file holding default values for command line options in
           the [irrecord] section. For some values including debug, plugindir,
           driver and device irrecord falls back to the [lircd] section if not
           found in [irrecord].

       -   The  location  of  this file can be changed using the -O/--options-
           file  command-line  option  or  using  the   environment   variable
           LIRC_OPTIONS_PATH.

       ~/.cache/irrecord.log
           Debug output. Setting the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable relo‐
           cates this file to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/irrecord.log
