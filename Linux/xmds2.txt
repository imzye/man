NAME
       xmds2 - the eXtensible Multi-Dimensional Simulator v2

SYNOPSIS
       xmds2 [options] fileToBeParsed

DESCRIPTION
       The  program xmds2 is a code generator that integrates equations.  You write them down in human readable form in an XML file, and it goes away and writes and compiles a C++ program that integrates
       those equations as fast as it can possibly be done in your architecture.

       For information as to how to write a script for xmds, and how to solve problems in physics, mathematics and even finance and economics, read the associated documentation available  from  the  xmds
       web site: http://www.xmds.org.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help message

       -o file, --output-file=file
              This overrides the name of the output file to be generated

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode

       -g, --debug
              Debug mode. Compiler error messages report errors in the .cc file, not the .xmds file. Implies --verbose. Mostly useful when debugging xmds code generation.

       -n, --no-compile
              Only generate a source file, don't compile

       --configure
              Run configuration checks for compiling simulations

       --reconfigure
              Run configuration using the same options as used with the last time --configure was run with the additional arguments specified

       --include-path /path/to/include
              Add the path /path/to/include to the list of paths searched for include headers This option is only meaningful when used with --(re)configure

       --lib-path /path/to/lib
              Add the path /path/to/lib to the list of paths searched for libraries This option is only meaningful when used with --(re)configure

FILES
