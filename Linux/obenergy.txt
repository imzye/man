NAME
     obenergy — calculate the energy for a molecule

SYNOPSIS
     obenergy [OPTIONS] filename

DESCRIPTION
     The obenergy tool can be used to calculate the energy for molecules inside (multi-)molecule files (e.g., MOL2, etc.)

OPTIONS
     If no filename is given, obenergy will give all options including the available forcefields.

     -v    Verbose: print out all individual energy interactions

     -ff forcefield
           Select the forcefield

EXAMPLES
     View the possible options, including available forcefields:
           obenergy

     Calculate the energy for the molecule(s) in file test.mol2:
           obenergy test.mol2

     Calculate the energy for the molecule(s) in file test.mol2 using the Ghemical forcefield:
           obenergy -ff Ghemical test.mol2

     Calculate the energy for the molecule(s) in file test.mol2 and print out all individual energy interactions:
           obenergy -v test.mol2
