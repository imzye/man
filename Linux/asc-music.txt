DESCRIPTION
       ascd is CD player written to play audio CD's integrated in afterstep's Wharf module or WindowMaker's dock.  ascd handles mounted volumes, and opens and closes the tray.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       -help, -h
            print a list of commandline options and exit.

       -version

            print the version number and exit.

       -themes

            print the list of installed themes and exit.

       -geometry <geom>
            specifies the geometry of ascd. The Geometry
            works like the standard X-Window geometry option.

       +/-withdrawn, +/-w
           Turn on and off withdrawn mode. Use this option if
           you use ascd with WindowMaker.

       -device <device>
            specifies the CDROM device which should be used by
            ascd. If "-DNO_DEFAULT_DEVICE" was set at
            compilation time this option will have no effect.

       -mixer <device>
            specifies the mixer device. Works only if mixer
            support was enabled at compilation.

       -cue <seconds>
            specifies the time -in seconds- for intro scan
            and cue modes.

       -ti <seconds>
            specifies the timeout for the help texts. The
            default is 1 second.

       +/-autoplay, +/-a
            Turn on or off autoplay mode. When this is
            turned on, ascd always wait for a CD, and play it
            automatically when inserted.

       +/-autoprobe, +/-p
            Turn on or off autoprobe mode. This mode
            checks for inserted CD. Default is on.

       +/-autorepeat, +/-t
            autorepeat mode: when ascd reaches the end of the
            last track, the CD is not stopped and first track
            is played.

       +/-B
            This option is no longer supported.

       -maxvolume <value>
            Set the CD driver max volume.

       -minvolume <value>
            Set the CD driver min volume.

       -volume <value>
            Set the CD driver volume, between 0 and maxvolume.
            Note that the -volume option in independant from
            the mixer. It controls the drive, not the sound
            card.

       -mvolume <value>
            Set the CD driver volume for the mute mode.

       -fadestep <value>
            Set the fade in/out speed. Default is 5. Greater
            values accelerate the fade.

       -theme <theme dir>
            Specify the visual theme to use.

       +/-ia
            When this option is enabled, AScd ignore the skip
            orders found in WorkMan database and read all the
            tracks of the CD.

       +/-up
            When enabled, all the message (and the track title
            display) are forced in uppercase.

       -showtitle
            Show the track title if found in WorkMan database.
            If the message panel is not large enough, AScd
            scrolls the title.

       -showartist
            Add the artist name to the track title (-showtitle
            option needed)

       -debug
            AScd verbose mode

       -save
            Save all the settings and exit. Usefull to 'make' a
            new configuration file: set all the stuff you want
            to set and put -save as last commandline option.
            Example:

            ascd +w +a -device /dev/cd0c -save

            Then, you just call ascd without arguments, it will
            use the settings you just saved.

FILES
       ascd stores its settings in ~/.ascdrc.

       The theme files are usually stored in /usr/local/share/AScd.

INVOCATION
       ascd can be called from one of many ways.  The most common invocation is the command line:

            % ascd -device /dev/wcd0a +w +a &

       With Afterstep, another way to call ascd is from the window manager:

            *Wharf - - Swallow "ascd" ascd&

       This line, when placed in the .steprc file in the users home directory will cause ascd to use the shape extensions so that it will be a button on the Wharf (1) button bar under the  afterstep
       (1) window manager.
