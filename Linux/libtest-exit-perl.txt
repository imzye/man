NAME
       Test::Exit - Test that some code calls exit() without terminating testing

VERSION
       version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::More tests => 4;
           use Test::Exit;

           is exit_code { exit 75; }, 75, "procmail not found";
           exits_ok { exit 1; } "exiting exits";
           never_exits_ok { print "Hi!"; } "not exiting doesn't exit"l
           exits_zero { exit 0; } "exited with success";
           exits_nonzero { exit 42; } "exited with failure";

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Exit provides some simple tools for testing code that might call "exit()", providing you with the status code without exiting the test file.

       The only criterion tested is that the supplied code does or does not call "exit()". If the code throws an exception, the exception will be propagated and you will have to catch it yourself.
       "die()"ing is not exiting for the purpose of these tests.

       Unlike previous versions of this module, the current version doesn't use exceptions to do its work, so even if you call "exit()" inside of an "eval", everything should work.

FUNCTIONS
   exit_code
       Runs the given code. If the code calls "exit()", then "exit_code" will return a number, which is the status that "exit()" would have exited with.  If the code never calls "exit()", returns
       "undef". This is the Test::Fatal-like interface. All of the other functions are wrappers for this one, retained for legacy purposes.

   exits_ok
       Tests that the supplied code calls "exit()" at some point.

   exits_nonzero
       Tests that the supplied code calls "exit()" with a nonzero value.

   exits_zero
       Tests that the supplied code calls "exit()" with a zero (successful) value.

   never_exits_ok
       Tests that the supplied code completes without calling "exit()".
