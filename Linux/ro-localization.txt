NAME
       ro-localization - Monte-Carlo localization for beacon range-only measurements

SYNOPSIS
       ro-localization config_file.ini

DESCRIPTION
       ro-localization is a command-line application which processes a rawlog and tracks a mobile robot pose from the sequence of odometry and observations. It can also perform global localization.

       This program is a specialization of pf-localization, with an extended model to cope with unknown, dynamic biases in the beacon ranges. It also shows a real-time visualization in 3D of the particles,
       the beacons, and the measurements.
