NAME
       aevol - an in silico experimental evolution platform

SYNOPSIS
       aevol_misc_compute_pop_stats -h | --help
       aevol_misc_compute_pop_stats -V | --version
       aevol_misc_compute_pop_stats [-i INDEX | -r RANK] [-b GENER1] -e GENER2

DESCRIPTION
       Aevol  is  a simulation platform that allows one to let populations of digital organisms evolve in different conditions and study experimentally the mechanisms responsible for the structuration of
       the genome and the transcriptome.

       aevol_misc_compute_pop_stats
              issues population and replication statistics for each available backup from GENER1 to GENER2. These statistics are written in files global_pop_stats.out and stats/pop_stats/*.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              print help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -i, --index INDEX
              specify the index (ID in current generation) of the individual whose replication statistics should be outputted

       -r, --rank RANK
              specify the rank of the individual whose replication statistics should be outputted

       -b, --begin GENER
              specify the first generation for which the statistics should be computed

       -e, --end GENER
              specify the last generation for which the statistics should be computed
