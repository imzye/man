LOCKFS-NOTIFY(1)                                                                                 User Commands                                                                                 LOCKFS-NOTIFY(1)

NAME
       lockfs-notify - notify user about temporary or permanent changes on fs

SYNOPSIS
       lockfs-notify [-a|--always|-l|--lockfs|-n|--nolockfs] [-t TIME|--expire-time=TIME]
       lockfs-notify -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       lockfs-notify  is  a wrapper around notify-send(1).  It is used to send a notification to users at the beginning of a session, to say if temporary or permanent changes are allowed on which filesystems
       (or more precisely on which mountpoints).

OPTIONS
       If several of the -a, -l or -n options are invoked (or their long forms, respectively --always, --lockfs or --nolockfs), the last overrides the previous ones. The  invocation  of  these  options  also
       overrides the variable 'BILIBOP_LOCKFS_NOTIFY_POLICY' that can be set in bilibop.conf(5).

       -a, --always
              Always  send  a  notification:  about filesystems on which permanent changes are allowed, and about filesystems on which temporary changes are allowed.  So, if the bilibop-lockfs feature is en‐
              abled, and one or more mountpoints have been whitelisted in /etc/bilibop/bilibop.conf, then two notifications are send to the user.

       -h, --help
              Print a short help message on stdout and exit.

       -l, --lockfs
              Send a notification only about filesystems for which the 'lockfs' feature has been enabled, i.e. about mountpoints for which only temporary changes are allowed. All these changes will  be  lost
              at next shutdown of the computer.

       -n, --nolockfs
              Send a notification only about filesystems for which the 'lockfs' feature has been disabled, i.e. about mountpoints for which permanent changes are allowed. All these changes will be kept after
              the shutdown of the computer.

       -t TIME, --expire-time=TIME
              Specifies the timeout in milliseconds at which to expire the notification.  Values of TIME less than '1000' (1 second) make the timeout is disabled and the notification never expires.  If  TIME
              is not an integer, this option is silently ignored.
